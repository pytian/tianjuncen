                Tanzanian police say 62 killed when siphoned tanker explodes
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania — A damaged tanker truck exploded in eastern Tanzania as people were trying to siphon fuel out of it Saturday, killing at least 62 in one of the worst incidents of its kind in the East African country.Tanzanian state broadcaster TBC, citing police figures, said at least 70 more people were injured during the explosion in the town of Morogoro, located about 120 miles (200 kilometers) from the economic hub of Dar es Salaam.Regional commissioner Steven Kebwe told the local Azam TV that many suffered serious burns.Witnesses told The Associated Press that a crowd had gathered around the fuel tanker after it was involved in an accident early Saturday and some people were trying to siphon away fuel when the truck burst into flames.Video footage posted on social media showed people collecting fuel into jerry cans before the fire incident.In a statement expressing condolences, Tanzanian President John Magufuli said he was dismayed people attacked vehicles involved in accidents instead of offering help.Residents are routinely killed by explosions while stealing fuel from incapacitated tankers in East Africa. Those who steal the fuel usually hope to be able to sell it cheaply to motorists.In 2013, at least 29 people were killed on the outskirts of the Ugandan capital, Kampala, as scores swarmed around the scene of an accident.There is limited awareness about the danger of explosions of damaged fuel tankers, said Henry Bantu, a road safety expert who runs the Tanzania-based Safe Speed Foundation. Local leaders need to do more to educate people on the risks, he said.This story has been corrected to show the official who spoke to Azam TV is regional commissioner Steven Kebwe, not a police commissioner whose surname is Kabwe.AP

                    Chinese medics filling gaps in Africa
                </p>

                Doctors have been sent to 42 African countries for more than five decadesAs debate rages on whether it is immoral for high-income countries to recruit medical doctors from Africa, China continues to send doctors to boost public healthcare to underserved communities in Africa.Just finishing his first year at the Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, a port city in Tanzania, Qin Chengwei, 45, head of the Chinese medical team and an anesthesiologist, said: "This is a duty. It is a mission to save as many lives as possible, regardless of geographical location."There are 11 Chinese medical doctors in Tanzania presently. Seven of them are serving in the Muhimbili hospital, the largest referral medical facility in Tanzania and its affiliate Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute, a Chinese-built facility. Four others are deployed at the Mbeya referral, in southern parts of the country.For more than five decades, China has sent medical teams to 42 African countries. Tanzania has been receiving Chinese teams continuously from 1968. For the last two years, Chinese doctors are deployed in urban and far-flung remote areas.Following requests from the Tanzanian government, the doctors are highly trained specialists in cardiology, neurosurgery, pediatric surgery, intensive care unit, orthopedics and anesthesia.With only six local anesthesiologists at Muhimbili hospital, Qin treats 60 to 80 patients daily. A large number of these patients are women giving birth and patients needing cataract surgery, a procedure to remove the eye lens and replace them with artificial ones.Doctor Bashir Nyangasa, former director of surgeon services at Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute, said that the team was very important, as there are only five Tanzanian cardio-surgeons in the country, serving 55 million people. "They do a lot. They have innately boosted provision of quality healthcare, especially to underserved people," he said.They are always in the frontline. Besides handling emergency cases brought into the two hospitals, the team occasionally holds outreach programs in rural Tanzania to provide health services to poor communities. This has also boosted the country's surveillance mechanisms on contagious diseases while helping with early detection of fatal but preventable diseases."These doctors have alleviated the critical shortage of doctors by plugging gaps left by the loss of qualified doctors overseas," said Dr Nyangasa.The World Health Organization puts Tanzania among countries with an enormous shortage of skilled health workers. The doctor-to-patient ratio stands at one doctor for every 20,000 patients, while the recommended doctor-patient ratio is one to 300.Research has shown that foreign doctors experience challenges in adjusting to new working environments. Nevertheless, the Chinese team said preparation sessions, before traveling to Tanzania, have helped them to adjust quickly to the environment.They are given country-specific knowledge of the health sector to reduce the stress that accompanies practicing in a new environment.But this does not entirely prepare them for the reality on the ground. Lack of critical equipment, especially in the emergency room, inadequate essentials such as hemoglobin, facing patients with terminal diseases such as cancer at stage four and knowing that early detection may have changed the odds remarkably, weighs heavily in the hearts of the doctors. But they persevere."I think our mission is to change the attitude of the people, by emphasizing the importance of early medical screening through tests. The burden of this disease is heavy in Tanzania," said 38 year-old Hu Bin, a cardio-surgeon and the youngest in the Chinese team. He handles about 16 heart operations in a month at the Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute, which has modern equipment.He has observed that most of his patients suffering from congenital heart disease are young people. This profile is in stark contrast to statistics in developed economies. This means that families lack funds to address this medical condition early, he said.His local colleague, Dr Nyangasa, noted that besides enhancing knowledge and skill exchange, the Chinese team helps to explain the use of some of the newly installed equipment in the Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac facility. Furthermore, they also make follow-up calls to the Chinese manufacturers when the machines need maintenance.He commended the team's enthusiasm. A beneficiary of a Chinese-sponsored scholarship where he undertook his higher learning at a medical college in Hubei province, he said that the Chinese team's persistence, passion to save lives and knowledge of how important they are in deepening Sino-Tanzanian relations have built in them coping mechanisms to propel them forward every morning.Africa accounts for 24 percent of the world's health needs and 16 percent of the global population, but it receives just 1 percent of global health spending, said the World Health Organization.

                    Chains of value that are hard to replace
                </p>
            </a>

                Companies from the US generate large revenues in China, but they also benefit from the country's manufacturing capacity US President Donald Trump has said that US tariffs on Chinese goods are causing companies to move production out of China. But the reality is that changing deep supply relationships is much more challenging than simply picking up the phone and placing a purchase order with a company in Vietnam or elsewhere. Moving production out of China is complicated by the fact that most products involve a chain or network of suppliers. Those who buy from a Chinese company are also indirectly buying from the suppliers of the Chinese exporter, and from their suppliers' suppliers. These supplier linkages are called value chains and the number of suppliers along the value chain is called the value chain "length". The World Bank and the University of International Business and Economics have published a report suggesting that foreign buyers prefer to buy more from countries with longer value chains. From a foreign buyer's perspective, countries with longer value chains have deeper supplier relationships and this can allow these countries to produce a wider variety of foreign designs. China has the longest value chains in the world and leads the world in value chain length in 12 out of 16 manufacturing industries, based on calculations of value chain length from the Research Institute for Global Value Chains. The depth of the Chinese supply relationships gives China production flexibility, which cannot be easily replaced in other countries. On May 20, 2019, 173 companies, from the footwear industry, wrote an open letter to Trump urging him to remove tariffs on China, and telling him that production cannot easily move out of China. They wrote that shoe production takes "years of planning required to make sourcing decisions, and companies cannot simply move factories to adjust to these changes". The challenges of moving production chains out of China are shared by many industries besides footwear and are the highest for industries in which designs change frequently or in industries that have complicated products. In some industries, such as footwear, companies are constantly releasing new designs into the market. New designs often include new types of intermediate products. So, the deep supplier relationships in China make it easier, for manufacturers, to change the intermediate goods needed to produce a new design. There is a common misconception that China has a trade advantage simply because of lower wages. Such misconceptions fail to recognize the manufacturing strength that originally made China a leader in global manufacturing, the ability of Chinese companies to copy foreign designs. The ability to copy often receives bad press, when framed in terms of intellectual property disputes. But it is exactly this ability that makes China an attractive manufacturing location. It is also the ability to produce foreign designs, using domestic supply chains, that has allowed China to retain foreign knowledge that enters the country. Such abilities, to absorb foreign designs, is lacking in most developing countries, leaving many businesses with no clear alternatives to the Chinese market. To compound the problem, many developing countries have pursued policies that actually limit the lengths of their production chains. Ironically, these were policies that were historically promoted by the West. Classical trade theory prescribes that countries should specialize in what they are efficient at producing. In many cases, the result has been short supply chains and the creation of a glass ceiling in economic development. The TIPER oil refinery in Tanzania is a good example of this. The plant was shut down in 1991 as a part of the structural reforms of the International Monetary Fund, saying that the plant was not competitive internationally. So, the rich inland oil reserves are now pumped directly to ships, to be sent abroad for further refining. There are more than 6,000 products that are derived from petroleum and these range from plastics, synthetic rubbers, inks, perfumes and fertilizers to detergents and pillows. The Tanzanian economy lost a great amount of capacity when domestic oil refining was abandoned. In this case, the supply chain was cut short and the capacity for economic development reduced. China was once in a similar phase of economic development. But China subsidized weaker industries in the early years of development and eventually a manufacturing base was set up that is currently unrivaled in the world today in terms of value chain length. Developing countries can follow the Chinese example and develop their value chain length by pushing raw materials as far down the production line as possible. But such structural reforms take many years to develop and will not be helpful to companies who are caught in the current US-China trade war. As a result, many companies will find themselves with no immediate alternatives to Chinese products, and those who exit will enter suboptimal production conditions, thus leaving the US consumer and US companies to carry a heavy cost in the trade war.

                Mbelwa Kairuki, the Tanzanian ambassador to China, recently talked with China Daily on China's policies on trade and investment, as well as the Belt and Road Initiative.Kairuki thinks highly of China's development in the past 70 years since the founding of the new China and said many developing countries have benefited a lot from its progress, especially in agriculture, science and technology, and medicine.The ambassador was impressed by China's recent efforts to facilitate foreign investment, and how China has opened up more to international investors, particularly in the past 10 years. Many of the Tanzanian businessmen in China are based in Guangdong province, where they set up their trade companies, exporting inexpensive consumer goods, furniture and electronics to their homeland in Africa.Ever since Tanzania's participation in the BRI, bilateral exchanges have been on the rise, with more Tanzanians studying in China as well as Chinese working and traveling in Tanzania.There are also many infrastructure projects between the two countries under the BRI, such as the construction of the road linking Tanzania's former capital Dar es Salaam with the northern city of Kagera. Previously, people traveling between the two cities had to transit through a third country.Near the end of the conversation, the ambassador said the BRI is a platform that enables the participating countries to build a more sustainable, collaborative and inclusive world.

                 The air raid siren across Shenyang, Liaoning province, at 9:18 am on Wednesday was a reminder of the pain and humiliation foreign invaders heaped on the Chinese people for more than a century before the founding of New China in 1949. The siren to mark the 88th anniversary of the Mukden Incident the Japanese invaders staged on Sept 18, 1931, to launch a full-scale invasion of China recalled not only the atrocities committed by the foreign invaders on the Chinese people but also the heroic battles the Chinese people have fought throughout China's recent history.While the outstanding contributions of the Chinese people as well as foreign friends before and in the early days of New China are well recorded and appreciated, there was also a need to recognize individuals' contributions to the development of the nation in recent decades.President Xi Jinping fulfilled that need on Tuesday by signing a decree to award 36 Chinese citizens and six foreign nationals, including some posthumously, national medals and honorary titles for their excellent contributions to the country's development and world peace.That the presidential decree came after the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a resolution to confer the medals and titles shows the great importance China attaches to their contributions and, more importantly, to their spirit.The Chinese awardees, as representatives of the countless unsung heroes, exemplify the contributions ordinary people have made to the country's development.Tragically, the two youngest heroes were only 29 years old when they died in 2016 — one in the line of duty as a UN peacekeeper in Somalia, and the other while performing a task for the naval air force of the People's Liberation Army.The awarding of the Friendship Medal to six foreigners — former Cuban president Raul Castro, Thai princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, former Tanzanian prime minister Salim Ahmed Salim, first vice-president of Russia-China Friendship Association Galina Kulikova, former French prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin and Canadian educator Isabel Crook — shows the Chinese people not only recognize foreigners' contributions but are also grateful to them for promoting cooperation between China and other countries and supporting China's socialist modernization.Thanks partly to such individuals' efforts, China has become the biggest supporter of economic globalization, which advances the common good and benefits the whole world.And the excellent examples these individuals have set should inspire the Chinese people to emulate them in order to realize the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
