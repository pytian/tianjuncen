                R&D to give Dutch giant edge in nation's energy-saving lighting products marketSignify NV, formerly Philips Lighting, the Netherlands-based lighting specialist, will increase its investments in China, which will mainly go toward acquisitions, research and development.The move is aimed at exploiting China's digital technology boom and rising demand from the education sector, said Lim Sau Hong, Signify's global vice-president.Lim, who is also the group's head of marketing in the country, said that as many Chinese companies have high-quality innovation and manufacturing abilities with considerable scale, investing on new plants is no longer the group's top priority in China."Because China is one of our top five markets across the world, Signify will seek robust growth by focusing on aspects such as acquiring capable domestic players, introducing connecting intelligent products, building an advanced supply chain and recruiting the right people."In July, Signify announced it acquired a 51-percent stake in Zhejiang Klite Lighting Holdings Co, one of the leading providers of cost-efficient LED lamps and luminaires in China.Klite manufactures a wide range of such products for a large, global customer base, which generated around 250 million euros ($273.4 million) in sales to third parties in 2018.Signify's transaction will bring additional scale and innovation power to Klite, allowing it to generate further cost efficiencies and enhance its product development, including connected lighting offerings. The deal is expected to close before this year-end, after which Klite will continue to operate as a stand-alone entity.In April, the Dutch company agreed to acquire Hong Kong-based WiZ Connected, an open IoT platform accessible to all lighting and electrical vendors. The deal is expected to enable Signify to enlarge its presence by stepping into the WiFi-based smart lighting market.As China is Signify's second-largest overseas market after the United States, the company develops its products not only for a single country but for the global markets, Lim said. Many breakthroughs have been contributed by Signify's innovation facilities, including those in Shanghai and Shenzhen.Since many parts of China have been focusing on 5G network construction and application of the cutting-edge technology for commercial use, Lim said Signify has already developed a relevant product - the smart pole, or an intelligent streetlight, which can be further integrated with 5G technologies in many fields. The product is currently being tested in China.He said the pole is much more than a mere streetlight, and uses technologies like a strong identification system based on a camera that can recognize faces and vehicles. It requires low latency, high reliability and wide bandwidth, and 5G technology can enable these functions.As the government plans to introduce a mandatory national standard for both home study and classroom lighting, Lim said more Chinese schools will equip themselves with next-generation lighting products over the next three years. Signify plans to generate more sales revenue from this fast-growing area."We found that parents in city-level markets have attached great importance to selecting desk lamps for their children," he said, adding many adults, on the contrary, often ignore proper protection for their own eyes. Public awareness needs to be further improved, given the strain caused to eyes by excessive use of smartphones and video games as well as workload-related stress.Given China's rapid GDP growth in recent years, Signify has been busy introducing several new desk lamp products in the domestic market that has seen notable consumption upgrade. Chinese consumers have a growing need to prevent deterioration of eyesight and avoid eye discomfort, Lim said.Consumption of lighting products was relatively low in third-and fourth-tier cities, but now a growing number of consumers prefer to buy such products using e-commerce platforms, he said.Sun Fuquan, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development in Beijing, said led by high-quality development, China is already the global leader in applying clean-energy and energy-efficient products as well as making big-ticket investments in this sector.He said LED and smart lighting, electric vehicles, wind power and solar energy, which use less power but also illuminate China's green development, will become a key differentiating factor in determining a country's competitiveness.With more than 44 million connected light points, over 29,000 employees and 6.4 billion euros in sales globally in 2018, Signify was rated by multiple market agencies, including the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, as the top player in conventional lighting, LED and connected lighting.Lim said Signify is also keen to assist Chinese cities that are developing more eco-friendly business and tourist landmarks by using connected LED lighting. It can help them to lower energy use and reduce operating costs. The new lighting is expected to save a city between 50 percent and 70 percent of its annual lighting costs compared with conventional lighting.

                    US manufacturing down amid friction
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                US manufacturing contracted in August for the first time in three years as a protracted trade war with China eroded manufacturers' confidence, according to a new business survey. The US purchasing managers index slumped to 49.1 in August, the fifth straight monthly decline, which capped a 35-month expansion cycle and was the lowest since January 2016, according to a report released by the Institute for Supply Management on Tuesday. PMI gauges the performance of the manufacturing sector. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. In contrast, China's PMI increased to 50.4 last month from 49.9 in July, according to the Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI Index released on Monday. The official manufacturing PMI inched down from 49.7 in July to 49.5 in August, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Saturday. Timothy Fiore, chairman of the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing business survey committee in the US, said, "Comments from the panel reflect a notable decrease in business confidence." The institute's new export orders index, a reflection of overseas demand, "contracted strongly" to 43.3 in August, the lowest in a decade, according to an institute news release. "Respondents expressed slightly more concern about US-China trade turbulence, but trade remains the most significant issue, indicated by the strong contraction in new export orders," Fiore said. In the release, the institute quoted several executives who listed tariffs and fear of a recession as their major concerns. "While business is strong, there is an undercurrent of fear and alarm regarding the trade wars and a potential recession," an unnamed executive of a chemical products company said in the survey. A manager in furniture and related products told the institute: "Incoming sales seem to be slowing down, and this is usually our busiest season. (There are) concerns about the economy and tariffs." Another respondent, representing computer and electronic products companies, said, "Tariffs continue to be a strain on the supply chain and the economy overall." The US PMI was released two days after a new round of US tariffs on imported Chinese goods took effect on Sunday. The new data on US factory activity was a precursor to selling on Wall Street. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.1 percent in trading on Tuesday. Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, called the situation "mildly worrying", since the manufacturing sector accounts for about 11 to 12 percent of the US economy. "That will cut back the number of new jobs each month and gradually erode consumer confidence," he said. Douglas H. Paal, distinguished fellow of the Asia Program of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said, "Entrepreneurs have taken the government's signals to heart and are avoiding investment that may be subject to unstable trade policy impulses." huanxinzhao@chinadailyusa.com (China Daily Global 09/05/2019 page1)

                    US stocks rally on data, trade talks

                US stocks surged Thursday on positive economic reports and after the US and China said they would hold high-level talks in Washington in October, rekindling hopes for an eventual trade truce.China's Ministry of Commerce Ministry said Thursday that its trade team would lay the groundwork with their US counterparts in mid-September for the October talks.That pushed Asian, European and US stock markets higher. Wall Street's three main indexes touched their highest level since Aug 1.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 372.68 points, or 1.41 percent, to 26,727.4, the S&P 500 index gained 38.2 points, or 1.30 percent, to 2,975.95. The Nasdaq Composite added 139.95 points, or 1.75 percent, to 8,116.83.Investors were cheered by strong US economic data that eased concerns about an economic downturn, which was exacerbated on Tuesday by data that showed factory activity contracted in August for the first time in three years.The US services sector accelerated in August, rebounding from its weakest level in nearly three years, as new orders rose to their highest level since February amid trade worries.ADP Research Institute data showed US companies added the most jobs in four months in August while jobless claims stayed low last week. Hiring at small businesses jumped by 66,000, a four-month high, the ADP data showed.The ADP report is considered a precursor to the Labor Department's more comprehensive jobs report that will be issued Friday.The report Friday is projected to show that nonfarm payrolls rose by 160,000 in August, versus 164,000 the previous month. Estimates are for unemployment to be steady at 3.7 percent and the average hourly earnings rate of increase to slow to 3 percent."Manufacturing is in a bit of a global slump, but if you look at the other economic data, like the services and jobs reports, none of them point to an economy that is teetering on a recession," Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, told Reuters.Usha Haley, a professor of international business at Wichita State University, disagreed, calling the rise in stocks "a sugar high''."The fundamentals have not changed. I have changed my opinion and feel we are on our way to a recession. Global indicators point in that direction. The US-China loud and jingoistic talk and actions on trade have expedited the process," he told China Daily in an email.Scott Reeves and The Associated Press contributed to this story.

                    Market rally likely to keep pace in Sept

                Bullish view fueled by fresh cut in amount banks must hold as reservesChinese mainland stocks extended gains on Monday as investors expected ampler liquidity and more easing policies after the central bank's latest move to boost lending.The market may continue to rally over the rest of this month, with upbeat investor sentiment and foreign inflows accelerated by global investment indexes' inclusions, analysts said.The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.84 percent to close at 3024.74 points on Monday, registering a six-session winning streak. The Shenzhen Component Index jumped by 1.82 percent to 10,001.93 points, the first time the index had closed above 10,000 points since late April.The ChiNext Index, which is heavy with innovative mid to small-cap companies, soared 2.42 percent to 1733.23 points and entered bullish territory, an advance of more than 20 percent from its recent low in June.Technology shares led the rise on Monday, with the communications equipment, internet, software and semiconductor sectors posting gains of more than 4 percent, according to financial information provider Wind Info.The bullish sentiment was fueled by the central bank's fresh cut in the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, analysts said. The People's Bank of China announced late on Friday the lowering of the required reserve ratio for all banks by 0.5 percentage point, effective from Sept 16.On top of the broad-based cut, the PBOC will also cut the ratio for some city commercial banks by 1 percentage point in two steps later this year. The cuts will release 900 billion yuan ($126 billion) in liquidity and lower banks' costs of funds, reducing borrowing costs faced by the real economy, according to the PBOC's website."The move lifted the market's expectation of further marginal easing of monetary policy, despite the unchanged overall prudent tone," said Wang Yi, chief strategist with Shenzhen-based Great Wall Securities.The market expects the authority to soon lower the interest rate of medium-term lending facility, which represents the cost that commercial banks should pay for borrowing from the PBOC, Wang said.The A-share market may extend gains in the rest of the month, as investor sentiment recovers amid rising expectations of macro stimulus and positive news about the trade tension between China and the United States - the two parties are due to restart trade talks next month, Wang added.In the mid-to long-run, the cut in reserve requirement ratio will help boost corporate earnings and therefore share prices, said Zhang Xia, chief strategist with Shenzhen-based China Merchants Securities.As banks face lower costs of funds after the cut, they may lower the quotation rates for the formation of the loan prime rate - the newly introduced lending reference rate, lowering corporate borrowing costs and boosting earnings as a result, Zhang said in a report.Foreign inflow triggered by global indexes' inclusion of A shares may cement the market rally in September, according to Zhang.Global index provider S&P Dow Jones Indices announced last week that it would add 1,099 A shares into the S&P Emerging Broad Market Index, one of its investment benchmarks used by global money managers. Once the inclusion takes effect on Sept 23 as scheduled, A shares are projected to represent a weight of 6.2 percent in the index.Also on Sept 23, another major index complier FTSE Russell is due to roughly triple the weighting of more than 1,000 A shares in its global benchmarks and include 87 new A-share constituents.On the back of the inclusions, a total of $5.1 billion in passively-managed overseas funds tracking the indexes - or worldwide portfolios whose allocations synchronize with every change in the indexes - is expected to flow into A shares this month, according to Zhang.Inflow of actively managed funds, which use the indexes as investment benchmarks, may also speed up, based on the premise of no major escalation in the trade tension or yuan depreciation, Zhang said.

                    Lifting quotas restrictions is step up for financial market reform, opening-up
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Earlier this week, China's foreign exchange regulator announced the decision to remove quotas on the dollar-dominated qualified foreign institutional investor (QFII) scheme and its yuan-denominated counterpart, RQFII. Under the changes, foreigners get to invest in Chinese securities by completing an easy registration process. FTSE China A50 futures rose as much as 0.6% in Singapore on the news.The move has come following earlier signs of financial market opening-up. In January, China doubled the QFII quota to $300 billion. Also, draft rules were published earlier this year to combine the QFII and RQFII investment schemes, while simplifying access for overseas investors. Last year, China removed lock-in periods and allowed foreign investors to repatriate funding at any time.The step-up of China's financial market reform and opening-up is a welcome sign while the world's second largest economy enhances its position as a credible, attractive financial investment destination. I believe there are several key take-aways that come out of the latest investment quota lifting.First of all, China's incremental approach to financial reform is working well. Over the past four decades of the reform and opening-up process, China has done marvelously in manufacturing and trade, apparently some of the "easier" tasks for an emerging economy. However, for rising China to be fully integrated into the global financial market with unobstructed capital flow, such sea change cannot happen overnight, and any incremental change involves significant risk as it impacts financial stability.Overall, China has managed well incremental change as the country adapts and mitigates any risk along the road towards full integration. This incremental pace aligns well with growing overall national economic strengths. Financial integration with the global market supports economic growth, while economic capacity provides the necessary resilience for China to address any financial upheaval, not the least manifested in the 1998 and 2008 financial crises.Secondly, on a more technical note, lifting foreign investment quotas doesn't necessarily mean a quick increase of inbound funding. Chinese regulators won't be so naive as to expect capital inflows as an immediate result of the latest move. In fact, any subsequent investment trend has to depend on the fundamental outlook of the underlying economy, in which Chinese regulators have the biggest confidence, backed by a huge patience that can be measured by years and even decades.That said, lifting foreign investment quotas is not a short-term maneuver to offset immediate stress, as voiced by certain pundits raising concern about current trade tensions and resultant capital flow. Chinese regulators are thinking in a much longer time frame than typical market participants. Therefore, building on past efforts to address market accessibility, the latest move is a natural evolution towards financial market opening-up. It'd be wrong to make any hyped over-interpretation.Thirdly, given overall market reaction in the past couple of days, people with insights on China are generally positive about the quota lifting. Increasingly, the "China Opportunity" in the financial sector is being recognized by international investors. To provide a wider context, a growing number of global index publishers, including MSCI, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones, are adding China stocks and bonds into their benchmarks. Such developments and easier financial market access coupled with ongoing index inclusion are sure to push China's capital markets into the global investment mainstream.Next, it would be interesting to observe how outbound investment from China, particularly the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) scheme, might be de-regulated. Though there is no concrete news as of now, I remain fully confident in the direction towards financial market reform and opening-up. Even more step-ups are sure to take place.The author is a Beijing-based consultant working on international development issues, covering public health, clean energy and poverty reduction.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.
