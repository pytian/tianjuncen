                'Serious irregularities' exist in jail where Epstein committed suicide: AG Barr
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON -- US Attorney General William Barr said Monday the jail where alleged sex offender Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide had "serious irregularities."Barr weighed in on the weekend incident at a news conference in New Orleans, saying that initial discoveries made by investigators probing into the apparent suicide of Epstein found the jail is partially responsible for the incident."I was appalled and frankly angry to learn of the failure to adequately secure this prisoner," Barr said. "We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation."Epstein was found unconscious in his cell on Saturday and was later pronounced dead.Epstein was accused in early July of sexually exploiting and abusing dozens of underage girls in the early 2000s. He was denied bail weeks after and would face up to 45 years in prison if convicted.After a previous attempt to take his own life, Epstein was placed on suicide watch, but was later removed from suicide watch at the request of his attorney.

                    US billionaire Epstein denied bail in sex-trafficking case

            <p class="style-content">
                NEW YORK -- Jeffrey Epstein, the US billionaire who was accused of sex trafficking with minors, was denied a bail on Thursday and will stay in custody until his trial.US federal judge Richard Berman dismissed the bail application at a courthouse in Manhattan in New York City, citing potential dangers Epstein could pose to the community, especially to his accusers.Prosecutors also said that Epstein's wealth and resources could help him flee the country if he got bailed out.Epstein, 66, was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing dozens of underage girls in early 2000s. Prosecutors said he had lured those girls to his homes in New York and Florida and paid them for sex acts and for recruiting more victims.He faces up to 45 years in prison if convicted.The former hedge fund manager had avoided federal prosecution 11 years ago on similar charges in Florida by pleading guilty to state charges under a plea deal, which spared him from a lengthy jail time.The new indictment re-generated public outrage over Epstein and his previous trial. US Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta, who acted as Epstein's lawyer in 2008 and handled the plea deal, was compelled to resign last week amid the furor.

                    Disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein found dead in apparent suicide

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                NEW YORK - Disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein was found dead on Saturday after an apparent suicide in the New York jail cell where he was being held without bail on sex-trafficking charges, and a source said he was not on suicide watch at the time of his death.Epstein, 66, was found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit of the Metropolitan Correctional Center and transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which operates the lower Manhattan jail, said in a statement.Epstein, who was arrested on July 6, had pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls as young as 14, from at least 2002 to 2005.Last month, Epstein was found unconscious on the floor of his jail cell with marks on his neck, according to media reports, and officials were investigating that incident as a possible suicide or assault.Despite that, Epstein had been taken off suicide watch, a special set of procedures for inmates deemed in danger of taking their own life, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. He was on suicide watch as late as Thursday, the source said.The financier was in a cell by himself when his body was found, the source said.The FBI and the Department of Justice's Inspector General were opening investigations, US Attorney General William Barr said, adding that he was "appalled" to learn of his death in federal custody."Mr. Epstein's death raises serious questions that must be answered," Barr said in a statement.At the MCC, two jail guards are required to make separate checks on all prisoners every 30 minutes, but that procedure was not followed overnight, according to the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record.In addition, every 15 minutes guards are required to make another check on prisoners who are on suicide watch.Epstein was housed in the Special Housing Unit, even as guards are required to remove prisoners on suicide watch from the unit, according to a Twitter post by Preet Bharara, a former US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The SHU separates inmates such as accused sex offenders deemed likely to be harmed by other prisoners from the general population.Epstein had been confined to the correctional center while he appealed a district judge's refusal to let him live under 24-hour guard in his opulent townhouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side.Reuters

                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he wants a "full investigation" into the circumstances surrounding financier Jeffrey Epstein's death at a federal detention facility in New York City while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges."Basically what we're saying is we want an investigation. I want a full investigation, and that's what I absolutely am demanding. That's what our attorney general, our great attorney general is doing. He's doing a full investigation," Trump told reporters in New Jersey.Trump made the comments after US Attorney General William Barr earlier vowed to carry on the Epstein investigation even after the financier's death and ordered the Justice Department's inspector general to look into the matter.Epstein, who once counted Trump and Democratic former President Bill Clinton as friends, was arrested on July 6 and pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls as young as 14.Epstein was found dead on Saturday morning, having apparently hanged himself in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in lower Manhattan.The 66-year-old financier had been on suicide watch, but a source said he was not on watch at the time of his death.At the MCC, two jail guards are required to make separate checks on all prisoners every 30 minutes, but that procedure was not followed overnight, according to a source familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity.Reuters

                NEW YORK - An autopsy has concluded that financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in his jail cell on Saturday while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, hanged himself, a spokeswoman for the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner said on Friday.The wealthy and well-connected money manager was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan, triggering investigations into the circumstances of his death. He was 66.Epstein was arrested on July 6 and pleaded not guilty to federal charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls as young as 14."We are sending the determination out very shortly. It is suicide by hanging," Office of Chief Medical Examiner spokeswoman Aja Worthy-Davis told Reuters.Epstein was already a registered sex offender after pleading guilty in 2008 to Florida state charges of unlawfully paying a teenage girl for sex. Prior to his conviction, he had counted the rich and powerful, including US President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton, among his associates.Reuters

                    US Attorney General reassigns chief of Federal Bureau of Prisons

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - US Attorney General William Barr said on Monday that he has reassigned the chief of the Federal Bureau of Prisons in the wake of the sudden death of suspected sex offender Jeffrey Epstein at a federal jail in the New York City more than a week ago.Barr said in a statement that he will name Kathleen Hawk Sawyer as the new director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, replacing the agency's acting director Hugh Hurwitz."I am pleased to welcome back Dr. Hawk Sawyer as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons," Barr said in the statement. Sawyer previously occupied the role between 1992 and 2003.The attorney general said last week that the jail where Epstein died has "serious irregularities" and is partially responsible for the disgraced financier's death. However, he didn't mention Epstein in Monday's statement.Epstein committed suicide by hanging himself in his jail cell, the New York medical examiner said Friday, capping days of an outpouring of unfounded conspiracy theories about how the disgraced financier died at the Metropolitan Correctional Center.US media reports said earlier the jail had not followed protocol to secure Epstein's safety prior to the apparent suicide. Epstein was at the time under "special observation status," indicating that he should have had a cell mate and jail guards should have checked on him every 30 minutes. But records showed that the cell mate was not present when the apparent suicide took place and jail guards failed to make scheduled tours.Epstein was accused in early July of sexually exploiting and abusing dozens of underage girls in the early 2000s. He was denied bail weeks after and would face up to 45 years in prison if convicted.

                    Records: Epstein signed will 2 days before jailhouse suicide

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                NEW YORK - Jeffrey Epstein signed a will just two days before he killed himself in jail, new court records show, opening a new legal front in what could be a long battle over the financier's fortune.Court papers filed last week in the US Virgin Islands list no details of beneficiaries but valued the estate at more than $577 million, including more than $56 million in cash.The existence of the will, first reported by the New York Post, raised new questions about Epstein's final days inside the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he was awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.Epstein signed the document Aug 8. Less than 48 hours later, he was found dead in his cell, prompting an investigation that has cast a harsh light on staffing shortages at the Manhattan detention center.Prosecutors on Monday moved to dismiss the indictment against Epstein but have said they are considering charging others with facilitating his alleged abuse of dozens of girls.The filing of the will, meanwhile, had been closely followed by lawyers representing women who claim they were sexually abused by Epstein when they were teenagers and recruited into his residences to provide him massages.Several attorneys vowed to go after his assets even if the will had named beneficiaries, as Epstein's death means there will be no trial on the criminal charges against him. One woman filed suit against the estate last week, claiming Epstein repeatedly raped her when she was a teenager."Give his entire estate to his victims. It is the only justice they can get," one of those lawyers, Lisa Bloom, wrote in an email. "And they deserve it. And on behalf of the Epstein victims I represent, I intend to fight for it."Former federal prosecutor David S. Weinstein, who is now in private practice in Miami but not involved in the Epstein case, said states and US territories have certain timeframes within which to make a claim against someone's estate."There are certainly going to be a lot of lawyers involved," Weinstein said. "It's not going to be over any time soon."A hedge fund manager who hobnobbed with the rich and famous, Epstein owned a Caribbean island, homes in Paris and New York City, a New Mexico ranch and a fleet of high-price cars.Epstein had more than $112 million worth of equities, according to the will, and nearly $200 million in "hedge funds & private equity investments." Among the properties that will be subject to appraisal and valuation are his collection of fine arts, antiques and other collectibles.As part of his 2008 plea deal to Florida state charges, Epstein made undisclosed financial settlements with dozens of his victims. It's unclear how those settlements might affect any claims made on his estate.William Blum, an attorney for Epstein's estate, said in a statement to The Associated Press that any debts or claims against the estate will be "fairly administered." He said the document was Epstein's original last will.AP

                    'Coward': Epstein accusers pour out their anger in court
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                NEW YORK — One by one, 16 women who say they were sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein poured out their anger Tuesday, lashing out at him as a coward and a manipulator, after a judge gave them the day in court they were denied when he killed himself behind bars."The fact I will never have a chance to face my predator in court eats away at my soul," said Jennifer Araoz, who has accused Epstein of raping her in his New York mansion when she was a 15-year-old aspiring actress."Even in death, Epstein is trying to hurt me. I had hoped to at last get an apology, but this evil man had no remorse or caring for what he did to anyone," she said.The hearing was convened by US District Judge Richard M. Berman, who presided over the case after federal prosecutors had Epstein arrested last month.The question before the judge was whether to throw out the indictment because of the defendant's death, a usually pro forma step undertaken without a hearing. But the judge offered Epstein's accusers an extraordinary opportunity to speak in court.In addition to the women who spoke — some publicly for the first time — statements from several others were read in court by their lawyers.They vented their fury over Epstein's alleged crimes and his suicide in his jail cell Aug. 10 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges involving dozens of teenage girls. Repeatedly, the women described themselves as survivors and said they hoped coming forward would help others."I was a victim, but I will not remain a victim and be silent for one more day," said actress Anouska De Georgiou, who said she was sexually abused by Epstein as a teenager. "Although I think it's tragic when anybody dies before their time, I'm extremely relieved that Jeffrey Epstein will not be in a position to hurt any more children or any more women."Courtney Wild, who has said she was sexually abused by Epstein in Florida at age 14, called him a "coward" who had "robbed myself and all the other victims of our day in court to confront him."Araoz said she felt let down by Epstein's jailers, too."They let this man kill himself and kill the chance for justice for so many others in the process," she said.Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who has said she was a 15-year-old working at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club when she was recruited to perform sex acts on Epstein, told the court: "My hopes were quickly dashed, and my dreams were stolen."Sarah Ransome, who said Epstein pressured her into sex when she was in her early 20s, pleaded with prosecutors to go after those who helped the financier in his pursuit of victims."Please, please finish what you started," she said.Among those under scrutiny: Epstein's girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who has been accused of recruiting young women for his sexual pleasure and taking part in the abuse. She has denied wrongdoing.In opening the session, the judge called the 66-year-old Epstein's suicide a "rather stunning turn of events." He defended his decision to let the women speak, saying public hearings "promote transparency."During the 2?-hour proceeding, the women sometimes clutched one another to lend support. Most remained composed, but several cried as they described falling into Epstein's web. His suicide left some of them angry, others sad. One said she was relieved that he was gone and could abuse no others.Some women described their shame and embarrassment, saying Epstein manipulated them, dangling his wealth and power and connection to celebrities and political figures, while seizing on their vulnerabilities.Several of the women chose to testify anonymously, including one who said she was 15 when she was flown to Epstein's New Mexico ranch. While molesting her, he was also "explaining to me how beneficial the experience was for me and how he was helping me grow," she said.She said that as he abused her, she could see framed pictures of him on a dresser, smiling with celebrities.Teala Davies, taking deep breaths to steady her voice, said she was 17 when she was victimized. She said she thought Epstein was the most powerful person she would ever meet."But the end is here, and here I stand, becoming more powerful than he will ever be," she said.A New York City coroner ruled that Epstein hanged himself . But one of Epstein's lawyers, Martin Weinberg, challenged that finding during Tuesday's hearing, saying "we are told by a very experienced forensic pathologist" that broken bones in his neck were more consistent with strangulation than with suicide."Find out what happened to our client," the lawyer told the judge.Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey, though, said the manner of Epstein's death was irrelevant to Tuesday's proceedings.The judge said he thought it was "fair game" for the defense to raise concerns, but took no immediate action on the request. Prosecutors noted that a grand jury is already investigating the death.Dr. Michael Baden, the pathologist hired by Epstein's representatives to observe the autopsy, told The Associated Press Tuesday he is awaiting the report from the medical examiner's office before offering his opinion on the cause of death.Comey said the dismissal of an indictment against Epstein "in no way lessens the government's resolve to stand up for the victims"At his death, Epstein was being held without bail, accused of abusing girls in the early 2000s at his mansions in New York and Palm Beach, Florida.In the wake of his suicide, the warden of the federal jail and the acting director of the Bureau of Prisons were removed, and two guards who were supposed to be watching Epstein were placed on leave.Epstein's lawyers contended he could not be prosecuted because he signed a non-prosecution deal with federal authorities over a decade ago in Florida that resulted in a 13-month stint in jail on state prostitution-related charges. Federal prosecutors in New York said that deal did not prevent the new charges.AP
