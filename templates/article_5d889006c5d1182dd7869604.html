                Plateau wildlife booms thanks to continuing ecological protection
            </p>
            <p>
                XINING - The lush grass, crystal blue waters and creatures residing in the high altitude localities of Sanjiangyuan-home to the headwaters of the Yangtze, Yellow and Lancang rivers-continually inspire Wei Ye to come back."The view here is breathtaking," said Wei from Nanjing, more than 2,000 kilometers away.A team of Hong Kong tourists are on an adventure to chase rare plateau animals. They have seen blue sheep, white-lipped deers and vultures, but their ultimate goal is to catch a glimpse of the snow leopard."Sanjiangyuan has the highest recorded density of snow leopards. Capturing them on camera is not a problem if you stay for a week," said Rinchen Dargye, a local guide.The Sanjiangyuan area strictly curbs the number of visitors to protect the fragile natural beauty. A total of 22 households in the region are now allowed to host tourists after having received training. Each household can only receive three groups of visitors-usually ranging from one to three people-a year.Snow leopards and other rare animals have been thriving in the area thanks to government efforts to protect the wild animals and crack down on poaching.Li Yuhan saw seven snow leopards during her tour in October 2017, while Xiao Nan, a truck driver, was thrilled to encounter thousands of Tibetan antelopes crossing a bridge on the Qinghai-Tibet rail route last summer."The population of herbivores grew fast while carnivores were frequently sighted, which is strong evidence of the improved ecosystem in the Sanjiangyuan area," stated Zhao Xiang, director of the Sanjiangyuan project at the Beijing Shanshui Conservation Center.The latest figures show that the area now boasts more than 1,000 snow leopards, and the number of rare antelopes has more than tripled. Meanwhile, naked carp, a species endemic to the plateau, has seen its numbers rise to 34 times its 2002 population."Such accomplishments are a result of increased awareness of ecological protection among local herders and the support of domestic and overseas experts," said Gyushe with the Sanjiangyuan National Park management bureau.China has injected more than 18 billion yuan ($2.5 billion) in ecological conservation in the area since 2005. The Sanjiangyuan National Park, part of a pilot project of 10 national parks, is expected to be officially established in 2020.British ecologist Terry Townshend applauded China's efforts. Sanjiangyuan is one of the cleanest areas in the world, with little human influence and many primitive features, Townshend said, adding that its natural environment provides an excellent shelter for wildlife.

                Chinese tech firms master surveying to thrive in the age of apps and autonomous drivingWalking into the Palace Museum, Beijing's pre-eminent historical site and tourist attraction, a visitor can simply point her smartphone at a palace in the precinct to see the ancient building and its surroundings in 3-D.The content is vivid and extremely informative. What the palace was used for, how many people are there right now, and how to reach it ...such details are available at fingertips, thanks to the innovative application of a high-definition mapping solution developed by Chinese firm Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.Dubbed Cyberverse, the hand-held device app uses virtual reality or VR and spatial computing to enable people to navigate and learn about their surroundings.To make it more creative and engaging, the app may be able to incorporate social functionalities in the future, where people will see passersby with their hobbies showing overhead on their handsets, said Luo Wei, a chief engineer from Huawei.Though the tech has not been commercialized yet, it epitomizes the ambition of China's largest smartphone maker to develop high-definition mapping capabilities. This move came right after Huawei announced plans to unveil in October its own mapping services called Map Kit.

                China Unicom, Telecom announce 5G cooperation
            </a>
            <p>
                China Unicom and China Telecom said on Monday they will work together to build one nationwide 5G network as the country's second- and third-largest telecom operators join hands to reduce construction costs for fifth-generation wireless technology.The two companies claimed they will jointly build and share network infrastructure to offer the same level of service.All three major Chinese telecom operators — China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom — co-own China Tower Corp, which makes it easier for China Unicom and China Telecom to cooperate on building 5G base stations.Besides offering a way to reduce the high cost of building 5G networks, the new agreement will also help ease operator pressures, especially as the domestic telecom services market is contracting.Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Information Consumption Alliance, a telecom industry association, explained that given the government's push to boost speed and reduce mobile data tariffs, operators are under certain pressures and it is difficult to see steady growth in revenue."5G construction will not only bring operators opportunities and new streams of revenue, but also boost development of the whole industry and economic growth," Xiang said during a recent interview with China Daily.Based on their total number of 4G base stations, China Unicom and China Telecom will work together to build 5G networks in 15 cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Nanjing in Jiangsu province.China Unicom will independently build 5G networks in 9 cities in Guangdong province, five cities in Zhejiang province and eight northern regions, including Hebei, Henan, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Shandong, Shanxi and the Inner Mongolia autonomous region. China Telecom, meanwhile, will build 5G networks in 10 cities of Guangdong province, five cities in Zhejiang province and 17 southern provinces.

                Telecom giants in alliance on 5G
            </a>
            <p>
                China Unicom, China Telecom team up to accelerate rollout of the superfast techThe joint push by China Unicom and China Telecom to build one nationwide 5G network is expected to accelerate the rollout of superfast wireless technology in the country, but its impact on upstream telecom equipment makers remains to be seen, analysts said on Tuesday.Ma Jihua, an independent analyst who has been following the telecom industry for more than a decade, said the move will undoubtedly reduce the construction costs for 5G given the current financial pressure faced by China Unicom and China Telecom."It will speed up the rollout for the two companies' 5G services by cutting duplicate investment, and this will also accelerate the shipments of telecom equipment," Ma said.The remarks came after the second and the third largest telecom operator in the country announced in a rare move on Monday their cooperation on building and sharing 5G network infrastructure.The two companies' shares on the Hong Kong bourse jumped following the announcement.China Unicom shares rose almost 5 percent to settle on Tuesday at its highest level in two months at HK$8.44($1.08). The shares of China Telecom also ended at a two-month peak, rising 4.74 percent to close at HK$3.76.Under the agreements inked by the two companies, China Unicom and China Telecom will work together to build 5G networks in 15 cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Nanjing in Jiangsu province, based on their total number of 4G base stations.China Unicom will also independently build 5G networks in nine cities in Guangdong province, five cities in Zhejiang province and more cities in another eight provinces and regions. China Telecom, for its part, will build 5G networks in 10 cities of Guangdong province, five cities in Zhejiang province and cities in another 17 provinces and regions.China International Capital Corporation Limited said in a research note the partnership between China Unicom and China Telecom will significantly relieve the financial pressure on the two companies. The acceleration of the 5G rollout will also bring benefits to telecom equipment makers such as Huawei Technologies Co and ZTE Corp."Currently, China Mobile, the country's largest telecom operator, has as many 4G base stations as those of China Unicom and China Telecom combined. That could also be the case in terms of 5G base stations in the future," the research note added.Last year, the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government think tank, forecast that the country's telecom carriers are expected to spend 900 billion to 1.5 trillion yuan ($127 billion to $211 billion) on 5G network construction from 2020 to 2025.The cooperation deal though sparked worries that the total investment size on 5G will be reduced sharply since the two major players will only build one network instead of two separate networks as originally expected. If that is the case, it could be bad news for Huawei and ZTE.Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Information Consumption Alliance, a telecom industry association, said it remains to be seen how the move will affect telecom equipment makers' businesses.

                Lack of 5G capacity may harm Apple
            </a>
            <p>
                Apple Inc's lower-priced iPhones are expected to intensify competition in China's smartphone market, but their inability to support 5G may leave some tech-savvy consumers disappointed, analysts said on Wednesday.The comments came after Apple unveiled new iPhones on Tuesday in the United States, with an unexpected price cut for its cheapest model, the iPhone 11.James Yan, research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research, who has tried Apple's latest iPhones and was present at the launch event in Cupertino, California, said on a social networking platform that the practical pricing strategy of the iPhone 11 could give Apple an appeal to consumers at least before the second quarter of next year.The iPhone 11 is priced from 5,499 yuan ($772.8) in China, about 1,000 yuan less than its predecessor the iPhone XR, which was unveiled in 2018. The premium version iPhone 11 Pro Max's price is roughly the same as its predecessor last year.Data from Fenqile, an installment e-commerce platform under Nasdaq-listed LexinFintech, show that since its launch, the iPhone 11's pre-order page on the platform has been visited almost a million times. The most popular pre-ordered iPhone model is the iPhone 11 64G.Among the consumers who have pre-ordered the iPhone 11 on Fenqile, 75 percent are those born in the mid-1990s to early-2000s, indicating that the interest in the cheapest iPhone model is among young Chinese consumers.According to Yan, despite inability to support the 5G network, the new iPhones have made impressive improvements in cameras. Apple added an extra camera lens to each model and made some software optimization to make photo-taking better.But industry observers also point out that's what Chinese smartphone vendor Huawei Technologies Co pioneered and other players have already done in their previous handsets.Apple's latest launch event came after its iPhone shipments went down 18.2 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2019, according to research firm International Data Corp.The decline is part of the result of a shrinking global smartphone market as consumers less frequently upgrade their handsets and some are holding their purchase plans to wait for competitive 5G smartphones.But Apple's loss also came as its South Korean rival Samsung Electronics Co and Chinese competitor Huawei grew their worldwide smartphone shipments by 5.5 percent and 8.3 percent year-on-year respectively from April to June, highlighting the challenges the US tech giant faces.Zhang Wentao, a 27-year-old Beijing-based electronics fan, said it has been rumored for a long time that Apple would not launch its 5G handset until next year, but witnessing the launch event still left him disappointed, especially as Chinese brands have all come up with their own 5G devices.Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Information Consumption Alliance, a telecom industry association, said Apple holds a major iPhone launch event every autumn, which means that its 5G device will come into the market by next September at the earliest. Many consumers would buy a competitive 5G handset before that time.

                Designing personalized tours becoming popular occupation
            </a>
            <p>
                Working as a personal itinerary designer-tailoring tours to an individual traveler's demands-has become a popular job as customized travel catches on in China.A report by the China Tourism Academy in late July said customized travel, which first emerged in China in 2000, has grown rapidly since 2016.According to a service standard on customized travel released in July by Ctrip, an online travel agency in Shanghai, customized travel is a tour product that includes services such as consultancy before the trip and hotel reservations and butler service during the trip.Tan Jie, deputy general manager of the self-guided travel department at China CYTS Tours in Beijing, said the company had seen customized travel products grow from 11 percent of its business in 2016 to 26 percent last year.Ctrip said customized travel reservations soared 180 percent year-on-year in 2018.Xiang Min, a 31-year-old from central China's Hunan province, chose to be an itinerary designer in 2016 after working as a tour guide for three years."I learned tourism at college and then worked as a tour guide after graduation," she said."I want to give more to the customers, provide a more interesting experience at the destination and also a human touch during the trip."Xiang said customized travel is quite different from traditional tours."The traditional product is a kind of standardized one, while a customized tour is more private and diversified, designed on the basis of the traveler's hobbies and demands."She designed a couple's customized tour to Australia in April to focus on encounters with animals. "We were told the wife loved animals and wanted to stay close to different animals on the trip, so we booked them homestays at farms and also hotels featuring the opportunity to feed animals-for example, a giraffe," Xiang said.She said an itinerary designer is responsible for one-stop services for travelers before and during the trip, and also needs to review the trip afterward."It's really important for the designer to keep learning about the destination and create travel plans that consider the customer's requests," she said.Itinerary designers also enjoy higher pay than tour guides, according to a report by Ctrip in July based on a survey of the more than 6,000 designers registered with its platform.It said the average monthly income of an itinerary designer is about 9,000 yuan ($1,308), while senior designers can earn as much as 40,000 yuan a month.Young people born since 1995 accounted for nearly 35 percent of those surveyed, with the report saying they were attracted to the job because of their passion and curiosity about new professions and new ways of traveling.Chen Lin, a 26-year-old from Yunnan province, said she enjoyed a great sense of accomplishment by working as an itinerary designer."I used to be a tour guide for groups of travelers before getting involved in customized travel in 2017," she said."I can feel the change … I used to regard myself as a saleswoman because what I had to do was to sell the standardized product to travelers. However, a more human touch is required to become a itinerary designer."We can even become very good friends with the customers as we know what they value and what they love as tourists, not merely selling them an average product."
