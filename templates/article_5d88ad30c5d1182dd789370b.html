                Xinwu district in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, is exploring an innovative path for high-quality development and Yangtze River Delta regional integration, local officials said. The district is home to the Wuxi National Hi-tech District. Government data show that there are more than 26,000 businesses in Xinwu, including 20 publicly traded companies in China and abroad. Of those businesses, 1,674 have a registered capital of $32.5 billion from Japanese, South Korean, European and US investors. Also, 437 have been granted the title of national high-tech enterprises. In 2018, foreign capital worth $1.3 billion was paid into Xinwu, enabling the district to keep its No 1 position across the city for the third year. Driven by this flourishing investment, the district registered high growth in major economic indicators in 2018. Its GDP topped 180 billion yuan ($25.32 billion), ranking first in the city. Per capita GDP surpassed 300,000 yuan. Foreign trade exceeded $50 billion, also topping the city. The momentum continued in the first half of this year. Investment in local industries and fixed assets increased by 11.6 percent and 5.2 percent from the same period of last year respectively. Foreign trade grew 7 percent year-on-year. Countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative contributed more than half to the amount. Deals with BRI countries and regions were worth $13.86 billion, an increase of 7.6 percent year-on-year. Between January and June, local authorities approved 50 industrial projects. The total investment value reached 30.38 billion yuan, a record high. Of the new paid-in foreign capital, 88.4 percent went to strategic and emerging sectors. As for domestic investment during the period, investors from 17 provinces and municipalities poured 13.29 billion yuan into major projects. They contributed 70.7 percent to the district's target investment value in 2019. Behind these bustling industries is a business-friendly environment and sound industrial structure. As a forerunner in the internet of things industry, the district made marked progress in integrating IoT technology with traditional sectors, advancing their transformation and upgrades. At the same time, revolving around the IoT sector, authorities optimized the district's industrial structure and have been developing emerging industries. These include new-generation information technology; advanced machinery and equipment manufacturing; renewable energy and new energy vehicles; life sciences; artificial intelligence and modern services. High-level human resources are key to the district's sustainable growth. During that six-month period, nearly 260 experts and specialists were brought in to the district. Also, more than 460 high-tech companies were added to the local business circle, a rise of 53 percent year-on-year. The addition helped the high-tech sector generate 140 billion yuan in output value in the first six months. It accounted for 66.6 percent of the district's total. Spending on research and development accounted for 3.8 percent of the district's GDP during the period, up 0.36 percentage points year-on-year. "We will continue our industry-powered, innovation-driven growth strategy to advance reform and opening-up, accelerate regional integrated development and make a greater contribution to the city's high-quality development," said Wang Jinjian, vice-mayor of Wuxi and Party secretary of Xinwu district.  From left: Visitors experience a system combining internet of things technology and medical services at an innovation center funded by biopharmaceuticals company AstraZeneca in the district.
