                Editor's Note: The US Congress has made the passing of the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019" introduced by Congress members in June a top priority, while over the weekend some demonstrators in Hong Kong urged the US Congress to approve the law. Three experts share their views on the issue with China Daily's Liu Jianna. Excerpts follow:US interference in China's internal affair unacceptableOne country paying attention to another country's human rights conditions and helping it promote human rights may not be a bad thing, because human rights are universal values and the common goal of the people of all countries. But what measures should a country take to protect and promote human rights are absolutely its own business, because only that country has the right and duty to safeguard human rights within its boundaries.Besides, only the country in question can take into consideration the domestic realities, which the outside world more often than not ignores, to ensure the protection and smooth and orderly promotion of human rights.By introducing the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act", which is a direct interference in China's internal affairs, the United States has not only violated China's sovereignty, but also called into question the very concept of human rights and freedom.Worse, the US has openly supported the violators who have contravened the very human rights they claim to pursue by attacking police officers and police stations and other government facilities and unleashing indiscriminate violence in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.Obviously, human rights and freedom, in the true sense of the terms, are not what the US preaches. Which means Washington is seeking to encourage the demonstrators to continue the mayhem in Hong Kong and widen the divisions in the city.Lu Zhian, a researcher at the Research Center for Human Rights, Fudan UniversityHK unrest reflects rise of populismThis is not the first time, and it certainly won't be the last, that the US Congress is trying to push through such an act, thanks to the businesspeople represented by the US president, "missionaries" such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and "soldiers" like Vice-President Mike Pence. The missionaries, for example, believe that what is good for the US is good for the world, and therefore blindly export US values to the rest of the world.Before the midterm elections, the US leader could call the shots and silence the Democrats. But now that the Democrats have got a majority in the House of Representatives, partisan politics has kicked in.In fact, the unrest in Hong Kong is a continuation of the populism that has besieged the other two international financial centers, New York and London, in the past as reflected in the Occupy Wall Street movement and Brexit.Yet some forces in the US hope that by helping escalate the violence in Hong Kong, they will force the Chinese central government to deal with the demonstrators with an iron hand to restore order in the city, which would give them an opportunity to label China as an enemy of human rights and ask the international community to join Washington in boycotting it.The more restrained has been the central government's response, the more anxious these forces have become. As a result, they are trying increasingly aggressive ways to provoke China. But instead of linking the Hong Kong demonstrations with the Sino-US trade war, Washington should strive to ink a trade deal with China at the next round of trade talks in October in order to avoid further complicating the issue.Wang Yiwei, Jean Monnet chair professor at Renmin University of China'Color revolution' not possible in ChinaAs a self-proclaimed human rights champion, the US is adept at airing its views on almost every issue, especially on issues in which China is involved. For instance, the US Congress has passed many acts related to China's human rights record.Yet by brazenly endorsing the acts of some Hong Kong demonstrators who have unleashed violence in Hong Kong, and ignoring the restraint the Hong Kong and central governments have shown, the US has betrayed its ulterior motives.The Hong Kong insurrectionists' aim is to stage another "color revolution", but even they know that they cannot succeed in their evil design. And by introducing the so-called Hong Kong human rights act, the US Congress will add fuel to the fire in Hong Kong. This should prompt China to take immediate measures to stop the US and other Western countries from interfering in its internal affairs.Zhu Feng, dean of the Institute of International Relations of Nanjing UniversityThe views don't necessarily represent those of China Daily.

                    Washington must stop damaging HK's future

                "Make Hong Kong great again!" That was among the placards the protesters carried when they marched toward the US Consulate in Hong Kong on Sunday, seeking US intervention in the current crisis.However, the three-month-long unrest in the name of demanding withdrawal of the extradition bill has done nothing to make Hong Kong great again. Rioters fueled fires on the streets, attacked the police, paralyzed traffic and created trouble for ordinary residents, casting a shadow on the city's economic outlook.The violence has taken a toll on the catering and tourism industry, divided society and tarnished Hong Kong's image as a prosperous financial hub.The foreign hand behind the ugly scenes was visible through the protesters' public appeals. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the US Congress looked forward to swiftly advancing the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act".Is Hong Kong under the jurisdiction of the United States? Never. Does "make Hong Kong great again" serve to "make America great again"? Absolutely not. This only proves that "make Hong Kong chaotic again "serves the US' Cold War mindset.What some US politicians are doing regarding Hong Kong shows the country's old tricks aimed at slowing the peaceful rise of its rival.The reasons posted on the US Congress website to advance the "Hong Kong bill" include that US has "a strong interest in the continued vitality, prosperity, and stability of Hong Kong" and "the human rights of the people of Hong Kong are of great importance to the United States... and serve as a basis for Hong Kong's continued economic prosperity".The US has no right to dictate terms in the Hong Kong affairs.Economists have said the combined impact of the trade war and the persistent protests could push Hong Kong into a technical recession between July and September. Its economy in the second quarter contracted 0.4 percent compared with the first quarter, the worst in a decade. Fitch Ratings, the credit rating agency, has downgraded Hong Kong's sovereign rating.If the US really cared about the city's economic prosperity, it would have stopped directing its puppets in Hong Kong to plot persistent chaos that has choked the city. If the US cared about the city's human rights, it should have been concerned about the plight of Hong Kong's laid-off workers in the catering and tourism industry.CNN reported that at least 700 restaurant workers have lost their jobs since June. Nearly half of the 500 workers who took part in a survey by the Eating Establishment Employees General Union said they expected their companies to cut back on labor costs.It's also strange that protests demanding withdrawal of the extradition bill still seem to be underway, though the bill was first announced "dead" and later "formally withdrawn". Some protesters are holding all Hong Kong residents hostage to their narrow political agenda to please their foreign masters.It is time for some US politicians and their agents in Hong Kong to stop acts that will further damage Hong Kong's future. Lies will eventually be found out.The author is a writer with China Daily.

                    US House panel votes to ramp up Trump impeachment probe
                </p>
            </a>

                WASHINGTON - The Democratic-led US House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted to intensify its investigation of Republican President Donald Trump on Thursday, as lawmakers edged closer to deciding whether to recommend his impeachment.The 41-member panel adopted a resolution allowing it to designate hearings as impeachment proceedings, subject witnesses to more aggressive questioning and quicken the pace of an investigation that is expanding into areas that could prove politically explosive for both Trump and Congress."With these new procedures, we will begin next week an aggressive series of hearings investigating allegations of corruption, obstruction and abuse of power against the president," House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler told reporters after a 24-17 vote along party lines.A more aggressive probe could also increase pressure on House Democratic leaders including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted impeachment of Trump as a politically risky step for moderate Democratic freshmen from swing districts where ousting the president is an unpopular idea."Democrats have never gotten over the fact that I won the Election very fairly," Trump said in a statement posted to his Facebook page hours after the vote."If they go down the path of impeachment they will be dividing the nation! So ridiculous to even be talking about this subject when all of the crimes were committed by the other side," the president said.Trump and his Republicans allies charge that former US Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the Trump campaign's possible collusion stemmed from an earlier effort to sink his candidacy, and later his presidency, by former officials at the Justice Department.LEWANDOWSKI TESTIMONYRepublican lawmakers rejected the notion that the panel was pursuing an impeachment inquiry and dismissed the resolution as a "fantasy" intended to distract from Democrats' unwillingness to have the full House authorize a formal impeachment inquiry, as occurred during the Watergate era and the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton.Republicans said Democrats lacked the votes to obtain formal House authorization and denounced Thursday's action as a show intended to pander to Democratic voters who want Trump removed from office.Representative Doug Collins, the panel's top Republican, said the resolution simply reiterates powers that the committee has had all along."These rules are not new," he said. "This is to make you believe something is happening, more than what's actually happening."Nadler said that during the Watergate era, the House Judiciary Committee was already considering impeachment charges against then-President Richard Nixon and conducting a related probe when the House voted to authorize a formal inquiry.Committee Democrats plan to use the new tactics that allow an hour of questioning by committee lawyers of Corey Lewandowski, a close Trump confidant and one of his campaign managers in 2016. Lewandowski is due to appear before the panel next Tuesday for what may be a contentious hearing.Democrats expect his testimony to help lay out a charge of obstruction of justice. But they are also pursuing allegations of campaign finance violations, witness tampering and unlawful self-enrichment through his business ventures.Democrats aim to decide by the end of the year whether to recommend articles of impeachment against Trump to the full House. If approved by the chamber, the Republican-controlled Senate would be left to hold a trial and consider the president's ouster.A Reuters head count shows that 135 House Democrats back an impeachment inquiry. While that is a majority of the caucus, the number is well short of the 218 votes needed to pass a resolution.Only two American presidents have been impeached by the House: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Clinton in 1999. Neither was convicted by the Senate.Nixon resigned in 1974 after the House Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment against him, but before the full House voted on the matter.Reuters

                    China urges US to immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs

                BEIJING - China on Thursday strongly urged the US side to respect China's sovereignty and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form.Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang made the remarks in response to reports that US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a news conference on Wednesday with House members as well as Joshua Wong Chi-fung and Denise Ho to back the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019."China is strongly dissatisfied with and firmly opposes this move," Geng said at a press briefing, accusing Pelosi and other US politicians of confusing right from wrong, engaging with Hong Kong separatists and grossly interfering in China's internal affairs.Geng reiterated the position that Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs and brook no interference from any outside forces."We strongly urge the US side to abide by international laws and basic norms governing international relations, respect China's sovereignty, and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form and advancing the Hong Kong-related act," Geng said.He also called on the United States to stop backing the violent and radical forces as well as Hong Kong separatists and desist from supporting any moves undermining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.

                    Washington, thy other name is hypocrisy: China Daily editorial
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The United States always has its hands full trying to force its laws and values upon other countries and, if resisted, to impose sanctions on them. But as usual, it has failed with its filthy trick in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by openly supporting the violent demonstrators and introducing the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act" in Congress.So now it is trying to extend its dirty hands into the Tibet autonomous region, by unveiling a new bill that would prohibit Beijing from opening any new consulates on US soil until Washington is permitted to establish its own diplomatic office in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet autonomous region. And all in the name of human rights protection.As is its wont, Washington cannot bear to see peace and stability anywhere, except within its borders, for it has mastered the art of fishing in troubled waters. No wonder the bill also has provisions for the US taking punitive action against any Chinese officials who "interfere" in the Dalai Lama's succession. Which should make it clear the real purpose of the bill is to prevent the Chinese central government from using its authority to approve the successor to the octogenarian Dalai Lama after he dies.Perhaps US lawmakers, especially Massachusetts Democrat James McGovern who introduced the bill in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, and Florida Republican Marco Rubio who has been screaming his head off in support of the Hong Kong demonstrators, have forgotten that Tibet is an inseparable part of China, a fact the US, too, recognizes. As such, any attempt to interfere in Tibet's affairs would be a violation of China's sovereignty.More important, supporting the Dalai Lama is like mollycoddling a separatist, for his activities over the past decades to split Tibet from China make him exactly that. The economic development and social progress Tibetans have been enjoying fly in the face of the US congressmen, who without any knowledge about the region, have been beating their democracy and human rights drum.In keeping up with the US' practice of poking its nose into other countries' matters, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomed Hong Kong protesters on Wednesday. She even thanked them for unleashing violence and holding the city to ransom, and warned the US administration not to allow commercial interests to drive foreign policy in the region.The double standard resorted to by the self-proclaimed guardians of human rights becomes even more evident when they applaud rioters in other countries and deal with protesters in their own country with an iron hand.Have American values also come to mean hypocrisy?
