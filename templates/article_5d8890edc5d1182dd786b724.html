                    Two pandas leave for new home in Denmark
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                A pair of giant pandas will leave Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province, on Thursday for Denmark.They will stay in the Copenhagen Zoo for 15 years as part of a joint research project between the Chinese Association of Zoological Gardens and Copenhagen Zoo to protect and breed giant pandas.A grand farewell ceremony for the duo, Xing Er, a 6-year-old male, and Mao Er, a 5-year-old female, was held at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding on Wednesday.China and Denmark have frequent exchanges in the field of forestry. That two pandas are headed to Denmark for joint scientific research will not only bring joy to the Danish people but also enhance the friendly relationship between the two countries, said Meng Xianlin, head of the international department of the National Forestry and Grassland Administration.Preparations for the arrival of the two pandas have been underway for some time.In 2014, the two countries agreed to begin cooperating during Danish Queen Margrethe II's state visit to China. On May 3, 2017, China and Denmark signed an agreement to jointly begin a 15-year giant panda research program.The Danish embassy in China said the two pandas can expect an enthusiastic welcome in Copenhagen. Danish Ambassador to China Carsten Damsgaard will accompany the pandas on their flight from Beijing to Copenhagen."I am excited to be able to travel to Denmark together with our two new Chinese guests. They will be warmly welcomed in Denmark," the ambassador said.The panda house at the Copenhagen Zoo, designed by Danish architectural firm Bjarke Ingels Group, is inspired by the Chinese yin and yang symbol. The facility allows the male and female pandas to live apart most of the year, yet in proximity and with easy access to a common area when the female is in heat.Copenhagen Zoo CEO Jorgen Nielsen hailed the impending arrival of the two pandas as one of the biggest events in the zoo's 160-year history.

                WASHINGTON — Two days after he said buying Greenland wasn't a top priority, President Donald Trump canceled an upcoming trip to Denmark, which owns the mostly frozen island, after its prime minister dismissed the idea.Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen had called Trump's musing about buying the Danish territory "an absurd discussion" after the former real estate mogul-turned-president began to talk up the idea.Trump said Sunday that he was interested in such a deal for strategic purposes, but said a purchase was not a priority at this time. "It's not No 1 on the burner," he told reporters.Trump even joked about his proposal as it came in for ridicule, tweeting a doctored photo of a glistening Trump skyscraper looming over a small village in the Arctic territory."I promise not to do this to Greenland," he joked Monday.But on Tuesday, Trump abruptly canceled the visit, also by tweet.Trump wrote: "Denmark is a very special country with incredible people, but based on Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's comments, that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland, I will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time."He added: "The Prime Minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the United States and Denmark by being so direct.

                WASHINGTON - Two days after he said buying Greenland wasn't a top priority, US President Donald Trump canceled an upcoming trip to Denmark, which counts the mostly frozen island as part of its kingdom, after its prime minister dismissed the idea. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen had called Trump's musing about buying the autonomous Danish territory "an absurd discussion" after the former real estate mogul-turned-president began to talk up the idea. At a meeting on Tuesday in Iceland of the Nordic government leaders, Greenland Premier Kim Kielsen said Trump's idea "is not something to joke about". Trump said on Sunday that he was interested in such a deal for strategic purposes, but said a purchase was not a priority at this time. "It's not No 1 on the burner," he told reporters. Trump even joked about his proposal as it came in for ridicule, tweeting a doctored photo of a glistening Trump skyscraper looming over a small village in the Arctic territory. "I promise not to do this to Greenland," he joked on Monday. But on Tuesday, Trump abruptly canceled the visit, also by tweet. Just a few hours earlier, the US ambassador to Denmark tweeted that it was "ready for the POTUS @realDonaldTrump visit!" using an acronym for "President of the United States" along with Trump's Twitter handle. Trump wrote: "Denmark is a very special country with incredible people, but based on Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's comments, that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland, I will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time." He added: "The prime minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the United States and Denmark by being so direct. I thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future!" White House spokesman Judd Deere said later that the visit to Denmark has been canceled. The White House announced in late July that Trump had accepted an invitation to visit Denmark's Queen Margrethe and participate in a series of meetings, including with Frederiksen and business leaders. The trip, set to begin at the end of August, includes a stop in Poland to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the start of World War II. Trump is expected to go ahead with the Warsaw visit. Asked about Greenland on Sunday as he prepared to return to Washington after a vacation week at his central New Jersey home, Trump said "strategically ... it would be nice" to own the island. He also suggested he might not visit Denmark at all, saying he didn't think the previously announced trip had been "absolutely set in stone yet". Agencies - Xinhua (China Daily 08/22/2019 page11)
