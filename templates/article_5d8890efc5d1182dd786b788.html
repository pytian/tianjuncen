                 US Army General David Petraeus, the new commander of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan, eats bread at a bakery in Kabul. Ahmad Massoud / Associated Press File General David Petraeus shifts from Iraq to Afghanistan as another US president asks him to make an unpopular mission possible.A recent media blitz by the United States Army's public relations master sent a clear message: It's not time to hit the panic button in Afghanistan, but success in the nearly nine-year war won't come quickly.The appeal for patience by Gen. David Petraeus, made in a series of media interviews a week ago, also suggests he may propose that only a few troops begin leaving next July despite President Barack Obama's promise.That could force the White House to choose between the professional advice of a respected commander widely credited with turning around the Iraq war and pressure from some Democrats for significant withdrawals and an end to the unpopular Afghan conflict.That's a familiar position for Petraeus, a slight, blue-eyed man with still-boyish looks in his mid-50s, who has made a career of being easy to underestimate."He looks more like a bookworm than a warrior," writes Mark Bowden in Vanity Fair. "Cheerful by nature, he is eager to please and eager to explain. Petraeus is a world-class explainer. There is scarcely a soldier who has served with him who has not, in the general's own words, 'been PowerPointed to within an inch of his own life'."In September 2007, he arrived at Washington's Capitol Hill to face another crowd of skeptical Democrats, including then-Senators Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Barack Obama. The recently implemented troop surge in Iraq - launched after an agonized appraisal by President George W. Bush - was working, Petraeus told Congress in two long days of testimony. Violence was down dramatically, as former Sunni insurgents joined the campaign against al-Qaida.There was a good chance, the general told incredulous lawmakers, that US forces could stabilize Iraq long enough to begin a relatively peaceful, phased exit.Clinton told Petraeus that it took an "extraordinary effort" to accept his testimony, which she said required "a willing suspension of disbelief."Obama: "We have set the bar so low that modest improvement in what was a completely chaotic situation is considered success. And it's not. This continues to be a disastrous foreign-policy mistake."Biden: "Let me ask you a question: Can a Sunni Arab travel safely to a Shia neighborhood in Baghdad today without fear of being captured or killed?" (The general's answer was straight: "It depends on the neighborhood, frankly, sir.")If Petraeus didn't convince his critics that day, he has done so since. President Obama turned to the general credited with saving the US Iraq strategy to work similar magic in Afghanistan after the president ousted Gen Stanley McChrystal for a Rolling Stone interview that smacked of disrespect for the commander-in-chief.Although the Senate confirmed him in his new role by a vote of 99-0, his task now must seem like dj vu. Today, congressional support for the Afghan war is wavering. Last month, House Democratic leaders had to rely on Republican support to pass a nearly $59 billion measure to fund Obama's additional 30,000 troops in Afghanistan. Twelve Republicans and 102 Democrats opposed it.But Petraeus loves a challenge. A paratrooper by training, "Petraeus is no stranger to the idea of being dropped into difficult situations and relying on his own judgment to emerge unscathed," Al Jazeera recently noted."During his days as a cadet," reports Britain's Guardian newspaper, "his nickname was 'Peaches,' but his physical toughness was legendary. Before his present job, he had a penchant for challenging much younger men in athletic competitions."In 1991, Petraeus was accidentally shot in the chest during a live-fire exercise. He was released just days after surgery after doing 50 push-ups without resting in front of his doctors.That sort of showiness doesn't always win him friends, though it has helped to make the extravert general a media star.To bolster congressional confidence in the US campaign in Afghanistan, the media-savvy Petraeus chose to deliver his latest message through news organizations with significant audiences in Washington - including NBC's Meet the Press and The Washington Post."We are doing everything we can to achieve progress as rapidly as we can without rushing to failure," Petraeus told the Post. "We fully appreciate the impatience in some quarters."Meet the Press host David Gregory asked if the general might recommend that the drawdown be delayed if conditions were not right."Certainly, yes," Petraeus replied, saying Obama had "expressed very clearly that what he wants from me is my best professional military advice."Petraeus is celebrated in military and media circles as a "warrior-scholar" who modernized the US army's counterinsurgency tactics for the unconventional warfare of the 21st century. His biggest idea: "Secure the population and do it by living with the people."In Iraq, he drilled soldiers to present a kinder face to the locals. "The human terrain is the decisive terrain," he told Vanity Fair. He was appalled by Abu Ghraib, which he called a "nonbiodegradable" event that undercut winning the trust of the Iraqi people.Some sniping colleagues are said to refer to him as "King David" and "The Teflon General," the latter a pointed reference to his time running the US postwar occupation of Mosul in 2004-05. While his early assignments in Iraq are generally touted as successes in glowing press reports, the police chief Petraeus trained defected four months after the general left and the area has since become a hotbed of insurgency.Petraeus was also chastised by a much-admired Army colonel and ethicist who wrote to Petraeus before committing suicide in Iraq."I am sullied - no more," Ted Westhusing wrote before his death. "I didn't volunteer to support corrupt, money grubbing contractors, nor work for commanders only interested in themselves."The Army concluded that his charges against the commanders were unfounded. Petraeus would later attend Westhusing's memorial service back in the US. Last week, Petraeus supported a decree by Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who formally ordered all private security companies in the country to disband within four months.And while some of his fellow generals have groused about Petraeus' liking for the limelight, the Guardian gives the last word on that to Ralph Peters, a former US army colonel."Every guitarist is jealous of Jimi Hendrix," Peters says.Associated Press - China Daily

                    Warrior Massoud's image becomes Afghan icon

                KABUL - In Kabul, it is hard to miss the late Ahmad Shah Massoud.His bearded visage is painted onto blast walls across the city, his photo adorns the windscreens of pro-government forces. And a central roundabout bears his name.More than 17 years since his assassination, the fighter who battled the Soviets and the Taliban has become something of an Afghan icon.The feats of the "Lion of Panjshir", named for his home valley north of Kabul, has earned him a devoted following in war-weary Afghanistan.The most famous images of Massoud, with a beige pakol-the traditional Afghan woolen hat-perched on his head, can now be found on T-shirts, key rings and even coffee cups in Kabul's markets.Massoud gained fame for his military prowess, through which he kept Panjshir free even during the Soviet occupation (1979-89) and during the Taliban regime (1996-2001)."Every country has a national hero, and Massoud is known worldwide as our national hero. That is why you see his pictures all over the country," said Shamsullah Jawid, a former mujahedeen fighter who now is a Panjshir prosecutor.Massoud's only son, Ahmad, said his father's vision for Afghanistan was a "peaceful country with good relations between all ethnicities and neighboring countries".Massoud was the first to approach the Taliban to seek peace, said Ahmad, 29, who now runs a foundation bearing his father's name.The United States is currently leading a push to find a peace deal with the insurgents."Peace has not come and the struggles Afghanistan still face keep piling up," explained Ahmad."In this current situation they need a Massoud figure to be again their savior," he said of the nation's love of his father.Massoud was killed aged 47 on Sept 9, 2001 by a team of al-Qaida suicide bombers posing as journalists.His death came just two days before the Sept 11, 2001, attacks that would precipitate the US-led invasion to oust the Taliban, who had granted al-Qaida safe haven.Massoud has subsequentially been elevated to the rank of Afghan "national hero" by presidential decree.Viewed by the West as someone who represented moderate Islam, Massoud was in April 2001 invited to Paris and then the European Parliament in Strasbourg. But his story is not without controversy.In his youth, he studied with the Muslim Brotherhood along with other Muslim leaders that fought the Soviets, before cutting ties in 1978.His troops were accused of massacres and looting during the 1992-1996 civil war following the Soviet withdrawal. That war killed tens of thousands of Afghans and reduced much of Kabul to rubble.Massoud's legend owes a good amount to a few photographic portraits that capture the aura of the Afghan "lion" and are instantly recognizable, rather like those of Che Guevara.Yousuf Jannesar, an Afghan photographer, says he has "never met anyone so photogenic".The most famous images of Massoud were taken by French-Iranian photographer Reza Deghati, known simply as Reza, and by Hiromi Nagakura of Japan."He's the man who best embodies the most important word for Afghans: pride. He is the only person in modern history who represents the Afghan soul," said Reza, who like his subject, shares a passion for chess and Persian poetry.Every Sept 9, the anniversary of his death, crowds of pakol-wearing admirers, as well as politicians and a few diplomats, go to Panjshir to pay homage.In Kabul, followers shoot weapons in the air to honor his memory, an event that invariably results in locals getting wounded.Agence France-Presse
