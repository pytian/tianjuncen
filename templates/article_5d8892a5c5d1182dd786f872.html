                Waltzing to the very best of Austrian culture in Beijing
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a spring evening, 6:15 pm on a Wednesday, when Tang Ying, a woman in her late 60s, left her two-bedroom apartment in southern Beijing. A 10-minute walk led Tang to an outdoor pavilion in a neighborhood park, where she met a dozen men and women her age. They seemed like old acquaintances, exchanging casual, friendly greetings.Minutes later and with the help of a portable music player, Strauss's waltz standard The Blue Danube, filled the air. A lanky, gray-haired man held out his hand to Tang, and they, along with their fellow dancers, began to glide across the polished stone floor.By 7:30 pm, another ten or so dancers had joined, turning the open-air location into something of a ballroom.The get-together is now part of Tang's daily routine, what she described as "one of the most enjoyable moments of the day".Like Tang, an increasing number of Chinese people, young and old, have taken up Austria's Viennese waltz – each of them for different reasons."My love for the waltz dates to the mid-1980s, when the workers' union at my school organized regular ballroom dance parties at the weekend," said Tang, a retired math teacher. It was at one of these balls that she met the man with whom she would share her life.Ballroom dancing, with styles including the Viennese waltz, jitterbug, and rumba, was introduced to China in the 1920s in coastal cities, becoming particularly popular in Shanghai and Guangzhou.It wasn't however until the 1980s that the dancing gained true mass appeal.For whatever the reason – with anecdotal evidence suggesting that people began paying more attention to exercise since the outbreak of SARS in 2003 – ballroom dancing, the waltz included, has enjoyed a revival in recent years.In 2007, the Ministry of Education introduced simplified waltz dance steps to primary and middle schools across the country.Outside schools, the waltz coaching business is booming, with students of all ages paying around 300 yuan, or $44.7, for one-off, one-to-one classes, according to Wu Xue, a ballroom dancing instructor living in Zhengzhou, capital city of Central China's Henan province.Tang's passion for the waltz was reignited five years ago, when her husband passed away."Initially I danced to stave off the pain from the death of my beloved, and then I realized that the waltz helped me stay young even if I was growing old physically."Like most dancers in the park, Tang has rarely attended formal black-tie waltz balls. Unlike Europe and the US, ballroom dancing, in fact, seldom takes place in actual ballrooms in China."I am planning to visit Vienna in the near future, probably in February next year," said Tang, explaining that the waltz's home city celebrates its annual dance festival in January and February, with more than 450 balls taking place."I wish I would then have the occasion to dress up in evening gowns and rotate to the tune of waltzes in a ballroom."

                A life of silver linings
            </a>
            <p>
                After 46 years at the helm of Taiwan's Cloud Gate Dance Theatre, choreographer Lin Hwai-min prepares to pass on the mantle to the next generation, Chen Jie reports. When Taiwan choreographer Lin Hwai-min paid a visit to India in 1994, an elderly local woman predicted that the then 47-year-old Lin would die at the age of 72. When he returned home, he found out from his family that he would die at 72 according to his bazi - the eight-character system used in the Chinese lunar calendar based on the specific time of a person's birth. Was this simply coincidence or fate?  Dust, choreographed by Lin Hwai-min to Shostakovich's String Quartet No 8 in C minor, premiered in 2014. Photos by Liu Chenhsiang / For China DailyEither way, Lin says he is happy to accept this prediction, because "death is the most feared and uneasy aspect of life". "But when you know your time has come, it becomes something of a relief and only helps you respect life more," he adds. On Feb 19, he celebrated his seventy-second birthday. The day before, the Cloud Gate Dance Theatre, the company Lin founded in 1973, won the Stef Stefanou Award for outstanding company, one of the UK's national dance awards presented annually by dance critics from The Guardian and The Times newspapers. "It's the best birthday gift I could have received," Lin told a recent news conference in Beijing to publicize Cloud Gate's ongoing performances in Guangzhou, Beijing and Shanghai through April 27. "It means that I can retire without any regrets." In November 2017, he announced that he would step down as artistic director of Cloud Gate at the end of 2019 to make room for the next generation of talent. But before that, he still intends to present his 2014 double bill of White Water and Dust. "One is like lemon water, while the other is like vodka," Lin says of the two pieces. During a trip to southern Taiwan, he passed the Liwuxi River and was so impressed by the shimmering beauty of the water that he took a photograph of it. The black and white print of it inspired him to choreograph the dance piece White Water, which features dancers in white costumes conveying the movement of the ripples on the water's surface. Dust was inspired by Shostakovich's String Quartet No 8 in C minor. Lin says when he heard the piece of music many years ago, he was so "terrified" by its power that "his whole body shrank". He had not thought about choreographing the work until he visited Dresden, where Shostakovich composed the work in 1960, and dedicated it to the victims of fascism and war. In February 1945, when Allies British and United States dropped high-explosive bombs on Dresden, an estimated 25,000 people were killed and the city center, an acclaimed European cultural landmark, was almost entirely destroyed. Although both British and American military officials defended the bombing as necessary, the air raid is still regarded as one of the most controversial events of the war. "These days, the world is suffering from even more disasters. People feel helpless. The Diamond Sutra (Buddhist text) mentions 'particles of dust', and in face of such cruelty, humans are as fragile and insignificant as dust," says Lin. Born in 1947 in Taiwan's Chiayi county, Lin's initial passion for dance was awakened at the age of 5, when he saw the British film The Red Shoes. He was so impressed by the ballet sequences in the movie that he started performing them for his family. But he also showed great interest in reading and writing and published his first novel at the age of 14, and continued to enjoy fame as a writer in Taiwan in the 1960s and 1970s. He then moved to the US and received his master's degree at the University of Iowa in 1972. During his stay, he began to learn about modern dance. He attended a modern dance course taught by Marcia Thayer and a summer program at the Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance. In 1973, he established the Cloud Gate Dance Theatre, the first contemporary dance company in Taiwan. Lin said he once read in a history book that yunmen ("cloud gate") was the oldest dance form in China, with its origins dating back more than 2,000 years. Unlike most Western modern dance companies, Cloud Gate's dancers practice tai chi, kung fu, meditation and their early works feature stories about Chinese myths and legends. The company not only takes to the stage at regular theaters, it also performs for underprivileged communities in a range of venues. His 2013 work, Rice, premiered in a paddy field to an audience of farmers in Chihshang, a town known for its rice, in Taiwan. "I don't think elderly farmers found it difficult to understand my dances. Dance is all about movements and feelings - there's no paperwork or written test," says Lin. But his unique approach to choreography of course earned him much academic praise. Time magazine described Cloud Gate as "Asia's leading contemporary dance theatre" and his work Moon Water was selected by The New York Times as its best dance work of 2003. In 2005, Lin was named as one of "Asia's heroes" by Time magazine and in 2009, he was honored with a lifetime achievement award from the International Movimentos Dance Prize in Wolfsburg, Germany. In 2013, the choreographer received the prestigious Samuel H. Scripps/American Dance Festival award for lifetime achievement, the first dancer outside the US or Europe to receive the accolade. Previous recipients include Martha Graham and Pina Bausch. Lin remains humble and says he never expected to achieve major success. "I always feel grateful that people still like to come to my shows," he says. Lin suffered a bone fracture during a car accident in late 2016. Friends tried to comfort him by asking him why it happened to such a great choreographer. Lin says his reply was: "Why not me?" But that experience did convince him to slow down. Lin says he had been considering retiring for a few years, as he felt that Cloud Gate needed fresh blood to lead the company into the future. He says many contemporary dance companies fail or disappear altogether soon after the founder of the troupe leaves or dies, as in the case of Merce Cunningham and Pina Pausch. "I don't want Cloud Gate to become a museum for Lin Hwaimin's works," he says. "Young people live in the information age of social media and handheld devices. I could not create a piece using special effects created on an iPad, but a young choreographer can." After retiring, he will hand over his position to Cheng Tsung-lung. Cheng, 44, has performed internationally with Cloud Gate since 2001. He was the resident choreographer with Cloud Gate 2 between 2006 and 2010, and has served as its artistic director since 2014. Cloud Gate 2 was formed by Lin in 1999, with a focus on showcasing talented young choreographers and dancers from Taiwan. Lin says he will start a new life like any ordinary person after retiring, filling his days with cooking, washing dishes, cleaning the house, reading and watching soap operas. "I've worked flat-out for 46 years since establishing Cloud Gate and I only really know choreography. Now it's time to slow down and learn about ordinary daily life."

He has come to China many times as a judge for China's ballet competitions," says Xu. "His wife showed me her ring during our dinner, telling me that it was a gift from Bai Shuxiang."Bai is a former ballerina of the National Ballet of China, and she is the first Chinese ballerina who performs the white swan.This May, the 71-year-old Elizariev, will come to Beijing with the National Academic Bolshoi Opera and Ballet Theatre for two shows of Spartacus, on May 3 and 4 at the National Centre for the Performing Arts.The work, based on a ballet piece of the same title by composer Aram Khachaturian, tells the story of a gladiator, Spartacus, who is the leader of a slave rebellion against the Roman empire.

                A number of new musicians and music productions will make their China debuts at the upcoming Music in the Summer Air festival in Shanghai, which will take place from July 2 to 15.The MISA festival is an annual event that has been hosted by the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra and the municipal educational commission since 2010. This year, the festival will consist of 23 concerts at the Shanghai Symphony Hall and the Shanghai Urban Music Lawn, an outdoor music space next to the Shanghai Concert Hall.Among the acts to feature at the event, Swiss Conductor Charles Dutoit will collaborate with German singer Ute Lemper and the SSO to present the Chinese premiere of The Seven Deadly Sins at the Shanghai Symphony Hall on July 5.The satirical ballet chante (sung ballet) penned by German composer Kurt Weill in 1933, sometimes referred to as Weimar Germany's swan song, will be performed at the show. And Lemper is believed to be the best interpreter of Weill's composition, says Wang Xiaoting, the program director of SSO.Also premiering at the festival will be Raymond Yiu's work Xocolatl.The London-based composer, pianist and conductor is of Chinese descent, and the piece will be presented by the BBC Symphony, under the baton of Sir Andrew Davis on July 7.A cross-over festival that embraces music of diverse genres, MISA will this year present a world music concert led by Chinese pipa player Wu Man; a mandolin concert by musicians from Israel and an ethnic music concert from Syria, as well as Japanese taiko drumming troupe Kodo's new project Evolution under the artistic direction of master kabuki artist Tamasaburo Bando.After two performances on the Urban Music Lawn on July 12 and 13 in Shanghai, the Kodo drummers will head on to the Guangzhou Opera House in Guangdong province and the Beijing Tianqiao Arts Center for more shows.Meanwhile, Yuan-pu Chiao, a Chinese musician based in Taiwan, has adapted Edvard Grieg's composition Peer Gynt, and invited theater actor Wang Yaoqing to narrate in Chinese the 21 different roles in the play by Ibsen, to help audiences enjoy the music.The concert will be presented by the SSO under the baton of Zhang Jiemin on July 9 and will feature soprano Ma Qian.Speaking about how the event has evolved over the years, Zhou Ping, the director of the SSO, says: "It seems like only yesterday when we first set up the luxurious, large tent in the parking lot of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music."From the very beginning, we and the municipal educational commission founded MISA in order to engage young people and introduce them to classical music.

                True friendship between sister cities
            </a>

                By sharing stories in Seoul, neighbors deepen cooperation, communicationA friend in need is a friend indeed. And according to a South Korean mayor, this is an apt description of his city's relationship with South China's Guangzhou.The reasons are far more than the close pronunciation of the name of Guangzhou and that of Gwangju."When Gwangju was preparing for the 2015 Summer Universiade, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) occurred in South Korea and foreigners were kind of reluctant to visit our country," said Lee Yong-seop, mayor of Gwangju, the sixth-largest city in South Korea.But the mayor of Guangzhou led a group that visited Gwangju, proving to the world that "Gwangju is a safe city", said Lee. "Thanks to this, the Summer Universiade was held successfully."In return, the next year Gwangju sent a group of nearly 170 representatives from public and private sectors to Guangzhou, celebrating the 20th anniversary of their sister city relations through a variety of cultural activities. Guangzhou and Gwangju formed sister city relations in 1996.There is also a road outside the Gwangju World Cup Stadium named after the Chinese city to commemorate China's participation in soccer's FIFA World Cup Finals tournament for the first time in 2002.Lee was speaking on Monday in Seoul at a sharing event of China-South Korea friendly exchange stories. Organized by the Guangzhou Municipal Government Information Office, the event aimed to deepen the cooperation and communication between the two countries, while promoting mutual understanding among the people.Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, is the third-largest city in China. Guangdong's GDP is estimated to exceed 10 trillion yuan ($1.45 trillion) this year.About 15,000 athletes and officials from around 200 countries are expected in Gwangju for the 2019 FINA World Aquatics Championships during July 12-28. Lee said he hopes people from Guangzhou as well as across China can visit the city to watch the championships, while being immersed in the culture of Gwangju.Company representatives from both China and South Korea told their cooperation stories at the event.Son Young-jun, vice-president of South Korea's largest panel maker, LG Display, said the company has been investing in China since 2002. Today, LG Display has six plants in China, producing panels for a wide range of electronic products, from mobile phones and laptops to televisions."China is an important market for (the parent company) LG Group," said Son, noting the group's annual sales in China reached 250 billion won ($211 million) in 2018.In Guangzhou, LG Display's footprint can be traced back to 2006. In July last year, it opened the company's first overseas organic light-emitting diode panel factory in Guangdong province with a total investment of $6.9 billion.An artificial intelligence-based multilingual news anchor, developed by China's major AI company iFlytek, drew attention during the event. Wu Junhua, iFlytek's general manager of branding management, said the company formed a joint venture with leading South Korean software developer Hancom in March and is working together to launch a new portable translation device called Ginietalk Go soon.During the event, a book fair was held showcasing the second volume of Xi Jinping: The Governance of China (Chinese and Korean versions) as well as books on Chinese language and culture.A variety of traditional and modern Chinese and South Korean performances were also presented, including Pansori, a percussion instrument performance in South Korea; Cantonese Opera, one of the major branches of Chinese opera; Nanta, a Korean nonverbal comedy show; hip-hop dance featuring teams from both countries; as well as acrobatic shoulder ballet performed by award-winning Chinese dancers."When promoting the Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese President Xi Jinping has mentioned repeatedly that different countries should work and stick together in the times of difficulty... which means joint cooperation for future," said Mayor Lee. "I hope South Korea and China are not just neighbors in terms of geographical location, but can also become partners for win-win outcomes."
