                Zidane: Bale absent due to illness
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Zinedine Zidane is claiming Gareth Bale was scratched from Real Madrid's preseason friendly against Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday due to illness.Following the collapse of his proposed move to China, Bale did not travel to Munich for the Audi Cup match, which Spurs won 1-0 thanks to a first-half Harry Kane strike.British media reported Bale was fuming at the refusal of Real president Florentino Perez to approve his departure, with Chinese Super League side Jiangsu Suning wanting to acquire the 30-year-old on a free transfer.Zidane, though, did not link the Suning saga to Bale's absence, saying after the match: "Bale didn't travel with us because he didn't feel that well."The doctors said he was unwell and the best thing for him was to stay in Madrid. He's training individually in Madrid."Bale has been used sparingly in Real's preseason, last featuring off the bench in the second half of a 7-3 loss to Atletico Madrid in New Jersey last Friday.The 30-year-old, who has won four Champions League titles since joining Madrid from Tottenham in 2013, is out of favor with Zidane, who last week said it would "be best for everyone" if the Welsh forward found a new club.Wednesday's closure of the Chinese transfer window ended any hope Bale had of a mega-money escape route to the CSL.Tottenham, Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain have all been linked with Bale in recent months, but it would seem none of them are prepared to match the $800,000 weekly salary he's getting at Real.Pochettino prickly Meanwhile, Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino appeared to vent some frustration at his lack of input into the Londoners' transfer dealings.With a little over a week of the English transfer window remaining, Spurs have only signed two players - midfielder Tanguy Ndombele from Lyon for a club-record 65 million pounds ($79 million) and 10 million pound teenage forward Jack Clarke from Leeds United, who has been loaned back to second-tier side for the season.Chairman Daniel Levy, the man who oversaw Bale's then world-record sale to Madrid, has retained firm control of the Tottenham coffers throughout Pochettino's fiveyear reign at the club.Pochettino became prickly after the victory in Munich when asked about leftback Danny Rose's future and possible new signings, saying his job title should be changed from manager to coach as he has no influence over transfers."I am not in charge of this. I know nothing about the situation of my players, I am only coaching them, trying to get the best from them."Things that may or may not happen - sell or buy players, extend contracts or not extend contracts - it's not in my hands, it's in the club's hands and in Daniel Levy's hands."At the moment I am just managing the team in the best way possible."The club needs to change my title and job description, no? My job now is to coach the team. It's not a question for me, it's a question for the club and maybe they need to change my title."Asked if his role had changed recently, the Argentine replied: "That is not a question for me. I am only the person on the touchline managing the team. I don't have an answer. I can only tell you what is my concern."Meanwhile, speculation that Rose is looking for a Spurs exit could be wide of the mark, with the England international a surprise starter in Bavaria against Real, for whom marquee summer signing Eden Hazard underwhelmed.China Daily/Reuters

                    Bale nearing CSL switch
                </p>

                Welsh superstar reportedly close to sealing mega-money Jiangsu Suning dealGareth Bale is closing on a blockbuster move to Jiangsu Suning in what would be the biggest transfer in Chinese Super League history.Reports in Britain suggest Bale's representatives are putting the finishing touches to a three-year deal with the Nanjing-based club that could net the Welsh superstar an astonishing 1 million pounds ($1.24 million) per week.Time is of the essence, however, with the Chinese transfer window shutting on Wednesday.Both financially and in terms of star power, the deal would eclipse the CSL's biggest-name imports to date: Shanghai Shenhua's capture of Argentine Carlos Tevez, who reportedly earned wages of around $800,000 per week, and the signings of Brazilians Oscar and Hulk, who arrived at Shanghai SIPG for fees of $73 million and $60 million respectively.Speculation about the possible Bale fee varies wildly, with some reports suggesting Madrid might even allow the attacking midfielder to leave for free as it bids to rid itself of the Welshman's $800,000 weekly wage bill.Other reports suggest a price of between $50 and $60 million could be agreed, although Suning would have to pay double that because of the CSL's 100 per cent foreign-player transfer tax. All proceeds from this tax go towards developing youth soccer in China.Former SIPG technical director Mads Davidsen said of Bale's possible arrival: "I was at SIPG when we bought Hulk from Zenit St Petersburg and then later Oscar from Chelsea."We were among the biggest transfers ever in Chinese history but now it seems Bale would be. Not only in branding and reputation-wise, but also his level. He would be a massive attraction for football in China."Whether or not a deal can be completed on time, Bale's days at Real look numbered.The 30-year-old has had six trophy-laden years - including four Champions League titles - since signing from Tottenham for a then world-record $106 million in September 2013. However, he has struggled to endear himself to Madrid's notoriously demanding fans, while rumors that he has failed to integrate socially at the club have abounded in recent seasons.Bale was never a favorite of Zinedine Zidane during the Frenchman's first stint at the Bernabeu as coach. Things haven't changed since Zidane's return to replace the fired Santiago Solari in March, with Bale rarely named in Real's starting XI.Throughout Madrid's preseason campaign, Zidane has admitted that Bale is nearing an exit, with the relationship between the two seemingly beyond repair."We hope he leaves soon. It would be best for everyone," Zidane said after omitting Bale from his squad for a preseason match against Bayern Munich in Houston earlier this month. "We are working on his transfer to a new team."Bale has had some minutes on the pitch for Real since, however. He scored and missed a penalty in a shootout defeat to Arsenal and on Friday appeared off the bench during the 7-3 hammering to Atletico Madrid in New Jersey on Friday.If Bale does depart for Suning, it will likely have a significant knock-on effect in the transfer market, with Madrid possibly using funds generated from Bale's sale to launch a bid for Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba.

                A pair of mass shootings in less than 24 hours in the US states of Texas and Ohio killed 29 people over the weekend, authorities said.Nine people in Dayton, Ohio, were killed and 16 others injured early on Sunday in the second mass shooting in the United States in less than 24 hours, police said. The identity of the suspected shooter, who also died, was not immediately released, police said.The Ohio shooting came hours after a young man opened fire in a crowded shopping area in El Paso, Texas, leaving 20 dead and more than two dozen injured. Less than a week earlier, on July 28, a 19-year-old shot and killed three people, including two children, at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in Northern California.

                    Farm bureaus warn of loss of China business

                Ministry of Commerce announces China to cease imports of all US agricultural productsChina has announced that it will stop buying all US agricultural products amid growing trade tensions, a move that will hit American farmers hard, US farm bureaus are warning.China's Ministry of Commerce made the announcement on Tuesday after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose a further 10 percent tariff on $300 billion of Chinese goods starting Sept 1. This would be in addition to the existing 25 percent tariff s on $250 billion of Chinese imports.It also announced that it may impose additional tariff s on US farm products, in a move that will hurt struggling American farmers, warns Peter Furey, executive director of the New Jersey Farm Bureau."Both sides are feeling the pain, and unfortunately, American farmers are bearing the brunt of the adverseeffects," Furey told China Daily. "However a return to normalcy can be achieved, we would certainly like that expedited."China is the world's top buyer of soybeans. The country has purchased 14.3 million tons of last season's soybean crop, the smallest amount in just over a decade, Reuters reported. At least 3.7 million tons still need to be shipped. In comparison, China had bought 32.9 million tons of US soybeans in 2017 before the trade dispute.The latest escalation in tensions came after US President Donald Trump said last week that Beijing had not made good on its promise to buy large amounts of American farm goods. He then threatened to slap the new tariff of 10 percent on Chinese goods.An official from China's National Development and Reform Commission hit back, calling Trump's accusations that China had not purchased enough "groundless", broadcaster CCTV reported.China's decision to limit US agriculture imports will have a dire impacton farmers and deliver a "body blow to the thousands of farmers and ranchers who are already struggling to get by", Zippy Duvall, from the American Farm Bureau told Reuters. Larry Kudlow, Trump's chief economic adviser, said farmers would be given assistance. Trump has already compensated farmers with a $28 billion aid package. Last week, the US Department of Agriculture signed up farmers for a program that will hand out $14.5 billion.In that aid package, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the government will pay a minimum of $15 per acre to farmers hurt by the trade war with China under an aid package. American hog farmers also have suffered a loss of at least $1 billion in the ongoing trade war, Reuters reported. China increased its retaliatory tariff s on US pork in April 2018, and again in July 2019.Rachel Gantz, communications director for the National Pork ProducersCouncil, told China Daily that China was one of its top five export markets. "We continue to reiterate the importance of ending the trade dispute with China so US pork producers can get back to competitive access and more fully participate in a historic sales opportunity."Furey agreed, adding that most farmers just want things resolved:"Prior to the Trump administration initiating all of this, China was a very important, large market for American commodities, and American agriculture is an export-dependent industry. We produce far more commodities than our domestic economy can consume, and that says something because the American economy is so large."So, we depend on exports to balance supply and demand," he said."We had worked very hard to build that China market, and the Chinese and American commodity shippers were in a strong position with each other. … We would like to see a return to what we had achieved."
