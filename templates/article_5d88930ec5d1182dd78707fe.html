                Bengal tigers found in Tibet, with plenty of prey
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Chinese scientists have confirmed the presence of the Bengal tiger in Medog, Tibet autonomous region, with the first recorded images of the cat captured by camera traps. The scientists plan to investigate further to learn how many of the endangered animals are roaming the area. The Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) is found in a handful of Asian countries including Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal and China. The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates that there are now 2,154 to 3,159 Bengal tigers in the wild.

                    A Sherpa guide and summiteer of Qomolangma
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Seasoned mountain climber Lakpa Sherpa had made debut in climbing Mount Qomolangma by reaching the top of the mountain on May 23, 2010 from the Chinese side of the mountain by taking US climbers.Since then, the 28-year-old man has not looked back in his climbing career, reaching the top of the world's tallest mountain seven times already, twice as a member of the rope fixing team. He has already climbed K2(8611-meter) in Pakistan, the world's second tallest peak, twice from attempted four, Mount Makalu in Nepal twice, Mount Lhotse in Nepal once, all peaks above 8000 meters.He has climbed other mountains of Nepal below 8000 meters also reaching the top of Muztagata (7509-meter) peak located in western Xinjiang of China.Now, he is recognized as one of the safest hands in taking the mountaineers to top of high mountains around the world.During the course of his climbing career, he also took many Chinese climbers including some famous names to the summit of several mountains including Mount Qomolangma. He worked as a guide for famous Chinese climber Luo Jing when he led a Chinese expedition team to the top of Mount Manaslu in 2011. It was the first successful attempt on eight-thousander and later summitted all 14 peaks above 8,000 meters of the world.Likewise, Lakpa was the guide for another famous Chinese climber Yang Chunfeng to climb K2 in 2012. Unfortunately, Yang was killed in a terrorist attack in Pakistan in 2013 at the foot of Nanga Parbat, the world's ninth-highest mountain in the western anchor of the Himalayas, when an expedition team involving Yang was preparing to climb the mountain.Being guide to these famous names exposed Lakpa to the wider mountaineering community in China. Ever since, he has already led over 200 Chinese climbers to the top of different high mountains so far.Lakpa, who is now managing director of Pioneer Adventure, mountaineering and trekking company established in 2016, has maintained a very good client base in China. "My company has the largest client base in China. The Chinese climbers occupy 50 percent of my total client base in mountaineering," Lakpa told Xinhua in an interview recently. His company took nine Chinese climbers to the top of Mount Qomolangma this spring season.Lakpa feels that he has made himself recognized in China after working with many Chinese climbers over the years. In fact, it was difficult for him to communicate with Chinese climbers initially because of language. "I used to rely more on sign language to communicate with them," Lakpa revealed.Based on the advice of Chinese climbers, he learnt Chinese language which has been handy for him to communicate with Chinese clients. In his experiences, the Chinese climbers want Chinese food during the expedition on the mountains. "So, I arrange Chinese cooks for them," revealed Lakpa.In recent years, the number of Chinese along with Indian citizens willing to climb Nepal's highest mountains is growing rapidly. Most of them aim to reach the top of Mount Qomolangma.According to Nepal's Department of Tourism, it permitted a total of 67 Chinese nationals to climb Mount Qomolangma this spring season as they came third behind climbers from India (78) and the US (75) in receiving climbing permits.The department has not confirmed how many Chinese climbers reached the top of Mount Qomolangma. It said that a total 659 climbers and their assistants reached the summit of the world's highest peak."The number of Chinese climbers is still low compared to Chinese population," Lakpa said pointing out that there is a lot of room for Chinese market to grow for Nepal's mountaineering sector.Stressing on why Chinese market should be focused, Lakpa said that Chinese are among the climbers who spend lavishly for the guides. "They spend more than Western climbers in most cases. They also give handsome tips to their guides," said Lakpa.As he talks about attracting more Chinese mountaineers, he is against the call for limiting the number of climbers on Mount Qomolangma amid reports about traffic jams caused deaths of many climbers. In this spring season, eight climbers died and one went missing on Mount Qomolangma, according to Nepal's Tourism Department.But Lakpa does not agree that traffic jam was the main reason behind increased deaths on Mount Qomolangma this year. Instead, he blamed unfavorable weather condition, ill preparation and lack of experienced guides and climbers behind the increased deaths. "Many climbers don't listen to guide's suggestions not to climb despite their poor health and pressurize the guides to take them to the summit putting lives of both climbers and guides at risk," said Lakpa.Xinhua

                    Will Nepal be able to act as bridge between China, India?
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Nestled between India and China, Nepal is leaving no stone unturned to maintain smooth and friendly relations with its two Asian neighbors. Major credit for such an approach goes to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli who took charge of the Himalayan country in February 2018. Before taking office, India-Nepal relations were reportedly at their worse following the 2015 economic blockade imposed by New Delhi. However, ties with China remained friendly.The country, as Nepalese Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali puts it, “does not lean more or less on any one side. We don’t try to compare the relationship we have with our two neighbors…We want to benefit from their economic growth and development…We are conveying to China and India that a prosperous and stable Nepal is also in their interest.”Statistics too suggest that Nepal’s new foreign policy approach is mutually beneficially for all three stakeholders. The country’s market is freely open for both the countries. It has helped Beijing sell goods worth $2.7 billion to Kathmandu in the first 11 months of the fiscal year 2018-19. New Delhi’s exports to the Nepalese capital, meanwhile, stood at $7.8 billion.When it comes to foreign policy, smaller countries across the world generally share similar challenges. Nepal, which has an estimated population of 29.3 million, faces the double burden of geographical landlocked and a suffering economy. In such a situation, Big Brothers should ideally come forward and help the less-privileged neighbor stand on its own.The good news is that China and India, on their part, can also be seen reciprocating the goodwill gestures of the Himalayan country more enthusiastically than before. Both countries, for example, are pursuing separate projects to bring railways to Nepal. While the Indian government’s proposed project is set to link Barhni in northern state of Uttar Pradesh to Kathmandu, China has concluded a pre-feasibility study of the proposed $312 million Keyung-Kathmandu railway project that may take about two years. The projects connecting Kathmandu to both countries will not only bring more tourism revenue to Nepal, but will also turn it into a vibrant economic bridge between India and China.China’s multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which incorporates plans to construct a trans-Himalayan rail project, includes Nepal. Beijing recently vowed to provide 150 million yuan in assistance to the Nepalese Army over a period of five years for humanitarian and disaster relief equipment. Talks are underway to set up a Nepali-China joint-venture bank to facilitate easier trade between the two countries. At a corporate level, Nepal's Chaudhary Group recently signed a deal worth about $100 million with China's Huawei Technologies to bring 4G phone services to the country.Similarly, New Delhi’s foreign aid allocation for Kathmandu in the 2019-20 budget stands at 10.5 billion Indian rupees (over $153 million), up nearly 62 percent over the 6.5 billion Indian rupees (over $94 million) earmarked in 2018-19. India is engaged in creating a 900-MW hydroelectric project, Arun-III, in Nepal. New Delhi and Kathmandu are also allies in several road connectivity projects under BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation), SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) and BBIN (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal Initiative).The list of initiatives by India and China to boost the political and economic confidence of Nepal is extensive. Once barely registered on investors’ radars, these intiatives are helping the Himalayan country get out of chaos and upheaval and move towards growth and stability. With capital mainly flowing in from the two big neighboring countries, the Nepalese government is now seeking its inaugural credit rating. Kathmandu hopes to have a credit rating in place by the end of this year, as Moody’s Investors Service has already started accessing the market. Once complete, the chances of Nepal wooing foreign investments from varied sources will increase manifold.The multi-pronged foreign policy of Oli has the potential to turn the country’s geographical drawbacks into terrestrial advantages. Kathmandu has the potential to act as a bridge connecting the two fastest growing economies in the world, each having more than one billion people. This would also help the region achieve rapid development and economic growth.A handful of tripartite cooperation agreements between China, India and Nepal may further help in strengthening and maintaining relations.The author is a New Delhi-based senior journalist and columnist.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                    Over 100 killed by floods in South Asia
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                NEW DELHI - Torrential monsoon rains swept away homes and triggered landslides across South Asia, affecting millions of people and claiming more than 100 lives, officials said on Tuesday.The monsoon is crucial for irrigation and groundwater supplies in the impoverished region, home to a fifth of the world's population, and brings relief after the unforgiving summers.But the downpours, which stretch from June to September, can turn deadly and have wreaked havoc again this year across India, Nepal and Bangladesh, with people, dwellings and boats in remote low-lying areas washed away.At least five children drowned in Bangladesh on Monday, taking the toll in the country to 34, including 18 hit by lightning and seven who drowned after their boat capsized in choppy waters in the Bay of Bengal.Hundreds of thousands have been marooned by floodwater in the country's north, with one of the major Himalayan rivers, the Brahmaputra, over a meter above the "danger level", officials said.In Nepal, at least 67 people have died, although floodwaters have started to recede. Images showed rescuers using inflatable dinghies to evacuate families trapped in flooded houses.At least 1,445 people have been rescued and evacuated to safer destinations, according to Nepal Police in a statement.Health experts have warned of possible outbreaks of waterborne diseases and called for international help.Nearly 50 people have been killed in India, with two eastern states - Assam and Bihar, which borders Nepal - bearing the brunt of the deluge.About 4.3 million people have been displaced from their homes in Assam in the last 10 days due to rising waters across the mostly rural northeastern region, according to a government release on Monday.Photos showed residents crammed in boats carrying their belongings to safer areas in Morigaon, one of the worst-affected districts. The roofs of their submerged homes were just above water.So far, 11 people have died in the state and nearly 83,000 people displaced by flooding.Authorities also scrambled to reach animals marooned by the deluge at the state's World Heritage listed Kaziranga National Park, which is home to two-thirds of the world's one-horned rhinos.In Bihar, 24 deaths were reported, with 2.5 million residents affected.Among the dead were three children who drowned after they went to check the rising water level in a canal. Two others died while playing near a ditch filled with floodwater, the Press Trust of India reported.Television channels showed roads and railway lines in Bihar submerged, with people wading through chest-high, churning brown waters, carrying their belongings on their heads.The United Nations said on Monday it "stands ready to work with the authorities in the affected countries as they respond to the humanitarian needs resulting from this ongoing monsoon season".Agencies - Xinhua
