                A black box from the German Airbus operated by Lufthansa's Germanwings budget Airbus A320 crash is seen in this photo released March 25, 2015 by the BEA, France's Bureau d'Enquetes et d'Analyses (Air Accident Investigator). [Photo/Agencies]SEYNE-LES-ALPES -- French investigators cracked open the mangled black box of a German jetliner on Wednesday and sealed off the rugged Alpine crash site where 150 people died when their plane slammed into a mountain.The dented, twisted and scarred cockpit voice recorder was being mined by investigators for clues into what sent the Germanwings Airbus 320 into a mid-flight dive Tuesday after pilots lost radio contact over the southern French Alps during a routine flight from Barcelona to Duesseldorf. Germany's top security official said Wednesday there was no evidence of foul play.Helicopters surveying the scattered debris lifted off at daybreak to eye the craggy ravine. Emergency crews, meanwhile, traveled slowly over the steep, rocky terrain to the remote high-altitude crash site through fresh snow and rain. Bereaved families and the French, German and Spanish leaders were expected later Wednesday."The black box is damaged and must be reconstituted in the coming hours in order to be useable," French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told RTL radio.Key to the investigation is what happened in the two minutes of 10:30 am and 10:31 am, said Segolene Royal, a top government minister whose portfolio includes transport. From then on, air traffic controllers were unable to make contact with the plane.The voice recorder takes audio feeds from four microphones within the cockpit and records all the conversations between the pilots, air traffic controllers as well as any noises in the cockpit. France's air accident investigation agency released images of the orange casing, mangled and scarred from the impact.The flight data recorder, which Cazeneuve said has not been retrieved yet, captures 25 hours' worth of information on the position and condition of almost every major part in a plane.France's air force says it scrambled a Mirage fighter jet to the area when the flight lost radar contact, but arrived too late to help.

"I think the rewards were there for the team, individuals, the staff, myself and also the town and its fans.

                    Liverpool sacks manager Rodgers after derby draw
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Then Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers looks dejected during the Premier League soccer match against Everton at the Goodison Park, Oct 4, 2015. [Photo/Agencies]Liverpool terminated the contract of manager Brendan Rodgers on Sunday, just eight games into the Premier League season with the five-times European champions languishing in 10th place.The announcement came three hours after the team had drawn 1-1 at Everton in the Merseyside derby leaving them with only three wins from their first eight league games this term."Although this has been a difficult decision, we believe it provides us with the best opportunity for success on the pitch," the club's owners said in a statement."Ambition and winning are at the heart of what we want to bring to Liverpool and we believe this change gives us the best opportunity to deliver it."The search for a new manager is underway and we hope to make an appointment in a decisive and timely manner."Liverpool have only beaten Stoke City, Bournemouth and Aston Villa in the league this season and count a 3-0 thrashing at home by West Ham United among their early results.They also needed a penalty shootout to overcome fourth-tier Carlisle United in the League Cup at Anfield after being held to a 1-1 draw at Anfield after extra time.Rodgers, who succeeded Liverpool icon Kenny Dalglish as manager in June 2012 and came close to bringing the title back to Anfield for the first time since 1990 in his second season, invested heavily in new players before the latest campaign.Belgium striker Christian Benteke came in from Villa for 32.5 million pounds ($49.33 million), Roberto Firmino arrived from Hoffenheim for 21 million and England fullback Nathaniel Clyne joined from Southampton for 12.5 million.Liverpool made a positive start to the season but have since been thrashed at Anfield by West Ham and also lost 3-1 to Manchester United, their first half-showing at Old Trafford described as the worst in living memory.Draws against Girondins Bordeaux and FC Sion in the Europa League and lowly Carlisle -- despite the subsequent penalty shootout win -- proved to be the final straw.Rodgers, 42, has now become the seventh man to arrive at Anfield and leave without taking the club back to the pinnacle of English soccer which appeared to be their divine right from the mid-1960s to 1990 when they won their last title.

                    Sharpshooter Icardi drawing Ronaldo-like rave reviews
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                MILAN－Argentina striker Mauro Icardi is the golden boy of Italian soccer as much for his scoring prowess with Inter Milan as his colorful lifestyle off the pitch.The heavily tattooed 25-year-old from Rosario－also the hometown of Lionel Messi－followed the same route as his illustrious compatriot to Barcelona in 2008.He moved to Italy in 2011 to Genoa club Sampdoria before arriving in Inter Milan five years ago, taking over as captain in 2015.Icardi's positional instinct and lethal finishing in a championship renowned for its tight defending have garnered 116 goals for the club.Luciano Spalletti, who took charge of Inter a year and a half ago, said: "Icardi has no weakness, he is perfect. He is a complete striker and for his age shoulders so much responsibility."Icardi tied for the Serie A scoring lead last season with 29 league goals.He was named Serie A Footballer of the Year last week, the first player not from Juventus to win since Zlatan Ibrahimovic with AC Milan in 2011.The Argentine also won the best goal award for his spectacular backheel during a four-goal haul against Sampdoria last March.He gave each Inter player a Rolex watch to thank them for helping him reach the mark for the second time in his career. "Without you it would have not been possible," Icardi paid tribute to his teammates in an Instagram post.Inter was due to take on PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on Tuesday night in a crucial game for the Italian club's progress in the competition, which it returned to this season for the first time since 2011-12.Icardi scored his first Champions League goal in a 2-1 home win over Tottenham, but the Italian club lost away to the English side at Wembley, with both sides tied at seven points.Inter will finish second and qualify for the knockout round if it picks up more points than Spurs who manage away to group winner Barcelona.There has also been speculation about Icardi's future with the club should it fail to advance in Europe."I've always clarified my goals," Icardi said on the weekend."The first was to come back to the Champions League with Inter and we reached it, the second was to win something with Inter."But Inter's title hopes have also been severely dented after losing 1-0 to Juventus in Serie A last Friday, falling 14 points behind the champion. Napoli is the nearest challenger, eight points behind Juve.And Icardi has been overshadowed by the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo at Juventus, with the Portuguese star scoring 10 league goals to Icardi's eight.Neither shone in Friday's Derby d'Italia that saw Mario Mandzukic score the winner, and Icardi failed to record a single shot on goal during the match.His high-profile off-pitch life with wife Wanda Nara, the ex of fellow Argentine and Sampdoria teammate Maxi Lopez, regularly provides fodder for the Italian press.Argentine TV star Nara manages the interests of the striker, whose contract expires in 2021. Manchester United and Real Madrid are regularly reported as being interested in signing him. Icardi's contract reportedly has a $114 million buyout clause, the sum which Juventus paid Real Madrid for five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo."Icardi is on a par with Cristiano Ronaldo," said Nara. "He played three games fewer than Ronaldo, which is why he has fewer goals."Having not been selected for this summer's World Cup finals amid reports he was snubbed because of Lionel Messi's friendship with Maxi Lopez, Icardi has since been recalled by Argentina and scored his first goal for his country in a friendly win over Mexico last month.AGENCE FRANCE - PRESSE

                    Crime wave threatens to dent Barcelona's image

                An eruption of serious crime in the Spanish city of Barcelona is threatening to tarnish the popular tourism hotspot's reputation.The city's problems came to the fore on the weekend when Afghanistan's ambassador to Spain, Masood Khalili, was robbed by a gang of attackers who threw him to the floor and stole his watch. A 91-year-old French woman was also targeted on the same day, suffering head injuries when she was assaulted for her necklace. The incidents, along with the violent robbery of a German tourist two days earlier, prompted Barcelona's deputy mayor, Albert Batlle, to describe the situation as "a crime crisis".The incidents follow the death of a South Korean woman in June who had been with a visiting government delegation and who had fallen and struck her head when a thief grabbed her purse.The bad publicity from the incidents has cast a shadow over the city, which is known for its sunshine, beaches, bars, and historic culture.Luis Sans, president of a central Barcelona business group, told the BBC the situation "is out of control" while Andres Maluelda, from the law firm Molins, told El Periodico newspaper: "The legislative and judicial powers are not managing to provide a response to a specific problem in our society: repeated theft."He said a 2015 reform of the penal code means courts rarely sentence first-time petty criminals to jail time, and repeat offenders get the option of paying a fine instead of doing time if they are charged with stealing items worth less than 400 euros ($444). Much of the crime blighting the city is being blamed locally on unaccompanied children who migrated to the city, mainly from Morocco.Official figures show the crime wave is more than anecdotal. Crime increased overall by 9 percent during the first six months of 2019 compared to the previous year, and violent crime spiked by 31 percent in comparison to 2018. It has gone up by 60 percent during the last three years.To combat the problem and better protect Barcelona's 1.6 million residents and its 16 million annual tourists, the regional government has pledged 300 more police officers and additional patrols. Barcelona's mayor, Ada Colau, has also increased spending on law and order, by 16 percent last year and by a further 11 percent this year.But the problem is large. Britain's Sun newspaper said the city had 115,014 reported crimes between January and June, including murders, sex attacks, gang fights, and a spree of thefts on the metro transportation system.Spanish newspaper El Pais said the tally included seven violent deaths in a 40-day period and 11 so far for the year.The apparent breakdown of law and order prompted warnings to be posted in seven languages around the city's famous Sagrada Familia cathedral, highlighting cuts in police funding and warning people that their safety could not be guaranteed.The Express newspaper quoted Batlle, as saying: "Homicides worry us, but … Barcelona continues to be a safe city compared with Paris, London or Rome."
