                US announces to launch Space Command
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - The US government announced on Thursday to establish the US Space Command to defend its interests in space."This is a landmark day, one that recognizes the centrality of space to America's security and defense," President Donald Trump said in a White House ceremony joined by John Raymond, the first commander of US Space Command.Trump ordered the establishment of Space Command late last year, making it the 11th unified combatant command of the US Department of Defense.The newly established Space Command is built to "protect America's dominance in space" by "employing assigned forces from every branch of the military" and "delivering combat power by operating superior space capabilities such as communications, intelligence, navigation, and early missile detection and warning," according to a White House statement released on Thursday.The new command is believed to be a step towards building an independent Space Force, a plan that still requires Congress approval."As a unified combatant command, the United States Space Command is the next crucial step toward the creation of an independent Space Force as an additional armed service," said US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper on Wednesday in a press conference.

                US withdrawal from Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty a destabilizing move that will diminish security for all and undermine international stabilityWhat made the United States withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty - the only arms-control agreement between the US and Soviet Union (now Russia) to abolish an entire category of weapons system - on August 2?Was it to enhance the US' strategic advantages, provoke a reaction from Russia and China, develop military industries and boost the US economy? Also, is it viable for China to participate in INF Treaty negotiations, as sought by the US and Japan?The withdrawal is a result of the current world situation. The US and Russia had been accusing each other of violating the Treaty and the US had suspended compliance for six months now.As a first-wave offensive weapon, missiles can destroy enemy's command and communication networks, air defense systems and major arsenals in advance. What the US did in Iraqi and Kosovo testifies to the critical role of missiles.Although the INF Treaty played an important role in easing military confrontation between the two nuclear superpowers, reducing the possibility of war and safeguarding world peace, the US believes the INF Treaty tied it down in Europe, hindering its strategic advantage against Russia. After the withdrawal, it can deploy land-based intermediate-range missiles and boost its strength.The second consideration is to create new confrontation to consolidate its military alliances, which the US depends on to maintain its global hegemony. After leaving the INF Treaty, the US can deploy such missiles in its allies in Europe and East Asia, and so provoke reactions from Russia and China and create new "threats" to its allies. As a result, its military alliance network will be consolidated to combat this manufactured external pressure.Another rationale behind this move is to develop military industries and the broader US economy. R&D and large-scale deployment of intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles mean a huge boost to military industries. Increased military acquisition and arms sales will promote the national economy, another motive behind the US administration's decision.But the move will seriously impact world security, major country relations, international order and geopolitics.First, it will increase the risk of nuclear war. Missiles whose ranges are shorter than 500 kilometers are not likely to be used during war since they may also affect the launch country. Those with ranges longer than 5,500 km are not used either since the targeted country will have enough time to plan a counterattack. It is the intermediate-range missiles in between that are most useful and likely to trigger war, the reason the INF Treaty explicitly prohibits them.The Nuclear Posture Review published by the US earlier this year proposed production of low-yield nuclear warheads, just what such missiles perfectly match. If the US develops and deploys such ballistic weapons after the withdrawal, the possibility of using nuclear weapons in future wars will be raised dramatically.Second, such a move will damage the existing balance and stability of the international landscape. Russian President Vladimir Putin has already warned that if the US deployed missiles in European countries, Russia would target nuclear weapons at such countries. China would be forced to respond to installations in East Asia in order to safeguard its security.On Aug 3, US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said he wants to place intermediate-range missiles in Asia within months and that Europe is also a priority region. If so, its Asian and European allies would be caught in a dilemma. If they did the deployment under American pressure, China and Russia would take counter-measures diplomatically and militarily, creating new confrontation.Third, such a withdrawal after the US dropped out of a series of multilateral economic, political and cultural treaties, represents another blow to the current international order.The US and Japan demand that China should participate in INF Treaty negotiation. But this is not a viable option considering the current strategic landscape.International nuclear disarmament should follow the principles of "undiminished security for all and maintaining strategic stability" and fully accommodate various countries' different needs arising from their different weapons systems and means of safeguarding national security. It would not be in line with the above-mentioned principles for China, which only keeps the minimum strength to maintain its security, to enter a treaty now. Besides, China is committed to prohibiting and destroying nuclear weapons across the board. Countries who possess the largest and most advanced arsenal should step up their efforts to reduce their nuclear weapon arsenals to roughly the same level as other countries. Only then can the preconditions be created for other nuclear countries to engage in disarmament.The author is deputy director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

                    US tests new ground-based missile after withdrawing from INF Treaty
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - The United States tested a new ground-based cruise missile which can hit a target after more than 500 kilometers of flight, weeks after withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty banning such systems, the Pentagon said Monday in a statement.The test took place at 2:30 pm Pacific Time on Sunday at San Nicolas Island, California, said the statement.The missile "exited its ground mobile launcher and accurately impacted its target after more than 500 kilometers of flight," the statement said."Data collected and lessons learned from this test will inform the Department of Defense's development of future intermediate-range capabilities," it said.The United States will fully develop ground-launched conventional missiles after withdrawing from the INF Treaty earlier this month, US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has said.The collapse of the INF Treaty, which was signed by the Soviet Union and the United States in 1987, has triggered the fear that a new round of arms race is looming, many analysts say.

                    US missile deployment plan a dangerous miscalculation: China Daily editorial

            <p class="style-content">
                The Pentagon announced on Monday it had successfully tested an intermediate-range missile, the first such test since the United States formally withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed with the Cold War-era Soviet Union.In a Fox News Channel interview on Wednesday, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said it was intended "to deter Chinese bad behavior".This, along with his earlier revelation of the US intention to deploy ground-launched, intermediate-range missiles in Asia and State Department Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security Affairs Andrea Thompson's disclosure of consultations with allies and partners regarding such deployment, cannot but raise serious security concerns on the part of Beijing.China's and Russia's request for the United Nations Security Council to meet over the proposed US missile deployment under the agenda item "threats to international peace and security" is legitimate and justified.However, the present UN architecture is simply not designed for a dispute of such proportions. Yet if Moscow and Washington were able to sit down and come up with the INF Treaty at the peak of Cold War confrontation, there is no reason they cannot do it today. They are a much lesser threat to each other nowadays.China, an outsider to the INF regime, has refused to be dragged in and become a third party in Russia-US intermediate-range missile negotiations, as the premise and basis for trilateral arms control negotiations do not exist.Trilateral talks would be to no purpose since not only has the current US administration shown it is willing to tear up any agreement whenever it feels like it, but even if it did take part in them, it would be doing so in bad faith, since its true intention in withdrawing from the INF Treaty is to make the treaty no longer binding on itself.It wants to go all out developing cutting-edge intermediate range missiles so it can apply pressure on what it views as the unholy trinity of China, Russia, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and trigger a new arms race.State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday reiterated Beijing's resolute opposition to Washington's plans to deploy such missiles in Asia during his meeting with his counterparts from the Republic of Korea and Japan.Since Japan and the ROK, as the two major US allies in Asia, will be expected by Washington to play host to new US intermediate-range ballistic missiles, they should give careful consideration to the increasingly obvious fact that it is the outdated Cold-War and zero-sum mindset of the US that is the biggest threat to regional peace and stability.

                    HK, Macao garrisons of PLA rotate their troops
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison rotated its troops for the 22nd time on Thursday in a routine annual move meant to protect the special administrative region's prosperity and stability, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense said on Thursday.The annual rotation, approved by the Central Military Commission to meet Hong Kong's safety requirements, is in line with the Law of the People's Republic of China on Garrisoning the HKSAR, Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang said in a news briefing in Beijing.The new personnel had arrived at the Hong Kong barracks via land, sea and air. They had been trained and had studied the general situation in Hong Kong and relevant laws, according to Xinhua News Agency. The PLA Macao Garrison also rotated its troops on Thursday for the 20th annual time.Ren said the garrison in Hong Kong will carry out exercises and will resolutely follow the command of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Central Military Commission in fulfilling their obligation of defending the city in accordance with the law."For 22 years, the PLA Hong Kong Garrison has been a staunch guardian of national sovereignty, security and the people's interests," he said, adding it has the capability and confidence to uphold the "one China, two systems" principle and contribute to Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and security.Senior Colonel Liu Chaohui, deputy chief of staff of the PLA Hong Kong Garrison, told China Central Television on Thursday that the rotation will further improve the garrison's ability to fulfill its defense duties.The garrison will firmly implement the "one country, two systems" principle, the Basic Law of the HKSAR and the Law of the People's Republic of China on Garrisoning the HKSAR, and "resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests", he said.When asked about recent China-US military-to-military relations as tension rises between the two militaries, Ren said China highly values China-US military relations, but the United States must create positive conditions and opportunities for this relationship to develop.On Wednesday, the US guided-missile destroyer USS Wayne E. Meyer sailed within 12 nautical miles of China's Yongshu and Meiji reefs in the South China Sea, prompting the PLA Southern Theater Command to dispatch vessels and aircraft to dispel the US vessel.Senior Colonel Li Huamin, a spokesman for the PLA Southern Theater Command, said in an online statement that the US warship's encroaching on Chinese territorial waters is "provocative" and "has seriously harmed China's sovereignty and security interests, and seriously damaged peace and stability in the South China Sea region".Ren said the US military has repeatedly made the same mistakes in trespassing in neighboring waters and airspace of Chinese territory in the South China Sea. "China resolutely opposes these actions and urges the US side to immediately stop."Last week, the US State Department approved an $8 billion sales package - including 66 Lockheed Martin F-16 fighter jets - for Taiwan. Ren said the arms deal will not change the power dynamics across the Taiwan Straits and will only send an erroneous signal to Taiwan secessionists and put Taiwan in danger.In early August, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the US will soon put intermediate range missiles in Asia after pulling out of a landmark arms control treaty with Russia. Ren said the US exiting the treaty is a testament to its pursuit of unilateralism and dodging international responsibility."China adamantly opposes the US deploying intermediate missiles in Asia," Ren said, adding that such actions will damage the security interests of Asian countries and undermine peace and security in the region."We hope the US side can pay attention to its words and deeds," he said. "The Chinese military safeguarding its legitimate national security and interests is unshakable."

                WASHINGTON - The US government announced on Thursday the establishment of the US Space Command to defend its interests in space. "This is a landmark day, one that recognizes the centrality of space to America's security and defense," US President Donald Trump said in a White House ceremony joined by John Raymond, the first commander of US Space Command. "We are at a strategic inflection point where there is nothing that we do as a joint coalition force that isn't enabled by space," Raymond told reporters at the Pentagon. "I'm convinced that space is a war-fighting domain. I'm convinced that our way of life and our way of war depend on space capabilities," he said. Trump ordered the establishment of the Space Command late last year, making it the 11th unified combatant command of the US Department of Defense. The newly established Space Command is built to "protect America's dominance in space" by "employing assigned forces from every branch of the military" and "delivering combat power by operating superior space capabilities such as communications, intelligence, navigation, and early missile detection and warning", according to a White House statement released on Thursday. A US Space Command existed from 1985 to 2002, but was disbanded in the aftermath of the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks as the country focused on domestic defense. The new command is believed to be a step toward building an independent Space Force, a plan that still requires Congress approval. The US Space Command will soon be followed by the establishment of the United States Space Force as the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, according to Trump. "As a unified combatant command, the United States Space Command is the next crucial step toward the creation of an independent Space Force as an additional armed service," US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said on Wednesday at a news conference. One-year transition The US Defense Department officials had discussed Space Force legislation with Congress, sources told SpaceNews. The Senate proposed a one-year transition before standing up a new military service but the House required no such transition, according to the sources. The phased-in approach proposed by the Senate came amid concerns over excessive costs and the growth of the military bureaucracy. "There is no reason to believe that adding an entirely new Space Force bureaucracy and pouring buckets more money into it is going to reduce our overall vulnerability in space," said Senator Elizabeth Warren at a Senate hearing in April. "In order to achieve the intent of standing up the new force and executing the bill, additional technical and conforming amendments are necessary," said a US Defense Department memo. Last year the Pentagon elevated its cyber warfare operations to Cyber-Com, recognizing that online attacks and defense constituted a unique theater of combat. But Trump has a much more ambitious vision for space warfare. In June 2018, he ordered the US Department of Defense to create a much larger Space Force, a dedicated branch of the military equal to the existing forces, the US Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines and Coast Guard.

                WASHINGTON - The Trump administration will divert $3.6 billion from the Pentagon for the construction of the US-Mexico border wall, according to local media reports quoting House aides and Democrats on Tuesday.Defense Secretary Mark Esper called congressional leaders including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer on Tuesday to inform them of the decision to reprogram the money away from military construction projects and to the border, said a report by TheHill news daily.About half of the funding will come from military construction projects outside the United States and half will come from Pentagon projects within the country, according to a report from the Politico website.In response, Schumer said: "The president is trying to usurp Congress's exclusive power of the purse and loot vital funds from our military. Robbing the Defense Department of much-needed funds is an affront to our service members and Congress will strongly oppose any funds for new wall construction."President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in February, ordering funding from other federal accounts to build a wall along the US-Mexico border. Besides military construction projects, a Treasury Department account and Defense Department efforts to interdict drugs were affected by the presidential order, said local media reports.
