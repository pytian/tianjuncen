                Brazil reports record number of wildfires in first 8 months of this yearBRASILIA, Brazil - Record-breaking forest fires in Brazil's Amazon rainforest are dealing a heavy blow to Brazil and have evolved into a crisis arousing international attention.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on social media about the devastating fires that have devoured swathes of forests in the Amazon: "In the midst of the global climate crisis, we cannot afford more damage to a major source of oxygen and biodiversity. The Amazon must be protected."Earlier this month, Brazil declared a state of emergency over the rising number of fires in the region.The number of forest fires in Brazil increased by 82 percent from January to August in 2019 compared to the same period last year, the country's National Institute for Space Research, or Inpe, said on Monday.According to Inpe, 71,497 forest fires were registered in the country in the first eight months of 2019, up from 39,194 in the same period in 2018.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Wednesday blamed nongovernmental organizations for increasing wildfires in the Amazon rainforest in the country's north, but his claim was refuted by environmentalists, who argued that the surge of fires was a result of increasing deforestation and burning fueled by the government's anti-environmental policy.This was echoed by Inpe researcher Alberto Setzer, who told local news site G1 that all the fires are the result of human activities, while some were accidental and others were intentional.Calling the fires an international emergency, French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday expressed his concern over the rampant fires and called for a discussion of the issue at the upcoming G7 summit."Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rainforest - the lungs which produces 20 percent of our planet's oxygen - is on fire," Macron said on social media.Amid growing international criticism over the alarming wildfires in the Amazon, a vital bulwark against climate change, Brazilian President Bolsonaro on Thursday admitted farmers could be illegally setting the rainforest ablaze but told Western powers not to interfere.Bolsonaro said on social media: "I regret that Macron seeks to make personal political gains in an internal matter for Brazil and other Amazonian countries. The sensationalist tone he used does nothing to solve the problem."Bolsonaro also accused media organizations of exploiting the fires to undermine his government."Most of the media wants Brazil to end up like Venezuela," he said, referring to political and economic turbulence in the neighboring South American country.Problems 'exaggerated' Onyx Lorenzoni, the president's chief of staff, earlier in the day accused European countries of exaggerating environmental problems in Brazil in order to disrupt its commercial interests."There is deforestation in Brazil, yes, but not at the rate and level that they say," said Lorenzoni, Brazilian news website globo.com reported.His allegation came after Germany and Norway, citing Brazil's apparent lack of commitment to fighting deforestation, decided to withhold more than $60 million in funds earmarked for sustainability projects in Brazilian forests.Satellite images showed smoke from the Amazon reaching across the Latin American continent to the Atlantic coast and Sao Paulo, Brazil's biggest city, according to the World Meteorological Organization.Federal prosecutors in Brazil's Amazon region had launched investigations of increasing deforestation, according to local media. Prosecutors said they plan to probe possible negligence by the national government in the enforcement of environmental codes.The emergency has now transcended Brazil's borders, reaching Peruvian, Paraguayan and Bolivian regions.The Chilean government on Thursday offered support for Brazil in the battle against the Amazon forest fires that set in more than two weeks ago. "We have the experience, we have very good technicians, professionals and forest guards, and we have to be very supportive with a country that is going through a bad moment," Chilean Minister of Agriculture Antonio Walker said.Xinhua - Agencies

                    NATO members sign Accession Protocol for Macedonia
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                BRUSSELS -- Permanent Representatives of the 29 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on Wednesday signed the Accession Protocol for Macedonia.Following the signing of the protocol, Macedonia can now take part in NATO activities as an invitee, said NATO in a statement published on its website.The accession process now moves to the capitals of the 29 NATO members where the protocol will be ratified according to national procedures. The country will become a member of NATO as soon as all members have ratified the protocol, said the statement.Macedonia and Greece recently resolved their long-standing dispute when the former agreed to change their country name to "Republic of North Macedonia", clearing thus the biggest obstacle for the Balkan country's bid for NATO and the European Union (EU).Although the Greek parliament was due to ratify in the first half of February also FYROM's NATO accession protocol, according to the agreed timetable, majority of Greek citizens seem to have not yet been persuaded to accept a name containing the word "Macedonia".Around 69 percent of Greeks still oppose the Macedonia name agreement, according to a survey released on Sunday's "To Vima" (The Tribune) local newspaper.In the poll conducted by polling firm Metron Analysis, 71 percent of respondents said that they will be referring to the neighbouring Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) as Skopje, the name of its capital.Greece and Macedonia have been in dispute since 1991, when the former Yugoslav republic gained independence. Greece has objected to its neighbour's constitutional name of the Republic of Macedonia, fearing that the name indicates territorial ambitions over the northern Greek province of Macedonia. Greece's objection has impeded Skopje's bids to join NATO and the European Union.Under the UN-brokered Prespa Agreement in June 2018, Macedonia's constitutional name would become "the Republic of North Macedonia."

                    In Munich, China shows positive role in global politics
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                MUNICH, Germany - If the Munich Security Conference acts as a barometer to gauge world politics, this year has shown quite contradictory trends: confrontation and cooperation, and unilateralism and multilateralism.In a world full of uncertainties and contradictions, China showed itself to be a staunch supporter of global cooperation and multilateralism, and its efforts to maintain the world order have been endorsed at the security conference.WORLD ORDER UNDER DEBATE"The Great Puzzle: Who Will Pick Up the Pieces?" asked the Munich Security Report published ahead of the conference. Last year the report said the world was on the brink of significant conflict and predicted a new era of uncertainty.This time around it seems that the report went further, as it asserted that the world is returning to an era of great power competition.At the opening session of the conference on Friday, British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson accused Russia of making the world a less safe place, and German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen said Russia was dividing Europe.Meanwhile on Saturday, China said it hopes that the United States and Russia will return to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty.Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and also director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, made the remarks after delivering a keynote speech at the 55th Munich Security Conference.The unilateral declaration by the United States to withdraw from the INF Treaty has serious consequences, and has drawn widespread concern from the international community, he said.Contradictions also exist within the Western bloc. German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday advocated for cooperation and multilateralism, sharply criticizing the United States' policies on Syria, Iran and trade issues, while U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in his successive speech ran almost fully counter to Merkel.Igor Yurgens, chairman of the Moscow-based Institute for Contemporary Development, said right now it's more about competition than cooperation in the world, adding that diplomacy does not work, and people do not trust each other at all so that things are getting worse rather than better."Instability is increasing ... and unfortunately we are seeing multilateralism getting more silent," Finnish President Sauli Niinisto told Xinhua.Wang Yiwei, a professor specializing in international relations at the Beijing-based Renmin University, told Xinhua in an interview that cooperation and competition always go hand-in-hand, but right now due to some unilateral and protectionist acts, competition prevails.China clearly for multilateralismThe Munich Security Conference used to focus primarily on European and transatlantic issues. However, China has become a focus at the conference in recent years as it is playing an increasingly important role in global security issues.In his keynote speech, Yang, the head of the Chinese delegation, said unilateralism and protectionism have been on the rise and the multilateral international order and global governance system are being challenged."China advocates a steadfast commitment to advance international cooperation, uphold and develop multilateralism, and make the international order more just and equitable," Yang said. "History tells us that we can only realize our peoples' dreams for a better life by upholding multilateralism and enhancing global cooperation.""A very good speech," said Johann Wadephul, a member of the German Bundestag and deputy chairman of the parliamentary group of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union.Wadephul told Xinhua that Yang's speech seemed to advocate a multilateral system that he is optimistic would prevail in the world.Besides Yang, other Chinese officials, former officials and scholars also exchanged ideas with other participants and explained China's major foreign policies that welcome global cooperation and multilateralism, such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind.Wang said both China and Europe embrace multilateralism with the United Nations (UN) at its center. Both sides stress equal consultation and participation, rather than making decisions alone.China's role endorsed"On every occasion participants are talking about China ... which showed that China has become strong and is approaching the center of the global stage," said Wu Shicun, president of China's National Institute for South China Sea Studies, who took part in the conference.China is assuming more global responsibility during its development, such as its efforts to safeguard global peace and security through UN peacekeeping missions, including anti-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden."China obviously contributes its dynamic economy, participation in mutually beneficial trade, and its increasing wealth to international development, as well as its infrastructure development such as the Belt and Road Initiative," Alexander Vershbow, former deputy secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), told Xinhua."I think China is becoming a contributor to global stability. Although not every project is perfect, I think it is a net contributor to global stability through global engagement," Vershbow said."One of the things I would like to see is China becoming a more regular contributor to the world's public goods," said Charles Kupchan, who served as special assistant to former U.S. President Barack Obama on national security."The AIIB is such a public good," he said in reference to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) initiated by China."China has stepped forward, creating a vehicle for development assistance. It has evolved in a positive way. It's not really competing with other lenders. It works in many cases with the existing financial institutions," said Kupchan."The BRI seems to be a very serious initiative with a lot of investment and a lot of international efforts. It's a big project that many countries can take part in, including Russia," said Yurgens.

                    EU calls for calm, warns of US-Iran conflict
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                European leaders on Monday urged the United States to exercise maximum restraint toward Iran and avoid military confrontation as tensions in the Persian Gulf region continue to escalate in the last days. The warning came after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo paid a hastily arranged visit to Brussels on Monday and the news that four oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman were allegedly sabotaged on Sunday. Pompeo met High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini and some other foreign ministers of key EU member states. "Mike Pompeo heard very clearly today from us, not only from myself, but also from other ministers of EU member states that we're living in a crucial, delicate moment where the most relevant attitude to take, the most responsible attitude to take, is and we believe, should be maximum restraint and avoiding any escalation on the military side," Mogherini told a news conference on Monday. The US has stepped up its military presence in the Persian Gulf, including dispatching aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers. US National Security Adviser John Bolton, a hawk on Iran, said last week that any attack on US or its allies "will be met with unrelenting force". "I'm hearing little stories about Iran. If they do anything, they will suffer greatly. We'll see what happens with Iran," US President Donald Trump said in Washington on Monday. Mogherini said the EU is still gathering information and assessing the situation regarding the ship sabotage. "I confirm my worry about the risks of an escalation in a region that definitely doesn't need further elements of destabilization and tensions. Our call is to show maximum restraint from all sides." Mogherini, a former Italian foreign minister, expressed her hope for Iran to continue to comply with the 2015 landmark nuclear deal reached by Iran, the EU, the US, China, Russia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The US withdrew from the agreement last year and reimposed sanctions on Iran, including threat to cut Iran's oil exports to zero. The International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed that Iran has lived up to the deal in all its 14 reports. Mogherini said the agency is the only body entitled to verify the issue. She said that the EU and its member states are fully determined to do all they can and will use all their instruments to implement in full their part of the agreement as long as Iran remains compliant with the nuclear deal. The first transactions are expected to take place in the next few weeks under the Instrument in Support of Trade and Exchanges, or INSTEX, a special purpose vehicle designed to facilitate trade with Iran without recourse to banks, Mogherini said. Iran, which has grown increasingly frustrated with the incompetence of the EU and some other signatories to protect its economic interests, announced last week that it was preparing initial steps to distance itself from the nuclear deal. In Brussels on Monday, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas also expressed their concerns over the growing tensions in the region. Tarja Cronberg, a fellow at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, expressed that the US is acting unilaterally and is in breach of UN Security Council resolution 2231 which codified the JCPOA. "Despite US provocations, Iran has so far complied with its obligations under the resolution," he wrote on Monday in an article posted on the Atlantic Council website. But he noted that it is not possible for the EU to counter the US economically given the dollar's dominance in the world economy. "The EU has not dared to enforce counter-sanctions on US firms nor on those of its allies. INSTEX is as far as the EU would go," wrote Cronberg, former chair of the European Parliament's Iran delegation.

                    Moscow rejects Washington's nuke accusation as 'absurd'
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The United States' accusations that Russia has been carrying out nuclear tests are absurd, according to Russian diplomats, who said their country's adherence to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty won't change.The US Defense Intelligence Agency claimed in June that Russia had carried out nuclear tests and caused nuclear explosions.This document was issued as a follow-up to a statement by US Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency Robert Ashley, who stated that "the United States believes Russia is probably not adhering to the nuclear testing moratorium in a manner consistent with the zero-yield standard".Russia has strongly rejected Ashley's statement, and foreign minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the claims as nonsense.The US accusations of Russia's breach of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, or CTBT, is baseless, said Russia's deputy envoy at the UN Geneva Office Andrei Belousov, adding that US is attempting to use the accusation against Russia as a pretext for its withdrawal from the agreement."It would appear that through propaganda around false claims about Russia's compliance there are attempts to prepare international opinion for a US exit from the CTBT and then to blame Russia again for everything," Belousov told the Conference on Disarmament.He was speaking days before the deadline for a US withdrawal from the INF Treaty.The US is set to pull out of the INF accord on Friday, saying it needs to develop its own warheads to deter Moscow, although Russia says it is fully compliant and blames Washington for orchestrating the US withdrawal."I can say quite firmly that kind of trick will not work again," Belousov said.Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said despite the US accusation, Russia is not going to change anything in its policy.Ryabkov also stressed that there was a lack of trust between his country and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, so Russia was reluctant to accept NATO's pledges that its 29 member countries will not to deploy intermediate-range missiles after the treaty is terminated."The more NATO says it has no intentions, plans, the less we believe so," Ryabkov said.Robert Wood, US permanent representative to the Conference on Disarmament, responded that Russia's record of violating treaties was a well-established pattern."I have to respond to the sort of crafty, Soviet-like propaganda that was espoused earlier during the session by our Russian colleague," Wood said. "We've made very clear that we will abide by our nuclear testing moratorium."

                    Climate activist Thunberg to join zero-emissions transatlantic voyage
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish girl who inspired tens of thousands of people to join a climate march last year, has begun a world tour that will entail crossing the Atlantic Ocean on a zero-emissions racing yacht. She posted on Twitter on Saturday a photo of herself standing next to a train in Sweden saying she is "on the morning train to New York and Santiago de Chile". Her first stop is Switzerland, where she will meet hundreds of climate activists from 37 countries at the "Fridays for Future" European summit in Lausanne during Aug 5-9. It was a movement, also known as "school strike for the climate", that spurred her to begin protesting outside the Swedish parliament in August last year demanding immediate action to fight climate change. Thunberg will then travel to the United Kingdom to join German sailor Boris Herrmann and Pierre Casiraghi of Monaco aboard their emissions-free racing boat Malizia II to cross the Atlantic.   In the United States, she plans to attend the United Nations Climate Action session in New York on Sept 23 on the sidelines of the annual UN General Assembly meeting, as well as climate protests planned for Sept 20-27. US President Donald Trump in June 2017 announced the withdrawal the US from the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord, dealing a heavy blow to the global cause to urgently reduce carbon emissions, a warning given by many scientists. Thunberg also plans to visit Canada and Mexico before joining the annual UN Climate Change Conference (COP 25) to be held in Santiago, Chile, on Dec 2-13. "We are looking forward to seeing you and many other young people at the #ClimateAction Summit, @gretathunberg! Your generation has grasped the urgency of the climate crisis better than many others - it's time we listen," UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, a passionate climate change fighter himself, replied last week on Twitter to Thunberg's trip announcement. According to the German news agency dpa, Thunberg was offered a ride on the 18.3-meter racing yacht to be captained by Herrmann and Casiraghi. Her father, Svante Thunberg, and filmmaker Nathan Grossman, who will document the trip, will also be aboard on the transatlantic voyage. "I feel humbled that Greta accepted our offer as the lowest-carbon option to cross the Atlantic - despite the lack of comfort for her," Herrmann said in a statement. The racing boat is "outfitted with solar panels and underwater turbines to allow for a zero-carbon, trans-Atlantic voyage," said the statement. Thunberg announced in June she would take a year off school to focus on the fight against climate change. She has sparked a climate movement in Europe and beyond. She has spoken at the COP24 in Poland in December, the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January and the European Parliament in April. The climate activist was nominated in March as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. chenweihua@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 08/06/2019 page7)

                    Hurricane Dorian closes in on Florida coast after battering Bahamas
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                MARSH HARBOUR - Hurricane Dorian grew and picked up speed, churning on a path that forecasters said would come "dangerously close" to Florida later on Tuesday after the storm battered the northern Bahamas, killing at least five people.Dorian over the weekend was one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record, pulverizing buildings and flooding parts of the Abaco Islands in the northern Bahamas.On the US East Coast, more than a million people have been ordered evacuated ahead of its expected advance.The hurricane weakened early on Tuesday to a Category 2 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale, packing maximum sustained winds of 110 miles per hour (175 km per hour) and moving northwest at 5 mph (8 kph), the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.The NHC warned that Dorian remained dangerous as it churned about 105 miles (116 km) east of Fort Pierce, Florida. It said the hurricane was moving offshore, nearly parallel to Florida's east coast.In the Bahamas, Dorian lashed the islands, including Great Abaco and Grand Bahama Island, for about 24 hours. Aerial video recorded over Great Abaco showed widespread devastation, with buildings flattened or missing roofs and walls, boats upturned and shipping containers scattered about like toy bricks. Entire neighborhoods could be seen under water.The exact toll will not be clear until the storm completely passes and rescue crews can get on the ground.Theo Neilly, the Bahamian consul general in Washington, said the damage on Grand Bahama was expected to be "very devastating." He said many people were still trapped in their homes and attics because of a strong sea surge.Although Dorian is moving away from Grand Bahama, forecasters said dangerous winds and a life-threatening storm surge would persist through the evening.Iram Lewis, a Bahamian member of Parliament, said on CNN the death toll would likely climb."It is safe to say, unfortunately, that that number will go up," Lewis said. "It is just unbelievable."As many as 13,000 homes in the Bahamas may have been destroyed or severely damaged, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said.Abaco may require food for 14,500 people and Grand Bahama for 45,700 people, the UN World Food Programme said in a statement. The preliminary estimates were based on an assessment by representatives from Caribbean countries, the WFP and other organizations.The US military has been authorized to provide logistics, health and engineering support to the Bahamas for up for 14 days if needed, General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, the head of US Northern Command, told reporters on Tuesday.Efforts to reach officials in the Bahamas by phone on Tuesday were unsuccessful.Reuters
