                Elkeson's instant impact
            </p>
            <p>
                Brazil-born forward stars as Team China romps to morale-boosting win in MaldivesChina's controversial talent naturalization policy paid immediate dividends as Marcello Lippi's squad got its 2022 World Cup qualification campaign off to a flying start on Tuesday.Roared on by a large contingent of traveling fans, China's Brazil-born forward Elkeson proved the difference maker, netting two goals in his debut as the visitor romped to a 5-0 victory over the Maldives at Rasmee Dhandu Stadium in Male.China's other newly naturalized player, London-born Nico Yennaris, aka Li Ke, also contributed with a late cameo off the bench on a night when Lippi made good on his pre-match pronouncements that fans would finally see a more convincing performance from his charges.Elkeson, the first player without Chinese heritage to don the red jersey, took center stage on his historic night with his late brace capping an impressive all-round display.At the final whistle, the Guangzhou Evergrande star and Yennaris draped themselves in the national flag before soaking up an appreciative reception from hundreds of red-clad traveling fans."I am very satisfied with today's result; taking all three points is just the first step of our campaign for the tournament," Lippi told the post-match media conference after a win that sent China to the top of Group A."Elkeson's partnership with Wu Lei is a strong combination for our attack. His two goals in the second half showed his class and I am happy with the our overall fighting mentality today."After Wu Xi's 33rd-minute header broke the deadlock, Espanyol's Wu Lei extended China's lead on the stroke of halftime.Yang Xu maintained the momentum by converting a 64th-minute penalty before Elkeson's double rounded out the scoring.China will likely face a tougher test in its next match, when it hosts Guam in Guangzhou on Oct 10 in a group that also features Syria and the Philippines.The eight winners of each group and the four best runners-up will advance to a final qualifying round to compete for three direct berths for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.Having not qualified since a sole appearance at the 2002 finals, China decided to embark on the controversial naturalization route, copying the likes of Qatar and Japan.Despite concerns over the public reaction, the Chinese Football Association has targeted a total of nine players who are either already eligible for selection or are in the middle of the paper work.Still, the policy remains a sensitive subject."It's quite a struggle personally for me to consider to use naturalized players on the national team as I originally disagreed with this idea," new CFA president Chen Xuyuan said after being elected to the post last month."That's a compromise we had to make to realize our imminent goal of qualifying for Qatar. But it's not going to be part of our long-term strategy and we will only field a limited number of naturalized players as key supplements to our homegrown roster."After stepping down as China's coach following a failed campaign to reach the 2018 World Cup finals in Russia, Italian guru Lippi returned to the post in June, reportedly on condition that the CFA gave the go-ahead for naturalized players.The flair and goals that Elkeson's inclusion has instantly added up front will go a long way to silencing any opposition to the policy.Meanwhile, the sight of Elkeson singing the national anthem before kickoff and a video posted on Weibo showing his son cheering him up by saying "Jia You! Ai Kesen!" will no doubt further endear him to the Chinese public."It was a special day for my career to be able to suit up for a national team and to score for my adopted home country in my debut," Elkeson said through an interpreter after the match.The 30-year-old forward, who signed with CSL giant Evergrande in 2012 and has played a major role in the southern club winning three league titles and two AFC Champions League crowns, said he is learning Mandarin and is anxious to embrace Chinese culture.His Brazilian compatriot and Evergrande teammate Paulinho, who is said to be on CFA's naturalization radar, congratulated Elkeson in an Instagram post, saying "You well deserve it!", accompanied by a photo of Elkeson holding the national flag.Some fans, however, still remain opposed to the notion that a player with no family links to China can pull on the red jersey."I don't think it's a good idea to bring in players without any Chinese ancestry," said Zhao Wen, leader of a Beijing Guo'an fan group."Culture-wise and emotionally, it's hard for the fans to see Chinese soccer represented by totally non-Chinese players, no matter how competitive they are."

                Trump fires national security adviser John Bolton
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Tuesday he fired national security adviser John Bolton, citing strong disagreements on a number of policy issues.Trump tweeted that he told Bolton Monday night his services were no longer needed at the White House and said Bolton submitted his resignation on Tuesday morning. Trump said that he "disagreed strongly" with many of Bolton's suggestions, "as did others in the administration."Bolton responded in a tweet of his own that he offered to resign Monday and President Trump said, "Let's talk about it tomorrow." Bolton's ouster came as a surprise to many in the White House. Just an hour before Trump's tweet, the press office announced that Bolton would join Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a briefing.Bolton was always an unlikely pick to be Trump's third national security adviser, with a world view seemingly ill-fit to the president's isolationist "America First" pronouncements.He's espoused hawkish foreign policy views dating back to the Reagan administration and became a household name over his vociferous support for the Iraq War as the US ambassador to the UN under George W. Bush. Bolton even briefly considered running for president in 2016, in part to make the case against the isolationism that Trump would come to embody.Inside the administration he advocated caution on the president's whirlwind rapprochement with North Korea and against Trump's decision last year to pull US troops out of Syria. He masterminded a quiet campaign inside the administration and with allies abroad to convince Trump to keep US forces in Syria to counter the remnants of the Islamic State and Iranian influence in the region.Bolton was named Trump's third national security adviser in April 2018 after the departure of Army Gen. H.R. McMaster.AP

                Economic sanctions are human rights violations
            </a>
            <p>
                Anelise Borges, a Euronews international correspondent, told a tragic story from Tehran on Wednesday about a seven-year-old Iranian boy who needs a bone marrow transplant to cure a deadly genetic disease known as Andrenoleukodystrophy, or ALD.But due to renewed US economic sanctions imposed after US President Donald Trump withdrew his country from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the treatment was made impossible. The boy's health has been deteriorating fast. He has become nearly blind and deaf, can no longer walk and has to be fed a liquid diet.The family can do nothing but give the boy all their love. As a parent myself, it was heartbreaking to watch the boy's father, with tears in his eyes, describing his son's helpless situation.Covering the 42ndsession of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva early this week, I did not hear any condemnation of economic sanctions as a serious violation of human rights. But it is time to call it what it is.US leaders, past and present, like to tout the effects of their crippling sanctions on countries such as Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Syria. They claim that economic sanctions deprive some governments of the money to develop nuclear weapons, pressure their leaders to change course and defend human rights, freedom and democracy.I am not defending every policy of these governments. But the US and many other Western countries are indeed good at hijacking the moral high ground.What is true is that none of these sanctioned countries has surrendered to Washington after decades living under maximum pressure. In the case of Cuba, the US economic embargo has been imposed for nearly 60 years and is now widely regarded as a debacle, even among many in the US.When US economic sanctions cause skyrocketing inflation and unemployment in Iran and other countries, it is ordinary people who are collectively punished by the US administration.Iran's GDP grew 13.4 percent in 2016 after easing of sanctions as a result of the nuclear deal, but the World Bank forecast Iran's economy will contract 4.5 percent this year, largely as a result of renewed US sanctions.In an interview with Borges, an Iranian doctor talked about a shortage of medicine and medical equipment despite the fact they are supposed to be spared from sanctions. Most global companies, fearing potential US reprisal, have suspended business in Iran.If sanctions have worked as US leaders claimed, they have worked as a tool to impoverish the local population and deny them food, medicine, education and a normal life.The boy Borges discussed is just one of the tens of thousands of heartbreaking stories resulting from US economic sanctions. And if these are not human rights violations, what are they?So when US officials, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, say the US stands with the Iranian people, I doubt he dares look into the eyes of that boy's father.The international community needs to pay more attention to the suffering of ordinary people under harsh economic sanctions.Since 1991, the UN General Assembly has condemned the US embargo on Cuba every year. When the 74thsession of the UNGA opens in New York next week, there is no better time to look into the devastating effect on ordinary people caused by economic sanctions.Sanctions, though there are no bombs dropped or shots fired, constitute an act of war. And though it isn't a true shooting war, the damage done to innocent people is no different.The author is chief of China Daily EU Bureau based in Brussels.
