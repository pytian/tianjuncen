                             According to veteran diplomats, interactions between China and the US in Shanghai, and what they have achieved in the city in past decades, are part of the two countries' shared legacy and are lessons that need to be passed on. "But at the time, political support within the US toward developing relations with China was not very strong, and many US politicians were unable to observe China's economic growth and social changes that had taken place," Wu added. Yuan Peng, a leading US expert and president of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that despite the Taiwan question, many new issues that emerged - including the Korean nuclear situation, the South China Sea, global economic governance and climate change - were not included in the landmark joint statements issued by the two governments in 1972, 1978 and 1982

History was unfolding fast: In February the next year, US President Richard Nixon would visit China, followed two months later by a Chinese table tennis team's reciprocal tour of the US in April 1972.

                            A maritime expert said it's unlikely a judge would grant a petition by the owners of a dive boat to limit their financial liability for a Labor Day fire on board that resulted in the loss of 34 lives. Second, the court must determine whether the owner of the vessel had knowledge or privity of those same acts of negligence or conditions of unseaworthiness," he said.Martin Davies, a martime law professor from Tulane University, told China Daily that "on average, petitions for limitation succeed about 50 percent of the time in the US, but averages are of little help – everything depends on the facts of the case, and it's too early to say in the present case"

MPs are putting forward plans to change the outcome of Brexit ahead of a vote next week on British Prime Minister Theresa May's amended deal. She told MPs that she could not rule out the possibility of leaving the EU without any agreement, even though preventing that outcome is probably the one thing that a majority in Parliament could agree on
