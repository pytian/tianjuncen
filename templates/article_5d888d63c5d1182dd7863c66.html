                48 states investigating Google's advertising; Facebook probed on consumer data-handlingGoogle and Facebook have dominated internet search and social media for years, and now some states are saying they may be too big for the nation's own good.Attorneys general from 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have opened a probe into major tech companies, focusing on Google, which is owned by Alphabet Inc, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced Monday outside the US Supreme Court.A second group of state attorneys general, led by New York, is focusing on Facebook Inc, it was announced on Friday.Silicon Valley companies have faced a lot of pushback in recent years, whether it has been over data and privacy breaches or the companies' inadvertent roles in political discourse, to censorship, even to the price of housing in the San Francisco Bay Area.Their executives have not infrequently been called to Washington to testify about their various business or privacy procedures, and it's usually a bipartisan effort in the questioning.Paxton is leading the Google probe, which will focus on the company's advertising business.Google, which did not comment Monday, specifically has faced accusations that its web search leads consumers to its own products at the cost of competitors."There is nothing wrong with a business becoming the biggest game in town if it does so through free market competition, but we have seen evidence that Google's business practices may have undermined consumer choice, stifled innovation, violated users' privacy, and put Google in control of the flow and dissemination of online information," Paxton said in a statement.On Friday, Google, perhaps anticipating the state probes, posted a comment by Kent Walker, senior vice-president of global affairs: "We have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so," he wrote. "We look forward to showing how we are investing in innovation, providing services that people want, and engaging in robust and fair competition.California — where Google is headquartered — and Alabama are not part of the investigation.Several of the attorneys general in Washington on Monday called the investigation "preliminary", but said they expected it would expand to cover other issues, including data privacy.Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said the probe was "for the benefit of the tech ecosystem to help level the playing field".Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge called Google's online search engine a "juggernaut", and argued that free internet search sometimes comes at the cost of the freedom to choose the best products.US President Donald Trump has called for closer scrutiny of social media firms and Google, accusing them of suppressing conservative voices online.US Senator Josh Hawley, who as Missouri attorney general opened a probe of Google in 2017, lauded the announcement as "a very big day for the folks who care about antitrust enforcement"."I hope that Congress will get serious about acting. And I hope the United States Senate will lead the way there," he said.Facebook, which also owns its onetime rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has more than 1.5 billion daily users, has been criticized for allowing misleading posts and so-called "fake news" on its service.Will Castleberry, Facebook's vice-president for state and local policy, said last week that the company would cooperate with state attorneys general.Facebook recently paid a $5 billion settlement for sharing 87 million users' data with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.Facebook said it would do more to protect user privacy, but the deal was criticized by regulators and lawmakers for not doing enough to rein in the Menlo Park, California company's market power or make company executives accountable.Last week, Google's YouTube agreed to pay a $170 million fine and limit advertising on children's videos in a settlement of claims that the company violated privacy laws.Google also has felt the heat in the European Union, which has stricter privacy protections than the US. It was fined $2.7 billion in 2017, $5 billion in 2018, and $1.7 billion in March over antitrust violations.On the US federal level, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are probing Facebook, Google, iPhone maker Apple Inc and online retail king Amazon Inc for potential violations of antitrust law.Alphabet said Friday that the Justice Department in late August requested information and documents related to prior antitrust probes of the company. The company added in a securities filing that it expects similar demands from state attorneys general, and that it is cooperating with regulators.The potential penalties for the investigations into whether the companies used their market power unfairly include everything from breaking them up to large fines.US Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, one of the top-tier candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has vowed to break up Amazon, Google and Facebook if elected, to promote competition in the technology sector.Tech companies, however, also are some of the biggest political donors. Google spent $21 million to lobby in 2018; Amazon $14.2 million, and Facebook $12.62 million.Facebook co-founder-turned-critic Chris Hughes says the social media company has too much power over speech and that it is willing to "sacrifice security and civility for clicks".For an antitrust case to succeed, the government would have to take the company to court and win. It is rare for a company to be broken up, but Standard Oil in 1911 and AT&T in 1982 are two examples of major breakups.While any future fines from the FTC, Justice Department or state attorneys general could capture headlines, the major tech companies are the world's most valuable by stock market valuation and can easily pay large fines. They each have more than $50 billion in revenue a year.Democratic lawmakers in Washington have on several occasions suggested one way to address Big Tech's market power on social media would be to make it easier for consumers to move data like photographs and contacts from one application to another, potentially opening up competition.The idea, which is already part of European law, has the support of US Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, a Democrat who leads the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia.In the New York case, the state's attorney general said Friday: "Even the largest social media platform in the world must follow the law and respect consumers. … We will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook's actions may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers' choices, or increased the price of advertising," said New York Attorney General Letitia James.Joining New York in the probe of Facebook are the attorneys general of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, and the District of Columbia.Reuters contributed to this story.

                    I'm going to go on and on about goji berries

                One of the pleasant aspects of working at China Daily in New York is sampling some of the delicacies that pop up in the office, either when staffers return from China or when the goodies are cooked right here.There are the annual holiday servings of baozi and jiaozi and various treats containing bean paste. They all have unique tastes, and some are very sweet and high in calories. There is something comforting about the fact that China still boldly makes treats without regard to sugar and caloric content.The snacks also usually come in colorful, elaborate wrappers, which to me means that if the makers went through the trouble of packaging them that nicely, they must taste pretty good.Recently I got to try something new: goji berries, also known as wolfberries, along with cookie-type treats based on the bright fruit.Xu He, one of China Daily's website editors currently working in New York, gave me and other colleagues each a plastic, octagonal jar filled with probably a month's supply of goji berries. I plowed through almost the entire bottle in a few days.But Xu He told me not to eat more than 15 a day. She says they can "heat you up".I told her they reminded me of raisins, or at least orange-reddish raisins. Goji berries are not as sweet and soft as raisins, and they have a dry, chewy texture.Xu He had them shipped from her hometown, Yinchuan, the capital city of Northwest China's Ningxia Hui autonomous region. As she explained it, each province and region is promoting what it's known for to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.Ningxia has been growing goji berries for thousands of years. The region has ample sunshine, a swing in temperatures between day and night, and unique water quality. The geographical conditions and climate provide an ideal environment for goji growing.From January to May 2019, the export value of Ningxia goji berries reached 90.3 million yuan (about $12.8 million). Exports to the United States were worth 25.08 million yuan, up 57.4 percent."Goji has traditionally been regarded as a good health supplement by Chinese people. Almost everywhere we can see people carrying a glass of water boiled with dried goji berries," said Jia Dengqi, head of the Zhongning International Goji Trade Center in Zhongning county, in west central Ningxia."Demand for goji has been rising, and we have seen increasing numbers of buyers from overseas, including Japan, the United States and Europe," Jia said.What's more intriguing than goji berries? Snacks made with them.Xu He put out two bags of crunchy goji snacks in the office kitchen: "Bairuiyan Goji Leaf Tea Oatmeal Cakes" (green) and regular (red). I'll admit to "wolfing" down about half the bags.They are really tasty, and naturally, came individually wrapped.I am a goji berry convert now. I went on eBay and Amazon and ordered some.Why am I going on about goji berries?It turns out they have some pretty good health benefits: high levels of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, the latter of which help fight cancer; they supposedly can help improve eyesight, reduce blood pressure, control cholesterol and improve circulation.Goji berries have been commercially grown in the US for about two decades. In 2004, they were discovered growing wildly in Utah, and it turned out the discovery was near the site of an 1860s housing camp for Chinese workers who helped build the Transcontinental Railroad.One other claim about goji berries is that they can increase your metabolism, which facilitates weight loss.So could that explain why when I weighed myself after gorging on gojis I was 5 pounds lighter?

                    Wine firms languish in Colorado as trade spat continues
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                DENVER - Perhaps Colorado's best-kept secret is the North Fork River Valley, located in a remote central part of western Colorado, a place perfect for growing wine grapes.With its natural irrigation, rich bottomlands and mild climate, the verdant river valley is perfect for growing the quality wine grapes that have won Colorado vineyards several national awards.Even though the Rocky Mountain state produces a tiny volume of wine compared to industry giant California, growers are feeling the trade dispute pinch and seem to stand in unison supporting their embattled west coast comrades."Totally backward and destructive to the industry," said Colorado wine grower Alfred Peterson, of the trade dispute's impact on US vineyards.According to WineAmerica, a Washington DC-based group that represents wineries across the US, the industry's total contribution to the US economy in 2017 was around $220 billion. California produces about 85 percent of the wine made in the US.The United States, the fourth largest wine producer in the world, exported $1.46 billion worth of wine last year, over 90 percent of which came from California.With China only the fifth-largest importer of US wine, industry insiders told Xinhua News Agency that producers are missing out on untold sales to China's burgeoning, thirsty middle-income group of 300 million people.Since April last year, growers from Australia and Chile have seen China sales skyrocket as buyers in the world's most populous nation turn to more affordable brands."It has not affected smaller wineries, but it has hit the industry hard," said Colorado wine grower Ty Gillespie. "They're very worried," he told Xinhua.US global exporters view China as a barely tapped opportunity - one that now is slipping from their grasp. The Colorado wineries may be small and the distance far, but China and the remote Rockies have been connected by the tariff spat."Totally prohibitive," Peterson said of the Sept 1 expected tariff hike that will "eventually hit us as well".On the southwestern foothills of Grand Mesa, the largest flat-top mountain in the world, Peterson and his wife Pam ran the Puesta del Sol vineyard in 1995 and in 1998.Today, his operation produces 2,000 cases a year of high-quality pinot noir as well as Bordeaux style blends, the Alfred Eames Cellars' website said.As a state, Colorado is one of the fastest-growing wine areas in the country, and most of its wineries are situated at around 6,500 feet in the foothills of Grand Mesa, in the state's Western Slope region."Our volume has jumped to 12,000 a year - up 3,000 cases in just the past two years," said Carlson Vineyard co-owner Cailin Portra, whose vineyard is located to the north of Grand Mesa near the Utah border city of Grand Junction.Portra said that Colorado's Western Slope wineries have recently seen great growth and recognition, especially ones surrounding Grand Mesa.Now, Peterson has to pay an additional $800 "tariff tax" on his glass bottle order from China."I tried to order bottles from a US manufacturer, but they were twice as expansive and the quality was not good," he said.

                    Contemporary dance routine developing a fan following in the capital
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                In a spacious dance studio in the 798 Art Zone, located in the northern part of Beijing, 66-year-old Yuan Xiaofei closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Following the instructions of teacher Madison Hoke, an American dancer-choreographer, Yuan then stretched her body to portray elements from nature, such as wind, water and fire. Yuan, who recently completed a five-day dance course, which ran from Aug 17 to 21, says: "I learned that the course, which is called Gaga people class, is a kind of art therapy, which helps people recover from illness." Yuan has breast cancer and just had surgery for the second time in April. Yuan was among the 50 amateur dancers, who joined contemporary dance workshops in Beijing held as part of the ongoing New Dance Festival, which is in its fifth year. The festival is being held by the Chaoyang Culture Center and the Beijing 9 Contemporary Dance Theater. The event, which aims to popularize the art form, features Chinese and international dancer-choreographers who run workshops for amateur dancers of all ages. Hoke from Fairmont, West Virginia was in Beijing for two years as a dancer with Sol Dance Company from Israel. Hoke says: "The students are very interested in what we are doing and they want to learn more about their bodies and about contemporary dance." The language of movement called Gaga, was developed by the Batsheva Dance Company's artistic director, Ohad Naharin. It is based on a deep listening and awareness of the scope of physical sensations. "We encourage students to use rich imagery that stimulates the imagination while dancing. It's about the passion to move and it helps develop physical possibilities, like flexibility, stamina and efficiency of movement," says Hoke, who started to dance at the age of 5 and has been a certified Gaga teacher since 2016. Zhan Li, the executive director of the festival, who is also a dancer-choreographer with Beijing 9 Contemporary Dance Theater, says: "We invited Hoke to conduct one of the workshops because her method encourages people to move, whether you are a professional dancer or not. This matches with our goal for the festival, which is to engage more people in dance movements." "We've taken our workshops to many communities and schools. Contemporary dance may not appeal to mainstream audiences in a big way, but we've built a fan base thanks to our workshops." Born and raised in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, Zhan, 30, graduated from Nanjing University of the Arts and furthered her study at the University of Utah with a major in modern dance. In 2014, she returned to China and danced with Chinese dancer-choreographer Hou Ying, a former member of the internationally acclaimed Shen Wei Dance Art in New York. Zhan joined in Beijing 9 Contemporary Dance Theater in the end of 2015. Besides Hoke, the workshops also had Australian dancer-choreographer Paul Blackman, Chinese dancer-choreographers Tang Yupei and Chao Ken as teachers. Meanwhile, nine dance performances by artists from Spain, Israel, Albania and China will be staged in Beijing from Oct 8 to 15, and they are free to the public. One of the highlights of the October program will be the theater's latest work, Knot, which marks the theater's ninth anniversary. Barcelona-based dance company, GN | MC, will bring its latest award-winning work, Set of Sets, to Beijing. The work premiered in April 2018 in Spain, and involves repetitive and rhythmic gravity-defying movements while exploring the notion of time as a fundamental concept.

                    NY finds $1b in hidden transfers by family behind OxyContin
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                NEW YORK - The family that owns OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma used Swiss and other hidden accounts to transfer $1 billion to themselves, New York's attorney general contends in court papers filed Friday.New York — asking a judge to enforce subpoenas of companies, banks and advisers to Purdue and its owners, the Sackler family — said it has uncovered the previously unknown wire transfers among family members, entities they control and several financial institutions.The transfers bolster allegations by New York and other states that the Sacklers worked to shield their wealth in recent years because of mounting worries about legal threats.Scores of those transactions sent millions of dollars to Mortimer D.A. Sackler, a former member of Purdue's board and a son of one of its founders, according to the filings.They point to $20 million shifted from a Purdue parent company to Sackler, who then redirected substantial amounts to shell companies that own family homes in Manhattan and the Hamptons. Another $64 million in transfers to Sackler came from a previously unknown family trust, using a Swiss account, prosecutors said in their filing.The filing, made in a New York court, follows decisions by that state and others to reject a tentative settlement with Stamford, Connecticut-based Purdue, announced this week, arguing it does not do enough to make amends for the company's and family's alleged roles in flooding US communities with prescription painkillers.A spokesperson for Mortimer D.A. Sackler called the attorney general's contention an attempt to "torpedo a mutually beneficial settlement that is supported by so many other states and would result in billions of dollars going to communities and individuals across the country that need help."The transfers were "perfectly legal and appropriate in every respect," the spokesperson said.As part of the settlement, Purdue is likely to soon file for bankruptcy protection. But New York and other states have promised they will continue to pursue the Sacklers, alleging that family members drained more than $4 billion from the company over the past dozen years. The family has used a complex chain of companies and trusts to control their holdings, some located in offshore tax havens.The Sacklers had an estimated net worth of $13 billion as of 2016, making them America's 19th-richest family, according to Forbes magazine.In its filing Friday, New York told a state judge that the only way it can determine the full extent of those transfers is if all those it has subpoenaed are forced to provide documents detailing their interactions with the Sackler family."While the Sacklers continue to lowball victims and skirt a responsible settlement, we refuse to allow the family to misuse the courts in an effort to shield their financial misconduct. The limited number of documents provided to us so far underscore the necessity for compliance with every subpoena," New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a prepared statement.AP

                    Utah setting pace for win-win
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Many Utah business leaders and legislators are strong advocates for a close relationship with China, so much so that US Ambassador to China Terry Branstad, during a visit to the state in July, commented that other states would benefit by following Utah's example.As one of the Utah legislators with close ties to China, state Senator Jacob Anderegg also has strong personal ties with China.In 2005, Anderegg and his wife went to China's Peking University and University of Xi'an as part of his master's degree program."I was amazed how normal it was. Chinese people are very loving, very kind and were very gracious to us. They are very smart and inquisitive, too. I made comments to my wife that I feel like we are in the United States," he said.In Shanghai, they visited an elementary school where students were from the neighboring orphanage."The little 5-year-old kids put on some performances for us. We did a service project to repair the playground. I started to play with some of the kids and had fun," Anderegg said.Anderegg felt something else from that experience. "It was a strong feeling I felt; I felt the impression that said, you have children here. Later, I found my wife felt the same thing separately," he said.As a result, in 2011, the Andereggs went back to China and adopted a 23-month-old girl from Zhengzhou, Henan province. Two years later in 2013, they adopted a 2-year-old girl from Zhoukou, Henan."We have done enough research to know that if you adopt from a different culture, it's really beneficial that someone else in the family looks like them, who experiences a lot of the same things they experience," Anderegg said. "If you only adopt one, their transition into teenage years can be very hard. They are like sisters now, and I think they will be a great comfort to each other."Anderegg has three biological children and calls his family a "part-Chinese family". "They are our daughters for sure, but they are daughters of China, too. When they get a little older, will take them to tour and get to know China."In 2012, Anderegg, a Republican, was elected to the Utah House of Representatives. In 2016, he won a seat in the state Senate. As a member of Utah legislators' International Trade Relations Committee, his involvement with China extended into his official capacity, and he sought to strengthen the state's ties with China.In 2017, Anderegg and scores of other Utah officials visited China to promote the bilateral relationship."We were in Liaoning province. I could not believe the number of power plants built. We counted 17 new power plants. It's a testament to me that this huge middle class of China is coming of age from now to the next 20 and 30 years. Where is the world economy to go? It will not be US dominated," said Anderegg.Between 2005 and 2017, China's modes of transportation were transformed. "In 2005, most people had bicycles; in 2017, most people have cars. I could not believe the traffic," he said, pointing to another indication of China's economic growth.Utah has many ties with China as one of the top import sources and export destinations for the state. Utah is selling about 40,000 tons of hay to China daily, Anderegg said.In addition, Hong Kong-based shipping carrier Orient Overseas Container Line — one of the world's largest shipping companies — recently opened an office in South Jordan near Salt Lake City."China played an intricate role in Utah's railway construction," Anderegg said.The completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad took place in Promontory, Utah, on May 10, 1869. Thousands of the men who helped build it were Chinese immigrants."Now Utah is trying to set up an inland port and trying to be a global hub for trade. China again will play an intricate role," he said.More prominent is Utah's educational and cultural exchanges with China, Anderegg said. Almost every major university in Utah has 3,000 to 4,000 Chinese students. The state has the most and best dual-language immersion programs in the country, and Chinese immersion students accounted for more than half of that.Anderegg is quite proud of Utah's dual-language programs. "Within the next five to 10 years, when these students are headed to college and graduating, our ability to have an even closer relationship with China will be unparalleled because we have Chinese-language capability on a very technical level. We are preparing our next generation to have the ability to have a much stronger relationship with China and other countries throughout the world," he said.Anderegg considers the relationships at the subgovernmental level vital. "Those bridges and partnerships we can build between Utah and China, with People's Congress and the individual province governments, are vital for the long-term interest of Utah. It will ultimately benefit the country as well," Anderegg said.Commenting on the ongoing trade friction between the US and China, Anderegg said that it makes no sense to cut trade ties with China. "I don't think either China or the US is really served by allowing this to continue for very long. I don't think it's in either country's long-term interests to have an adversarial relationship."If we were to lose all the goods and services we receive from China, like cutting it out 100 percent right now, that would devastate our economy as well as China's economy. That does not make any sense," Anderegg said.

                WASHINGTON -The Chinese embassy in the United States has confirmed the bus that crashed near the Bryce Canyon National Park in the US state of Utah on Friday noon was carrying a Chinese tour group.The crash caused multiple deaths and injuries, the Chinese embassy said in a statement.The embassy has been in touch with local police for further details regarding the accident and has dispatched an emergency team to provide assistance to the victims, according to the statement.Earlier report: At least four Chinese tourists died in a tour bus crash near Bryce Canyon National Park in the US state of Utah on Friday, according to the Utah Highway Patrol (UHP).A total of 30 persons were on the bus, the UHP tweeted. "Four have been killed, 12-15 with critical injuries and 10 more with minor to serious injuries."The Chinese embassy in the United States has confirmed the bus was carrying a Chinese tour group into Bryce Canyon in Garfield County.The embassy said in a statement that it has been in touch with local police for further details regarding the accident and has dispatched an emergency team to provide assistance for the victims.The crash occurred on the state road 12 (SR-12), about 5.6 km west of Bryce Canyon, according to authorities and staff of the park.A Facebook post from the Garfield County Sheriff's Office said the bus was traveling eastward at 11:36 a.m. (1736 GMT) when it ran off the road and rolled into the guardrail.Three helicopters were dispatched and multiple agencies were involved, said the sheriff office.A video footage acquired by Xinhua showed the top of the white bus was smashed with one side peeled away. The footage was shot by a Chinese tourist on a bus passing by the scene. Screams and sighs could be heard in the video.The UHP said multiple air ambulances and rescue crews have been dispatched, and the SR-12 has been closed for investigation into the bus crash.The injured have been taken to area hospitals throughout southern Utah, and several were transported by an air ambulance, according to the UHP.The National Transportation Safety Board, an independent US government agency responsible for civil transportation accident investigation, tweeted Friday afternoon it was launching a team to investigate the crash.Garfield County Commissioner Leland Pollock told media that he felt terrible for those involved in the crash."This is pretty overwhelming for a little county of 4,900 people. This is just horrible for us," he was quoted by US media as saying.Some victims were treated at Garfield Memorial Hospital in Panguitch City, Utah, according to media reports.The hospital tweeted it has received 17 patients so far, three in critical condition, 11 in serious condition and three in fair condition."I grieve with all who lost loved ones in this crash and I'm grateful for the quick work of first responders, as well as all those who are volunteering to act as translators," Utah Governor Gary Herbert tweeted.Bryce Canyon National Park in southern Utah is known for its unique geology, according to the National Park Service website.

                    NBA and China: A match for the ages
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                As stars flock to endear themselves to huge fanbase, popularity of world's top pro league reaches unprecedented heightsKobe Bryant went to China for the first time in 1998, making the trip to Beijing to help operate an instructional basketball clinic for about a dozen kids.The local coaches working with him didn't know a lot about the game, and barely anyone noticed that an NBA player was in town.Basketball wasn't a big deal in China 20 years ago - but then everything changed very quickly.The footprint of the NBA has grown at an extremely rapid pace over the past two decades in the world's most populous nation, where more than 500 million people watched games last season and where one new streaming deal will pump $1.5 billion into the league's coffers over the next five years."When I first came here, I never thought the game in China would get to be this big," Bryant said. "But it has. And it's not going to stop."The possibilities seem endless.Could there be an NBA team in China despite the travel that would be involved? Might there be two-way player contracts between the NBA and the Chinese Basketball Association? What about the NBA constructing a team to play in China or the Chinese sending a team for a full season in the US?Farfetched as all that may sound, keep in mind that 20 years ago no one envisioned the NBA-China relationship to be this big - or that it would keep growing after Yao Ming's run with the Houston Rockets ended eight years ago.The NBA has academies in China now, and the Chinese national team returned to the NBA Summer League in Las Vegas this year."It's a good question," Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. "I think the next step will probably come when the next Yao Ming arrives. That would take it to a new level, more Chinese players to reach the NBA and make an impact."The marriage between the NBA and China is stronger than ever. League officials say more than 300 million Chinese play the game and 40 million are registered to play the 2K video game. Thousands showed up this summer just to watch the sons of Dwyane Wade and LeBron James play exhibitions with their high school teammates.The current trade war between the US and China could impact the products of the league's business partners. But basketball continues to thrive."I think sports transcends politics and I hope the NBA can continue to connect fans globally," Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said. "I don't have any reason to think our relationship won't continue to be positive."Nothing seems to be able to derail the NBA's popularity.The team the US sent to the World Cup in China didn't feature the NBA's biggest stars, but drew sellout crowds for every game. Coach Gregg Popovich was begged for autographs and selfies everywhere he went."We've known for a long time how big basketball has become in China, of course, but all over the world," Popovich said. "It's an international deal now. There are so many great players in so many countries. It's not a secret."Stars like James, Stephen Curry, and James Harden have a trip to China on their annual schedules - and when Wade, the recently retired guard who has a lifetime contract with Chinese shoe company Li-Ning, visited this summer one of his events had to be halted after about 10 minutes because the mall where it was taking place was overflowing with people.Donovan Mitchell of the Utah Jazz has been to China twice this summer, once to promote his brand, the second time for the World Cup with USA Basketball. He sees it becoming an annual stop for him, too - and believes there is no ceiling for the game globally."Man, I couldn't tell you where it will end," Mitchell said. "I think it's going to be even bigger and it's not going to be just China. It's going to be many more countries."The relationship between the NBA and China has been huge since I was a kid and it can only take off from there ... because the passion and love is so strong."It's not a one-sided relationship; China sees reason to invest in the NBA.Joe Tsai, co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, this week completed the purchase of the remaining 51 percent that he didn't already own of the Brooklyn Nets and Barclays Center from Mikhail Prokhorov in deals worth about $2.35 billion.In 2016, Jiang Lizhang, a businessman from Shanghai, bought 5 percent of the Minnesota Timberwolves, a stake he sold earlier this year.China also takes immense pride in players like Klay Thompson wearing Chinese brands on the court.Thompson has a 10-year deal with Chinese shoe company Anta for a reported $80 million. And China sent its national team to compete in the NBA Summer League in July, primarily to get ready for the World Cup but also to gain more exposure."I think it's good for our players and good for the team," China coach Li Nan said of playing in Las Vegas. "I think it's good for everyone."The NBA has opened three basketball academies in China and has seen very quick success with academies in Asia and Africa.The international influence on the league was more present this past season than ever.NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo is from Greece. Rookie of the year Luka Doncic is from Slovenia. The most improved player, Pascal Siakam, is from Cameroon. The defensive player of the year, Rudy Gobert, is from France, while the All-NBA center, Nikola Jokic, is from Serbia."This past summer, an NBA Academy prospect from China signed a contract with a National Basketball League team in Australia, becoming the first male NBA Academy prospect from China to sign a contract with a professional team," NBA commissioner Adam Silver said."And on the women's side, Han Xu from the New York Liberty, who trained at the NBA Academy in Shandong, China, became the first NBA Academy prospect to be drafted into the NBA or WNBA."It hasn't happened overnight.Former commissioner David Stern struck a deal with Chinese television to show games on tape-delay three decades ago, and once toyed with the idea of some sort of NBA-sponsored or branded league in China.Today, teams embrace the opportunity to participate in the preseason NBA China Games exhibitions because the exposure is worth the jet lag."When I have 76ers gear on and I walk through Shanghai, walk through Shenzhen, if I had a nickel for every time somebody said 'Trust the process' in perfect English I wouldn't be standing here working," Philadelphia 76ers CEO Scott O'Neil said, referencing the team's motto during its rebuilding phase of recent years. "We're very much a part of the fabric of China."None of this seemed possible 20 years ago or so, when Bryant made that first trip. Now fans can't get enough."When you come here, you feel it from the fans, their energy, people at the hotel, people just walking around," Kerr said in China during the World Cup. "Everybody just seems very excited about basketball."Same goes for the game's future in China.Associated Press

They come from Shanghai and the nearby provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang, according to a news report on the media website huanqiu.com.The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture and Tourism urged the travel agency to spare no effort in rescuing the injured and properly handle the follow-up matters.The Zhuyuan Travel Agency has organized a working group to rush to the scene as soon as possible and try to help the injured tourists. Phone calls to the travel agency rang unanswered Sunday morning.Five passengers remained in critical condition Friday night, and the death toll could rise, the Utah Highway Patrol (UHP) Sgt. Nick Street said.All 31 people on board were hurt. Twelve to 15 on board were considered to be in critical condition shortly after the crash, but several of them have since improved, Street said. Not everyone was wearing a seatbelt, as is common in tour buses, he said.The crash occurred before Friday noon on the state road 12 (SR-12), about 5.6 km west of Bryce Canyon, according to authorities and staff of the park.According UHP, the tour bus was eastbound on SR-12 heading towards Bryce Canyon. The bus drifted off the road to the right. The driver overcorrected to the left and the bus rolled over, during which it landed on a guardrail and then came to rest on its wheels blocking the westbound lane.The Chinese Embassy in the United States said the bus was carrying a Chinese tour group into Bryce Canyon in Garfield County.The embassy said in a statement that it has been in touch with local police for further details regarding the accident and has dispatched an emergency team to provide assistance for the victims.Three helicopters were dispatched and multiple agencies were involved, said the Garfield County Sheriff's Office.A video footage acquired by Xinhua showed the top of the white bus was smashed with one side peeled away. The footage was shot by a Chinese tourist on a bus passing by the scene. Screams and sighs could be heard in the video.The UHP said multiple air ambulances and rescue crews have been dispatched.The injured have been taken to area hospitals throughout southern Utah, and several were transported by an air ambulance, according to the UHP.The National Transportation Safety Board, an independent US government agency responsible for civil transportation accident investigation, tweeted Friday afternoon it was launching a team to investigate the crash.Garfield County Commissioner Leland Pollock told media that he felt terrible for those involved in the crash."This is pretty overwhelming for a little county of 4,900 people. This is just horrible for us," he was quoted by US media as saying.Some victims were treated at Garfield Memorial Hospital in Panguitch City, Utah, according to media reports.The hospital tweeted Friday night it has received 19 patients so far, among whom 11 have been transferred, one admitted and seven discharged."I grieve with all who lost loved ones in this crash and I'm grateful for the quick work of first responders, as well as all those who are volunteering to act as translators," Utah Governor Gary Herbert tweeted.Bryce Canyon National Park in southern Utah is known for its unique geology, according to the National Park Service website.AP - Xinhua
