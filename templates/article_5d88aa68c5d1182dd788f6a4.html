                Former revolutionary base becomes tourism magnet
            </a>
            <p>
                In the western suburbs of Beijing, Xiangshan Park, or the Fragrant Hills, is known as a prime place in China for viewing autumn foliage.Now the red leaves have another meaning. More people have realized they symbolize the country's revolutionary years as eight revolutionary memorial sites in the area opened to the public. It has become a magnet for tourists who want to view historical relics and related cultural information.In March 1949, the Communist Party of China Central Committee had its headquarters in the Fragrant Hills. Chairman Mao Zedong lived in Shuangqing Villa from which he directed the military campaign that sent soldiers across the Yangtze River and led to the collapse of the Kuomintang regime.

                PM 2.5 in Beijing drops to record low in August
            </a>
            <p>
                The average concentration of PM 2.5 - fine particulate matter that is hazardous to human health - in Beijing dropped to 23 micrograms per cubic meter in August, a record low in history since monitoring, the Beijing Municipal Ecological Environment Bureau said on Thursday.In fact, it was the first time Beijing's PM 2.5 level went below 30 micrograms per cubic meter, data from the bureau showed.In addition, the average concentration of PM 2.5 in the first eight months was 42 micrograms per cu m, which was also a record low.During the first eight months, Beijing saw 150 days with good air quality. Only three days were reported to have severe air pollution, five less compared with the same period last year.Meanwhile the government warned of the increasing possibilities and challenges of worsening air quality in the coming autumn and winter due to disadvantageous weather to disperse the pollutants and increasing emission levels.
