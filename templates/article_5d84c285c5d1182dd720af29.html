            <p>
                Shanghai will strive to equip every sub-district and town with at least one childcare center that is accessible and affordable for all kids aged 3 and under within three years, Chen Qun, the city's vice-mayor, said on Friday.Chen also pointed out that the city's gross enrollment rate for kindergartens has reached 97 percent, achieving the national target - 85 percent by 2020 - ahead of schedule. The situation will be further improved in the next three years to ensure that 99 percent of local children receive preschool education.Meanwhile, the scale of enrollment for university students majoring in preschool education in the city will be further expanded. The aim is to enroll more than 3,000 of these students every year.The city also expects more than 80 percent of full-time kindergarten teachers to receive undergraduate education, which would in turn enhance the quality of education.Furthermore, the government will strive to ensure that every kindergarten would have at least one senior teacher, and that the number of the intermediate and senior educators account for at least 28 percent of the staff.

                Beijing Nanyuan Airport poised to close its doors
            </a>
            <p>
                Throwing a "happy funeral" is a tradition in China to commemorate a person who has lived to a ripe old age and died peacefully from natural causes.It is a time to be joyful, a celebration of life and a blessing for the surviving family members.The case for holding such a funeral can be made for Beijing Nanyuan Airport, China's oldest, which will cease public operations before Sept 30 with the opening of Beijing Daxing International Airport.Nanyuan has been witness to rapid developments in the nation's aviation industry over the past century.Opened in 1910 during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), it has long served as both a military and commercial airport. In 1986, it became the main hub for China United Airlines after serving the military for decades. The airline was established under the administration of the People's Liberation Army Air Force, connecting revolutionary base areas and border cities.Located in Fengtai district, 13 kilometers south of Tian'anmen Square, Nanyuan is much closer to downtown than is Beijing Capital International Airport. However, its outdated and even shabby facilities have turned off many passengers.

                Jinan's springs soak up global attention
            </a>
            <p>
                Region's famous natural assets remain top priority for preservation As the sun rose on a warm September morning at Black Tiger Spring in Jinan, East China's Shandong province, groups of people wait in line to fill their buckets with fresh spring water gushing out from the rocks. Using spring water to cook, wash and drink is the local way in Jinan, which makes the "city of springs" so special to visitors from home and abroad. Jinan has more than 800 springs, including 72 famous ones such as Baotu Spring, Black Tiger Spring, Moquan Spring and Shuyu Spring. Black Tiger Spring is located below a steep cliff in the city's Lixia district. The water laps the rocks, creating a sound like a tiger's growl. The water outflow reaches up to 41,000 cubic meters per day, less only than the nearby Baotu Spring. In June 2019, the cultural landscape of springs in Jinan was included on a tentative list of new Chinese World Heritage sites. "For hundreds of years, people have lived with springs. The city is energized by springs," said Sun Shutao, mayor of Jinan, at the 2019 International Spring Cultural Landscape City Alliance Conference held earlier this month. "The unique natural landscape and culture is an example of humans respecting nature and realizing sustainable development," he said. Jinan is also home to Daming Lake, which is formed solely by springs, and home to the spring water city moat. In olden times, residents even had springs in their own yards. Long Yongtu, former vice-minister of the then Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said at the conference that Jinan reminds him of the French town of Evian, where residents and tourists happily fill up empty bottles with water from springs. Nowadays, people ask for cleaner water, clearer skies, safer food and more convenient transport, in seeking a higher quality of life. That's why Jinan puts so much effort into preserving its springs, as historical heritage and urban cultural landscape, Long added. The city also considers the protection of its springs while planning and constructing its subway system and renovating old communities, according to Sun. Rick Jennings, a councilor from the city of Sacramento in California, said at the event: "I've watched the children and old people in Jinan. They take pride in how they continue to take advantage of the city's resources. I've seen so many people visiting the parks and being able to use the water. That's a memory I will have for the rest of my life." The conference coincided with the seventh Jinan international springs festival, held from Sept 6 to 11, and was accompanied by a series of activities, including a spring worshipping ceremony, a music festival, a folk arts week, a night tour and float parade. During the festival, journalists from 12 media agencies in countries including the United States, Russia, Cambodia, Mongolia, Laos, South Korea and Japan toured the city as participants of the Discover Jinan media trip, co-organized by the foreign affairs office of the Jinan municipal people's government and China Daily. The group visited the 648-year-old Mingfucheng Historical Area, which has over 100 springs, and Baihuazhou Historical and Cultural Block, which features some of the 126 intangible cultural heritage and traditional handicrafts of the city, as well as about 100 inheritors, including those of shadow puppetry, paper-cutting, wood carving and clay rabbit figurine making. Li Juan, an inheritor of shadow puppetry, said the art form remains popular even in the digital age, with children learning and taking courses. She said that the government has supported her work with its effort to preserve traditional culture. Kristina Zorkina, an editor from ITAR-TASS news agency in Russia, said in her country they have a similar art form, but the puppets are made from different materials. Muhammad Imran, a reporter from Dawn News in Pakistan, said he had also seen similar puppetry when he was younger, but it is no longer popular in his home country. According to Mayor Sun, the city of Jinan is promoting its intangible cultural heritage by financing major cultural programs, holding courses in communities and schools and encouraging heritage to go global. chenmeiling@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily 09/20/2019 page12)

                AnhuiPlastic bag mistaken for 'water monster'An official, surnamed Yang, from the Chizhou ferry administrative office has confirmed that the "water monster", which was seen "swimming" in an online video, is actually a big black plastic bag in the middle of the Yangtze River. The plastic bag was blocked by a stone in the middle of the river, and looked as if it was "swimming" in the flowing water. Many netizens commented that it looked like a big fish, snake, eel or Chinese sturgeon after seeing the video online. The video was shot and published on WeChat by a tourist who found the "water monster". Yang refuted rumors online that there was a "water monster" in the river.

                BEIJING NANYUAN AIRPORT POISED TO CLOSE ITS DOORS
            </a>
            <p>
                Facility witnesses rapid change in nation's aviation industry Throwing a "happy funeral" is a tradition in China to commemorate a person who has lived to a ripe old age and died peacefully from natural causes. It is a time to be joyful, a celebration of life and a blessing for the descendants of the deceased. The case for holding such a funeral can be made for Beijing Nanyuan Airport, China's oldest, which will cease public operations before Sept 30 with the opening of Beijing Daxing International Airport. Nanyuan Airport has witnessed rapid developments in the nation's aviation industry over the past century. Built in 1910 during the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), it has long served as a military and commercial airport. In 1986, it became the main hub for China United Airlines after serving the military for decades. The airline was established under the administration of the People's Liberation Army Air Force, connecting revolutionary base areas and border cities. Nanyuan Airport, located 13 kilometers south of Tian'anmen Square in Fengtai district, is much closer to downtown compared with Beijing Capital International Airport. However, its outdated and shabby facilities have deterred many passengers. In 2016, Zheng Zhongjie, a fitness coach in Beijing, had been in the city for more than three years when he had the chance to take a flight from the airport. It proved a mixed experience. "Winding through a series of tortuous lanes, I thought I had taken an unlicensed taxi driver who wanted to take me the long way to the airport. But the real shock came when he pulled up at the terminal building. It looked like a county-level bus or train station to me, not an airport," he said. However, Zheng, a military enthusiast, said he welcomed the chance to see the airport, where there were soldiers on duty and some of the buildings offered a glimpse of the facility's history. Nanyuan, which translates as "southern garden" in Chinese, used to be a hunting ground for the Qing royal family. After flooding washed away the land during the reign of Emperor Guangxu (1871-1908), the area was turned into a base for military training and parades. In 1904, two French light aircraft performed aerobatics above the Nanyuan training ground - the first time aircraft had taken off and landed in China. Six years later, the Qing government built airstrips at Nanyuan and it became the nation's first airport. Later, the Qing government began to establish air transportation in China and built a factory at Nanyuan to experiment with manufacturing aircraft. After the Xinhai Revolution of 1911, Yuan Shikai, a key figure in Chinese politics in the early 20th century, established the Nanyuan Flying Academy in 1913 - the first official flying academy in China - and bought 10 French aircraft for pilot training. The academy struggled to survive for 15 years amid turbulent political changes and was forced to close in 1928. However, more than 150 pilots who graduated from it played important roles in China's aviation history. Fu Qianshao, an air defense expert, said: "The academy set the bar very high for the admission of candidates and drew up specific training programs and a detailed process for the pilots, which set an example and standard for the current flight school. China's aviation industry started at Nanyuan Airport." After the founding of New China in 1949, Nanyuan Airport continued as an aeronautical school and Air Force training base for nearly three decades. With rapid economic development and rising living standards, it was turned into a commercial airport in 1986 to cope with the growing demand for business and leisure travel. In 2002, the central government halted commercial services at the airport for three years, as it did not allow the military to run such businesses. Li Peibin, senior manager of China United Airlines' marketing department who has worked at the airport for nearly 15 years, said that with the expected increase in air traffic as Beijing hosted the Olympic Games in 2008, the airline relaunched commercial aviation services in 2005 with a single Boeing 737 leased from Shanghai Airlines, its largest stakeholder at the time. "With one aircraft in 2005, we only had three routes - Dalian, Liaoning province, Harbin, Heilongjiang province, and Wuxi, Jiangsu province. We handled just six flights a day, but it took us only three years to see passenger trips increase to more than 1.3 million," he said. To meet the surge in demand for air travel, the airport witnessed large-scale expansions and renovations in 2011 and 2016. The newly constructed terminal, together with the old one, covered a total of 200,000 squares meters and was designed to handle 6 million passenger trips annually, more than twice its former capacity. The airport, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Eastern Airlines, handles 49 aircraft and more than 170 flights a day, covering a network of nearly 60 routes and 80 domestic destinations. Last year, it handled 6.5 million passenger trips. Li said: "Compared with Beijing Capital International Airport, which handled more than 100 million passenger trips last year, Nanyuan Airport's throughput capacity is just a drop in the ocean. But China United Airlines has always served less-densely populated smaller cities where other airlines are unwilling to offer lower-priced tickets aimed at making flying affordable for the public." Daxing International Airport, with four runways, 268 airplane parking bays and a terminal building covering 700,000 square meters, will start operating by the end of the month and is preparing to accommodate 45 million passengers a year by 2021, and 72 million by 2025. As a result, Beijing will no longer need the small military-civilian airport. Chen Donglin, deputy general manager of China United Airlines' e-commerce department, said the carrier will become the first airline to transfer its operations to the new airport from its headquarters at Nanyuan. It will transfer all its planes and more than 4,000 employees before the new airport opens. "The opportunities brought by the new airport will help Chinese carriers to improve their operating efficiency and increase profits. We plan to purchase six new aircraft this year, and the company's fleet size is expected to reach more than 60 by next year," he added. No plans have been released for the future of Nanyuan Airport, but one expert has suggested turning it into a museum to showcase the development of the nation's aviation sector. Ma Huidi, director of the Center for China Leisure Studies at the China Academy of Art, said Nanyuan Airport is different from others and has its own peculiarities in terms of its history and location. "Scientific and technological 'relics' such as Nanyuan Airport should enjoy the same important status as other historical and cultural heritage" she said. "Compared with the Capital Airport and Daxing Airport, Nanyuan has a rich and special history with numerous fascinating stories to offer to the public as the first airport in China, making it the perfect site for a civil aviation-themed museum." With many neighborhoods close by on the one hand and a scarcity of historical resources in the southern part of Beijing on the other, Nanyuan Airport should be put to good use to balance development of the capital's cultural industry, she added. "Though the airport will come to an end, its history can be passed on in this way and show the next generation what the country has been through to achieve the level of economic progress it has," she said. wangkeju@chinadaily.com.cn  Flights prepare to leave from Beijing Nanyuan Airport. In 1920, it became the first airport in China to handle commercial flights. No plans have been released for the airport's future.Provided To China Daily(China Daily Global 09/20/2019 page1)
