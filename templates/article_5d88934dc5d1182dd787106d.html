                Airline companies shake up in-flight service
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                China's civil aviation authority said airline companies can decide whether to provide passengers in-flight meal services in order to ensure flight safety, Chinanews.com reported.Gu Xiaohong, deputy director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China's general affairs department, said at a news conference in Beijing on Monday that the draft of regulations removing airborne meal services gives airline companies more flexibility on running their business and providing passengers diversified services. It is a response to the latest move by CAAC plans to simplify the catering service on-board that has drawn nationwide criticism.Passengers' primary complaint was that flights used to catering dinner now only cater snacks, with declined meal quality.A passenger surnamed Xue said in the past few days during his eight flights, the food provided by different airlines was simpler overall, according to a report from news website jwview.com. Xue was surprised when he recently flew from Chongqing to Shanghai, and was catered with only three small snacks during the two-hour flight.Another passenger surnamed Yang said on her flight on August 26 from Changsha to Beijing, the previously served beef rice or curry rice was replaced with a small sandwich and a bottle of water. "I was surprised that my dinner was only thin slices of bread stuffed with pieces of beef and two small leaves inside," she said.According to Gu Xiaohong, in-flight meal services are an important part of airborne services in China, and the decisions primarily belong to the airlines' own business. The companies decide on their own to provide their meal services depending on the flight length and passengers' demands, while ensuring safety for all on the flight.The regulation issued by CAAC in 2012 specified that cabin crew are not allowed to engage in unsafe work 20 minutes after flight departure and within 30 minutes before landing."CAAC has reaffirmed the regulation following the recent consecutive aircraft incidents in which passengers and cabin crew have been harmed when delivering services within 30 minutes before landing," Gu Xiaohong said."Some airline companies simplified their meal services as catering on short-haul flights (mainly less than two hours) is a bit tight for the cabin crew, as they don't have enough time to collect the food waste safely," Gu added.

                Expansion expected to bump airport's capacity to 80 million trips annuallyAn auxiliary terminal to improve efficiency at Shanghai Pudong International Airport opened on Monday, bringing the city closer to becoming a global aviation hub, said officials from the airport authority.Located south of the airport's existing terminal 1 and terminal 2, the 620,000-square-meter satellite hall has 90 boarding gangways and is expected to handle 60 to 70 percent of the airport's flights.Hu Zhihong, general manager of the Shanghai Pudong International Airport, said it will greatly enhance the airport's boarding, as only about 10 percent of passengers will need to take shuttle buses.Ye Yuquan, a deputy general manager with China Eastern Airlines' ground service division, said only about 35 percent of the airline's flights at Pudong International Airport can access boarding gangways."The new satellite terminal is expected to enable us to increase that figure to 100 percent," Ye said.It is the world's largest single-building satellite terminal.Italian passenger Andrea Angelici departed on the first international flight from the new satellite terminal to Rome."It is one of the best I have visited," he said.A mass rapid transit system moves passengers between Pudong's two terminals and the satellite terminal, with a one-way trip between terminal 1 and the satellite terminal taking a mere 2.5 minutes, according to Feng Xin, president of Shanghai Airport Authority.The third phase of the expansion of Shanghai Pudong International Airport began more than three years ago and is expected handle 38 million passenger trips a year, raising the annual capacity of the airport to 80 million trips, said Guo Jianxiang, vice-president of East China Architectural Design & Research Institute who led a more than 100-member design team for the satellite terminal.According to Guo, the satellite terminal was designed to help Pudong International Airport meet the needs of the increasing number of air passengers and to improve efficiency in flight transfers.The H-shaped satellite terminal puts a priority on practical use and customer experience. "At the same time, it also features a mixture of Shanghai taste and international diversification," added Guo.Together with the satellite terminal, Shanghai's two airports can handle 120 million passenger trips and 5.2 million metric tons of cargo per year, said Xie Feng, head of the Shanghai Transport Commission.The satellite terminal has more than 28,000 square meters of commercial space, of which nearly 10,000 sq m are duty free zone.According to Xie, the Yangtze River Delta regional airport master plan is still pending central government approval, but Shanghai will strive to enhance the development of the Shanghai international aviation hub together with airports in cities including Nanjing of Jiangsu province, Hangzhou of Zhejiang province, Hefei of Anhui province, Nantong of Jiangsu province and Ningbo of Zhejiang province."The development of the city clusters in the Yangtze River Delta region requires the support of a comprehensive transportation system of air, railway, road and even water, both for passenger and cargo transportation," Xie said.Passenger throughput of the Pudong International Airport and Hongqiao International Airport in Shanghai hit 118 million passenger trips in 2018, ranking fourth in the world for three consecutive years, while cargo throughput reached 4.18 million tons, ranking third for 11 consecutive years, according to the Shanghai Airport Authority statistics.

                Strong revenue growth witnessed in non-aviation sectors at major centersLarge-scale airports posted more sales revenue from their non-aviation business, especially in duty-free retail stores catering to affluent international travelers, helping to offset slower passenger throughput growth at major hubs in the country.In the first half of the year, Hong Kong-listed Beijing Capital International Airport said in its earnings report that non-aviation business sales hit 3.35 billion yuan ($474 million), up by 24.8 percent year-on-year. Aviation-related sales though stood at 2.03 billion yuan, down 23 percent year-on-year."In recent years, the growth rate of passenger throughput at major domestic airports is around 5 percent, and it won't grow significantly. Besides, the fee charging standard of aviation business is strictly controlled by the authority, and airports are unable to increase the prices willfully," said Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst."The revenue growth of airports will mainly rely on non-aviation business in the future. Prices of non-aviation business depends on market demand. Hub airports have ample passenger flows, including more high-value international transfer passengers. With better business layout at airports and their increasing profit-making ability, the growth potential of non-aviation operations is huge," he said.For airports, aviation income mainly comes from charging fees for aircraft parking, the takeoff and landing of aircraft, and services such as the use of corridor bridges. Gains from non-aviation business come from the rent charged for various shops, restaurants and duty-free stores.The capital airport said the fall in aviation income mainly came from the cancellation of airport fees levied on passengers. Non-aviation income, which now accounts for 62.19 percent of total revenue, has become a critical way for airports to turn a profit.In February last year, the new operating contract of duty-free shops significantly boosted the proportion of revenue collected by airports. The growing number of international travelers and an increase in their consumption ability fueled the growth of duty-free shops, the capital airport said in a statement.Under the new agreement, duty-free operators at the capital airport will share 42.5 percent of their sales revenue with the airport operator, up from the level of around 30 percent in the previous arrangement.For Shanghai Pudong International Airport, where more than half of total passengers take international flights, its non-aviation business revenue in the first six month made up 62.9 percent of the total.From January to June, the Shanghai-listed Pudong airport gained revenues from its catering and retailing business of 2.77 billion yuan, jumping 46 percent year-on-year, its earnings report said.In the fourth quarter, Pudong airport will launch a mid-field satellite terminal to increase its capacity. By then, the areas of duty-free shops will be expanded further and sales from those shops will naturally increase, a research report by Minsheng Securities explained.Last year, spending on luxury products by Chinese consumers reached 770 billion yuan, and nearly 540 billion yuan were spent abroad. By opening more duty-free shops at the airports, it can help to redirect the spending on products like cosmetics, perfumes, bags and accessories to domestic retailers.
