                Given the pro-independence stance of Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen and her Democratic Progressive Party, it is not surprising that the island has lost many of its "diplomatic" partners in recent years. From Sao Tome and Principe in December 2016 to Kiribati on Friday, seven countries have severed official ties with the island in less than three years leaving it with only 15 "diplomatic" partners. That the island has been further isolated in the world during Tsai's tenure can be squarely blamed on her refusal to accept the 1992 Consensus that there is only one China. Yet instead of realizing their follies, Tsai and the DPP have again pointed the finger at Beijing for the island's woes, claiming it is using its thick checkbook to lure Taipei's allies into switching "sides". It was particularly appalling to hear a Taiwan official say the aid Kiribati has sought from Beijing includes loans and a Boeing 737 aircraft, as it is an insult to all the 179 countries that have diplomatic relations with Beijing.

                    Escalating violence in SAR reveals Western media's ill intentions

            <p class="style-content">
                Violence has continued unabated in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region even as Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor is actively building a platform for dialogue in a bid to foster cohesiveness in society and find ways to bring the city back to the development track. That the demonstrators refuse to end the violence and some Western media outlets continue to ignore their unlawful acts shows there is more to the demonstrations than meets the eye. Although the number of demonstrators and riots has declined over the past few weeks, probably because of the public fury over the serious disruption of normal life and economic activities, the intensity of the violence has been on the rise.

                Given the pro-independence stance of Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen and her Democratic Progressive Party, it is not surprising that the island has lost many of its "diplomatic" partners in recent years. From Sao Tome and Principe in December 2016 to Kiribati on Friday, seven countries have severed official ties with the island in less than three years leaving it with only 15 "diplomatic" partners. That the island has been further isolated in the world during Tsai's tenure can be squarely blamed on her refusal to accept the 1992 Consensus that there is only one China. Yet instead of realizing their follies, Tsai and the DPP have again pointed the finger at Beijing for the island's woes, claiming it is using its thick checkbook to lure Taipei's allies into switching "sides". It was particularly appalling to hear a Taiwan official say the aid Kiribati has sought from Beijing includes loans and a Boeing 737 aircraft, as it is an insult to all the 179 countries that have diplomatic relations with Beijing. International relations are all about a country keeping its national interests in mind while choosing its diplomatic partners. As Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said: "Those used to dollar-diplomacy may not understand that certain principles cannot be bought with money, neither can trust". Since the United Nations and the international community recognize the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate government that represents the whole of China and Taiwan is an integral part of China, there is no need for Beijing to "buy" recognition from other countries. If Taipei continues to stick to its ostrich policy by refusing to face reality, it could see more of its allies going the Kiribati way. During the eight years of Kuomintang leader Ma Ying-jeou's rule, Taiwan lost only one ally because cross-Straits relations were amiable. Not only were cross-Straits ties friendly but also two-way trade and people-to-people exchanges flourished because Ma accepted the 1992 Consensus. As such, the consensus is the common political foundation for peaceful development of cross-Straits ties. But since Tsai has shaken that foundation by refusing to acknowledge the 1992 Consensus, cross-Straits ties have nose-dived affecting common development. Hopefully, the loss of "diplomatic" allies will force the Tsai administration to realize there is no international space for Taiwan "independence", and it would be playing with fire if it continues to pursue that illusory goal.
