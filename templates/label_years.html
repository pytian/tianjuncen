                            Due to failure of long rains in the months of March to May, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an eight-country trade bloc in Africa based in Djibouti, has said that Kenya will be hit by the worst drought in 38 years.Speaking at a handover ceremony of 2017 Rice Assistance to Kenya press event held at the Treasury House in Nairobi, Wamalwa said the country is expecting a second batch from China, which will go a long way in assisting government food programs targeting vulnerable communities living in more than 13 of Kenya’s 47 counties. We are expecting additional consignment that will bring relief to millions of Kenyans as the current rains end by the end of this month

                             Many of the advanced technologies one hears so much about in the media remain unexploited by a nontrivial share of companies, which suggests that we have a long wait before even the most revolutionary innovations start driving GDP.To avoid an even worse backlash, and to develop a better appreciation of what the Fourth Industrial Revolution actually entails, one must understand where all companies－not just those at the top－stand with respect to today's disruptions. But it is worth remembering that smaller companies, even if they face economic headwinds, still have the political power to push for tougher regulation of new technologies that threaten their existence

                            The pronouncement of International Trade Secretary Liam Fox that Britain's post-Brexit free-trade deal with the EU would be the "easiest in human history" has proved to be anything but, and given the uncertainty over what divorce terms Britain will manage to secure, many international companies seem to be erring on the side of caution and drawing up plans to relocate from the UK to mainland Europe.He said that, despite the challenges posed by the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, London has always held a special allure for Chinese individuals and companies, and he expects this relationship to flourish in the years to come. His successor, Theresa May, who as home secretary had made a speech in April 2016 in which she said "remaining inside the European Union does make us more secure, it does make us more prosperous, and it does make us more influential beyond our shores", had inherited the task of overseeing Britain's departure from the EU, which is scheduled for the end of March 2019

The investigation into the alleged rape does not expire until August 2020, but was closed in 2017 after an assessment that Assange could not be extradited to Sweden for the foreseeable future. At the time, Assange denied the accusations but refused to be questioned in Sweden, fearing that Sweden would then extradite him to the US to face conspiracy charges

                             According to veteran diplomats, interactions between China and the US in Shanghai, and what they have achieved in the city in past decades, are part of the two countries' shared legacy and are lessons that need to be passed on. "But at the time, political support within the US toward developing relations with China was not very strong, and many US politicians were unable to observe China's economic growth and social changes that had taken place," Wu added. Yuan Peng, a leading US expert and president of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that despite the Taiwan question, many new issues that emerged - including the Korean nuclear situation, the South China Sea, global economic governance and climate change - were not included in the landmark joint statements issued by the two governments in 1972, 1978 and 1982

Juan Carlos Capunay, Peru's former ambassador to China, said the BRI is the best solution for countries that want to embrace open business environments and build up their economies by joining global groups like the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization. A study by the World Bank found that fully implementing deeper policy reforms related to the BRI would lift 32 million people out of moderate poverty, increase global trade by up to 6

                            Major General Chen Daoxiang, commander of the PLA Garrison Commander, said that since the PLA Garrison was stationed in Hong Kong 22 years ago, it has been firmly implementing the principle of "one country, two systems," performing defense responsibilities in accordance with the law, firmly supporting the SAR government in governing according to the law, thus playing a significant role in maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.More than 400 guests from all walks of life, including major officials of the HKSAR government and Hong Kong deputies to the National People's Congress were present at the event.The series of violent incidents that happened in Hong Kong recently have severely damaged Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, severely challenged Hong Kong's rule of law and social order, seriously threatened the lives and properties of the Hong Kong people, and touched the bottom line of the principle of "one country, two systems," Chen said

So we have every confidence that it will take China less than 15 years to become a high-income country.China expected to complete transition to high-income country by 2025 In the past decade, the concept of the middle-income trap has attracted wide attention from economists, media, government officials, international organizations and even the general public worldwide

A few years later, as China was opening up to the world, the same young man came to the American University in Washington to study and was welcomed as a regular guest at the Bonkers' apartment on many occasions.Although China at the time looked gray and backward with bicycles everywhere and facilities in dire condition, everyone on the trip could feel there was something powerful just waiting to be unleashed, Bonker says
