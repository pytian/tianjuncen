                Hamilton wins 2019 Chinese Grand Prix
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                SHANGHAI -- Lewis Hamilton beat teammate Valtteri Bottas to win the 2019 Chinese Grand Prix, with the Mercedes AMG Petronas team securing their third consecutive 1-2 finish of the season in Formula 1's 1,000th race.Though Bottas had qualified on pole position and had the measure of Hamilton earlier in the weekend, it was the Briton who got the jump on the Finn at the start, with a better getaway seeing the 44 Mercedes lead into the first corner. Behind them, both Ferraris also swapped places, with Charles Leclerc now ahead of Sebastian Vettel.While the front-runners all negotiated the first lap cleanly, there was drama further down the field, as the Toro Rosso of Daniil Kvyat made contact with the McLarens of Lando Norris and Carlos Sainz, both of whom required a trip to the pits for new front wings, putting them well down the order. Kvyat was handed a drive-through penalty for causing the collision in what would prove to be an untidy race for the Russian.The opening laps continued without much in the way of incident, though Vettel was soon on Leclerc's tail after the Monegasque lost time locking up into the hairpin. Though unable to overtake, the German appeared to have a quicker car than his young teammate, and the team controversially ordered Leclerc to let Vettel by on lap 11.By this stage, Vettel was five seconds adrift of Bottas in second place, losing time after himself locking up at the hairpin on lap 14, and by this stage it appeared as if the race was playing nicely into the hands of Mercedes.Clearly irked at having been ordered to let Vettel by, Leclerc radioed his team to say that he was now losing time behind his teammate, having closed on the German after his hairpin lock up.

                    Hamilton turns up the heat on Vettel after Singapore F1 win
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                SINGAPORE — In the sweltering heat of the Singapore Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton turned up the heat on Sebastian Vettel a notch further.Hamilton won comfortably from pole position on Sunday, extending his Formula One championship lead over Vettel to 40 points.Winning from pole on one of the hardest tracks for overtaking in F1 was nothing special in itself. But Hamilton's masterclass in qualifying was exceptional as he recorded one of the best pole positions of his career — described as epic within his Mercedes team.It afforded him a more relaxing race than expected — heat aside — given Ferrari's advantage during practice this weekend.Considering Vettel makes more mistakes than Hamilton, a 40-point gap looks a huge advantage with only six races left.Especially as Hamilton has no intention of easing up.The British driver is on a major roll after winning four of the past five races, pinning Vettel firmly on the ropes in their bid for a fifth F1 title."I think the approach I have is working really well, so I don't see the point in changing," Hamilton said after his seventh win of the season and 69th in F1."I've been (around) a long, long time and I know I can't get ahead of myself, we can't get ahead of ourselves," Hamilton said. "I truly think we can deliver like this for the rest of the season, and that is the goal."Red Bull driver Max Verstappen was nine seconds back in second place, with Vettel way back in third."We didn't come here expecting to lose 10 points," said a dejected Vettel, who trailed by 30 heading into Singapore.Vettel's championship bid crumbled when he crashed from pole here last year and went on to lose the title by 46 points to Hamilton.It is looking increasingly like a repeat scenario for the Ferrari driver, who is in disappearing into Hamilton's slipstream.Vettel was unhappy with his team after qualifying in third place behind Verstappen, and the German driver sounded irritated during Sunday's race after a team strategy error to send him into the pits for a tire change before Hamilton failed to work.Instead he lost position and crucial points, dropping back behind Verstappen having earlier overtaken him."We tried to be aggressive in the beginning and obviously it didn't work out," Vettel said. "I think today, with the way we raced, we didn't have a chance. I said before the weekend we can only beat ourselves and today we didn't get everything out of the package."The only thing bothering Hamilton seemed to be the conditions. Despite the night-time start, the temperature was around 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) and the humidity intense."I'm spent," Hamilton said moments after victory, crouching down by his car.His teammate Valtteri Bottas was fourth ahead of Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen and Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo. Two-time F1 champion Fernando Alonso, who won the inaugural race here 10 years ago, was seventh for McLaren.Hamilton's stunning pole Saturday was a record-extending 79th."It's so hard to overtake here," Hamilton said. "So positioning is everything."Vettel tried to make ground, almost bumping into Verstappen as they headed into the first corner on Sunday. They just avoided contact.Moments later, Vettel passed Verstappen with a great move on Raffles boulevard while behind them Sergio Perez knocked his Force India teammate Esteban Ocon into the wall and out — bringing a safety car onto the track for four laps.When the race re-started, Ferrari gambled on pitting first for new tires by bringing in Vettel first. Mercedes pitted Hamilton moments later, and when Vettel came back out he was still behind Hamilton and lost more time getting past Perez.Verstappen was the next in, almost colliding again with Vettel into turn 3. Verstappen held position, Vettel dropping to third."No chance, we are again too late," Vettel complained over team radio, taking another apparent swipe at team strategy. "If (being aggressive) works it's great — today it didn't work by quite a bit."Time is running out for Vettel, who realistically has to win in Russia in two weeks' time if he is to get back into title contention.AP

                Patience the name of the game for China's rising young starsThe long-awaited rise of Chinese men's tennis is gaining momentum at home events, but challenges remain for local stars to shine on the highly competitive pro stage.Homegrown players won support from fans and praise from international stars as they served notice of improvement at the ongoing Rolex Shanghai Masters.As the youngest homegrown challenger, teenager Wu Yibing, boys' champion at the 2017 US Open, proved he has what it takes to become a future star by pushing world No 12 Kei Nishikori to the limit in their second-round match, which saw the Japanese star pull out a 3-6, 6-0, 6-3 victory at the Qizhong Tennis Center on Wednesday."I was surprised how well he played in the opening set," Nishikori, Asia's highest-ranked man, said of Wu."He was playing very solid, hitting good serves, very good forehands and backhands. In the first set he was playing maybe top-30 tennis," said the 2014 US Open finalist.Wu, who earned his first ATP World Tour win over fellow Chinese wild card Li Zhe on Monday, attributed his impressive run in Shanghai to his preparation for wild card entries at previous Tour-level tournaments."The three matches before Shanghai gave me high-quality tests where I improved match by match technically and gained confidence," said Wu, who celebrates his 19th birthday on Sunday, the final day of the Shanghai Masters."Playing at home is an advantage for up-and-coming players like us, with the support from the home crowd and the chance to gauge ourselves against the world's best. Nowhere else can offer that."The ATP World Tour has four stops in China, from the 250 level to the 1000 Masters. Wu entered the main draws in Chengdu, Beijing and Shanghai through wild cards.Citing more professional exposure, better coaching and conditioning, Zhang Ze, China's current top ace, envisions a smoother ride for the new generation to establish a presence on the brutally competitive men's tour."I think they are in a better situation in terms of what it takes to become good professionals than we had in the past," said Zhang, who in 2012 became the first Chinese male to reach the quarterfinals at an ATP 500 event in Beijing.Zhang, currently ranked No 216 in the world, made his presence felt in Shanghai on Tuesday after narrowly losing to No 22 Danill Medvedev of Russia in a three-set fight in the first round, losing the chance to face Swiss great Roger Federer on Wednesday.Disappointed by missing out on the chance to play Federer, his doubles partner at the Shanghai tournament in 2013, Zhang said he could still leave with his head held high."The gap on the court between us and the world's top 50 is actually not as big as the rankings show," said the 28-year-old Jiangsu native."I feel like if we keep pushing on the entry-level ATP events injury-free, we'll eventually crack the top 100. We just need patience."Medvedev, winner of the Japan Open before Shanghai, said Zhang is a much better player than his ranking, adding: "He was serving so good and making winners. At the net he was unbelievable."Unlike the old generation fostered in the traditional State-run training system, youngsters like Wu represent the new breed of talent from a melded Chinese-Western program.They've forged their careers with financial backing from their provincial sports governing bodies and their families, sponsors and marketing agencies, which allows them to hire foreign coaches and compete on a more flexible schedule.In June, Wu signed an agreement with US-based International Management Group to have his career managed by Max Eisenbud, a veteran agent who has represented Li Na and Russian favorite Maria Sharapova for a decade, on and off the court.Federer, who is defending his title in Shanghai, said the rise of Chinese men's tennis will take time－but it's heading in the right direction."It's all about learning how to play point for points, making the right decisions at the right time," the 20-time major winner said after watching some of Wu's action."I think you're pretty safe for the next years to come. Wu's doing great. I don't want to put too much pressure on him, but it seems he has a good attitude, as well. I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun watching him in the future."

                    China Railway Express in Chengdu boosts regional economy
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Countries and regions across the world have strengthened cooperation with the city, thanks to the Belt and Road InitiativeTwo thousand years ago, the ancient Silk Road opened the door for Chengdu to connect with the rest of the world. Now, fueled by the Belt and Road Initiative, the city again stands at the forefront of opening-up, developing its industries, creating value and making innovations on the global stage.The first freight train from Luxembourg to Chengdu departed on April 4. The train, branded under the "China Railway Express" banner, passed through Germany, Poland, Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan, and then entered China through the Alashankou port in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. The travel time, from start to finish, was 15 days.By now, China Railway Express (Chengdu) has linked 25 overseas cities and 14 Chinese cities. It has seven international railway channels and five international rail-sea combined channels to further open up the city.Six years ago, when the initiative was put forward, Chengdu opened the first direct freight railway to reach Lodz in Poland, bridging a gap to link to Europe. Through the logistics channel, the products and services from Chengdu were exported to meet the demands of countries and regions involved in the initiative. It became an important platform for Chinese companies to go global and for foreign capital to be introduced.For example, China Railway Express-Skyworth Express, with 41 full containers of televisions and accessories, left Chengdu International Railway Port to reach Europe in March.The express provided a more convenient channel for Shenzhen-based television manufacturer Skyworth Group to enter overseas markets.Wang Zhiguo, chairman and president of Shenzhen Skyworth-RGB Electronic, a subsidiary of Skyworth Group, said the express helped reduce logistics time by more than 66 percent.Enticed by the growing influence of China Railway Express on China-Europe trade, more companies have signed agreements with Chengdu to conduct import-export logistics and production capacity cooperation with Europe. They've also reached cooperative intention with local companies in bonded processing and logistics.That includes electronics giant TCL Corp, Lenovo Group, the world's largest manufacturer of personal computers, and AVIC Chengdu Aircraft Industrial Co Ltd.The production of Skyworth, TCL and electronics company Dell in Chengdu also saw significant growth.Big logistics companies, like Alibaba's Cainiao Logistics, Hema Fresh and Hong Kong-based Sun Wah Group, have also invested in Chengdu International Railway Port. The number of major logistics and trade projects in the port has reached 84, with a total investment of 55 billion yuan ($8.2 billion).Thanks to Chengdu's geographical advantages with regard to the Belt and Road Initiative, local companies have linked to global markets more frequently. Companies that used to lack the confidence to go global began taking the step. Companies that have had export business for years upgraded their product structure and expanded their business to production capacity cooperation and technological export.Chengdu Xinzhu Road and Bridge Machinery is a prime example. The company was founded as an infrastructure company, and its business has expanded to include new energy and railway traffic. In September 2018, the company's production base at the China-Belarus Industrial Park in Minsk was launched to produce super capacitors used in buses. They're the first high-tech manufacturer to begin operation in the park. Before that, the company mainly exported parts used in roads and bridges' construction.It's Xinzhu's first overseas production base, marking the first step of its overseas development.Du Xiaofeng, vice-president of the company, said it aims to serve members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Eurasian Economic Union, and other Middle East and European markets. He said the company will adopt localized management and hire a large number of Belarusian employees.The company also introduced the core technology for medium- and low-speed maglev traffic system from German company Max Bogl Group and put it into local production. Its production line is expected to be completed in June."Our overseas outreach has gradually transformed from technological and academic communications to capacity cooperation," said Hu Jishi, senior counselor and technical director of the company.More BRI-related countries and companies have found business potential in Chengdu. The Sino-German small and medium-sized enterprises cooperative park, Sino-French ecological park, Sino-Italian cultural innovation park, Sino-South Korean innovation and entrepreneurship park, Chengdu-Israel technological innovation center, the Chinese innovation center of France-based Sophia Antipolis Science and Technology Park and other industrial parks have all settled in the city.As a comprehensive global service platform, the Business and Innovation Centre for China-Europe Cooperation in Chengdu has attracted more than 40 projects, including the representative offices of Bavaria, Germany, the Chinese headquarters of Norwegian company Opera, the French internet of things company Sigfox, the global innovation center of Amazon, the Germany visa application center, and the sustainable development and innovation demonstration project of the United Nations Development Programme.Chengdu attracted foreign direct investment of $2.69 billion in 2018, up 44.1 percent year-over-year, according to data from the Ministry of Commerce. The actual use of foreign investment grew 17.5 percent to reach $7.63 billion last year.Chengdu has established economic relations with 228 countries and regions. At the end of 2018, the city operated 114 international or regional flights, had 17 consulates and 285 Fortune Global 500 companies, ranking it first in central and western China.

                    United will buy used planes for MAX gap
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                United Airlines reported strong second-quarter profit growth and announced Wednesday it will buy 19 used Boeing 737-700 jets to fill the gap created by the worldwide grounding of 737 MAX aircraft.The strong earnings report — United said second-quarter profit increased to $1.05 billion from $683 million a year earlier — suggests that fatal crashes of two MAX jets have not deterred customers from flying. The 737-700 is an older, less fuel-efficient plane introduced in 1993. United said it hopes to take delivery of the used jets by December. It did not disclose the airline it is buying the airplanes from."I see United's action as an opportunistic buy to supplement its domestic fleet," aviation consultant Robert Mann told China Daily USA. "Remember that taking delivery of the planes and inducting them into service are two different things."United has 14 MAXs and planned to add another 16 by the end of the year with 28 more in 2020, but deliveries have slowed following the crashes of MAX jets flown by Lion Air in Indonesia and Ethiopian Air.United hopes to have its MAX jets back in service by December, but Boeing has not submitted the software update for the airplane's anti-stall system to federal regulators for review, and it's unclear how long the review will take. Initially, airlines hoped to get their MAXs back in the sky by early summer, but technical and regulatory issues have created lengthy delays. Some analysts believe the MAX will not return to service until 2020."This is a stop-gap measure until the MAX is returned to service," John Cochran professor emeritus of aerospace engineering at Auburn University and CEO of aviation consulting firm Eaglemark, told China Daily."The 737-700 is an older, but a proven, plane. It doesn't have all the attributes of the MAX, but it functions well. I think the FAA will recertify the MAX, but the question is when," he said.Ryan Air, an Irish discount carrier, said on Wednesday that it expects to cut flights and may close some European hubs following the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX.The airline said it expects to receive only 30 new MAX jets by next May rather than the planned 58 that would have allowed it to provide full service. The airline expects reduced capacity will cut the number of passengers it carries through March 2021 to 157 million from the previously forecast 162 million.Boeing MAX jets were grounded worldwide following crashes on March 10 in Ethiopia and Oct 29, 2018, in Indonesia that killed a total of 346 passengers and crew.

                    Boeing will compensate  on groundings
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                Aircraft maker will take $5b charge to help make up for MAX jet users’ lost revenueBoeing said Thursday it will take a $5 billion charge to compensate airlines for lost revenue stemming from the extended grounding of its 737 MAX jets.The aircraft manufacturer said the accounting charge will sharply reduce second-quarter earnings, but the concessions may be made over a number of years and may take various forms."We don't know what's in the contract Boeing has with the airlines," John Cochran, professor emeritus of aerospace engineering at Auburn University and CEO of aviation consulting firm Eaglemark, told China Daily. "It might be something that would allow the airlines to delay payments or Boeing could discount future purchases."Many airlines, including those in China, Europe and the US, have said they will seek compensation from Boeing for lost revenue due to canceled flights. United Airlines said this week it will buy 19 used Boeing 737-700 jets to fill the gap created by the worldwide grounding of MAX aircraft. The 737-700 is an older, less fuel-efficient plane that was introduced in 1993."The MAX grounding presents significant headwinds and the financial impact recognized this quarter reflects the current challenges and helps to address future financial risks," Boeing's CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement. "This is a defining moment for Boeing."Boeing said its estimated costs to produce the aircraft increased by $1.7 billion in the second quarter, mostly due to higher costs associated with a longer than expected reduction in the production rate. Boeing said it plans to gradually increase production to 57 a month in 2020 from the current 42.Saudi Arabia's discount carrier, flyadeal, backed out of an order for 50 737 MAX jets, opting for the Airbus A320neo. At the Paris Air Show in June, International Airlines Group announced the purchase of 200 737 MAX jets. IAG owns British Airways, Iberia and AerLingus.Boeing has not yet submitted its updated software for the MAX's anti-stall system to the US Federal Aviation Administration for review. Major US airlines have canceled flights handled by the MAX through November. Boeing said it expected regulatory approval in the fourth quarter, but it's unclear how quickly regulators will approve the new software, and the planes could remain grounded into 2020."This assumption reflects the company's best estimate at this time, but actual timing of return to service could differ," Boeing said.Boeing MAX jets were grounded worldwide following crashes March 10 in Ethiopia and Oct 29, 2018, in Indonesia that killed a total of 346 passengers and crew. Preliminary investigations suggest the aircraft's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), an automated anti-stall device, apparently forced the noses of Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines flights down and into a fatal plunge when it erroneously determined the planes were about to stall. To avoid a stall, MCAS points the nose of the plane down to gain air speed.There were about 400 MAX jets in commercial service worldwide, including about 97 in China. MAX jets were flown extensively in the US and China without incident prior to the fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.Boeing shares closed Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange at $361.11, down $8.41, or 2.28 percent. The 52-week range is $292.47 to $446.01.

                    Boeing may cut, halt production of MAX aircraft

                Boeing on Wednesday reported a $2.94 billion second-quarter loss — the largest in the company's history — because its top-selling MAX jet remains grounded after two fatal crashes and deliveries of new planes in the top-selling sector have ceased.CEO Dennis Muilenburg warned that Boeing may cut or temporarily halt production of the MAX if the US Federal Aviation Administration doesn't recertify the plane in September as the company now anticipates."Then we'll have to evaluate alternatives and those could include different production rates (or) a temporary shutdown of the line, "he told analysts on a conference call. "(It's) not something we want to do, but an alternative we have to prepare for."For the same period a year earlier, Boeing reported a profit of $2.2 billion. Sales dropped 35 percent to $15.75 billion in the current quarter and the company delivered only 90 planes with MAX shipments on hold. Boeing reported a loss of $5.21 a share, the first loss since a $234 million deficit in the second quarter of 2016 when the company took charges on the 787, 747-8 and KC-46A Pegasus military tanker."Boeing's earnings are an indication of how profitable the MAX has been and what a cash cow it's projected to be in the future,"Robert Mann, president of R.W. Mann & Co, an aviation consultancy, told China Daily."The company's survival would be in question if Boeing were a single-line manufacturer, but it's a diversified company with military and service sectors. The problem is more than a gnat on an elephant's back, but second quarter earnings are not a lethal blow."Cutting production below the current 42 planes a month would disrupt the supply chain and ripple throughout the industry. Such a move would further strain Boeing's cash flow which fell $1.01 billion in the red in the second quarter, Mann said."Technically, the issue is solvable,"Mann said. "But if a separate certification is required for the MAX —if it's treated as a separate type of aircraft rather than as a 737 —that will require additional training for the flight crew. If that happens, return of the MAX will be delayed further and there will be increased expense for the airlines."Boeing hopes MAX jets will return to service in the fourth quarter, but some analysts believe the plane will remain grounded into 2020. Boeing has submitted updated software for the anti-stall system implicated in the fatal crashes to the FAA for review, but there is no schedule for approval.The company delivered 90 commercial airplanes in the second quarter valued at $4.72 billion, including eight designed for freight service, but the division lost $4.94 billion. The defense unit reported a $975 million profit after revenue climbed 8 percent to $6.61 billion. Global service revenue increased 11 percent to $4.54 billion and the unit earned $687 million.Boeing warned it may not be able to deliver its newest plane, the 777X, by the end of 2020 as planned due to previously disclosed trouble with General Electric's engine.Analysts at Citigroup said airlines will schedule flights without the MAX if the jet doesn't return to service in the fourth quarter. United Airlines said it will buy 19 used Boeing 737-700 jets to fill the gap created by grounded MAX aircraft. The 737-700 is an older, less fuel-efficient airplane introduced in 1993.Boeing MAX jets were grounded worldwide following crashes March 10 in Ethiopia and Oct 29, 2018, in Indonesia that killed a total of 346 passengers and crew.Boeing's stock closed Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $361.43 a share, down $11.64, or 3.12 percent, from Tuesday's close. The 52-week range is $292.47 to $446.01 a share.

                    Seats on next MAX flights reportedly for sale
                </p>

                Major airlines reportedly are selling seats on future Boeing 737 MAX flights even as the planes remain grounded worldwide, but US carriers said they have taken no such action and hope to return the aircraft to service later this year.The London Times reported Sunday that airlines have scheduled about 32,600 flights using MAX jets by the end of year, an apparent bet the planes will be returned to service quickly despite lack of approval from regulators in the US, Europe and Asia.Major US airlines discounted the report."We have no current plans to operate MAX revenue flights for the remainder of 2019," Southwest Airlines said in a statement. "We are in the process of removing all MAX flying through January 5, 2020, and notifying affected customers to offer rebooking options."American Airlines said it has canceled MAX flights through Nov 2 and hasn't yet made an announcement about rebooking canceled flights. The airline said it "remains confident" MAX jets will be recertified for commercial service this year.United Airlines said it has canceled MAX flights through at least Nov 3. In July, the airline said it planned to buy 19 used Boeing 737-700 jets to fill the gap created by the worldwide grounding of MAX aircraft.Boeing said it has completed the software update for MCAS and is working with the FAA to get the plane back in the air.In June, the US Federal Aviation Administration said there is no "prescribed timeline" for returning MAX jets to commercial service and noted it "will lift the aircraft's prohibition order when we deem it is safe to do so"."Our best current estimate is a return to service of the MAX that begins early in the fourth quarter," Boeing said in a statement. "Timing on return to service will be driven by the FAA and global regulators."Analysts estimate it would take at least 45 days to return the grounded aircraft to commercial services after securing regulatory approval.Boeing MAX jets were grounded worldwide following crashes March 10 in Ethiopia and Oct 20, 2018, in Indonesia that killed a total of 346 passengers and crew.
