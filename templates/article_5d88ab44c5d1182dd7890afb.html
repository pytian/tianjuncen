                San Francisco labels NRA as 'domestic terrorist'
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                San Francisco's legislature has passed a resolution labeling the National Rifle Association a "domestic terrorist organization". The measure by the city's Board of Supervisors, passed on Tuesday, also states that "the City and County of San Francisco should take every reasonable step to limit those entities who do business with the City and County ... from doing business with this domestic terrorist organization". "The National Rifle Association musters its considerable wealth and organizational strength to promote gun ownership and incite gun owners to acts of violence," the resolution states. "The National Rifle Association spreads propaganda that misinforms and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence, and ... the leadership of National Rifle Association promotes extremist positions, in defiance of the views of a majority of its membership and the public, and undermine the general welfare." In response, the Fairfax, Virginia-based NRA said in a statement: "This ludicrous stunt by the Board of Supervisors is an effort to distract from the real problems facing San Francisco, such as rampant homelessness, drug abuse and skyrocketing petty crime, to name a few. The NRA will continue working to protect the constitutional rights of all freedom-loving Americans." San Francisco City Supervisor Catherine Stefani introduced the resolution after a mass shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in Northern California on July 28. Three people, including two children, were fatally shot and 17 injured. Twenty-two people were killed in a mass shooting at Walmart shopping center in El Paso, Texas, on Aug 3; nine in Dayton, Ohio, on Aug 4; and seven in Odessa and Midland, Texas, on Aug 31. "People are dying every day in this country," Stefani said on Tuesday in an interview with KTVU in Oakland. "Doing nothing is not an option. And that's what the NRA continues to do." US corporate reaction to gun violence this week included Cincinnati-based supermarket chain Kroger joining Walmart in requesting customers not to openly carry firearms in states where such behavior is legal. Walmart also said this week that it would stop selling ammunition for handguns and short-barrel rifles. "Rather than place the blame on the criminal, Walmart has chosen to victimize law-abiding Americans," the NRA said in response to the firearms policy changes by the Bentonville, Arkansas, retail giant. Dick's Sporting Goods announced in March it would stop selling firearms and ammunition at 125 of its 700-plus locations. Kroger said last year that it would do the same at its Fred Meyer stores in the Pacific Northwest. Starbucks, Target and Wendy's also have asked customers not to openly carry firearms when they visit their premises, even if legal to do so. But they are not enforcing a ban because they don't want to put their employees in confrontational situations.

                    Retail stores with history of shootings take action
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Walmart and Kroger, the largest and second-largest retail chains, respectively, in the US, have a history of fatal shootings at their stores, and this week they took actions to address the issue.The companies have asked shoppers not to openly carry guns in their stores in states where "open carry" is allowed.The actions came after a spree of shootings in the US in August, including one at a Walmart in El Paso. The two corporations also have been sued over shootings on their premises.The announcement by Cincinnati, Ohio-based Kroger on Tuesday came hours after Walmart  "respectfully'' requested that shoppers who visit Walmart and Sam's Club stop openly carrying firearms in its stores, even in states where open carry is legal.On Thursday, they were joined by drugstore chains Walgreens and CVS and supermarket company Wegmans.On Aug 3, 22 people were shot and killed at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, and on July 30, two employees were killed at a Walmart in Southaven, Mississippi, by a man described as a disgruntled store employee.On Tuesday, a man and his wife who were wounded in the El Paso shooting filed what appears to be the first suit against Walmart connected to the rampage. The suit accuses the company of failing to protect the couple by not having armed security guards at the store.Ten people have been shot and killed at Kroger supermarkets since 1991. The most recent shooting was at a store in Jefferson, Kentucky, in October 2018, when two people were killed.Last month, two separate but nearly identical lawsuits were filed against Kroger in those killings. The suits also named Gregory Bush, who has been charged with federal hate crimes in the deaths. Both of the victims were black.The lawsuits claim that Kroger allowed customers to carry firearms inside its stores, had no policy in place to make sure the alleged shooter was licensed to carry his firearm, and that store security did nothing to help prevent the shootings.It was unclear whether or how Kroger plans to implement its request that customers no longer openly carry firearms in its stores. Walmart said it will take a "non-confrontational" approach to the new policy by posting signs announcing it outside stores. Walmart said it won't be changing its policy for customers who have permits to carry concealed weapons.Open-carry laws vary by state, with 31 states allowing people to openly carry handguns without any license or permit, according to the Giffords Law Center. In those states, in some cases, the gun cannot be loaded.Like Walmart, Kroger's announcement also called on elected officials to pass gun reform laws, such as requiring stronger background checks and removing weapons "from those who have been found to pose a risk for violence". The retailers' announcements came after recent mass shootings in the US. In addition to El Paso, there was a shooting July 28 in Gilroy, California; in Dayton, Ohio, on Aug 4; and in Midland and Odessa, Texas, on Aug 31, by the same gunman. Kroger didn't specifically cite those shootings as the reason for the gun-policy change.Kroger said "that we recognize the growing chorus of Americans who are no longer comfortable with the status quo and who are advocating for concrete and common-sense gun reforms".After a former student at a high school in Parkland, Florida, killed 17 people at the school last year, Kroger said 43 of its stores in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington would stop selling firearms and ammunition to buyers under 21 until a background check verifying their ages.Walmart's former US CEO said that the retailer's decision to stop selling some ammunition is a "thoughtful" one, but he's not confident it will reduce gun violence."It's kind of unreasonable to ask Bentonville to solve a problem that Washington DC should solve," Bill Simon told CNBC on Tuesday, referring to the Arkansas city in which Walmart was founded and is headquartered.

                    US CEOs urge Senate to act on guns
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Chief executives of dozens of the US' biggest companies sent a letter to Senate leaders Thursday urging them to enact pending legislation that would strengthen gun laws."We are writing to you because we have a responsibility and obligation to stand up for the safety of our employees, customers and all Americans in the communities we serve across the country. Doing nothing about America's gun violence crisis is simply unacceptable and it is time to stand with the American public on gun safety," said the letter signed by more than 150 CEOs.While the vast majority of Americans support stronger gun control measures to cut down on violence, according to surveys from the Pew Research Center, US business leaders have largely steered clear of the current gun debate to avoid alienating some consumers.But the letter signed by the CEOs is the boldest move by so many executives in the business community to join others in calling for stronger gun laws."Business leaders are not afraid to get engaged now. CEOs are wired to take action on things that are going to impact their business, and gun violence is impacting everybody's business now," Chip Bergh, CEO of Levi Strauss, who signed the letter, told The New York Times.The letter drew a rebuke from Republican US Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is co-sponsoring a bill to improve background checks. He told the executives to stop being "political players on divisive social issues''."I don't think it's a positive thing to see big corporations shifting their focus from their customers and actually doing what they were created to do into trying to become political players on divisive social issues," he said Thursday at a breakfast sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor newspaper.Cruz, whose state is among those with the most registered guns, said he believes the CEOs are more motivated by a desire to win approval from their "country club" friends than a full understanding of gun violence and public policy."This is about social signaling at the country club," he said. The letter urges Congress to expand background checks and "red flag" laws, legislation that would enable law enforcement to temporarily take guns away from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.Earlier this year, the House of Representatives passed legislation that would strengthen federal background check laws.But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that he wants clear support from President Donald Trump in order for the Senate to vote on the measure.On Wednesday, Trump said "lots of things" were under discussion. The Wall Street Journal reported that White House aides were expected to brief the president on Thursday with a range of legislative and policy options for guns.The letter was signed by the chief executives of Uber, Twitter, publisher Conde Nast, retailer Gap and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, among other companies. It also was signed by Thrive Capital's Joshua Kushner, who is the brother of White House adviser and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.The letter was not signed by CEOs from large tech companies, including Apple, Facebook and Google, or Wall Street banks. Also missing from the signatories was Doug McMillon, the CEO of Walmart.McMillon announced then that Walmart, the country's largest retailer and employer, would stop selling ammunition that could be used in assault rifles following two shootings at its stores, one in El Paso, Texas, on Aug 3 that killed 22 people.Walmart also asked customers at Walmart and Sam's Club to no longer openly carry firearms, a move followed by other retailers, including grocery chains Kroger and Wegmans and drugstore chains CVS and Walgreens.

                    Housing costs send some in California to RVs
                </p>

                Marvin and his family moved into a recreational vehicle on a street in Mountain View, California, two years ago, after their apartment rent became unaffordable.The 27-year-old Walmart employee, who gave only his first name, now lives with his mother, elder sister, younger brother and his sister's 4-year-old daughter in the RV, which has two beds, a sofa bed and a sofa.Despite the lack of personal space and the roar of trains whizzing by, Marvin said living in the RV is convenient, as the family can use bathrooms in a nearby park and shower at a gym. The biggest upside is the cost: the RV rental is only $500 a month."We can save up more money. I hope we can move into apartment and my niece can go to a kindergarten," he said.Dozens of camper vans and RVs are parked on Crisanto Avenue. Some are in a dilapidated state with rusted side panels; some of the windows are covered with aluminum foil; one van has a flat tire on the back.Another van, whose windows are not fully covered, is packed with so many items that one can hardly imagine there¡¯s any living space left.The people in vehicles parked on Crisanto Avenue and on other streets in several California cities are the fallout from the state's lack of affordable housing. California has the nation's steepest home prices and the highest state poverty rate once housing costs are figured in, according to officials.Not all those sleeping in vehicles are without a job. Some have been priced out of renting an apartment or house or somehow have economically been forced out of their homes.Maria, a woman in her 60s, recently became an RV resident after losing her job in a nursery due to knee problems."Her husband still works at the nursery. She relies on her husband now. I also take care of her sometimes," Rosario, Maria's niece, told China Daily, as Maria doesn't speak English.Rosario, who preferred to be identified by his first name only, said most of the RV dwellers there are experiencing similar situations. What makes the situation difficult is that they are often forced to move their vehicles by police or get parking tickets, she said.A similar scene took place along Church Street, outside Eagle Park, about a 30-minute walk from Crisanto Avenue. A resident said the street has been an RV park at least for the two years since he moved here.About two miles from the park in Mountain View is the sprawling headquarters of Google. The tech company, which has 45,000 employees in the region, has been criticized by activists for contributing to rising rents and a housing shortage.Google and other tech giants such as Facebook and Apple have been urged to accept responsibility and to address their impact on rents and housing prices. In June, Google announced it would invest $1 billion to develop affordable housing and address homelessness in the region.In Mountain View, rents have increased 50 percent since 2010, according to a report by activist group Silicon Valley Rising in April 2018."Unaffordable rents have pushed working people in Mountain View into the RVs that now line many city streets," says the report.In Santa Clara County, the center of Silicon Valley, the homeless population has increased by 31 percent since 2017, and now stands at about 9,706, according to the county's 2019 homeless census and survey.This year's survey found 18 percent of the respondents staying in a vehicle, a "substantial" increase from previous years. The number of individuals living in cars, RVs and vans has increased 146 percent since 2015, reaching 3,655 individuals in 2019.People are living in vehicles not just because of the high cost of housing but also because they have encountered personal events that led to financial challenges, or they prefer sleeping in an RV or car to long daily commutes, according to a recent report by Palo Alto's Policy and Services Committee."I stay here on weekdays only," said Andrew, who gave only his first name, while cleaning his trailer parked on El Camino Real, just outside Stanford University in Palo Alto.The plumber has been working on construction sites at Stanford University in the past few years. But his family lives in Sacramento, 120 miles away, for the low rents there.The round trip usually takes him six hours, so he chooses to sleep in the trailer during the week and go home on weekends to join his wife and son.He said he knew several construction workers living in RVs as well. "It's easy to find work but difficult to find a place to live," he said.The mile-long stretch of El Camino Real is lined with vans, RVs and cars. Residents have been complaining about safety, "blight caused by unkempt RVs", sanitation issues and parking impact, according to the city's Policy and Services Committee report.Many other cities in California have reported an increase in people living in RVs, small campers and cars on residential streets, in industrial parks and church parking lots.In San Francisco, 1,794 people live in vehicles, which accounts for 68 percent of the rise in homeless population between 2017 and 2019, according to the city's homeless count released in May.The city of Oakland found the number of people living in vehicles in 2019 almost doubled that of 2017.In the Greater Los Angeles area, more than 16,500 people were living in their cars, vans and RVs in 2019, almost 1,000 more than last year, according to the area's homeless count.California had about 130,000 homeless people as of 2018, according to the US Interagency Council on Homelessness. The number is second-highest in state history after the Great San Francisco Earthquake in 1906 left more than 200,000 people homeless.A recent survey by Quinnipiac University found that more than 80 percent of the 1,125 Californian voters say homelessness in California is a "very serious" issue and that nearly 60 percent of them say the cost of housing is a major cause.San Francisco is the most expensive rental market in the US, followed by New York and Boston, according to a June report by San Francisco-based rental platform Zumper. Average rent for a one bedroom is $3,700, and two bedrooms is $4,720, says the report.In San Jose, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $2,524 a month; in Mountain View, rents for a two-bedroom have reached nearly $4,000 a month, as Google has pursued aggressive expansion plans, according to the Silicon Valley Rising report.The affordable housing crisis, partly due to wages not keeping pace with low-wage families' housing costs, has forced the families to cram together in small apartments and make unhealthy trade-offs between rent and other essentials, according to the report.The cities, under the pressure to get RV dwellers off the street, are launching "safe parking programs". Mountain View has partnered with non-profit organizations to use a former light-rail stop as a parking site for vehicle-dwellers and eventually, an affordable housing project. Palo Alto is in the process of selecting potential sites.San Francisco also is taking action on opening a Vehicle Triage Center near a railway station, which would provide safe parking and basic services – bathrooms, sanitation and social services –to people living in vehicles.The proposal by Supervisor Ahsha Safai was met with strong opposition from local residents who consider the RV dwellers a nuisance or an eyesore that brings down the value of their communities.Despite the residents' protest, San Francisco has recently approved the proposal to transform a parking lot into a safe lot for vehicle-dwellers. The pilot program for 33 RVs and cars would last a year. After that, the land would be turned into affordable housing by the city.Those that are living in vehicles are not the "hardcore homeless" that people think about, such as those with drug addictions or mental health issues, said Safai. "They are a very different subset of the homeless population," he said.Dozens of RVs and vans parked along Crisanto Avenue, close to Rengstorff Park in Mountain View, California.

                Marvin and his family moved into a recreational vehicle on a street in Mountain View, California, two years ago, after their apartment rent became unaffordable. The 27-year-old Walmart employee, who gave only his first name, lives with his mother, elder sister, younger brother and his sister's four-year-old daughter in the RV, which has two beds, a sofa bed and a sofa. Despite the lack of personal space and the noise of trains whizzing by, Marvin said living in the RV is convenient as the family can use bathrooms in a nearby park and shower at a gym. The biggest upside is the RV rental is only $500 a month. Depending on the size and features, an RV can cost anywhere from $10,000 to $300,000. "We can save up more money. I hope we can move into apartment and my niece can go to a kindergarten," he said. Dozens of camper vans and RVs are parked on Crisanto Avenue. Some are in a dilapidated state. People in vehicles on Crisanto Avenue and other streets in several California cities are a fallout of the state's lack of affordable housing. California has the nation's highest home prices, according to officials. Maria, a woman aged about 60, recently became an RV resident after losing her job in a nursery due to knee problems. "Her husband still works at the nursery. She relies on her husband now. I also take care of her sometimes," Rosario, Maria's niece, said, as Maria doesn't speak English. Rosario, who preferred to be identified only by her first name, said most of the RV dwellers there are experiencing similar situations. They are often forced to move their vehicles by police or get parking tickets, she said. The same scene is along Church Street, outside the Eagle Park, about a 30-minute walk from Crisanto Avenue. About two miles from the park in Mountain View is Google's headquarters. The tech company with 45,000 employees in the region has been criticized by activists for contributing to rising rents. Google and other tech giants such as Facebook and Apple have been urged to address their impact on rents and housing prices. In June, Google announced it would invest $1 billion to develop affordable housing and address homelessness in the region. In Mountain View, rents have increased 50 percent since 2010, according to a report by activist group Silicon Valley Rising in April 2018. "Unaffordable rents have pushed working people into the RVs that now line many city streets," says the report. In Santa Clara County, the center of Silicon Valley, 18 percent of respondents were staying in a vehicle, a "substantial" increase from previous years, according to the county's 2019 homeless census and survey. The number of individuals living in cars, RVs and vans has increased 146 percent since 2015, reaching 3,655 in 2019. People are living in vehicles not just because of the high cost of housing but also because they have encountered personal events that lead to financial challenges, or they prefer sleeping in an RV or car to long daily commutes, according to a recent report by Palo Alto's Policy and Services Committee. Many other cities in California have reported an increase in people living in RVs, small campers and cars on residential streets, in industrial parks and church parking lots. In San Francisco, 1,794 people live in vehicles, or 68 percent rise in the homeless population between 2017 and 2019, according to the city's homeless count released in May. In the Greater Los Angeles Area, more than 16,500 people live in their cars, vans and RVs in 2019, almost 1,000 more than that of last year, according to the area's homeless count. San Francisco is the most expensive rental market in the US, followed by New York and Boston, according to a June report by San Francisco-based rental platform Zumper. Average rent for a one-bedroom is $3,700; two-bedrooms $4,720. In San Jose, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $2,524 a month; in Mountain View, rents for two bedroom have reached nearly $4,000 a month as Google aggressively expands, according to the Silicon Valley Rising report. The cities, under pressure to get RV dwellers off the street, are launching "safe parking programs". Mountain View has partnered with nonprofit organizations to use a former light rail stop as a parking site for vehicle dwellers and eventually, an affordable housing project. Palo Alto is in the process of selecting potential sites. San Francisco is opening a Vehicle Triage Center near a railway station, which would provide safe parking and basic services - bathrooms, sanitation, and social services - to people living in vehicles. liazhu@chinadailyusa.com (China Daily Global 09/19/2019 page3)
