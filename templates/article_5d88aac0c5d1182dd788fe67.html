            <p class="style-content">
                MILAN - After being elected to the board of the European Club Association (ECA) on Tuesday, Inter Milan president Steven Zhang said he was ready to shake up European soccer with his youthful energy and enthusiasm.Zhang, 27, becomes the first Chinese among the 24 board members of the ECA, which represents 246 clubs, elected on a four-year mandate until 2023."I'm young, but age doesn't matter," Zhang told journalists in Geneva."I bring my energy and my enthusiasm, new ideas to European soccer. I feel ready at my age for the new job."Zhang - appointed Inter president last October - is the son of Zhang Jindong, chairman of the Chinese Suning Commerce Group, which has owned a controlling stake in Inter since 2016."Suning has been in soccer for five or six years, I have been in charge of Inter for three. I'm still in a learning phase," said Zhang."I can offer my freshness, my competence and even a global vision of soccer."I started working very young and I went ahead step by step. My age is not exceptional at all."In China and the United States, many young entrepreneurs hold management positions. The new generation is full of energy and ideas."Soccer can no longer be limited to the 90 minutes of the game. Technology, video clips and social networks are increasingly important."Zhang also believes three-time former European champion Inter can turn back the clock under new coach Antonio Conte as it embarks on a second consecutive Champions League campaign.The 18-time Italian league champion last won Serie A in 2010, the year it also won the Champions League, when under Jose Mourinho it became the first Italian team to clinch the treble."We have a great coach, who only arrived a 100 days ago, and we are supporting him 200 percent," Zhang said."We have bought many young players and even if I know everyone is enthusiastic and would like to win the Scudetto and the Champions League immediately, we must give him time to work. The results will come."Zhang said the principle of non-discrimination is "embedded in the DNA" of the club, after a widely criticized response from ultras fans to striker Romelu Lukaku being targeted for racial abuse.Lukaku, who is black, was recently subjected to monkey chants by Cagliari fans after the Belgium forward scored a penalty.A group of Inter fans later suggested such apparent abuse is not racist in Italy, and was a tactic they also used to unsettle opposing players.Zhang said the club's inclusive history makes him believe "for a lot of fans, when they did it, the intention was not bad".He said soccer is "not for violence, it's not for racism "and can be a force to educate people around the world.AFP/AP

                MILAN－Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Sunday he expected to finalize talks to form a new government by Wednesday, as the 5-Star Movement and Democratic Party held intense discussions over the weekend to hammer out a deal on a common agenda and Cabinet posts.Italian President Sergio Mattarella gave Conte a mandate on Thursday to try to form a new coalition following Interior Minister Matteo Salvini's decision to pull his right-wing League from a 14-month-old alliance with 5-Star in an attempt to trigger early elections.Conte said the "political mood" between 5-Star and once bitter adversary Democratic Party, or PD, was good."It will be on Tuesday, Wednesday at the latest," he said in a video interview during a conference organized by Il Fatto Quotidiano newspaper, when asked when he would report back to Mattarella with a program and a lineup for the new government."Obviously I am confident on a positive outcome." he added.If no agreement is sealed in the coming week, Mattarella is expected to dissolve parliament and set a date for a new vote.In a sign that a deal on the program might be closer, the 5-Star Movement said later on Sunday its members were called on Tuesday to give a green light to a potential coalition accord with PD through a web-based ballot on the movement's internet platform.Members will have to answer whether they agree that the movement should form a government with the PD, chaired by Conte, the 5-Star official blog said, in line with the party's credo of direct democracy.The blog added that the government program agreed with PD would be available online to members when voting starts.Making an attemptStung by what it saw as betrayal and keen to avoid a return to the ballot box, the 5-Star has agreed to make an attempt to govern with the PD, which is in the process of rebuilding after a string of election defeats.Despite the differences over policy and ministerial roles, senior figures from both sides spoke in support of a coalition over the weekend as the talks have continued."I know it is difficult, but we're doing our best to give this country a new government," PD leader Nicola Zingaretti said on Sunday in a video post on Twitter.He said on Friday after talks with Conte that Italy's next government must cut income taxes to boost consumption, relaunch investment and focus on health and education.Reuters

                    Online vote to decide Italy's future

            <p class="style-content">
                Members of Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement were due to vote online on Tuesday on whether they approved a new coalition with the opposition Democratic Party, known as PD, with fresh elections looming if the pact is rejected.On Monday, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte urged members of 5-Star to back the coalition, saying the planned government could transform Italy.About 100,000 people who subscribe to 5-Star's so-called Rousseau website were asked to answer the question: "Do you agree that the 5-Star Movement should form a government together with the Democratic Party, chaired by Giuseppe Conte?"Conte on Monday delivered a video speech, through Facebook, to Rousseau subscribers, saying: "I understand your concerns. But I'd also like to remember that the 5-Star, before the elections last year, had said they were ready to join any political force that was ready to carry out the movement's political agenda. Today, we have a great chance to change this country."Shortly after he spoke, 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio also took to Facebook, but delivered a more subdued message and refused to advise his party members on how to vote."There is no right or wrong vote, there are your ideas and the sum of your ideas will guide the movement," Di Maio said. "Don't be afraid ... we have already won, the world is waiting for the democratic outcome of your vote to know Italy's future."An SWG opinion poll for La7 television channel said 51 percent of 5-Star supporters backed a tie-up with the PD, while some 69 percent of PD voters endorsed the idea. Though the two parties are longstanding enemies, they are also the two largest parties in Parliament.Italian President Sergio Mattarella gave Conte a mandate last week to try to form a new coalition following Interior Minister Matteo Salvini's decision to pull his right-wing League from a 14-month-old alliance with 5-Star in an attempt to trigger early elections.If no agreement is sealed in the coming week, Mattarella is expected to dissolve Parliament and set a date for a new vote.The 5-Star party's internet portal stated that the government program agreed with the PD would be available online to members when voting started.Despite differences over policy and ministerial roles, senior figures from both sides spoke in support of a coalition over the weekend as the talks have continued."I know it is difficult, but we're doing our best to give this country a new government," PD leader Nicola Zingaretti said on Sunday in a video post on Twitter.After talks with Conte, he said on Friday that Italy's next government must cut income taxes to boost consumption, relaunch investment and focus on health and education.

                    Conte is set to lead new Italian govt
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Italy's president met Giuseppe Conte on Wednesday to formally ask him to lead a new government, marking the end of a turbulent chapter in the nation's political story in which Conte outmaneuvered his ambitious adversary Matteo Salvini.Conte, a professor of law by trade, will lead a coalition government comprising the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party, which is also known as PD.Salvini had earlier hoped to win power through snap elections after forcing his then collaborator, Conte, from office as prime minister, but his plan failed and the new coalition means an election has been avoided.Conte's new coalition of formerly rival political parties will now edge Italy toward the center ground from the previous government's more right-wing standpoint, likely ensuring better relations with the European Union, with which Salvini frequently quarreled over issues including the bloc's immigration policy.Conte brands himself as an independent and first came to the public's attention a year ago when he was chosen to lead a coalition between Five Star and the right-wing League led by Salvini.Salvini criticized his former coalition partners Five Star for teaming up with PD to form the new government, saying his time in opposition will be short."From today, you will see me even more completely p***ed off and determined than before," the Financial Times quoted Salvini as saying. "I will go from town to town and we will take this country back."His party had fared well in European parliamentary elections earlier this year and, buoyed by that and encouraging opinion polls, he had ended the coalition his League party had formed with Five Star, forcing Conte to resign as prime minister after calling for a vote of no confidence in him.But his plan to bring down the government he participated in and force a general election in a bid to capitalize on his party's popularity backfired when his former coalition partners, Five Star, teamed up with PD.Before meeting with President Sergio Mattarella in Rome on Wednesday, the new government released a 26-point provisional program pledging to pursue an "expansive" budget "without compromising public finances".The new government also called on the EU's political leaders to be flexible with budgetary rules, so Italy can introduce policies to stimulate its slumbering economy.The FT quoted Luigi Di Maio, the political leader of Five Star and formerly a joint deputy prime minister alongside the defeated Salvini, as saying the partnership with PD will ensure his party's work can continue."This will not be a left-wing or a right-wing government but a government that has to do what is right," Di Maio said.The BBC said PD leader Nicola Zingaretti has promised "the real change Italy needs", which will likely include a reversal or relaxation of Salvini's earlier decision to close Italian ports to boats carrying migrants from other nations.The new coalition also hopes to introduce a minimum wage, cut taxes, and plans extra spending on education, social security, and research as well as a tax on internet giants and a reduction in the number of lawmakers in Parliament.Bloomberg reported that the financial markets reacted well to the new government, with Italian bonds rallying for a third straight day.

                    Italy's new govt wins first of two confidence votes

            <p class="style-content">
                ROME - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte entered the home stretch Monday of his effort to be formally installed as the head of his second consecutive government, promising a "more respectful" and more pro-European government.The Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Italy's parliament, on Monday voted comfortably to support Conte's government by a majority of 343 votes in favor and 263 against. Before it can be formally installed, Conte and his list of ministers must win a similar vote in the Senate Tuesday.Opinion polls show support for the new government headed by the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party on the rise, topping 40 percent in the latest survey from the polling firm Opinioni."Italy is very divided right now, and it will be a great challenge for any leader to unite the country," Maria Rossi, the firm's co-director, told Xinhua.Addressing lawmakers for one hour and 20 minutes, Conte called for a period of "reform and stability" and promised that his cabinet would open "a new, and hopefully decisive season of reforms.""We must recover our sobriety," Conte said. "Our citizens must develop a renewed faith in our institutions. In the coming months, we cannot waste our time with disputes and clashes."He stressed this government would move in accordance with the European Union (EU) to regain a pro-European stance that has long been traditional for Italy, one of the founding members of the integration process.According to Nicola Pasini, a political scientist with the State University of Milan, Conte's remarks ahead of Monday's vote were designed to "illustrate a break from the previous government" in terms of European relations and other key topics.Pasini told Xinhua that Conte's message was aimed not only at those set to vote in parliament and to Italian citizens but also to those following events from elsewhere in Europe and at the European Commission in Brussels."I think the European Commission will do what it can to have a stable, pro-European government in Italy," Pasini said. "Conte's remarks were meant to illustrate to the commission that his government will be what the commissioners want."Conte's new cabinet was sworn in on Thursday after the previous one, also led by Conte, collapsed on Aug 20 under pressure from the right-wing League party.

                Rebirth of steel plant in Serbia among examples of initiative's wide success Editor's note: Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy is the fundamental guideline for China's diplomatic work in the new era. China Daily is publishing a series of stories to examine how Xi's proposals have become internationally accepted and contributed to world peace and human progress. When President Xi Jinping visited the Smederevo steel plant in Serbia in June 2016, he received a warm welcome from the workers, who held up large portraits of him in greeting. Their jobs had been at risk earlier, as the former state-owned steel plant, founded in 1913 and once the epitome of Serbia's industrial success, was on the brink of bankruptcy. Light dawned during Xi's visit, however. The plant was purchased by Chinese steel giant HBIS, and all its 5,000 Serbian employees kept their jobs. The company, renamed Hesteel Serbia after the takeover, was profitable by the following December. Last year, it produced 1.77 million metric tons of steel, the most in its centurylong history. The rebirth of the Smederevo steel plant is "a story about changes, a story about success and a story about progress", Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said during an inspection of the steel mill in July last year. The success of the company is a vivid example of how China's Belt and Road Initiative has benefited people around the world. In a speech delivered at Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan in September 2013, Xi unveiled his flagship Silk Road Economic Belt concept, which he hailed as "a great cause that will bring benefits to the people along the routes". The following month, Xi proposed the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road in a speech to the Indonesian parliament. The Belt and Road Initiative has blossomed ever since. After six years of development, the BRI has been translated from a visionary proposal to concrete practices. About 136 countries and 30 international organizations had signed BRI cooperation agreements with China as of the end of August. From 2013 to 2018, trade between China and other BRI countries surpassed $6 trillion, and China's investment in those countries exceeded $90 billion. Last year, Chinese companies invested $15.64 billion in countries cooperating in the BRI, a year-on-year increase of 8.9 percent, according to the Ministry of Commerce. In April, China hosted the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, which was attended by about 6,000 participants from 150 countries and 92 international organizations. "We should forge a global connectivity partnership to achieve common development and prosperity," Xi said at the forum. "As long as we work together to help each other, even if thousands of miles apart, we will certainly be able to find a mutually beneficial and win-win road." Since putting forward the BRI six years ago, Xi has frequently promoted it on multiple international occasions. "Wherever President Xi went, he took the Belt and Road and produced a harvest of practical cooperation there," State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in March after Xi wrapped up a visit to Italy, Monaco and France. The trip took Xi to the western end of the ancient Silk Road and boosted Eurasian interconnectivity through the BRI, Wang said. Witnessed by Xi and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on jointly developing the Belt and Road. Italy was the first G7 country to sign such an agreement with China. France and Germany also showed interest in boosting BRI-related cooperation through third-party markets to improve infrastructure in Africa. It is pragmatic and visionary for Italy to make the strategic decision to join the Belt and Road, as it could inject new momentum into infrastructure construction there, said Jin Yong, a professor of international relations at Communication University of China. There is great potential for China to enhance Belt and Road cooperation with the rest of the world in such areas as artificial intelligence, big data and 5G technology, he said. Juan Carlos Capunay, Peru's former ambassador to China, said the BRI is the best solution for countries that want to embrace open business environments and build up their economies by joining global groups like the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization. The BRI was put forward at a time when anti-globalization movements were rising, and it advocates cultural dialogue and economic openness, which is crucial for the development of the world economy, he said. "The BRI and its interconnectivity is helpful to promote the development of Peru's trade, investment and tourism, and it will connect Peru with countries in Central Asia and Southeast Asia, bringing huge benefits for Peru," Capunay told China Daily. Since the start of the year, Xi has made five overseas visits to a total of eight countries and attended four multilateral gatherings to forge a broader consensus and closer partnerships. Enhancing BRI cooperation is a major topic on his agenda. During his state visit to Russia in early June, Xi said the two countries should proactively push forward the connection between the Belt and Road and the Eurasian Economic Union and dedicate themselves to promoting the integration of the regional economy. In Xi's talks with Kyrgyzstan's President Sooronbay Jeenbekov and Tajikistan's President Emomali Rahmon in Bishkek and Dushanbe, the leaders agreed to implement the outcomes of the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation and bring high quality to the Belt and Road. In his speech at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, Xi told global leaders that the BRI aims to mobilize more resources, boost interconnectivity, release the driving forces of the economy and encourage the integration of more countries and regions into a global economic network. A study by the World Bank found that fully implementing deeper policy reforms related to the BRI would lift 32 million people out of moderate poverty, increase global trade by up to 6.2 percent and increase global income by as much as 2.9 percent. Ruan Zongze, executive vice-president of the China Institute of International Studies, said the BRI, which focuses on promoting development, is capable not only of promoting the opening-up of China, but also bringing more benefits to the whole world. Facing such challenges as anti-globalization movements, geopolitical risks and rising trade protectionism, the BRI has also encountered some problems, Ruan said, noting that some countries have accused China of setting a debt trap by promoting BRI projects. Wang, the foreign minister, said at a news conference in March that the BRI does not involve debt traps but "pies" that could bring benefits to people. It's not a geopolitical tool but an opportunity for common development, he said. Through participation in the Belt and Road, countries have sped up their development process and improved the livelihoods of their people, he said. At the Malaysia-China Belt and Road Economic Cooperation Forum in Kuala Lumpur last month, Malaysian Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said Malaysia supports the BRI to encourage sustainable development throughout Asia and bring the region closer together. "We will continue to facilitate Chinese investment in Malaysia - particularly the high-tech industries and innovation-based services," he said. Aleksandar Duncevic, an electrician at Hesteel Serbia, said that after the Chinese company bought the factory, the biggest change has been that he feels "more certainty and security". "Every one of my colleagues is happy with the new management. We no longer feel stressed," he said. Xinhua contributed to this story. anbaijie@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 09/17/2019 page1)
