                Indonesia finds design flaw, oversight lapses in 737 MAX crash - WSJ
            </p>
            <p>
                Indonesian investigators have found that design and oversight lapses played a key role in the October 2018 crash of Boeing Co's 737 MAX jet that killed all 189 people aboard, the Wall Street Journal said on Sunday.The draft conclusions, expected to be the first formal government finding of flaws in the design and US regulatory approval, also identify a string of pilot errors and maintenance mistakes as causal factors of the Lion Air crash, the WSJ said.The Boeing 737 MAX has been grounded since March in the aftermath of two fatal crashes in five months.A Boeing spokesman did not comment on the newspaper report but said the plane maker continued to offer support to the investigating authorities as they complete their report.Soerjanto Tjahjono, the head of Indonesia's transport safety committee, told Reuters he could not comment before the release of the final report, which is expected by early November.He said several stakeholders, but not all, had already provided feedback on a draft of the final report that has not been released publicly.The draft was circulated to parties including Boeing, Lion Air and the US Federal Aviation Administration on Aug 24."There are stakeholders that have sent their answers to us and we are evaluating them," Tjahjono said.US air crash investigators are readying to announce a handful of separate safety recommendations, from bolstering pilots' manual flying skills to boosting FAA vetting of new aircraft designs, the WSJ added.Around month-end, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is expected to call for improvements to cockpit training and crew decision-making and focus on potential changes to certification of new airliners, the newspaper said.The NTSB declined to comment on the WSJ report but said it planned to release recommendations on the FAA's certification program sometime in September.The FAA welcomed the scrutiny from safety experts and looked forward to their findings, it said in a statement."We continue to work with other international aviation safety regulators and will carefully consider all recommendations," it added. "The FAA will incorporate any changes that would improve our certification activities." Reuters

                China-US trade tensions likely to affect help to global poor: Bill Gates
            </a>
            <p>
                Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has warned that trade tensions between China and the United States are likely to affect global initiatives aimed at conquering poverty, contagious diseases and other global woes.Gates, who founded the foundation in 2000 with the aim of helping people around the world lead healthy, productive lives, told Chinese media recently that a healthy and constructive relationship between China and the US not only benefits the two countries, but also bolsters progress toward addressing major global issues."I see anything that cuts down global cooperation as a potential step backward, where the people who would get hurt the most by it are the poorest in the world," he said ahead of the launch of the foundation's Goalkeepers Data Report on Tuesday, an annual report card on efforts to improve living conditions for people worldwide, especially those in poor countries.As concerns run high that the China-US trade war might trigger a global economic downturn, Gates said foreign aid donations, which were determined by overall government budgets, would possibly take a hit.He said the idea of caring for other people, like African children dying of malaria, could be dismissed or made less of a priority. "People tend to turn inward when government budgets get tight," Gates said.In a worst-case scenario, the mortality rates of infectious disease would go up, as critical medicines that treat malaria, tuberculosis and some HIV drugs risk losing their efficacy due to potential resistance, Gates said."If we don't get generous contributions to those organizations (that deliver vaccines), it results in literally millions of deaths," he said. "If you don't keep infectious diseases in check, they just keep expanding and expanding."A self-proclaimed "impatient optimist", Gates said he feels upbeat about future trade talks between the two countries."I'm a huge believer that China and the US getting along is the most important bilateral relationship in the world," he said. "I'm hopeful that the trade problems can get behind us and that we can go on to work constructively together."Gates said the partnership between the foundation and China is progressing at full speed and had deepened over the years.Last year, China unveiled its International Development Cooperation Agency, which is responsible for overseeing and coordinating the country's expanding foreign assistance programs.The foundation is now working with the agency, Gates said."It has helped us understand China's priorities and to coordinate our work with China in an even better way," he said.The foundation launched the Goalkeepers Data Report in 2017 as an initiative to spur action and chart progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015.The 2019 report examines the issue of inequality across genders, districts and countries and discusses transferable practices that can help close the gap.

                Chinese liquor brand Wang Mao has bolstered its fashionista credentials this week with the first-ever sponsorship collaboration between London Fashion Week and a Chinese spirit maker.Wang Mao, a sub-brand of well-known baijiu maker Moutai, has become an official spirit partner of London Fashion Week September 2019.Usually distilled from sorghum and wheat, baijiu contains between 40 and 60 percent alcohol by volume, and is a mainstay of special social occasions in China, from Spring Festival dinners to weddings and business banquets.Founded in 1879, Wang Mao was merged to become the State-run Moutai Distillery in the early 1950s, and the brand was relaunched in 2018 by Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd to target the 30-to 50-year-old customer group.Yuan Bin, chief executive of Wang Mao, hailed the collaboration, saying the brand takes pride in the heritage of Chinese culture while also valuing the creativity and fashion sense."London Fashion Week, from what we see, is a unique one amongst the four big international fashion weeks, because on one hand it highlights the history and tradition, but at the same time it absorbs innovative ideas and concepts, which fits in very well with our brand," Yuan said.As part of the collaboration, Wang Mao was able to promote its products at the London Fashion Week September 2019, with two cocktails being created using the liquor as their base ingredient.Gemma Juviler, commercial director at British Fashion Council, which organizes London Fashion Week, said it was a win-win partnership."What the British Fashion Council has done, with our international strategy, is really focus on China, because when we're helping designers to build and grow their business, one of the most important structures that they can think about is how to successfully enter the Chinese market," she said."Given its resonance with an international market, specifically in China, I think associating Chinese brands such as Wang Mao with the British Fashion Council and particularly London Fashion Week is a really good message for the audience back in China."Drinks columnist Douglas Blyde welcomed the partnership, saying: "It is a vote of confidence from China to the UK to invest alongside the catwalk here. With the right guidance, Wang Mao could create some amazing, memorable drinks which will be as flamboyant and distinctive as the fashion spectacles they may be enjoyed alongside."With more Chinese businesses keen to make inroads into the international arena, Wang Mao is not alone in tapping into the potential of the major fashion platforms.Since 2018, Alibaba's Tmall has held special China Day events at the last four New York Fashion Weeks, showing the best in Chinese fashion.And Chinese e-commerce giant JD has a three-year partnership with the British Fashion Council that runs until the end of 2021, to provide a channel for Chinese brands at London Fashion Week.

                University helps bolster Sino-Egyptian relations
            </a>
            <p>
                CAIRO - Sitting on a vast area of land with several premises in Cairo, the Egyptian Chinese University, which opened four years ago, is the only one of its kind in Egypt. Not a traditional university with specific textbooks, it teaches students by holding lectures and providing access to its digital library, and preparing them for postgraduate self-learning skills that are necessary for the labor market.It has faculties of engineering and technology, economics and international trade, and physical therapy, and has provided educational services to about 2,500 students so far. Next year, the pharmacy section will be opened as the fourth faculty."The university has deepened Egypt-China cooperation and enhanced learning from the Chinese experience in the fields of education and scientific research," says Ashraf el-Shihy, the ECU president and Egypt's former higher education minister.

                Chengdu and Dubai bolstering trade ties
            </a>
            <p>
                Chengdu, capital of Southwest China's Sichuan province, has strengthened economic cooperation with Dubai in the United Arab Emirates under the Belt and Road Initiative, through a trade cooperation conference held in Dubai earlier this month. Dubai is a transport hub in the Middle East, linking West Asia and North Africa. The city is also a center for commerce, logistics, exhibitions and finance, ranked ninth among the top 10 world cities by Globalization and World Cities in 2018. Chengdu is also an important gateway to Southwest China. As a key point on the trade routes of the BRI, it plays an active role in promoting international exchanges, and has acted as a business hub in Southwest China from ancient times to the present. In early September, the Chengdu-Dubai Economic and Trade Cooperation Conference was held in Dubai, where eight companies from Chengdu signed agreements with six companies in Dubai, with a total investment value of 37.4 billion yuan ($5.3 billion). Chengdu Xgimi Technology, a manufacturer of high-performance multifunctional smart projectors, is one of the beneficiaries. "Many companies in Dubai, including the biggest shopping mall in the country, Dubai Mall, have shown great interest in our products," said an executive from the company. According to Chengdu Xgimi, the conference provided a platform to find out more about customer demands in Dubai. At the same time, the company said it hoped to find high-quality distributors at the conference, who will assist in showcasing the company's products and expand its market share in the country. Also at the conference, Sheme, a woman's shoe brand from Chengdu, announced it was in talks with Dubai Mall to open a store there. The Chengdu logistics office shared the Chinese city's concepts and practices in building an international logistics hub in western China and the Chengdu Association of Building Economy Promotion briefed participants on international cooperation projects in Chengdu. Cooperation between the two cities dates back to 2011, when Chengdu and Dubai International Financial Center launched a joint financial project. Chengdu opened a direct flight to Dubai in 2016, and in June this year, the two cities signed an agreement to build an international airport shopping center. "Chengdu is an important trade and logistics center in Southwest China, a high-tech industrial base and a transportation hub with strong comprehensive strength and enormous development prospects," Li Xuhang, consul general of China in Dubai, told the conference. "The city has become a preferred place for many domestic and foreign companies to launch investment," Li said. He said the development plans for Chengdu and Dubai are highly complementary and have great potential under the BRI. Many Chengdu companies have opened branches in Dubai, which plays an important role in accelerating the pace of Chinese companies going global and expanding Chinese companies' international influence, Li added. At the conference, the Chengdu delegation brought with them special local ingredients and cooked traditional food, including dandan noodles, mapo tofu and minced beef pancakes. Hu Jiafeng, head of Chengdu's cooking association, said:"As one of the important exchanges between Chengdu and Dubai, cuisine can promote extensive cooperation in culture, economy, trade and tourism between the two cities." Giant pandas and cuisine are the most iconic calling cards of Chengdu. In addition to its delicious food, the city staff also dressed up as pandas at Dubai Mall on Sept 6, attracting much local attention. A resident named Abdulla said it was amazing to see a panda from Chengdu in Dubai and added he was interested in hotpot and the history of the Chinese city. Chengdu officials said they have realized that their city cannot gain such momentum without cooperation with other cities worldwide and that they hope to seize more opportunities to work with global companies. Based on the development of its business, tourism, finance and technology, Chengdu is looking forward to partnering with Dubai, an official with the Chengdu bureau of commerce said at the conference. According to official statistics, foreign trade between Chengdu and the UAE totaled 3 billion yuan in 2018, increasing 19.9 percent year-on-year. The figure reached 1.7 billion yuan in the first half of this year, jumping 42.1 percent compared with same period last year. An official from the Chengdu bureau of commerce said the city is looking forward to launching more projects with Dubai in business, advanced technology, financial services, commerce and logistics, aviation and tourism, as well as strengthening communication in culture, education, technology, sports and environmental protection. "We hope to deepen cooperation and attract more Arab companies to invest in Chengdu and expand their market in western China, as efforts to promote the development of the industries and companies in the two cities and achieve a win-win situation," the official said. caoyingying@chinadaily.com.cn  Deals with a total investment value of 37.4 billion yuan ($5.3 billion) are signed during the ChengduDubai Economic and Trade Cooperation Conference held in Dubai earlier this month.

                Sub-Saharan Africa's tourism shows great potential, report says
            </a>
            <p>
                CAPE TOWN - South Africa has emerged as one of the highest-ranked countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, according to the latest Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report. The report, which ranks 140 countries on their relative strengths in global tourism and travel, was released on the sideline of the World Economic Forum on Africa in Cape Town. Although Sub-Saharan Africa is the lowest-ranking travel-and-tourism region in this year's report - with all but three of the countries performing lower than the global average - the region is expected to have the second-highest growth rate in tourism over the next 10 years, the report says. This may bolster the region's attractiveness to international investment in travel and tourism, it predicts. The report says Africa also has huge potential for nature-based tourism thanks to its relatively underdeveloped but rich natural resources. Mauritius is the highest-ranking Sub-Saharan country, largely due to its good business environment, and hygiene and international-openness scores. South Africa is second, followed by Seychelles. Rwanda currently leads the region in safety and security, while Tanzania ranks first in terms of natural resources. When considered by sub-region, Southern Africa is the most competitive, especially outscoring other sub-regions in tourist-service infrastructure, prioritization of travel and tourism, and price competitiveness. East Africa comes in second and West Africa ranks third. The report also says that West Africa has seen the highest growth in travel-and-tourism competitiveness in the region. The index reveals the sector's resilience but warns of an approaching "tipping point", where such factors as less-expensive travel and fewer tourist barriers increase demand to unsustainable levels. The burden of over-tourism is already being felt by many travel hot spots, the report says. Xinhua (China Daily Global 09/18/2019 page15)

                Efforts to improve senior care renewed
            </a>
            <p>
                For years, ailing residents of nursing homes have struggled with an elderly care system that mostly does not offer reimbursable medical service as hospitals do, despite recent progress.To avoid the bills, they were made to shift constantly between hospitals and care facilities, creating trouble for their families, exacerbating the shortage of medical resources and causing many care facilities to sit idle.Nursing homes and medical institutions are expected to become friendlier to patients now that the central government has renewed efforts to integrate the two systems.The National Health Commission, alongside several central agencies, plans to roll out a guideline encouraging elderly care providers to run healthcare services by building up their own medical centers or signing up hospitals for such services, according to Wang Jianjun, a senior Party official with the commission.Hospitals and community health centers are also encouraged to offer care services for the swelling numbers of senior patients, Wang said at a news conference held by the State Council Information Office on Tuesday in Beijing.Apart from the streamlined application process, authorities will attempt to make the transformation attractive by dangling benefits before hybrid facilities, including tax breaks equivalent to nonprofits and priority in land use.The new arrangement is widely expected to make basic health insurance reimbursement easier. But Wang stressed that caution will be used to clarify the boundary between medical costs and spending on care."Money from the nation's basic health insurance system will only be used to pay medical costs," he said.China is 20 years into its "aging country" status, according to global standards, and the senior population is expanding at an alarming rate.Figures from the central government show China had almost 250 million people aged 60 and above by the end of last year, roughly 17.9 percent of its population. That figure is estimated to reach 487 million by mid-century, when one in three Chinese will be in that age group.Health issues are widespread among the group. The National Health Commission said nearly 180 million seniors have chronic diseases, and 40 million have various levels of disabilities.To meet seniors' demand for medical services, the central government in 2015 issued a landmark guideline that signaled the start of government efforts to bolster the integration of medicine and elderly care, and triggered a boom for hybrid facilities.China currently has about 4,000 such facilities, and another 20,000 nursing homes that have teamed up with medical institutions, according to the commission.

                HK tour guides rush for practice permit in Hengqin
            </a>
            <p>
                SHENZHEN – More than 500 tour guides and leaders from Hong Kong and Macao have applied for special certificates for practicing in the Hengqin New Area in Zhuhai, next door to Macao, since the new policy was announced by the Guangdong government last week.The first batch of tourism professionals are expected to explore the new market as soon as the upcoming weeklong National Day holiday that begins on Oct 1.The applicants need to go through a three-day training on local regulations and Hengqin's major tourist sites, the provincial Human Resources and Social Security Department said during the announcement of the scheme.Those who will receive the new certificates will also be granted a reward of 3,000 yuan ($470). No extra charges are required either for applying for the certificate or the training.After successful practice for 30 and 45 days in Hengqin, tourism practitioners will receive another incentive of 20,000 yuan and 30,000 yuan respectively.Li Weihui, deputy Party secretary of the Hengqin New Area, said it is an attempt to facilitate recognition of professional qualifications in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and an encouragement for Hong Kong and Macao tourism agencies to come up with more multi-destinations products.The 11-city cluster includes nine cities of Guangdong province and Hong Kong and Macao. The central government released a blueprint of its integrated development in February. It also bolsters Macao's development into a world tourism and leisure center.In April, the State Council approved the plan for the construction of the Hengqin International Recreation Island, the nation's third of its kind. The 106.46-square-kilometer region has many well-known tourist sites, such as Chime-Long Ocean Kingdom, the largest marine theme park in the world.The island received above 10 million tourists in 2018 while more than 38.8 million people visited Macao.
