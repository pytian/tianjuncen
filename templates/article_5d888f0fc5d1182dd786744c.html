                For the past decade, dancer-choreographer Wang Yabin has run a project with her friends to bring together Chinese and international choreographers to create a new dance piece every year.When dancer-choreographer Wang Yabin was 25 years old, she achieved fame by performing as the dance double for Zhang Ziyi in Chinese film director Zhang Yimou's 2003 film, House of Flying Daggers, and by playing the lead character in the Chinese TV drama, The Love Story of the Village.However, she withdrew from the screen and founded her own dance studio in 2009. The same year, she launched Yabin and Her Friends, an annual dance production series, which she designed as a platform to bring together Chinese and international choreographers to create a dance piece every year."Now, when I look back, it was a crazy idea. There were few independent dance studios in China and contemporary dance was not a mainstream art form," says Wang."I didn't know where I was heading with the idea. I just wanted to dance and choreograph by working with people, who share the same passion for dance, and to get inspired."Early this year, she released the 10th production by Yabin and Her Friends. And it started touring nationwide in March.The production, consisting of Wang's two choreographic works, Moon Opera and World, will be staged at Tianqiao Performing Arts Centre in Beijing on Sept 25, 26, and 28.Moon Opera, which premiered at the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing in 2015, is based on a novel of the same title by Chinese author Bi Feiyu. And it tells the story of Peking Opera performer Xiao Yanqiu, who is committed to her role to the point of obsession. The novel has been translated into different languages and was longlisted for the 2008 Independent Foreign Fiction Prize in the United Kingdom.When Wang read the novel in 2012 during her tour of Europe, she felt that the heroine in the novel resembled her.In the 75-minute production, Wang presents a new vocabulary of dance by using elements from Chinese classical dance, contemporary dance and Peking Opera.So far, Moon Opera has been staged over 80 times worldwide, and Wang regards the piece as one of her best choreographies.As for the other piece, entitled World, which is Wang's latest creation, she wants to communicate with the audience about being a dancer.Speaking about the piece, she says: "When I toured with my dancers, we were often asked about dancers' lives. People are curious about us. But it's a question that is hard to answer. So, with this piece I want to answer their questions as well as pay tribute to dancers," says Wang, who also dances in the piece."In dance, I see glamour and the pain of life. It allows me to be free and creative but at the same time, it causes me physical pain. I am aware of the fact that the career of dancer is short."

                At a recent festival dedicated to the yangqin, young people were to the fore.At the third International Dulcimer Music Festival in Beijing from Aug 11 to 16, a concert performed entirely by children and teenagers received particular attention. The youngest performer was just 4 years old, playing the yangqin standing up because she was not tall enough to sit on a stool.With yangqin education for young people uppermost in their minds, experts and artists joined in discussions at the festival, looking for innovative teaching methods to help young learners acquire techniques and keep them enthusiastic about the instrument.Fu Bing, a yangqin player and examiner for yangqin grading exams, says more parents are now willing to invest in their children's all-round education, and the number of young people learning the instrument has grown steadily in recent years.Yangqin ensembles and extracurricular training courses for young children are also emerging, the Beijing Junior Jasmine Ensemble being one of the most notable examples.The ensemble, established last year, has already given dozens of performances in both China and overseas, and its members have won several gold awards in international music competitions.The ensemble is associated with the Jasmine Ensemble, which was founded by Liu Yuening, a musician and researcher, in 2008 and comprises young professional yangqin performers.While the Jasmine Ensemble has been taking the sounds of the yangqin overseas, Liu is not complacent and so, with a yangqin player and composer, Chen Yunyun, established this junior ensemble for children with the aim of passing on expertise to coming generations."Learning musical instruments is more than simply acquiring the techniques," Liu says. "More importantly, it means taking up the responsibility to inherit and promote our culture, and to contribute to the overall development of world music."So an evident feature of this ensemble is that each student is supervised by a professional musician who belongs to the Jasmine Ensemble, which means the children can enjoy one-on-one instruction.Apart from professionalism, fun is another keyword in the children's everyday training. First and foremost, happiness and friendship are what Liu says she would like the children to gain from learning music.
