                US sailing into uncharted waters
            </p>
            <p>
                Suppose a country sends its warships with guided missiles regularly to the waters off Hawaii, conducts navy drills in the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean Sea targeting "hostile" forces, and test-fires conventional medium-range missiles in the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean near the US coast within just a few months, what would be the United States' response? This is a no-brainer for anyone with even the basic knowledge of geopolitics. But the US has been conducting such provocative operations in and around the waters of China, which it now considers a strategic competitor. On Friday, the Pentagon sent USS Wayne E.Meyer, a guided-missile destroyer, into the waters off China's Xisha Islands in the South China Sea in the name of "freedom of navigation". It was the sixth US' "freedom of navigation operation" this year, compared with only six during the entire eight years of the Barack Obama administration. To justify Friday's provocative move, a US Seventh Fleet spokeswoman said China's territorial claim in the South China Sea is "not permitted by international law", even though the self-proclaimed guardian of international law has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. That the US is desperate to contain China's rise is reflected in the series of moves the Pentagon has made recently in the Asia-Pacific region. On Wednesday, the US Marine Corps announced it had held exercises on a Japanese islet to strengthen the US military's capability of invading a disputed island and establishing a supply base for aerial operations. And last month, the Pentagon chose the Pacific Ocean to test its first conventional medium-range missile since the end of the Cold War. Washington has never minced words about its plan to deploy new medium-range conventional missiles in Asia. And now that it has withdrawn from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the deployment could happen within months. Which would seriously disrupt the regional strategic balance, not least because the missiles could strike targets in China. Yet Beijing's response to Washington's provocations has been restrained. It has dispatched its navy vessels only to identify and monitor US warships transgressing China's territorial waters, and said it will take "countermeasures" if the US deploys missiles at its doorstep. Beijing does not want to be dragged into an arms race. But that should not be seen as a sign of weakness, and the military hawks in Washington would commit a grave mistake by underestimating China's determination and capability to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and safeguard regional peace and stability.

                Hezbollah group says it downed Israeli drone
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIRUT, Lebanon - The Hezbollah military group said it downed an Israeli drone in southern Lebanon on Monday, a week after the group's leader said it would shoot down Israeli drones in Lebanese airspace.The drone is now in Hezbollah's possession, it said in a statement.An Israeli military statement said one of its drones "fell inside southern Lebanon during routine operations". It did not say why the drone crashed, but said "there is no concern information could be taken from it". An Israeli military spokeswoman said it was a "simple drone" without elaborating.Hezbollah said its fighters had used "appropriate weapons" to bring down the drone on the edge of the southern Lebanese town of Ramyah.A correspondent for Hezbollah's al-Manar television said the drone had not sustained much damage, and had been in Lebanese airspace for around five minutes.A week ago, after a drone attack in a Hezbollah-controlled Beirut suburb, Hezbollah and the Israeli army exchanged cross-border fire that marked their fiercest shelling exchange since the 2006 Lebanon war.Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, as well as Lebanon's government, blamed Israel for the drone attack and had vowed to target Israeli drones entering Lebanon's airspace.Nasrallah said while last week's flare-up with Israel was over, the episode had launched a "new phase" in which the Iran-backed group no longer had red lines it would not cross.In that brief exchange of fire, Hezbollah said it destroyed an Israeli armored vehicle, killing and wounding those inside, and broadcast what it said was footage of two missiles hitting a moving vehicle.Israel said it had faked soldier casualties to dampen any inclination of Hezbollah to escalate hostilities.Nasrallah said the attack marked the first such targeting of positions inside Israel by the Islamist militants in a long time. More commonly, Hezbollah targets the Israeli-occupied Shebaa farms, which are on land which Lebanon claims as its territory.Amid rising tensions in the region, Israel also raised the stakes last week by accusing Hezbollah, with Iranian assistance, of setting up a factory for precision-guided missiles in Lebanon's Bekaa valley.Hezbollah has denied having production sites in Lebanon.Agencies - Xinhua

                Deal with Serbia marks first for drones
            </a>
            <p>
                China has taken a remarkable stride in the promotion of its weapons in the international market as the first export of Chinese military drones to a European country has been confirmed by the buyer.Aleksandar Vulin, defense minister of the Republic of Serbia, said last week in an interview with Radio-Television Serbia that the procurement of the Chinese armed drones will significantly strengthen the Serbian Armed Forces by giving them capabilities they do not have now.He noted that the deal had been agreed upon earlier, without giving more details such as the type of the involved Chinese drone and delivery schedule.The drone transaction was made public by Serbian officials during a five-day official visit by a delegation of China's Central Military Commission, the country's top military authority, that concluded on Sept 10. The delegation was headed by General Zhang Youxia, vice-chairman of the military commission.The visit was the highest level of its kind between China and Serbia in terms of their military relations and is "a testament to the friendship and support China provides to Serbia in international relations, economic development and assistance to the Serbian Armed Forces in valuable donations of arms and equipment", according to a statement from the Serbian Defense Ministry.The Associated Press quoted local media in Belgrade as reporting last week that Serbia will take delivery of nine Wing Loong I reconnaissance/combat drones with a possible follow-up order of an additional 15 drones.A spokeswoman for Aviation Industry Corp of China, which makes the pilotless plane, said on Monday that the company has no comment on this matter.Wu Peixin, an aviation industry observer in Beijing, said that the deal indicates that Chinese armed drones are competitive and attractive in the international market thanks to their combat-proven capabilities and reasonable prices.Information previously published by AVIC shows that the Wing Loong I medium-altitude, long-endurance armed drone has a maximum speed of 280 kilometers per hour, can stay airborne for 20 hours and is capable of carrying about 200 kilograms of weapons such as laser-guided missiles and high-explosive bombs.Development of the unmanned aircraft started in 2005, and its maiden flight took place in 2007.So far, at least 100 Wing Loong I units have been delivered to foreign users, the company said.Wang Yaoxin, vice-president of China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corp, an AVIC subsidiary and the biggest exporter of aviation defense products in China, said last month at the International Aviation and Space Salon 2019 in Zhukovsky, Russia, that China "is in talks with several countries on cooperation projects concerning the Wing Loong unmanned combat drone family".He said the Wing Loong I and II have become internationally renowned for their good capabilities and outstanding performance in combat and have attracted a lot of potential buyers.Developed by AVIC's Chengdu Aircraft Design and Research Institute, Wing Loong I and II feature advanced designs, reasonable prices, easy-to-use controls and reliable technical support.They are capable of reconnaissance and surveillance, electronic jamming, targeted strikes and border patrols. In addition to military operations, they can also perform civilian tasks such as disaster monitoring, environmental inspections, resource surveys and meteorological research, according to Wang.
