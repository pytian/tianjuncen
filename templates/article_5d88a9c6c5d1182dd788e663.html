                Xi extends greetings on farmers' harvest festival
            </p>
            <p>
                BEIJING - Chinese President Xi Jinping extended greetings to farmers and people working in agriculture and rural areas as Monday marked the second Chinese farmers' harvest festival.Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, sent his greetings via the China Central Television's newly-launched channel dedicated to agriculture and rural affairs."With a solid foundation laid by agriculture, we have full confidence in development," Xi said.The achievements that China has made in the fields related to agriculture, rural areas and farmers are not only the outcomes of concerted efforts of the whole CPC and the country but also the results of hard work of all farmers and people working in agriculture and rural areas, he said.Xi also congratulated on the launch of the new channel, expecting the channel to publicize agricultural policies, plans as well as new looks of farmers and rural areas in-depth.Xi also expected the channel to lead the audience to pay attention to agriculture, care for the countryside and farmers, and contribute to poverty alleviation, reform and development in agriculture and the countryside, and the realization of rural revitalization.The Chinese farmers' harvest festival is the first national festival created specifically for the country's farmers. Starting in 2018, the festival coincides with the Autumnal Equinox each year, which is one of the 24 solar terms of the Chinese lunisolar calendar and usually falls between Sept. 22 and 24 during the country's agricultural harvest season.The new channel is the first national all-media channel dedicated to agriculture and rural affairs. With daily 18-hour programs, the channel officially began broadcasting on Monday.

                Chinese, Philippine artists paint mutual for understanding
            </a>
            <p>
                Renowned artists from various parts of China will strengthen the bonds between China and the Philippines by joining in an art exchange program, inaugurated on Saturday, in Shenzhen.The exchange program, called the Philippine-Chinese Art and Culture Exchange Program with the theme In Harmony with Nature, is expected to last about two months. Chinese and Filipino artists will exchange visits to each other's countries to create art and exhibit their works once the visitation program is finished.Five Chinese artists - three from Jiangsu province, one from Hong Kong and another from Yunnan province, will join five of their Filipino counterparts in the Philippine island province of Palawan, in southwest of the Philippines, to express their visions with their paint brushes, for five days, commencing Sunday.Art pieces created during the trip will be exhibited in Manila from Sept 28 to October 19, with corresponding public programs, aimed at raising awareness on climate change and the need for environmental protection.The aim of the program is to deepen bilateral communication and people-to-people exchanges, including art and culture. The program is co-organized by the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, the Bank of China, China Daily and the Chinese Culture and Art Association (CCAA).Kate Yau, executive director of the China Daily Asia Leadership Roundtable, spoke at the inaugural event on behalf of Zhou Li, publisher and editor-in-chief of China Daily Asia Pacific. She spoke of the importance of enhance bilateral exchanges between countries, through art, not only at the official but through the people of both countries. ."China Daily has been active in co-organizing such programs for a long time, bringing Chinese artists to Thailand in 2015 and Myanmar in 2018, respectively, (to promote art exchange between different countries)," said Yau.Zhou Yanzhao, chairman of the Chinese Culture and Art Association (CCAA) said the program is of great importance, since the Philippines is an important destination in the Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to strengthen connections around the world on many levels.Hong Kong-based artist Kuki Chai Bu-kuk who participated in China Daily's previous programs in Thailand and Myanmar, said the art exchanges help to attract global attention to Chinese art and culture. The importance of the work, she said, gives artists a strong sense of responsibility to introduce Chinese art to the world and to make their best efforts."Unlike the Philippine artists who are good at oil painting, (the participating) Chinese artists are experienced in ink and wash painting, (which gives us a chance) to show something special to them," said Chai. She is also a council member of the China Artists Association and an examiner for the Hong Kong Arts Development Council.Ding Jie, a national first class artist from eastern China's Jiansu province, spoke of his excitement about meeting the Filipino artists, even though he speaks no English well. He said he will communicate the stories of China with his brush and, at the same time, show Filipinos how their country is seen through the eyes of Chinese artists.The program comes at a special time as China and the Philippines enter a new chapter of bilateral relations.In August, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte visited China to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. During his five days in China, Duterte participated in events intended to improve cultural and people-to-people exchanges. It was Duterte's second visit this year and his fifth in the past three years."I hope artists from both countries can experience the natural sceneries and the magic landscape (in both countries) together to find inspiration," said Zhou of CCAA.After the exhibition in Manila, the Philippine artists will visit Liling city in Central China's Hunan province from Oct 20 to 24 to sketch and paint in a city famous for its artistic atmosphere and for its ceramics. After that, the collection of art works created in the Philippines and China will be exhibited in Shenzhen, between Oct 26 and Nov 16. That exhibition will be open to the public for free.

                Xi: Criticism, advice should all be heard
            </a>
            <p>
                Being open to CPPCC's differing voices can assist govt in making right decisions, he says Being open to advice and criticism from the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the nation's top political advisory body, can help the central government make the right decisions and ensure that the country's development stays on the right track, experts said on Sunday, following a speech on Friday by President Xi Jinping. Xi called for giving full play to the system of democratic centralism, promoting expression and exchanges of differing ideas and opinions and improving the mechanism to ensure consultation - both before and during the decision-making process. Xi, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remark in Beijing at the Central Conference on CPPCC Work, which marked the 70th anniversary of the consultative body. Zhu Lijia, a professor of public administration at the National Academy of Governance, said: "China has entered an era in which an increasing number of social problems and conflicts have surfaced because of its fast development. So receiving advice from other political parties, people without party affiliation, people's organizations and all ethnic groups and all walks of life is important. They can use their expertise to see solutions to problems from a different angle, not just the Party's." Such advice - and even criticism - is crucial in ensuring that China's development stays on the right path, Zhu added. Xi said at the conference that being open to advice and criticism, and making improvements in the work, show confidence and capability. As long as different parties of the CPPCC uphold the fundamental theory, path and strategy of the Party, they should be encouraged to speak their opinions, even harshly and fiercely at times, he said, adding that the Party should be delighted to hear criticism and correct mistakes if there are any, as well as to guard against introducing errors. Fan Peng, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Political Sciences, said, "Socialist consultative democracy allows the central government to respect the diversity of Chinese society as it promotes exchanges between different political parties and all walks of life. "More important, it encourages people to offer their advice on the key tasks of the Party and the country, so people with different backgrounds can be on the same page when it comes to China's development path," Fan said. Xi said at the conference that the CPPCC needs to guide its members from the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions to support the law-based administration of the SARs' governments and chief executives. Zhu, the public administration professor, said such support is important for Hong Kong, even when there is no conflict. "CPPCC members can do more to unite the Hong Kong people to fully implement the 'one country, two systems' policy," Zhu said. CPPCC member Samuel Yung Wing-ki of Hong Kong said on Sunday that it's necessary to strengthen the patriotism that reflects love of both the country and the city. That's the way to maintain the SAR's prosperity and stability in the long run, Yung said. To achieve that, he encouraged CPPCC members from the region to extensively engage people from various backgrounds, especially young people, and brief them about the nation's latest developments and the opportunities made possible by major national strategies. This will buttress people's national identity as well as their recognition of the country, he said. Yung said it is also important for CPPCC members to support the SAR government's law-based administration. That is a basic requirement, he said. Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, a Hong Kong and Macao affairs think tank, said that Hong Kong's recent social unrest shows that patriotism needs to be enhanced and expanded in society. Hong Kong members of the CPPCC should play a greater role in the region's political arena and serve as the bridge between the Chinese mainland and the region, he said. Lau added that CPPCC members should do more policy research targeting the deep-seated social issues in Hong Kong to relieve internal rifts and tensions in the city.
