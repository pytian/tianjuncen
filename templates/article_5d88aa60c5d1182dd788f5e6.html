                Iran will lift all limits on nuclear R&D
            </p>
            <p>
                Rouhani calls it the 'most important step' away from 2015 nuclear dealTEHERAN - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday ordered the removal of all limits on nuclear research and development, taking the country's third step in scaling down its commitments to a 2015 deal with world powers.His announcement came shortly after the United States hit the Islamic Republic with further sanctions, the latest in a series of punitive measures including an embargo on Iranian oil exports.Iran and three European countries - the United Kingdom, France and Germany - have been engaged in talks to reduce tensions and save the nuclear deal that has been unraveling since US President Donald Trump withdrew from it in May last year.But late on Wednesday, Rouhani made good on a declared intention to take another step away from the multilateral deal signed with the five permanent member states of the United Nations Security Council and Germany (P5+1)."Iran's third step is of an extraordinarily significant nature. The atomic energy organization (of Iran) is ordered to immediately start whatever is needed in the field of research and development, and abandon all the commitments that were in place regarding research and development," Rouhani said.He referred to "expansions in the field of research and development, centrifuges, different types of new centrifuges, and whatever we need for enrichment".Iran in July abandoned two other nuclear commitments: To keep its stockpile of enriched uranium below 300 kilograms, and maintain a 3.67-percent cap on the purity of its uranium stocks.Rouhani had earlier on Wednesday told a Cabinet meeting:"I don't think that... we will reach a deal".But he had also said that Teheran and the European powers had been getting closer to an agreement on a way to resolve burning issues."If we had 20 issues of disagreement with the Europeans in the past, today there are three issues," he said.French President Emmanuel Macron, last month in France at the G7 meeting, encouraged Trump to offer economic incentives to Teheran and dangled the possibility of a summit between the US and Iranian presidents.Trump made clear on Wednesday that he was still interested in meeting Rouhani when the Iranian leader visits New York for the opening of the annual UN General Assembly this month."Sure, anything is possible," Trump told reporters.But Rouhani has already ruled out a summit without sanctions relief, and on Wednesday the Trump administration issued its third set of sanctions on Iran in less than a week.In the latest salvo, the US Treasury Department put on its blacklist a shipping network of 16 entities, 10 people and 11 vessels that it said was selling oil on behalf of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard's Qods Force.The network sold more than $500 million worth of oil this spring, mostly to Syria, benefiting both the Syrian government and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, the department said.A US official said that the move showed Washington's position on relaxing sanctions - and warned that more would come."We can't make it any more clear that we are committed to this campaign of maximum pressure and we are not looking to grant any exceptions or waivers," Brian Hook, the US State Department coordinator on Iran, told reporters.Iran has said it will resume full compliance with the nuclear deal if it reaches a deal with France on a $15-billion credit line, which Teheran would repay once it resumes oil exports.The US is currently trying to block such shipments with unilateral sanctions.Hook stopped short of criticizing the credit line itself, saying there was no "concrete" proposal.Hawks in the Trump administration adamantly oppose any easing of pressure, saying their goal is not only to contain Iran's nuclear program but to curb Iran's influence across the Middle East.Iran had long threatened to carry out a third set of nuclear countermeasures by Friday unless other parties to the deal offset the effect of US sanctions in return for its continued compliance.Agencies - Xinhua

                A US-Iran military conflict unlikely
            </a>
            <p>
                Editor's Note: Iran announced on Friday that it would stop implementing some of the provisions of the 2015 nuclear deal with major powers to continue its nuclear research and development program. This is Iran's latest move to withdraw from the nuclear deal amid escalating tensions with the US. Two experts share their views on the US-Iran standoff with China Daily's Liu Jianna. Excerpts follow: Stalemate to continue for the time being Iran is relinquishing its commitments to the nuclear deal and rebooting its nuclear program bit by bit in a bid to force the United States to back down and ease the sanctions. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed on Monday that Iran was installing advanced centrifuges, saying it had "verified that the following centrifuges were either installed or being installed ... : 22 IR-4, one IR-5, 30 IR-6 and three IR-6". And despite France's efforts to mediate between the US and Iran, Teheran is unlikely to accept Paris's proposal of a $15 billion letter of credit in exchange for its full compliance with the nuclear deal. The reason is simple: agreeing to the proposal is tantamount to Iran disarming itself. The US president claims he doesn't seek for Iran's regime change, but what Washington is driving at is nothing less than forcing Teheran to commit suicide. The 12 demands US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo put forward last year, which include Iran scrapping all missile programs, ceasing regional expansion, not supporting Hezbollah and Hamas and not opposing Israel, basically mean Iran's complete surrender. Which Iran will never accept. The security team that helped the George W. Bush administration has become the main force prompting the incumbent US administration to adopt a more aggressive approach toward Teheran. Believing that Iran's expansion in the Middle East could threaten the security of its main allies Israel and Saudi Arabia and pose a challenge to the US' hegemony in the region, the US administration deems it necessary to push Iran into a corner. Furthermore, the US administration has strengthened its ties with Israel and Saudi Arabia. Besides, by increasing pressure on Teheran, Washington could persuade Riyadh to purchase more US weapons, which could help boost the US' manufacturing sector. The US-Iran standoff is expected to last for a while, but both sides will avoid a military confrontation. Iran hopes a Democratic Party candidate wins the 2020 US presidential election because Democrat president Barack Obama had signed the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, while the US aims to force Iran into giving unprecedented concessions by threatening military action against and imposing the most serious financial sanctions on the country. Ma Xiaolin, a professor at Zhejiang International Studies University Third-party mediation needed more than ever Despite Iran reducing its commitments to the nuclear deal and the US tightening sanctions on Iran, the situation in the Middle East has not gone out of control. The US intends to prolong the stalemate till Iran can no longer endure the economic pain, and Iran is putting up a strong fa?ade thanks to the pressure from the opposition forces at home. Yet the tools that Iran could wield to counterattack the US are indeed few. So Teheran has adopted an approach of gradually putting pressure on the US and its allies. But neither Iran nor the US wants a military confrontation. France inviting Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to the G7 Summit was quite a diplomatically significant move. It shows European countries such as France and Germany are becoming more independent as far as their foreign policies are concerned and more freely voicing their views on global and regional affairs - a development that is expected to strengthen in the near future. Indeed, the Middle East situation demands more effective third-party mediation, because preventing the situation from getting out of control not only suits the interests of the US and Iran but also other countries. Still, expecting the other signatories to the Iran nuclear deal to take concerted action would be impractical because not all of them would risk angering the US. So the stalemate will continue for some time. And domestic politics will largely determine the US' next move toward Iran. Li Weijian, a senior research fellow at the Center for West Asian and African Studies, and the Institute for Foreign Policy Studies, Shanghai Institutes for International Studies The views don't necessarily represent those of China Daily.
