                Investment insights amid a trade standoff
            </p>
            <p>
                Kentucky needs and encourages foreign investment — especially from China, a state official said Tuesday at the Vision China event in New York.Kentucky has attracted $21 billion in foreign investment in the last three and a half years, including $2 billion from China and $200 million recently, said Vivek Sarin, interim secretary for the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development."The situation in Kentucky is one of great encouragement," Sarin said. "We hustled because business is a contact sport. You have to get out of the office."He made the comments during a panel discussion moderated by Ji Tao, president and editor-in-chief of China Daily USA. The event was held at the Asia Society and co-hosted by China Daily and the Bank of China.Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin led a delegation to China where state officials met investors and pitched Kentucky's eagerness for foreign investment.Sarin said the continuing US-China trade dispute has not affected discussions with China because business is conducted face-to-face, and politics isn't an issue."In Kentucky, we take more of a long-term view," he said. "We build personal relationships. Capital goes where capital is welcome. We make it clear that we want to do more business."Sarin said the Kentucky delegation split into two groups: politicians and business representatives. The politicians meet in one room, and the investors meet in another to keep the lines of communication open and uncomplicated.Xiao Yuqiang, vice-chairman of China General Chamber of Commerce-USA and chairman of the US management committee, said at the panel discussion that he is confident about the future because investment benefits both nations.The market demands efficiency at every level of production. This requires sound management practices and a deep reservoir of human capital, factors that abound in China, he said.Jeff Liu, another panelist who is a CGCC director and CEO of Fuyao Group North America, said Chinese companies operating in the US must understand cultural differences to get the most out their workers.Liu appeared in American Factory, a recently released movie about Fuyao Glass that took over an abandoned General Motors factory in Ohio to produce auto glass. The movie examines the cultural factors as blue-collar American workers adapt to high-tech management techniques.He said attracting young workers to manufacturing is difficult because the work is demanding, and technology jobs pay much better. Nevertheless, training can create engaging jobs that will attract younger workers who will thrive in an industry increasingly dependent on automation."It's hard to find young, talented people," Liu said. "It's not old-style manufacturing, and now involves a lot of automation. We need to work together because automobile production is a nonstop production line."The demands of the production line are unforgiving, and therefore everyone must give their best effort to meet the demands of auto companies, including GM and BMW, while maintaining worker morale. A lapse in either will delay deliveries and erode profits, he said.Liu said his operation is not directly affected by the continuing US-China trade dispute, and he's confident foreign investment will continue to fuel expansion."We work together - and that's a success," he said.

                Kentucky governor unabashed about China deals
            </a>
            <p>
                Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin likes to spruce up his talks with quotations from historical figures like inventor Thomas Edison, as well as Chinese sayings, drawing on his background as an Asian studies major.Quoting from Edison that "opportunity is missed by most people because it comes dressed in overalls looking like hard work", Bevin said Kentucky is "seizing opportunity" and taking the lead in strengthening ties with China by staging one outreach after another, for "the longest journey begins with a single step" – as a Chinese proverb goes.In less than a year, Bevin has led a trade mission to China, being the first US governor to attend the inaugural China Import Expo in Shanghai, and hosting a China-US governors' summit in his state. He even threw a New Year's party for Chinese students at the governor's mansion in Frankfort in February."Even if other states are afraid or uncertain or want to wait, Kentucky will lead the way," Bevin told China Daily at the Kentucky Capitol."I can't control the national-level conversation, but I can be part of the solution at the subnational level," he said, referring to the fact that the world's top two economies are locked in a protracted trade dispute, which Beijing and Washington have pledged to resolve with yet another round of talks scheduled for October.Bevin, who earned a degree in East Asian studies 30 years ago, said he had studied the region and "fallen in love with that part of the world", with a good appreciation of the cultural differences between East and West.While Americans usually prefer quick actions and results, "you have to be more steady, patient, develop relationships and earn respect" with the Chinese, according to Bevin."What I want to do is strengthen our relationships, build friendships and partnerships. And then when that happens, good things will come," he said.Under the Republican governor, Kentucky's exports to China increased by 60 percent in 2017, to an all-time high of $2.81 billion, then slowed to $2.23 billion last year, partly due to the trade dispute, according to statistics provided by the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development.But Chinese investment in The Bluegrass State has turned from a trickle to a flow."When I was elected just three and a half years ago, there were two Chinese-owned companies in Kentucky. And now there are 14 or 15, and others that are looking to come," he said.Early last month, Chinese-owned manufacturer Phoenix Paper Wickliffe announced plans to invest $200 million in Ballard County to launch a paper-and-pulp recycling facility, creating 500 jobs in western Kentucky.Altogether, Chinese companies employ nearly 9,000 Kentuckians, including 6,000-plus employees at GE Appliance Park in Louisville and 1,600-plus at Lexington-based manufacturer Lexmark."And we also have another half-dozen companies that are already committed to hiring another 680 people to come here," Bevin said, adding that over the past three and a half years, the state has attracted a record of more than $20 billion in private capital from foreign countries."But it's not by accident. It's because we are going out," he said.There have been missed opportunities because of misunderstandings or a lack of understanding between countries, Bevin said.He quoted a Chinese idiom, yugong yishan, which tells a well-known fable from Chinese mythology about the virtues of perseverance and willpower.Yugong, a foolish old man, was annoyed by the obstruction caused by the mountains in front of his house and sought to dig through them, believing that though he could not finish the task in his lifetime, through the hard work of himself, his children and their children and so on, someday the mountains would be removed."There's a big mountain of cultural difference" between the East and the West that needs to be removed through unyielding engagement, Bevin said."What I'm trying to do is disprove some of the misunderstanding and help to elevate, and to show that there's opportunity," he said."We're not afraid of opportunity. We're seizing opportunity. It does look like hard work. It is dressed in overalls, but we put our overalls on, we go out, we do the work and good things are happening," he said.Late last month, the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development sent a business delegation to the Smart China Expo in Southwest China's Chongqing municipality, a global summit for business leaders and innovators at the forefront of revolutionizing innovation.This will be followed by another team traveling to China "in a couple of months", according to Bevin.The governor touted a long list of Kentucky's advantages as a top investment destination, including the quality of the workforce, the low energy costs, a location within a day's drive of two-thirds of the US population and having major delivery hubs operated by DHL, UPS and Amazon.At a time of uncertainty in the world, Kentucky is a safe place for people to invest, he said.Bevin, a Republican who is seeking reelection, said he wants to focus on "more of the same" in Kentucky if he has four more years, like getting Kentucky's financial house in order, addressing financial obligations and investing in infrastructure to the "highest levels of quality"."It will be four more years of what we've been doing. But I think they will be even more powerful," he said. "Because when I see us going from two companies to 14 to 15 companies from China in just three years, I think four years from now 50 companies, 100 companies, why not?"The governor said he has full confidence that the outstanding issues, including intellectual property protection, will be fully addressed at the national level."This is the conversation that our ambassador (US Trade Representative Robert) Lighthizer and his team are having with his Chinese counterparts; they will work this out, they will need to, because our two nations are better together, and we are both weaker if the other is in trouble," he said."As soon as we have a trade agreement between our nations, it will be unleashed," he said, referring to bilateral trade and investment, both of which have contracted and slowed."I'm putting up my sail even though I'm out on a calm sea. And the economic wind seems to have slowed down, maybe to a halt. I'm still putting up my sail, because when the wind starts to blow, I will be ready. Kentucky will be ready," he said.

                New vision would advance China-US ties, benefit world
            </a>
            <p>
                Leading voices at event in New York discuss ways for two countries to resolve differencesWith rapid changes in the world, the old era of Sino-US relations is over, and there's no going back. The two countries should therefore work to create a better future and a new vision for the world.That is a point Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai made at the Vision China event, hosted by China Daily and Bank of China, on Tuesday in New York City. At the event, leading voices on China-US relations discussed how the two countries should resolve their differences and advance their ties.The event, "China-US Relations: 40 Years & Beyond", took place shortly before Beijing and Washington are to hold another round of high-level talks in Washington in early October to address their outstanding trade disputes. Twelve such meetings since February 2018 failed to produce a deal.In his keynote speech, Cui said: "We have learned from the past four decades that cooperation is the only right option for us. It is something we should always uphold."The envoy said that some in the US blame a rising China, which they claim will displace the US to become the world's new hegemon."But I do not see the onus on the side of China. It is how America perceives China that should be held to account."Cui's points were echoed by Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs."We have a lot of problems in the United States. Unfortunately for us, it is very convenient for us - always when we have problems - to blame them on somebody else," said the former chief economist at Morgan Stanley and chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia."We did that with the Japanese 30 years ago. We are doing it again with China," Roach said.Speaking at the opening of the event, Zhou Shuchun, China Daily's publisher and editor-in-chief, highlighted the importance of the two nations proceeding based on what they have achieved over recent decades."If we could break the ice 40 years ago when there were virtually no exchanges and interaction, then in today's world of interdependence, with the two countries being each other's biggest trade partner and main investor, owning very much a piece of each other, there is absolutely no reason for the future to be going against the tracks of history, and the talk of 'decoupling' is sheer nonsense," Zhou said.Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council, recalled the history of China-US business relations.He discussed the first major rebellion of Britain's North American colonies in 1773, virtually the spark that created the United States of America, in which patriots at the Boston Tea Party, disguised as Native Americans, threw tea imported from Fujian province into Boston Harbor to protest a new tax that the British colonial government had placed on the tea.The uprising was referenced in the US Declaration of Independence, its founding document, in which Thomas Jefferson laid out the formal claims for independence when he complained that England's King George III had illegally cut off trade with all parts of the world and "imposed tariffs without our consent", according to Allen."This is interesting and has a relevance even today," he said.Talking about the current trade tensions between China and the US, Allen said he hoped the leaders of the two countries will be inspired by the friendship, cooperation and mutual benefit that have characterized the bilateral relationship in the past."We have a glorious history. We have a mutual responsibility to ensure that the success of the past continues into the future," he said.Maurice Greenberg, chairman of Starr Cos, said he believes it's time for both countries to have a trade agreement."If both sides can't do it, both sides will suffer. I'm convinced of that," said Greenberg, also vice-chairman of the National Committee on United States-China Relations.Kenneth Quinn, president of The World Food Prize Foundation, recalled the 2012 visit by then Vice-President Xi Jinping to Muscatine, Iowa, where Xi talked about and quoted US writer Mark Twain, and about seeing the sun over the Mississippi River."To have someone who is a head of state, but of another country, speak about my country that way, was so impactful, so dramatic. It left a very, very deep impression on me," said Quinn, former US ambassador to Cambodia.Xu Chen, president and CEO of Bank of China USA, said that while his bank acts on corporate social responsibility by engaging in poverty relief projects in China and helping low-income local communities and small businesses in the US, it's important for countries to commit to the social responsibilities of statehood."If the US is willing to work together with China for mutual benefits and shoulder ... (social responsibilities of statehood) on the world stage, I believe that China will gladly work hand-in-hand with the US and jointly promote a more peaceful, stable and prosperous global community," Xu said.Speakers at the event also highlighted the role that people-to-people exchanges played in boosting the relations between the two countries.Connie Sweeris, a player behind the ice-breaking "ping-pong diplomacy" of the 1970s, encouraged people to play a part in the relationship, just like she did with sports and cultural exchanges."We need to be ambassadors for peace," Sweeris said.The event also featured a panel discussion on Chinese companies' investment in the US, featuring Xiao Yuqiang, chairman of the US Management Committee of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China; Vivek K. Sarin, interim secretary of the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development; and Jeff Liu, president and CEO of Fuyao Group North America. The discussion was moderated by Ji Tao, editor-in-chief and president of China Daily USA.The New York event at the Asia Society was hosted by China Daily and Bank of China. It was the eighth Vision China since it was launched in 2018. Each has featured global opinion leaders invited to discuss Chinese topics of international significance.huanxinzhao@chinadailyusa.comMaurice Greenberg, chairman of Starr Companies, raises a question to Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai during the Q&A session at the Vision China event on Tuesday.Feng Yongbin/china Daily(China Daily Global 09/19/2019 page1)

                Striking union could learn from Confucius' middle way
            </a>
            <p>
                 Nearly 50,000 workers in the United States walked off their jobs at more than 50 General Motors plants and other locations across the country's Midwest and South starting on Sunday, striking to get what they see as a fair share of the company's hefty returns.It was the first by the United Auto Workers since 2007. The UAW believes workers are not getting a fair share of the company's returns, but how much is a fair share?In negotiations that resumed on Monday morning and continued into the evening, the company offered to invest $7 billion in its US plants and add 5,400 jobs. It said it was willing to increase pay and benefits, without giving details. But the UAW was not pleased.What if what the union is asking for is too much? It may drain GM of its resources for developing new technology.Then the 50,000 workers might lose their jobs. That was what had happened in the Rust Belt, a region in the US that saw industrial decline starting in the 1980s.Such fears made Chinese entrepreneur Cao Dewang turn down the request of the trade union to enter his factory, Fuyao Glass America, an automobile glassmaker in Dayton, Ohio. He said he would withdraw from the US if the union got involved. A majority of workers voted in support of Cao's decision not to let the union in.On the surface, it is the question of whether workers need the union to protect their interests or whether the union needs to fight with employers on behalf of workers to justify its own existence. The union, it seems, is trying to balance the relationship between employers and employees.But it is not that simple. It depends on how far the union can play its role.Maybe the concept of zhong, or the middle course, can be borrowed from Confucianism, a system of philosophical teachings founded by Confucius, to explain the relationship between employers and workers. Zhong means that one should not go beyond what is necessary, while at the same time not falling short.There should be a balance between how much the employer should give and how much an employee should get.On one hand, an employer should keep enough money for the smooth running of the company and for technological innovation, which will help the enterprise remain competitive. On the other hand, what an employee gets from the employer should ensure he or she can make a decent living.It is human nature to expect maximum benefits. It is counterintuitive for an employee to think about how the company will perform if he or she gets high wages or too many benefits, since the employee is not in a position to think on behalf of the employer.When GM was on the brink of bankruptcy a decade ago, the company's union bore a significant portion of the pain to restore the automaker's financial health.GM was allowed to hire a number of workers at roughly half the hourly wage of those already on the payroll, and with reduced retirement benefits. In the following years, it also hired temporary workers with even lower wages and little job security.This made it possible for GM to compete with its rivals and survive in the competitive market, which implies the company cannot afford to pay all its employees, including those hired after the crisis 10 years ago and the temporary ones, the same hourly wages as its senior employees.In its effort to seek what it believes is the fair and reasonable treatment of workers, the union cannot decide what is most appropriate.It is impossible for the union to know how much money GM needs for technological innovation to keep it competitive.According to the documentary American Factory, workers at the GM plant in Dayton, Ohio, made $29 an hour, while the hourly wage is $12.84 for the Fuyao Glass America workers. But the GM plant is gone, rendering workers jobless. Fuyao Glass America provided employment to some of those unemployed.Zhong, as a code of conduct in Chinese culture, is meant to bring about harmony between people and among different parties.There is no telling what will happen as a result of the current strike. There is no telling whether GM will give in or whether it will consider moving more of its plants to other countries to bring down the costs. If that happens, the striking workers will be severely affected.While zhong can provide some food for thought, the UAW should decide what role it should play in the long-term interest of US autoworkers.The author is a senior writer at China Daily.

                US heartland reaps benefits of China’s capital investments
            </a>
            <p>
                Kentucky needs and encourages foreign investment — especially from China, a state official said Tuesday at the Vision China event in New York.Kentucky has attracted $21 billion in foreign investment in the last three and a half years, including $2 billion from China and $200 million recently, said Vivek Sarin, interim secretary of the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development."The situation in Kentucky is one of great encouragement," Sarin said. "We hustled because business is a contact sport. You have to get out of the office."He made the comments during a panel discussion moderated by Ji Tao, president and editor-in-chief of China Daily USA. The event was held at the Asia Society and co-hosted by China Daily and the Bank of China.Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin led a delegation to China where state officials met investors and pitched Kentucky's eagerness for foreign investment.Sarin said the continuing US-China trade dispute has not affected discussions with China because business is conducted face-to-face, and politics isn't an issue."In Kentucky, we take more of a long-term view," he said. "We build personal relationships. Capital goes where capital is welcome. We make it clear that we want to do more business."Sarin said the Kentucky delegation split into two groups: politicians and business representatives. The politicians meet in one room, and the investors meet in another to keep the lines of communication open and uncomplicated.Xiao Yuqiang, vice-chairman of China General Chamber of Commerce-USA and chairman of the US management committee, said at the panel discussion that he is confident about the future because investment benefits both nations.The market demands efficiency at every level of production. This requires sound management practices and a deep reservoir of human capital, factors that abound in China, he said.Jeff Liu, another panelist who is a CGCC director and CEO of Fuyao Group North America, said Chinese companies operating in the US must understand cultural differences to get the most out their workers.Liu appeared in American Factory, a recently released movie about Fuyao Glass that took over an abandoned General Motors factory in Ohio to produce auto glass. The movie examines the cultural factors as blue-collar American workers adapt to high-tech management techniques.He said attracting young workers to manufacturing is difficult because the work is demanding, and technology jobs pay much better. Nevertheless, training can create engaging jobs that will attract younger workers who will thrive in an industry increasingly dependent on automation."It's hard to find young, talented people," Liu said. "It's not old-style manufacturing, and now involves a lot of automation. We need to work together because automobile production is a nonstop production line."The demands of the production line are unforgiving, and therefore everyone must give their best effort to meet the demands of auto companies, including GM and BMW, while maintaining worker morale. A lapse in either will delay deliveries and erode profits, he said.Liu said his operation is not directly affected by the continuing US-China trade dispute, and he's confident foreign investment will continue to fuel expansion."We work together — and that's a success," he said.
