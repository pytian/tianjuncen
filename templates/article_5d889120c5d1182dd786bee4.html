                Discovering more of China and world while traveling
            </p>
            <p>
                I noticed at the end of June how Beijing South Railway Station had suddenly become much busier than usual. That trend has continued right through the summer period for the school holidays are upon us and people are traveling in larger numbers than ever before. Indeed in recent years, the travel scene in China has changed considerably. Families increasingly taking weekend breaks while the days set around events such as Qingming Festival, Labor Day and more have resulted in a surge of demand at hotels and resorts that lie within reasonable travel time from main urban centers.Having traveled through much of China, usually by train, over the last 30 years I now try to plan my journeys outside those peak dates. With increased mobility and greater disposable income more distant areas of natural beauty and ethnic culture have witnessed steadily increasing popularity.The growth of social media with images postings online encourages others to head toward "must-see" locations followed by "been-there" selfies on popular sites such as WeChat and Weibo.Today I am seeing a growing desire among people across China to see so much of the world. That wish previously was partly satisfied by visiting places such as the "World Park" in Beijing or "Window of the World" in Shenzhen. Increasingly people now want the real thing, a trend being a major boost for local economies but also creating both environmental and logistical challenges. Many European destinations are small in size with infrastructure and facilities finding difficulties in coping with the sudden growing numbers. Indeed we can see this in China itself with the Great Wall at times crowded. This of course has led to alternative sections of The Wall opening to absorb some of the demand or cities limiting visitor numbers to prime sites. Although tourist numbers are valued for local economic growth, if visitor numbers become unsustainable then the attraction that initially encouraged visiting will diminish.However, with a bit of planning combined with some local knowledge it is still possible to beat the crowds. Take Beijing’s Forbidden City, always busy with many thousands of visitors passing south to north through its many courtyards. Yet, from outside the Tiananmen Gate by walking a short distance east along Chang’an Avenue there is the entrance to a park, The Working People’s Cultural Palace. Inside is the extensive Tai Miao or Imperial Ancestral Temple, dating from the Ming Dynasty and a place where the visitor can actually discover almost solitude and certainly peace right in the heart of the city.What are holidays for, when did they start to emerge? With China this has been a recent phenomenon. Indeed when I first started coming to China, holidays were limited mainly to the Spring Festival week with the often extremely challenging "long journey home" for millions of migrant workers. People worked six-day weeks but I remember Golden Weeks starting in October 1999 resulting in a sudden surge of visitors to Yunnan, where I was then. Factories and institutions had previously organized stays for workers and their families to company-owned facilities at coastal or upland locations.1993 I would see domestic tour groups, often distinguished by colored caps, visiting Guilin, for example. Interestingly foreign independent travelers would stay lengthy periods at nearby Yangshuo, which at that time saw few domestic visitors. By 1999 I was noticing individual Chinese tourists having beach holidays, for example at Guangxi’s Beihai. Today, of course, road trips, adventure vacations, sea cruises are on the rise.Back in Europe, where the idea of holidays really emerged in the mid-19th century it was the rich, indeed often the very rich who could afford such luxury of holidays. They would head to the Alpine lakes of Switzerland and Italy or the French Mediterranean Riviera, staying in the grand hotels or villas of that time, often for lengthy periods. The mass transportation systems of today did not exist, journeys were done by horse-drawn carriages and coaches. However the coming of the railways, particularly from the mid-19th century helped promote a growth in travel. However, for most working people there was no paid holiday time, it was mostly working long days with maybe a Sunday break.Within Europe, including Britain, there had long been a concept of the therapeutic effects of natural spring water enriched with minerals and particularly if warm. The city of Bath in the west of England had its waters renown even during the Roman Empire period. It was the building of railways, for example in the UK, that took initially mostly wealthy guests north to spa towns of Yorkshire such as Harrogate. The railways helped introduced another travel concept, luxury train journeys such as the Orient Express across Europe to Istanbul and a stunning gateway to Asia across the Bosphorous. Literally opulent hotels on wheels they became the inspiration for many books, songs and movies.While railways were opening up North America they also spurred tourism such as to Banff in the Canadian Rockies. Indeed in the US, the railroads became the ‘stuff of legends", featuring again in Hollywood movies or in song, "gonna take a sentimental journey..." People headed to the Pacific coast of California, at times in luxury trains. The 1930’s Santa Fe Railroad’s "Chief" became famous as a luxury "rolling boudoir" bringing movie stars and Hollywood executives from Chicago to the elegant Spanish-style Union Station of Los Angeles.Back in the UK it was partly an expanding railway network that led to the country’s rapid growth of tourism and consequently the emergence of coastal holiday resorts. In the earlier 19th century most British people had probably never travelled more than 30 kilometers beyond their home town. The railways made travel faster, cheaper and more comfortable than before. They made it possible for many less wealthy people to travel from the first time. Many people had tedious, often monotonous lives working in giant cotton mills and steel works of northern England’s Yorkshire and Lancashire. For maybe one or two weeks they had often unpaid holidays from the factories. Although salaries (called "wages") were low, people saved what they could. The railways built to serve the needs of factories and coal mines also connected to the coasts of England and parts of Scotland. Workers often on group travel, crowded onto the trains for summer breaks known as "Wakes" or "Fairs". They headed toward coastal Blackpool, Morecambe, Scarborough and many more for that much loved holiday. Indeed romance would blossom on such vacations, becoming a part of Britain’s social history along with songs featuring "Oh I do like to be beside the seaside, I do like to be beside the sea....." or in France the more evocative "La Mer" conjuring up images of the sea. Just like more affluent went to the spas to "take the waters" so the working population headed to the coasts to "take in the airs".Today in China railways have played their part in tourism development. Indeed I came first to China on a railway holiday following a passion for train travel. Having lengthy summer holidays from my teaching job I would head off on extensive railway journeys initially throughout Scotland and Europe before crisscrossing North America several times by train. Indeed in 1987, for me the "ultimate dream" of rail travel was to spend my summer holiday heading overland by train from Glasgow to Scotland to China, reaching Hong Kong before flying back to the UK. It was the railway that initially opened up China for me. While living in Guangzhou during the early 1990s I would board the steam-hauled San-Mao Railway to spend time in the beautiful Guangdong city of overlooking Guangdong’s West River. It was by rail I reached Yunnan, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Dongbei and so much more but not yet Tibet by rail. I flew there in 2000.Such was my passion for rail travel that in June 2018 I was filmed by a team for BBC Scotland on the high-speed train between Beijing and Tianjin. In China I have witnessed how important the country’s rail system has been for not only the massive Spring Festival movement of people but also the growing nationwide tourism boom. Indeed had China not invested so heavily in high-speed rail and modern stations the system could not have coped. The older trains were already often working at maximum capacity, airlines even with rapidly increasing numbers of aircraft could never have handled the numbers of people now travelling today in China. Such railways have brought major benefit to the tourism sector. Within a few hours between large cities and holiday spots, both coastal and inland, the trains can carry thousands of people effortlessly. Cities such as Qingdao and Yantai have both grown through tourism. Similarly Yunnan’s once remoter northwestern locations such as Dali and Lijiang are served by expressway, air and rail. Lijiang, where I reached in 1995 after a lengthy bus journey from Kunming, is today connected across China bringing in substantial numbers of visitors daily. Similarly Sanya in southern Hainan, during Spring Festival 1993 I was often the only person on Dadonghai’s long sandy beach. Now it is one of China’s premier resorts, changing dramatically the place I had found then so tranquil.The concept and perception of travel has changed so much with time. Me, a geographer and photographer, actually sought solitude. Back in Scotland I would head off on my own with my tent and camp by a lonely mountain river or sail to remote islands, simply to sit watching and listening to the natural beauty of the land around me. Often there were no other people, just me alone and far from any road. At that time there were no mobile phones or digital navigational technology, survival depended on skills carefully learned and acquired, indeed without understanding the exactness of using a manual compass or the subtleties of detailed topographic maps that were a life-saver it would have been sheer folly to have ventured from the public roads onto some of Scotland’s wildest mountains but those were some of my greatest summer moments, a sense of achievement accomplished during my pre-China days.In China I had my solitude moments, but always carefully assessed any risks, whether walking across silent, empty desert terrain in Gansu or following unmarked trails through dense sub-tropical forest on Hainan. Then I was really alone for the not exactly precise locations our smartphones give us did not exist, nor did detailed maps. Those were adventurous times which rank high among my China moments. Today popular areas have developed carefully managed tourist trails where navigational skills are not so required. Although often lacking the excitement and challenges of solo exploration they do provide a much safer environment for the many now visiting.What does travel give us? Hopefully a greater understanding of different societies and of each other. I had no concept of China before 1987 except that gained from local Chinese restaurants. Here I am now living and working in China, something I would not be doing had I not been an adventurous traveler!

                Amazon to boost small businesses with stores across UK
            </a>
            <p>
                Online retail giant Amazon is to set up high street stores in test locations throughout the United Kingdom as part of a scheme that it claims will help more than 100 small businesses combine online and in-person sales.The trial scheme, branded "Clicks and Mortar", will run for one year to test the viability of the concept, and act as a location for customers to try out products from online-only brands.British retail has struggled in recent years, as major chains including Marks & Spencer and Debenhams have announced store closures. Toys R Us and Maplins have closed down entirely, with the rise of internet shopping cited as a factor. The so-called pop-up shops will sell homeware, health and beauty, food and drink and electronics and are a partnership between Amazon and small business support group Enterprise Nation.Foldable adult scooter company "Swifty Scooters", leather smartphone accessories maker "Torro Cases" and men's skincare product maker "Altr for Men" are among the online brands that will be selling in the shops for the first time, Amazon said.Amazon announced it is also providing one million pounds ($1.25 million) for training schemes for 150 full-time apprentices, to help small to medium enterprises, known as SMEs,increase their productivity."From giving up-and-coming online British brands the chance to experience physical retail, to funding the training of full-time apprenticeships and helping to increase SME exports, Amazon is committed to supporting the growth of small businesses – helping them boost the economy and create jobs across the UK," said Doug Gurr, UK country manager of Amazon.The first shop opened in central Manchester on Monday, with another nine to open in Wales, Scotland, the Midlands, Yorkshire and across the South East. Independent research on the success of the pilot stores will help to develop the government's "Future High Street" strategy."UK shoppers like to shop both online and in high street stores, and our intention is to help small businesses succeed by combining the best elements of online and high street retail," said Emma Jones, the founder of Enterprise Nation, which supports more than 90,000 of Britain's small businesses."This new concept will provide small businesses with the space, technology and support to experience physical retail for the first time, while enabling customers to discover new brands on their local high streets," she said. Amazon states that in 2000, 3 percent of physical gross merchandise sales on Amazon came from third-party businesses. By 2018 this increased to 58 percent, following years of heavy investment in technology, infrastructure and selling tools to help them grow their business.It claims that tens of thousands of UK-based small businesses now sell their products on Amazon's global sites, helping to support more than 80,000 UK jobs and achieving 2.5 billion pounds in export sales in 2018 alone.

                One baby + One doggy = Two destroyers
            </a>
            <p>
                When I was in university, I read From Baghdad, with Love. It is a story of a US military officer who picked up a stray dog while serving in Iraq and took it back home. I was moved as I read that the dog, named Lava, used to sleep beside the officer's little son and protect him, just like the military officer had protected the dog in Iraq.Yet I realized not all pet-and-child stories are similar when I had my daughter, who was born one year after I and my wife had adopted a puppy - half Yorkshire, half local Chinese breed. If our dog's naughtiness knows no bounds, our daughter's energy seems limitless.Since the day the dog entered our house, I have not put on a pair of shoes without holes in them. And after it chewed my expensive sofa twice, I had to buy a cheap one to minimize the possible future losses.

                Yorkshire fish and chip shop to open branch in China
            </a>
            <p>
                A fish and chip shop in Yorkshire in the North of England has become so popular with Chinese tourists that the ownership has announced plans to open a branch in Chengdu, Sichuan province.Located near Bilbrough on the main highway from London to the historic city of York, Scotts Fish and Chips has long been a popular pit stop for hungry British motorists. But two unrelated events in 2015 transformed this Yorkshire chip shop into a must-visit destination for Chinese tourists as well.In October 2015, while on a state visit to the UK, President Xi Jinping ordered fish and chips at a pub in Buckinghamshire, sparking widespread Chinese interest in the traditional British meal.In January that same year, the "king of Asian pop" Jay Chou held his wedding reception at Castle Howard near York. Since the Chou wedding, around 650 Chinese tour buses each year visit the stately home, up from just four in 2014.This unprecedented interest in both Yorkshire and fish and chips meant Scotts experienced an influx in Chinese visitors, and shop owner Tony Webster started looking for ways to cater to his new clientele."We thought we should be doing more to adapt to the Chinese culture, so we translated out menu and embraced Chinese social media," he told China Daily.Last year Scotts teamed up with Will Zhuang, who manages Chinese social media for tourism authority Visit York, and created menus in Mandarin and Cantonese as well as accounts on Weibo and WeChat.This strategy and publicity push have placed Scotts on the itinerary of many Chinese tour groups heading north from London."We now get five or six coach parties every week, as well as private groups, so a few hundred Chinese tourists on a weekly basis, "said Webster.In December last year, a consortium of Chinese businessmen－who have asked to remain unnamed at this stage -approached Scotts about creating a replica restaurant in Chengdu.Webster says the deal was recently agreed in principle, a site has been located, and they aim to open in August or September this year."You always have to take into account local tastes in cuisine, but this is all about authentic English fish and chips, with the Scotts batter and recipe," said Webster."We use Icelandic cod and haddock, and I believe Icelandic cod is readily available in China. The differences are that in the UK we have tomato ketchup or brown sauce -maybe in China there will be a spicy sauce or other accompaniments."At the Bilbrough location, Webster says Chinese diners almost exclusively order classic fish and chips from the menu, and rarely ask for mushy peas, a common side dish for British diners. Instead, some diners will bring their own sachets of seasonings to spice things up.Scotts is not the only British food and drink business to benefit from the Chinese state visit. After Xi and former UK prime minister Cameron ate battered cod and sank pints of beer at the Plough pub at Cadsden, the bar in the sleepy Buckinghamshire village is now a regular stop for Chinese tour groups.The two leaders' drink of choice was India pale ale from Suffolk-based brewer Greene King, which reported a 16-fold increase in orders from China in the weeks that followed Xi's visit in 2015.The brewer said it sent 50,000 cases to China in the lead up to Chinese New Year celebrations in early 2016.Later that year, Chinese investment group SinoFortune Investment purchased the Plough at Cadsden.

                London exhibition celebrates 50 years of black creativity
            </a>
            <p>
                  A major exhibition in London celebrates the past 50 years of black creativity in Britain and beyond.There are so many works that, politically and culturally, hit you right between the eyes at Get Up, Stand Up Now, an exhibition celebrating how black art pioneers have shaped the UK over the last 50 years.They connect in so many different ways and means that it's hard to prioritise any of them.For sheer immediacy and unforgettable impact, however, Richard Rawlins' black-power fist rising from a gilt-edged Victorian cup of tea in The True Crown (2018) dishes out some beating. It's a powerful statement that explicitly invokes conflict between the airs, graces, niceties and sweetness of traditional English afternoon tea versus the plight of the black slaves working on the sugar plantations. It's stark, brutal, incontrovertible black-and-white truth.

                Sharp rise in knife offences among women
            </a>
            <p>
                Police admit concern over "small but worrying" proportion involved in crimeThe number of women and girls committing knife possession crimes in England has increased steeply since 2014 - rising by at least 10 percent every year, police figures show.The highest number of possession cases involving women and girls was in London, but some Northern England regions have seen such crimes increase at a faster rate.Data obtained by the BBC through a Freedom of Information request shows there were 1,509 offences recorded in 2018, an increase of 73 percent over 5 years.It comes against a backdrop of rising knife crime nationally and after the number of fatal stabbings in England and Wales was last year the highest number since records began.The Home Office said it was investing 220 million pounds ($267 million) into steering both young men and young women away from violent crime.It supports and funds young people's advocates who work with gang-affected young women and girls in London, Manchester and the West Midlands.A spokesman added: "We recently announced plans to recruit 20,000 more police officers and empower them to use fair and intelligence-led stop and search, to prevent more young people falling victim to knife crime."Earlier this year South Yorkshire Police was one of seven forces to receive extra Home Office funding to tackle violent crime.The force's assistant chief constable, Tim Forber, said while knife crime is still predominately a male problem, it is increasingly about "vulnerability" rather than gender."It's a very small proportion (of women) but it's a worrying proportion-we don't want to see any young people, any women carrying knives in society."I don't think it's any more nuanced, than it is for men, it's about vulnerable young people getting drawn into the fringes of organized crime."Jennifer Blake is a former gang leader from Peckham, in South London, who now works as a community support worker and independent gangs consultant. She told the BBC that, for some women, a knife is a normal thing to have in your bag, "like lipstick".She said: "We have got girls that stab, but it's just like the elephant in the room. No-one wants to talk about it because no one knows how to deal with it."Everywhere you go you have problems with girls and their identity, their self-worth and those are the vulnerable ones that boys end up picking up."She says some girls and women from broken homes see street gangs as their family and will do anything to fit it."Knife, guns, drugs- they are the couriers for it. They're not going to get stopped by police, and the men know that."In total, between 2014 and 2018 there were more than 5,800 recorded knife possession crimes involving women.Data from 38 forces out of 39 in England showed almost a quarter of knife possession offences involved girls under the age of 18, with the youngest aged seven.

                Suicide rate among young women in Britain highest on record: report
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON -- The number of young women in Britain killing themselves has reached the highest level on record, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said in a report Tuesday.ONS said in 2018 there were 6,507 suicides registered in Britain, with the rate of people ending their own lives significantly higher than that in 2017, representing the first increase since 2013.Suicide rates among the under 25s have increased in recent years, particularly 10 to 24-year-old females where the rate has increased significantly since 2012 to its highest level with 3.3 deaths per 100,000 females in 2018, added ONS.Nick Stripe, head of Health Analysis and Life Events at ONS, said: "We saw a significant increase in the rate of deaths registered as suicide last year which has changed a trend of continuous decline since 2013."While the exact reasons for this are unknown, the latest data show that this was largely driven by an increase among men who have continued to be most at risk of dying by suicide. In recent years, there have also been increases in the rate among young adults, with females under 25 reaching the highest rate on record for their age group."Stripe said looking at the overall trend since the early 80s, Britain is still witnessing a gradual decline in the rate of suicide for the population as a whole.The figures show that overall 75 percent of registered suicide deaths in 2018 were among men (4,903 deaths), which has been the case since the mid-1990s.Scotland had the highest suicide rate in Britain with 16.1 deaths per 100,000 persons (784 deaths), followed by Wales with a rate of 12.8 per 100,000 (349 deaths) and England the lowest with 10.3 deaths per 100,000 (5,021 deaths).The 45 to 49 years age group had the highest age-specific suicide rate for both men and women, the results revealed.ONS added that as seen in previous years, the most common method of suicide in the Britain was hanging, accounting for almost 60 percent of all suicides among males and 45 percent of all suicides among females.ONS said: "Since 1981, suicide rates for both males and females have generally been on a downward trend. The latest suicide rate for males is like that observed in 2013, when it previously peaked, but it still remains significantly lower than in 1988 when it was at its highest. Among females, suicide rates have generally been consistent over the past decade, however, the latest rate is significantly higher than that observed in 2007, when it was at its lowest."Across Britain North East England registered the highest suicide rate among men, while London had the lowest rate. London also had the lowest rate of female suicides, with the Yorkshire/Humber and South West regions of England recording the highest levels of female deaths from suicide.
