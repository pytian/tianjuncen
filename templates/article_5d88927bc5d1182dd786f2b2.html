                Scholar remembered for Deng meeting
            </p>
            <p>
                To many in China and the United States, Winston L. Yang was a prolific scholar in Asian studies. But in the final analysis, Yang was a "Chinese compatriot" to be forever remembered for his contributions to relations across the Taiwan Straits, his friends and family have said.At a memorial service Tuesday for Yang, who passed away on Aug 17 at age 86, relatives and friends highlighted the historic meeting between him and former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in June 1983, at which Deng formally unveiled his ideas about "one country, two systems".Xu Xueyuan, a minister at the Chinese embassy in Washington who attended the service Tuesday, said that people will always remember Yang as the "witness and supporter of the scientific vision of 'one country, two systems'".Deng, in a meeting 36 years ago in Beijing with Yang, then a professor at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, raised the six policies on realizing the peaceful reunification of the mainland and Taiwan."The most important issue is the reunification of the motherland," Deng told Yang, according to Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume III. "Peaceful reunification does not mean that the mainland will swallow up Taiwan."In March of this year, you held a forum in San Francisco on the prospects for China's reunification. That was a very good thing to do," Deng said.Norman Fu, a longtime friend of Yang in the United States, noted that Yang interviewed Deng when he "unveiled for the first time this formula 'one country, two systems', which Yang had helped propagate in the ensuing years.Fu said it is "very unfortunate" some people in Taiwan as well as in Hong Kong have "kind of deviated" from the original formula proposed by Deng."If they had followed strictly according to the letter of the formula — 'one country, two systems' — probably a lot of the problems and conflicts would have been avoided. That's my way of looking at it," Fu said.Yang had contributed extensively to Chinese and English publications on politics, including how to improve China-US relations and cross-Straits relations, according to Fu."In the final analysis, I believe Dr Yang was a true Chinese compatriot, despite the fact he was a naturalized American citizen," Fu said. "I feel that his heart was always with China, with the Chinese people."Yang was chosen as an adviser on China affairs to the Carter administration, according to Cheng Chen, Yang's niece.He had traveled to China frequently, and in the early 1980s, he led trade or academic delegations from the US 10 times a year, helping to forge sister-ship relations between at least five Chinese provinces and US states in addition to promoting university exchanges between the two countries, Cheng said.Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesperson for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing, said Yang devoted his life to relations across the Taiwan Straits and advocated peaceful reunification of China with "unswerving determination"."He worked tirelessly to promote the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, opposing separatist attempts for 'Taiwan independence', unafraid of any slanders," Ma said on Aug 21. "We deeply mourn the passing of Yang. Although he has gone, his demeanor will last forever."Yang's son, David Yang, recalled his father's "real tough life" after moving to Taiwan with his elder sister in 1949. While in high school, he lived alone, supporting himself by selling newspapers, then attended college on the island. He got his PhD at Stanford University before becoming a full professor and chairman of the East Asian Studies Department at Seton Hall."From there, he became the first scholar to interview Deng Xiaoping, which is amazing in itself," Yang said.He said Yang was "extremely driven" and a highly focused individual, demonstrating a genuine willingness to help all those around him and never expecting anything back in return."My dad always had very high expectations for people around him. He just expects people to be better than they were," he said. "We all strive every day — we take something out and we become better individuals. It's his wisdom that guides us."

                Fed chief to testify on rate cuts
            </a>
            <p>
                US inflation is low, and the June jobs report that came out last week was strong, suggesting an economy with no major problems ahead.Yet, many expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates a quarter of a point when it meets July 30-31.Analysts, pundits and politicians are wondering why.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will give his views on the need for an interest rate cut — or the importance of holding rates steady — when he testifies on Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee and Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee.Some believe the slowing rate of growth, dipping to an estimated 1.3 percent in the second quarter of 2019 from an annualized rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter, calls for a booster shot.Others foresee trouble ahead from the ongoing US-China trade dispute because tariffs raise prices and have the potential to disrupt supply chains, tossing production and retail sales into turmoil.That would be a serious problem because consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the US gross domestic product, the monetary value of all goods sold and services provided.US President Donald Trump argues that the current rate of 2.25-2.50 percent limits economic growth. "If we had a Fed that would lower interest rates, we would be like a rocket ship. We don't have a Fed that knows what it's doing," Trump said last week.A cut reduces bond yields, making stocks more attractive to investors. A cut also may reduce credit card and home mortgage rates, boosting retail and home sales.A cut would be bad news for small savers, however, because interest earned on deposits will decline.The market was mixed Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 22.65 points, or 0.08 percent, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up. All three indices declined Monday.Larry Kudlow, White House economic adviser, on Tuesday said Powell's job is safe "at the present time".The Federal Reserve is an independent governmental agency, and its actions do not have to be approved by Trump or anyone else, and asFed spokeswoman Michelle Smith said in June: "Under the law, a Federal Reserve Board chair can only be removed for cause."But Trump's comments may create a problem for Powell. If he cuts rates he may be seen as caving in to Trump's demands and thereby eroding the independence of the Fed.Trump needs a strong economy when he seeks re-election in 2020. Since 1900, about 80 percent of incumbent presidents have been re-elected. Since Franklin Delano Roosevelt won the White House in 1932, every incumbent president who campaigned with a strong economy has been re-elected. President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, lost his bid for re-election in 1980 because unemployment reached 7.15 percent and inflation was 12.67 — a toxic combination known as "stagflation" that strangled the economy.By contrast, the June 2019 jobs report showed that US employers added 224,000 non-farm jobs, up from 72,000 created in May. It was the 105th consecutive month employment has increased, the US Labor Department reported. The annual inflation rate was 1.8 percent for the 12 months ended in May, below the Fed's target of 2 percent. The Labor Department will release its next report on Thursday and provide the inflation rate for the 12 months ended June 2019.The June job numbers are the first full-month look at the labor market since Trump hiked tariffs on May 10, to 25 percent from 10 percent on Chinese Imports valued at $200 billion. The labor force participation rate, the share of working-age adults employed or looking for a job, rose to 62.0 percent from 62.8 percent in May. The unemployment rate edged up to 3.7 percent in June because more Americans returned to the labor force to look for a job.In June, Goldman Sachs analyst Jan Hatzius correctly forecast that the Fed would hold rates unchanged while being open to possible cuts later this year. The Federal Open Market Committee now projects at least one cut by December."Most of the dovish Fedspeak over the past several weeks has emphasized the increased uncertainty (especially with regard to trade policy) around a fairly optimistic central case as a reason for potential rate cuts," he said in a research note to investors. "But while trade uncertainty has not gone away, the decision by presidents Trump and Xi (Jinping) to return to the negotiating table and suspend the next tariff increase has reduced it, at least in the near term."

                Calls for regulation in gaming industry as children drain parents' bank accounts
            </a>
            <p>
                Earlier this month in the United Kingdom, a father of 3 found that his bank had mysteriously declined all of his payments. Thomas Carter's children were big fans of the game FIFA on the Nintendo Switch, an innocent looking and colorful console, no larger than a tablet phone. Unknowingly to the hapless father, his children had made purchases on the game through the console, racking up a bill of more than 550 pounds ($685) and wiping out the family's bank account. By no means a small sum of money, this amount is comparable to the average monthly price to rent a property in the UK.The story has since spread, and shocked many parents who view the mysterious activities their children carry out on these gaming consoles with a new form of anxiety. Many video games now demand in-game purchases, designed in a manner that makes them addictively rewarding and allows producers to tap in to parents' credit card details. The concept of your own children being able to wipe out family savings infinitely faster than a burglar could physically break into your home and loot everything, is hard for parents of this generation to take in.Yet the problem is so widespread across the world that parents such as Thomas Carter should consider themselves lucky. Susie Breare told the BBC: "My son spent 3,160 pounds in one game. He is 22 years old and has cerebral palsy, complex epilepsy, autism and learning difficulties. I have phoned and emailed (the video game company provider BlastworksLtd) several times but have had no response. It is extremely distressing that vulnerable people, such as my son, become victims of what is thought to be an educational game. I have tried tirelessly to recoup his life savings but constantly come up against a brick wall."Such horror stories are common across the world. China too is facing an underage gaming epidemic, with many parents across Asia also at risk of unknowingly allowing their children to make in-game payments. This is easily achieved with just a few swipes of a finger as the technology lacks secure parental authentication procedures. Some steps have been taken in the right direction however. Chinese internet technology company NetEase, in partnership with Warcraft creator Blizzard, has developed a Parenting Care Platform which goes some way to monitoring video game activity. Predominantly aimed at reducing a child's screen time, itself a widespread issue in Asia, it allows caregivers to monitor in-app purchases and can ban access to certain games.Worth $93 billion, the global video game industry dwarfs any other entertainment industry in the world, including film, television and music. The growing trend for these games is to provide them for free, relying on in-app purchases for profit. Shiny graphics and "lootboxes" entice children, though the marketing does not highlight the financial risk. A game suitable for players over the age of 3 years may allow a toddler direct access to the bank of mum and dad, often under their own noses. Even more worryingly, some politicians in the UK have raised concerns that this may encourage gambling like behavior at an early age.It is therefore vital that both tighter government regulation and more powerful monitoring tools are offered to parents, so that children cannot be responsible for financial disasters, both for their families and potentially even their future selves.

                China slams latest tariffs as 'bullying'
            </a>
            <p>
                Nation should be fully prepared to fight an extended battle, says expertChinese officials and experts said that Washington's plan to impose a 10 percent tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods starting Sept 1 is irrational and irresponsible, hurts the interests of China and the world and is not in the long-term interests of the US.The trade friction and new planned tariffs are harmful for both China and the United States, and the global economy overall, and this has been proven by capital markets around the world, according to Tong Jiadong, former vice-president of Nankai University in Tianjin.China should be fully prepared to fight a long battle in order to win the opportunity of further development in the future, Tong said.Zhao Zhongxiu, president of Shandong University of Finance and Economics, said China is facing a strategic opportunity to turn pressure into positive growth momentum, as external pressure has become a normal circumstance."China has demonstrated the endurance of its economy through the trade dispute," Zhao said, adding that disagreements in trade, technology and finance in the past have shown that countries can have trouble enduring such pressure if they don't have their own strategic advantages.Zhao suggested that China can rely on the development of high-tech industries to offset the economic impact brought by the trade friction and seize the opportunities generated by fast-growing industries such as information technology, aviation and artificial intelligence to expand the output value of high-tech industries and maintain a stable GDP growth rate.China can also use its huge market, rich human resources and institutional advantages to achieve a higher level of opening-up and enlarge its trade volume with other partners such as the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations, the European Union, Russia and Brazil, said Yu Miaojie, an economics professor at Peking University's National School of Development.The 10-member ASEAN became China's second-largest trading partner, after the European Union, in the first half of this year, overtaking the US for the first time since 1997, according to the General Administration of Customs.The trade dispute with the US has also pushed Chinese manufacturers and service providers to expand their global presence via international industrial capacity cooperation, transit trade and other commercial activities at a faster pace, especially in economies participating in the Belt and Road Initiative, Yu said.Ambassador Zhang Jun, permanent representative of China to the United Nations, told media on Friday that the US announcement further deviates from the right track and US consumers are paying more."Practices of unilateralism, protectionism and bullying hurt the world ... and will not solve the problems of the US," Zhang said.He said China is not fighting for itself alone, but also for an open, transparent, nondiscriminatory multilateral trading system.Walter Mondale, formerly US vice-president under president Jimmy Carter, joined signatories to a letter expressing concern over US trade policies. Mondale, along with 100 others, added his name to an open letter to US President Donald Trump and Congress over the weekend."We are deeply concerned about the growing deterioration in US relations with China, which we believe does not serve American or global interests," the letter states.

                Carter poised to make history by returning for 22nd season
            </a>
            <p>
                ATLANTA - Vince Carter is putting off retirement for at least one more season in order to claim the longest career in NBA history all to himself.A source familiar with the situation on Monday confirmed Carter has agreed to a one-year contract to return to the Atlanta Hawks for his record 22nd season.The source spoke to Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been officially announced.The 42-year-old Carter is tied with Robert Parish, Kevin Garnett, Kevin Willis and recently retired Dirk Nowitzki - all of whom played for 21 seasons - for the longest careers in NBA history."Just waiting for the right opportunity," he said on a recent conference call to discuss the upcoming Jr. NBA Global Championship, when questioned by a reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. "Nothing has changed as far as that goal and that dream of mine."Essentially an extra coach during his first season with the Hawks, Carter served as a mentor to some of the NBA's most promising young talent, including point guard Trae Young and forward John Collins.This year, the Hawks have added first-round picks D'Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish, giving the team two more players who will surely benefit from Carter's experience and leadership.Carter also showed last season that he's still got some hoop skills. He was a valuable member of the playing rotation on a rebuilding team, playing in 76 games with nine starts, averaging 17.5 minutes and 7.4 points per contest.While Carter is likely to get less playing time after the additions of Hunter and Reddish, the Hawks wanted him back and finish off what is expected to be a 14-man roster this season.Carter entered the league in 1998 - the same year Young was born - as the fifth overall pick out of North Carolina.He sparked a wave of "Vinsanity "in Toronto, where his high-flying style made him one of the league's top players. With the Raptors, Carter began a run of 10 straight seasons in which he appeared in the All-Star Game, averaging more than 20 points a game.Carter was dealt to New Jersey in a blockbuster trade early in the 2004-05 and spent nearly five seasons with the Nets.Since then, he bounced around to Orlando, Phoenix, Dallas, Memphis and Sacramento before landing in Atlanta last season.The only blemish on his resume is the lack of an NBA title, which isn't likely to change in Atlanta, where the Hawks are in the midst of a total roster makeover focused on young talent.Atlanta went 29-53 last season and is again pegged as a long shot to make the playoffs in the Eastern Conference.After reporting for training camp a year ago, Carter said he still feels like a 20-something when a new season rolls around."This is like I'm in my third, fourth, fifth year," he said. "I'm excited about the opportunity. I'm excited about playing. I still love playing. I still love competing. I still enjoy the traveling, the ups and downs of the league. That's what it's all about. It's hard to let go."Coach Lloyd Pierce, who is heading into his second season with the Hawks, loved having Carter around to give players such as Young and Collins an extra shoulder to lean on during their transition to the NBA.Pierce is only eight months older than Carter."When we have our locker-room and on-the-bus debates and conversations, he's on our side," Pierce joked. "He can relate a little closer to the coaching staff than he can with the players."Associated Press
