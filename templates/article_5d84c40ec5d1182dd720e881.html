                Tech competitor is being choked, but China is learning

                Seems like the United States doesn't just make washing machines or pork rinds - it's in the hostage-taking business, too.At least that's what it looks like after the US Department of Commerce announced Shenzhen-based tech giant Huawei would be put on the "Entity List", a ledger of firms legally prohibited from trade with the US based on - well, based on whatever reason President Donald Trump pulls out of thin air.Pretty smart way to run a global economy. But with such ire thrown a single company's way, you might be wondering what all the fuss is about.The answer is as predictable as it is simple.Germany, Great Britain and other countries in the European Union were recently considering Huawei-based infrastructure for their 5G wireless networks. Adoption of this technology would represent a communications sea change and a big economic loss for the US.So you can guess what happened next. The US begged and pleaded for its allies to freeze the company out over "security concerns". But those pleas mostly fell on deaf ears due to lack of proof. So it's no great mystery why the US has acted this way - its traditional partners weren't doing its bidding, thus a brute-force solution was required.This is not without precedent. The 2018 trade ban on Chinese telecom outfit ZTE was a "Sputnik moment" for Chinese tech. Trump showed then he had no interest in playing by any set of rules but his own, and the punitive tactics against that company showed the rest of the industry it had to prepare for a similar assault.By stockpiling components and dedicating more resources to building operating systems and chipware of their own, Huawei and others took steps to protect themselves from the inevitable.Recent US moves singling out Huawei show the prudence of such a strategy - and not just at an enterprise level. National policy to safeguard domestic companies has proven quite wise, given the current hostile climate.To say nothing of what this does to US tech's credibility. By following Trump's lead, Google has shown its true colors. Many lamented the company's exit from the Chinese mainland, wondering what possible reason there would be to keep a transnational colossus like Google from operating. Well, now we know - the second the US government asked it to enact an explicitly political demand, it did so without hesitation.Imagine if the Chinese tech industry had totally relied on Google software and applications, and an order like this one came down from on high. The US could hold the entire country's smartphones hostage for as long as it liked. This takes on a new level of irony when you remember the US case against Huawei hinges on unproven claims the company is beholden to the Chinese government. After recent events, it's tempting to think, "Oh, like Google?"And I'm only half-joking there. This belligerent move gives us an opportunity to re-evaluate the supposedly benevolent nature of US tech. Saturated by a media storm slandering their competitors, it's easy to forget US internet behemoths do the bidding of their government on a regular basis.Facebook conspired with the National Security Agency for its PRISM surveillance program, and Amazon built a computing cloud for the Central Intelligence Agency. Google joined PRISM around the same time as Facebook, but its relationship with intel-gathering agencies goes even deeper; it is the product of CIA and NSA research grants.So it's abundantly clear a Google or Facebook given free rein to operate would be something of a "fox in the henhouse" - albeit one that keeps its hunger in check long enough to build a customer base among the chickens.But that's not the only wrinkle in this story. As these companies move into new markets they sap burgeoning domestic rivals of their innovative oomph. They leverage economies of scale to dominate and drive out smaller "underdogs", becoming synonymous with the services they provide.In doing so, they grow into gargantuan hyper-monopolies, wielding a level of influence previously held only by large countries.Ultimately, they answer to their home nations - in this case the US - functioning as "soft power" organs while claiming nominal autonomy. This is imperialism for the 21st century; the kind of mechanism for worldwide consolidation of capital Vladimir Lenin observed when he wrote his seminal text over 100 years ago.There's no telling what the technological landscape might look like without this corporate oligarchy in the driver's seat. Rather than the "Big Four" US-based companies-Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook, backed by the economic and military might of the planet's only superpower - dictating what everyone else does, we could see more equal partnerships sprout up among all countries, inside and outside the developed world.China has shown it's possible to build independent industry and scrape one's way out of a colonial destiny. What might a Nigeria, Bolivia or Pakistan do in similar circumstances? What kinds of new developments would we see in a tech ecosystem not under the thumb of the Big Four?Labor is only one area where an alternate state of affairs holds appeal. At present, with their concentrated resources and power, these companies can siphon top workers from across the globe, leading to an international "brain drain" that dries up home countries' talent pools. This leaves those domestic sectors in the lurch, as US megacorps have "kicked away the ladder" they used to climb to the top.We see echoes of this phenomenon in the trade "grievances" the US has brought against China - a topic for another time. But no matter how you look at it, this regime of coercion and control denies former colonial subjects their chance to rise up and become strong, sovereign nations.You'd be forgiven for thinking this practice reproduces those old exploitative relations - but of course the innocent, freedom-loving US would never do such a thing.Just like all other measures taken against Huawei - and China in a broader sense - this is an attempt to choke out a competitor and maintain US hegemony through the foreseeable future.It happened to Japan in the 1980s, and the playbook has changed little in the intervening years. The difference between then and now is China was watching, and learning.There won't be a present-day Plaza Accords, where China buckles to pressure and concedes key planks of the system that has had unprecedented success. And these strongarm tactics won't work, either. Fair negotiations don't happen when one party has a gun to the other's head.China already knows what it's like to suffer under the yoke of a colonial master. No matter what the US or anyone else tries, it won't do so again.The writer is a copy editor with China Daily's website chinadaily.com.cn.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of China Daily.

                ASYLUM-SEEKERS FACE ANXIOUS WAIT AT BORDER
            </a>
            <p>
                More Central American migrants trying to enter US From a distance, United States Border Patrol vehicles can be seen stopping along or inspecting the border near the San Ysidro port of entry, the country's busiest land border crossing, which connects the San Diego area in the US and Tijuana in Mexico. On the southern side of a corrugated metal fence are the same rolling hills studded with clumps of brush that can be found to the north. A rusted barrier, lined by razor wire on the ground, stands in the warm April sun. This section of the border has seen an increased flow of migrants from Central America seeking asylum in the US. "I saw migrants' camps close to the border until one or two months ago," said a tour guide working for American WF Vacation. The man, who only gave his surname as Liu, had just led 30 tourists from Dalian, Liaoning province, through the San Ysidro port of entry back into the US. A half-day tour of Tijuana is usually the first stop on the company's 10-day itinerary from the US West Coast to the East Coast. Liu said such itineraries had not been disrupted even amid the national emergency called by US President Donald Trump concerning the US-Mexico border. Emmanuel Molina, 33, an architect in San Diego who crosses the border frequently to meet with friends and classmates in Tijuana, said, "Sometimes, the word 'crisis' is in one's head." "I read news articles saying the migrants made a lot of trouble for local vendors at the border. I asked the vendors, and they told me they had no trouble," said Molina, a Mexican-American who was born and raised in San Diego. Molina, who has never seen a migrant camp, said he believed the adults and children who gather at a plaza in front of the San Ysidro port of entry in Tijuana were from Central America. He once invited a family of five from El Salvador to eat tacos with him. "A warm meal is the least I can share with them. Life was tough (in El Salvador). The family came here to escape violence and seek work. They are nice people," Molina said. He never saw the family again, and said no people appearing to be asylum seekers were gathering at the plaza any more. At the Otay Mesa port of entry, about 16 kilometers east of San Ysidro, there were also no signs of asylum seekers. A woman working for a McDonald's outlet about a four-minute walk from the entry point, who gave her name only as Annalee, said she had never seen any asylum seekers near the border. She and her family have lived in Tijuana and worked in the US for many years. "Waiting time at the port of entry is two or three hours now. It was 10 or 15 minutes in the past," she said, adding that this is inconvenient, but it would be unimaginable if the border was shut down. On the Mexican side of the border, long lines of cars wait to cross. Manuel Gutierrez, who cleans cars at a parking lot near the border, said, "These people are going to work afternoon shifts in the US." He spoke in fluent English because he used to work in the US. "A very good apartment on the Mexican side costs about $200 a month, but the rent for similar apartment in San Diego is between $2,000 and $3,000 a month," he said. Migrants had never approached this port of entry, Gutierrez said. They used to stay in a makeshift shelter in a stadium, but because it was close to the border, the Mexican authorities closed it and put them in warehouses farther away. 'Credible fear' Recalling the life she left behind in Honduras, a 37-year-old woman, calling herself Maria, breathed a sigh of relief while resting on a cot at a shelter run by the San Diego Rapid Response Network, a coalition of human rights and faith organizations. The shelter is in a former courthouse in downtown San Diego, about 27 km from the San Ysidro port of entry. "The economy is really bad in Honduras, but the main reason we fled home is that there is a lot of violence there," Maria said through a translator. Her family made a living by selling food in Honduras, but she said gang members kept extorting them. "If you don't pay them, they threaten to kill your family," she said. Events on the night of Dec 29 were the last straw for the family. "One gang member wanted to be with me, but I didn't want to be with him. At about 11:30 pm that night, he broke into the house where I was staying with my mother. He then started stabbing me," Maria said. "He didn't kill me, but only because my younger brother intervened," she said. Her brother ended up with a broken knee. Maria's knife wounds have healed, leaving red scars about 5 centimeters long on her forearms, but the incident is etched permanently on her mind. In January, Maria, her 20-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son boarded a bus heading to Guatemala. Her husband was in Mexico at the time and had heard that the US was granting asylum to people from Central America. After traveling thousands of kilo-meters by bus across Mexico, Maria, her husband and their two children arrived at the San Ysidro crossing and were given a number. They waited in Mexico for six weeks before being held in custody for three days by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. After passing the initial screening, known as a "credible fear" interview, the family was released and dropped off at the shelter. "I'm in a place where I feel I'm protected. That person who hurt me will not come here and hurt me again," Maria said. Wearing a monitoring bracelet around her right ankle, she said they would leave the shelter in two days for Iowa, where her husband's sister lives. The family is required to appear in an immigration court later, which will decide whether their asylum case is legitimate. "I'm not worried now, and believe that if you follow the law, everything will be OK," Maria said. At the start of this year, Central Americans were among the largest groups of people applying for asylum in the US. According to the International Rescue Committee, people living in Central America's Northern Triangle region, which comprises Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, are enduring violence comparable to that in a war zone. According to an NBC News report on April 9, the White House is working on plans to approve fewer Central American migrants in initial screenings by putting border agents in charge of the interview process because they will be tougher on asylum seekers. The issue has become a humanitarian one because the White House has significantly cut the number of asylum applications it processes daily, creating a bottleneck of hundreds of frightened, vulnerable people on the Mexican side of the border, the San Diego Rapid Response Network said. On Oct 26, the US began releasing hundreds of migrant families on to San Diego's streets without following the usual protocol that ensures asylum seekers have travel plans and the means to join relatives and friends elsewhere in the country, the response network said. Michael Hopkins, CEO of Jewish Family Service of San Diego, an agency that operates the shelter, said that since then, about 12,500 people have been released by the US and passed through the network's shelter, the only one in Southern California. "These are families who crossed the border with no money, no cellphones and no tickets to go anywhere. They would more than likely be victims of human trafficking, or end up on the street if we didn't assist them," Hopkins said. "San Diego has a large homeless population. Even if just a small percentage (of the 12,500 people released by the US) fell through the cracks, it would greatly increase the homeless population," he added. Every day, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers drop asylum-seeking families at the shelter any time after 5 pm. The facility currently shelters about 200 people, most of them staying for 24 to 48 hours before leaving for their final destinations across the US. California is their main choice, followed by Texas, Florida and New Jersey. Staff members and volunteers at the shelter help to look after medical requirements, travel arrangements and legal work. When migrants are dropped off at the shelter, they are thirsty and hungry, wearing clothes that have not been changed for months, and are without shoelaces (a jail suicide prevention policy), Hopkins said. While they await medical screening, volunteers provide them with new clothing and shoes. "We look for flu and tuberculosis symptoms, scabies and lice," Hopkins said. "We want to make sure that these folks are coming into the country healthy before they travel to their final destinations." It is not unusual for families to cry when they eat dinner, as it is an emotional experience for both the migrants and those who work at the shelter, he said. Although the shelter has secured $2.2 million in emergency funding from California to support operations through June, it still needs another $500,000 for the next six months. On the Jewish Family Service of San Diego's GoFundMe page, nearly $196,000 has been raised in five months. But anti-immigrant groups are protesting over what Hopkins considers critical humanitarian work. "Haters have been here in front of the shelter when the bus drops off asylum-seeking families. They believe these people are invaders," he said. "All I see is young moms and dads with very young children who talk about making the journey because they want new lives for their children." San Diegans for Secure Borders, one of more than 80 anti-immigrant groups in California listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center, has regularly posted memes mocking immigrants on its Facebook page. One of the memes, a map of Mexico with "A" marked at the southern border with Guatemala and "B" at the northern border with the US, states, "If the migrants are escaping danger, why not seek asylum between A and B?" It echoes the Trump administration's controversial policy Remain in Mexico, formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols. 'Lives in danger' The policy, launched in January at the San Ysidro port of entry and later expanded to El Paso, Texas, requires asylum seekers to stay in Mexico until their scheduled court date in the US. They had previously been allowed to remain in the US while awaiting their court hearings. The US has defended the policy as necessary to deter "baseless" asylum claims that "exploit" the country's immigration laws. But critics argue that forcing migrants to wait in Mexico puts their lives in danger because of violence, crowded encampments and vulnerability to local gangs. They said the policy also violates their legal right to seek asylum in the US. On April 8, a federal judge in California blocked the policy after finding the administration had not done enough to ensure asylum seekers' safety. Only a few days after the practice was halted, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals granted the US government's emergency motion to stay the lower court's ruling. The practice resumed on April 16. Trump has repeatedly threatened to close the border with Mexico and impose a 25 percent tariff on all cars made there if Mexico stops apprehending migrants trying to cross into the US. The Mexican government has discouraged migrants from continuing their journey north and urged them to stay in the country by granting them a large number of humanitarian visas, according to media reports. Doris Meissner and Sarah Pierce, policy analysts at the Migration Policy Institute, said in an article published on the organization's website that the Trump administration's measures, including the zero-tolerance policy that led to family separations, have seemingly encouraged prospective migrants to travel to the US before such policies are hardened further. In the fiscal year that began on Oct 1, the number of "unaccompanied children" and "family units" apprehended along the southwest border has reached 225,482, representing 62 percent of all apprehensions, according to the figures released by US Customs and Border Protection on April 9. Despite the rise in the number of asylum-seeking families, the total number of border apprehensions last year was lower than for most of the past six decades, according to CBP data. The CBP southwest border sector reported 396,579 apprehensions in the 2018 fiscal year, compared with more than 1 million in the 1980s, '90s and early 2000s. Many factors are behind the recent increase in arrivals, such as endemic violence, limited economic opportunities and poor governance in the Northern Triangle area, as well as available jobs and long-standing social and family ties in the US, the article by Meissner and Pierce said. Many people from that area fleeing to the US border are banding together and traveling in "caravans" for safety. While only a small percentage have arrived in such caravans, their emergence may have inspired more people to go to the US. In front of a liquor store near the Otay Mesa port of entry in Tijuana, Gutierrez, the car cleaner, showed a local newspaper article that reported 1,100 migrants from Central America were arriving in Mexico. He saw migrants climb over the border fence near the beach and turn themselves in to US agents. "If home is safe, who would want to flee?" Gutierrez asked. liazhu@chinadailyusa.com  From left: Migrants from Central American countries line up to apply for entry to the US; a corrugated metal fence at the border; people from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador stay in a makeshift shelter in San Diego.(China Daily Global 05/06/2019 page1)

                False narrative fuels Trade War
            </a>
            <p>
                Amid charges and counter-charges, the US-China conflict has now moved squarely into the danger zone. And in light of the sharp recent escalation of pressures from the American side — the early May hike in tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200 billion of Chinese exports to the US along with a promise of more to come on the remaining $325 billion of exports, together with a full frontal assault in Huawei — even the odds of a cosmetic agreement are slipping by the day.Washington’s penchant for China bashing has been taken to an entirely new level. Republicans and Democrats agree on very little these days. But blaming China for America’s economic ills resonates across the political spectrum. Once the pro-business constituency of free trade, the Trump takeover of the Republican Party has now embraced tariffs with open arms. For pro-working class Democrats, many of whom have long warned of the perils of globalization and trade liberalization, the transformation into tariff warriors has been relatively easy. After years of abusive trade practices, goes the shared bipartisan rhetoric, it is high time America stood up against China.Today’s China bashing has gone well beyond the strain of anti-Japan sentiment that was evident some 30 years ago. Back then, the US manufacturing sector was experiencing its first taste of pressures on jobs and real wages that could be traced to a sharply widening trade deficit. A mercantilist Japan, fixated on suppressing the value of the yen and accounting for about 42% of the total US merchandise trade deficit in the first half of the 1980s, was the culprit. This led to the so-called Plaza Accord of 1985, when the so-called G-5 coalition of leading industrial nations put Japan in a straight-jacket of currency appreciation that led to asset bubbles and a string of lost decades of economic stagnation and deflation. Having studied the lessons of Japan very carefully, China’s leadership has resisted comparable advice from the West. And so Washington has embraced different and tougher tactics to address a Chinese threat that it judges to be far more serious than that which arose from Japan back in the late 1980s.From Japan to China, the United States has been quick to see itself as the victim, choosing to blame others for economic problems that are very much of its own making. Yet this blame game flies in the face of some of the basic and most elementary principles of macroeconomics. Economics students are quickly taught the simple national income accounting identity that investment must always saving. The problem comes in the corollary: When nations are short of saving and want to invest and grow, they must borrow surplus saving from abroad and run current account deficits in order to attract the foreign capital. These balance-of-payments deficits — which the US has experienced in every year since 1982 (with the exception of 1991, when the US ran a small surplus by charging other nations for its military campaign to wage the Gulf War) — are a recipe for trade deficits. But since the trade deficits stem from macro saving-investment imbalances, they tend to be broad based, or multi-lateral, in scope. Indeed, in 2018, the United States had merchandise trade deficits with 102 countries.Therein lies the pitfalls of China bashing. Yes, China accounted for fully 48% of America’s massive $879 billion merchandise trade deficit in 2018. That makes it a lightning rod in the current US policy debate. Eliminating the Chinese piece of the deficit, goes the argument, is the only way to “make America great again” and thereby alleviate pressures on American workers.If it were only that easy. For a saving-short US economy, there is no bilateral fix for a multilateral problem. A China-centric solution is like “whack-a-mole.” Eliminating one piece of the trade deficit without fixing the saving problem — a very real possibility in light of a further depression of domestic saving following from the ill-timed Trump tax cuts of late 2017 — simply means that trade will be diverted from China to other foreign producers. Inasmuch as China is one of America’s lowest cost foreign suppliers, that means the trade diversion will invariably go to higher cost foreign producers — the functional equivalent of a tax hike on American consumers.The likelihood that China bashing will backfire for a saving short US economy raises a far deeper question: Why does Washington pursue such a flagrantly inconsistent strategy? The answer is as much an outgrowth of hegemonic overreach as it is a reflection China’s alleged unfair trading practices. With the dollar pre-eminent as the world’s reserve currency, the United States has developed a sense of entitlement toward open-ended budget deficits that are funded by dollar-denominated debt issuance in its own currency.Never mind the inefficiencies of a healthcare system that eats up 18% of GDP, or a defense budget that is essentially equal to the combined military outlays of the next seven largest defense budgets around the world, or low tax rates that put the current 16.5% revenue share of US GDP well below the 17.4% average of the past 50 years. Washington would rather pursue fiscal recklessness than come clean with the American public. And it would rather blame the consequences of such a strategy on the trading practices of others than take a long hard look in the mirror.Indeed, considerable effort has gone into the construction of a false narrative on China in order to justify America’s aggressive trade policies. China has been charged with a number of so-called Section 301 violations of the US Trade Act of 1974 and vilified, accordingly, in the arena of US public opinion. Yet the evidence behind such allegations is flimsy at best and outright misleading at worst. Apparently, it is much easier to find comfort in the false narrative than to accept responsibility for fiscal excesses and saving shortfalls that spawn the macroeconomic imbalances that give rise to multilateral trade deficits.The tragic irony of a possible trade deal, if it does occur, is that it is likely to focus on a multi-year commitment by China to purchase over $1 trillion of US made goods in an effort to narrow the bilateral trade imbalance between the two nations. This is pure political theater at its worst — underscoring the folly of a bilateral fix for a multilateral problem. It is based on the false premise that this “solution” will address the squeeze on US manufacturing and provide relief to pressures on jobs and real wages of factory workers. Yet nothing could be further from the truth for saving-short America. As noted above, the bilateral fix is a recipe for trade diversion that does next to nothing in providing lasting relief for American workers and consumers.Most significantly, the fixation on the bilateral trade deficit fails to address the structural issues that threaten lasting tensions between the two nations. Market access is at the top of that list — the opportunity of multinational corporations in both nations to invest freely in each other’s markets. The US claims that China’s joint venture requirements imposed on such investments is a recipe for forced technology transfer. As highlighted in the March 2018 Section 301 report of the US Trade Representative (USTR), this charge has become the poster child of the US-China dispute and the foundational evidence for Trump’s tariffs. This has occurred despite the fact that the USTR admits (on page 19 of the March 2018 report) that there is no direct evidence to support the allegation that technology transfer is forced by joint ventures that represent voluntary agreements between US and Chinese partners. Once again, the false narrative apparently matters more than fact-based analytics.Notwithstanding the politics of the blame game, there are plenty of realistic options for resolution. Three, in particular, stand out:Bilateral Investment Treaty. Market access is best addressed through the formalization of cross-border investment rules and standards that are stipulated in a bilateral investment treaty (BIT). The United States currently has 42 BITs on the books and China has 145. Under a BIT, foreign ownership caps can be eliminated, thereby rendering joint ventures unnecessary and taking allegations of forced technology transfer off the table. Prior to the 2016 presidential election in the United Sates, the US and China spent 10 years attempting to negotiate a BIT. Stymied by Trump’s tariffs, those negotiations have been suspended. Restarting BIT negotiations would be the single best strategy to resolve the thorny issue of forced technology transfer.Trans Pacific Partnership. The political decision to abrogate America’s commitment to TPP in the first days of the Trump presidency was a mistake. This multilateral agreement provided a high-quality framework linking 12 nations accounting for 40% of world GDP through cross-border trade liberalization, labor standards, intellectual property rules, Internet protocols, and environmental norms. With China on the outside looking in, TPP would have provided a powerful mechanism for Chinese conformity to many of the structural norms that are currently being contested. While a rethinking of America’s TPP strategy may not be politically possible for President Trump, it may well be a realistic option after the 2020 presidential election.Global cyber accord. Like the trade conflict, this is not a bilateral problem. The US and China should take the lead in forging a global cyber accord, complete with pooled metrics of cyber incursions, attack-reduction targets and a robust dispute-resolution mechanism.The United States and China are on a collision course. The world’s two largest economies have accounted for fully 44% of world GDP growth since 2008. If they opt for a superficial resolution or fail to come to terms on their trade conflict, the global economy could well falter. Resolution is possible but it won’t be easy in the current climate. Saving-short America’s bipartisan political support of China bashing is especially problematic in threatening to turn a trade war into a protracted and destructive economic cold war. Now, more than ever, a fragile world is in desperate need of political will and wisdom — and a leadership courage that is sorely lacking today.The author is a faculty member at Yale University and former Chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, is the author of Unbalanced: The Codependency of America and China (2014).The author contributed this article to China Watch exclusively.

                US shows true colors with Huawei strong-arm tactics: Opinion
            </a>
            <p>
                Seems like the United States doesn't just make washing machines or pork rinds — it's in the hostage-taking business, too.At least that's what it looks like after President Donald Trump's Department of Commerce announced Shenzhen tech giant Huawei would be put on the "Entity List", a ledger of firms legally prohibited from trade with the US based on — well, based on whatever reason the president pulls out of thin air. Pretty smart way to run a global economy. But with such ire thrown a single company's way, you might be wondering what all the fuss is about. The answer is as predictable as it is simple.Germany, Great Britain and other countries in the European Union were recently considering Huawei-based infrastructure for their 5G wireless networks. Adoption of this technology would represent a communications sea change and a big economic loss for the US, so you can guess what happened next. The US begged and pleaded for its allies to freeze the company out over "security concerns", but those pleas mostly fell on deaf ears due to lack of proof. So it's no great mystery why the US has acted this way — its traditional partners weren’t doing its bidding, thus a brute-force solution was required.This is not without precedent. The 2018 trade ban against Chinese telecom outfit ZTE was a "Sputnik moment" for Chinese tech. Trump showed then he had no interest in playing by any set of rules but his own, and the punitive tactics against that company showed the rest of the industry it had to prepare for a similar assault. By stockpiling components and dedicating more resources to building operating systems and chipware of their own, Huawei and others took steps to protect themselves from the inevitable. Recent moves singling out Huawei show the prudence of such strategy — and not just at an enterprise level. National policy to safeguard domestic companies has proven quite wise, given the current hostile climate.To say nothing of what this does to US tech's credibility. By following Trump's lead, Google has shown its true colors. Many lamented the company's exit from the Chinese mainland, wondering what possible reason there would be to keep a transnational colossus like Google from operating. Well, now we know — the second the US government asked it to enact an explicitly political demand, it did so without hesitation.Imagine if the Chinese tech industry had totally relied on Google software and applications, and an order like this one came down from on high. The US could hold the entire country's smartphones hostage for as long as it liked. This takes on a new level of irony when you remember the US case against Huawei hinges on unproven claims the company is beholden to the Chinese government. After recent events it's tempting to think, "Oh, like Google?"And I'm only half-joking there. This belligerent move gives us an opportunity to reevaluate the supposedly benevolent nature of US tech. Saturated by a media storm slandering their competitors, it's easy to forget US internet behemoths do the bidding of their government on a regular basis. Facebook conspired with the National Security Agency for its PRISM surveillance program, and Amazon built a computing cloud for the Central Intelligence Agency. Google joined PRISM around the same time as Facebook, but its relationship with intel-gathering agencies goes even deeper; it is the product of CIA and NSA research grants. So it's abundantly clear a Google or Facebook given free rein to operate would be something of a "fox in the henhouse" — albeit one that keeps its hunger in check long enough to build a customer base among the chickens.But that's not the only wrinkle in this story. As these companies move into new markets they sap burgeoning domestic rivals of their innovative oomph. They leverage economies of scale to dominate and drive out smaller "underdogs", becoming synonymous with the services they provide. In so doing they grow into gargantuan hyper-monopolies, wielding a level of influence previously only held by large countries. Ultimately, they answer to their home nations — in this case the United States — functioning as "soft power" organs while claiming nominal autonomy. This is imperialism for the 21st century; the kind of mechanism for worldwide consolidation of capital Vladimir Lenin observed when he wrote his seminal text over 100 years ago.There's no telling what the technological landscape might look like without this corporate oligarchy in the driver's seat. Rather than the "Big Four" US-based companies dictating what everyone else does — backed by the economic and military might of the planet's only superpower — we could see more equal partnerships sprout up among all countries, inside and outside the developed world. China has shown it's possible to build independent industry and scrape one's way out of a colonial destiny. What might a Nigeria, Bolivia or Pakistan do in similar circumstances? What kinds of new developments would we see in a tech ecosystem not under the thumb of Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook?Labor is only one area where an alternate state of affairs holds appeal. At present, with their concentrated resources and power these companies can siphon top workers from across the globe, leading to an international "brain drain" that dries up home countries' talent pools. This leaves those domestic sectors in the lurch, as US megacorps have "kicked away the ladder" they used to climb to the top.We see echoes of this phenomenon in the trade "grievances" the US has brought against China; a topic for another time. But no matter how you look at it, this regime of coercion and control denies former colonial subjects their chance to rise up and become strong, sovereign nations. You'd be forgiven for thinking this practice reproduces those old exploitative relations — but of course the innocent, freedom-loving United States would never do such a thing.Just like all other measures taken against Huawei — and China in a broader sense — this is an attempt to choke out a competitor and maintain US hegemony through the foreseeable future. It happened to Japan in the 1980s, and the playbook has changed little in the intervening years. The difference between then and now is China was watching, and learning. There won't be a present-day Plaza Accords, where China buckles to pressure and concedes key planks of the system that has had unprecedented success. And these strong-arm tactics won't work, either; fair negotiations don't happen when one party has a gun to the other's head.China already knows what it's like to suffer under the yoke of a colonial master. No matter what the US or anyone else tries, it won't do so again.The author is a copy editor with chinadaily.com.cn.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                China is not Japan, US should know that
            </a>
            <p>
                "When governments permit counterfeiting or copying of American products, it is stealing our future, and it is no longer free trade." So said former US president Ronald Reagan, commenting on Japan after the Plaza Accord was concluded in September 1985. These times, in many respects, are a remake of this 1980s movie, but with a reality-television star replacing a Hollywood film star in the presidential leading role-and with a new villain in place of Japan.Back in the 1980s, Japan was portrayed as America's greatest economic threat-not only because of allegations of intellectual property theft, but also because of concerns about currency manipulation, state-sponsored industrial policy, a hollowing out of US manufacturing, and an outsize bilateral trade deficit. In its standoff with the United States, Japan ultimately blinked, but it paid a steep price for doing so-nearly three "lost" decades of economic stagnation and deflation. Today, the same plot features China.Japan, China both scapegoats of US own economic problemsNotwithstanding both countries' objectionable mercantilism, Japan and China had something else in common: They became victims of America's unfortunate habit of making others the scapegoat for its own economic problems. Like Japan bashing in the 1980s, China bashing today is an outgrowth of America's increasingly insidious macroeconomic imbalances. In both cases, a dramatic shortfall in US domestic savings spawned large current-account and trade deficits, setting the stage for battles, 30 years apart, with Asia's two economic giants.When Reagan took office in January 1981, the net domestic savings rate stood at 7.8 percent of national income, and the current account was basically balanced. Within two and a half years, courtesy of Reagan's wildly popular tax cuts, the domestic savings rate had plunged to 3.7 percent, and the current account and the merchandise trade balances swung into perpetual deficit. In this important respect, America's so-called trade problem was very much of its own making.Yet the Reagan administration was in denial. There was little or no appreciation of the link between savings and trade imbalances. Instead, the blame was pinned on Japan, which accounted for 42 percent of US goods trade deficits in the first half of the 1980s. Japan bashing then took on a life of its own with a wide range of grievances over unfair and illegal trade practices. Leading the charge back then was a young deputy US trade representative named Robert Lighthizer.Fast-forward some 30 years and the similarities are painfully evident. Unlike Reagan, President Donald Trump did not inherit a US economy with an ample reservoir of savings. When Trump took office in January 2017, the net domestic saving rate was just 3 percent, well below half the rate at the onset of the Reagan era. But, like his predecessor, who waxed eloquently of a new "morning in America", Trump also opted for large tax cuts-this time to "make America great again".The result was a predictable widening of the federal budget deficit, which more than offset the cyclical surge in private savings that normally accompanies a maturing economic expansion. As a result, the net domestic savings rate actually edged down to 2.8 percent of national income by late 2018, keeping America's international balances deep in the red-with the current-account deficit at 2.6 percent of GDP and the merchandise trade gap at 4.5 percent in late 2018.And that's where China assumes the role that Japan played in the 1980s. On the surface, the threat seems more dire. After all, China accounted for 48 percent of the US merchandise trade deficit in 2018, compared to Japan's 42 percent share in the first half of the 1980s. But the comparison is distorted by global supply chains, which basically didn't exist in the 1980s. Data from the OECD and the World Trade Organization suggest that about 35-40 percent of the bilateral US-China trade deficit reflects inputs made outside of China but assembled and shipped to the US from China. That means the made-in-China portion of today's US trade deficit is actually smaller than Japan's share of the 1980s.US should raise savings rate before charging at windmillsLike the Japan bashing of the 1980s, today's outbreak of China bashing has been conveniently excised from America's broader macroeconomic context. That is a serious mistake. Without raising national savings-highly unlikely under the current US budget trajectory-trade will simply be shifted away from China to America's other trading partners. With this trade diversion likely to migrate to higher-cost platforms around the world, American consumers will be hit with the functional equivalent of a tax hike.Ironically, Trump has summoned the same Robert Lighthizer, veteran of the Japan trade battles of the 1980s, to lead the charge against China. Unfortunately, Lighthizer seems as clueless about the macro argument today as he was back then.In both episodes, the US was in denial, bordering on delusion. Basking in the warm glow of untested supply-side economics-especially the theory that tax cuts would be self-financing-the Reagan administration failed to appreciate the links between mounting budget and trade deficits. Today, the seductive power of low interest rates, coupled with the latest strain of voodoo economics-Modern Monetary Theory-is equally alluring for the Trump administration and a bipartisan consensus of China bashers in the US Congress.The tough macroeconomic constraints facing a savings-short US economy are ignored for good reason: there is no US political constituency for reducing trade deficits by cutting budget deficits and thereby boosting domestic savings. America wants to have its cake and eat it too, with a healthcare system that swallows 18 percent of its GDP, defense spending that exceeds the combined sum of the world's next seven largest military budgets, and tax cuts that have reduced federal government revenue to 16.5 percent of GDP, well below the 17.4 percent average of the past 50 years.This remake of an old movie is disconcerting, to say the least. Once again, the US has found it far easier to bash others-Japan then, China now-than to live within its means. This time, however, the movie might have a very different ending.Stephen S.

                Analyst: trade dispute could lead to recession in US
            </a>
            <p>
                Bank economist says a US downturn due to China trade war is not an "alarmist" prognosisThe ongoing trade dispute with China could tip the US economy into a recession in less than a year, an analyst at investment bank Morgan Stanley believes.US President Donald Trump last month raised tariffs on Chinese imports valued at $200 billion to 25 percent from 10 percent and threatened to impose tariffs on another $300 billion worth of goods.China responded by imposing tariffs totaling $60 billion on US goods. The tit-for-tat between the world's two largest economies has disrupted markets for cars, technology, consumer electronics, clothing and farming."We could end up in a recession in three quarters," Chetan Ahya, the investment bank's chief economist, said in a research note. "Is such a prognosis alarmist? We think otherwise."The Duke University Global Business Outlook found that 48.1 percent of US chief financial officers expect the US will be in a recession by the middle of next year or by the end of 2020.Manufacturing activity slowed in the US, Europe and Asia in May, as the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing continued.A recession could come just as the US presidential election is heating up and could damage Trump's re-election prospects.Gao Feng, spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, said in Beijing that the continuing trade standoff "could cause a recession in the United States and global economies".Christine Lagarde, International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director, said the IMF does not now see the threat of a global recession sparked by trade dispute. Instead, she said growth will slow, but the world economy won't slide into a recession.Usha Haley, the W. Frank Barton Distinguished Chair in International Business and a professor of management at Wichita State University who specializes in China, called talk of a recession sparked by the trade dispute is "apocalyptic"."There might be a recession simply because it's time," Haley told China Daily. "The current strong economy is about 10 years old, and historically, a boom is followed by a downturn. The trade dispute with China creates uncertainty, and that doesn't help because it disrupts long-range planning. The underlying principles of the US economy are OK, but need structural adjustment."The current economic boom began in June 2009 and is 10 years old. While US economic fundamentals remain strong, growth is slowing.The US economy added 75,000 jobs in May, for the 104th consecutive month of employment gains, but hiring dipped. Analysts expected companies to add 180,000 jobs last month, but employers hired only 41.6 percent of the anticipated total.Nevertheless, the nation's unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.6 percent, a 50-year low, and wages remained strong as companies competed to attract and retain employees.The US economy roared between 1991 and 2001, driven by explosive growth of the internet, rising productivity and strong growth across diverse sectors. Employers found it difficult to hire qualified employees needed to expand, driving up wages.The market rose to new highs, creating a bubble in technology stocks. When the bubble of overpriced stocks burst, a recession followed in about a year.The economy boomed between 1982 and 1990 after the Federal Reserve tamed runaway inflation with the highest interest rates in history. US President Ronald Reagan cut taxes, spurring growth. But Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 led to a spike in oil prices that helped to bring on a short recession.Goldman Sachs believes the current US-China trade imbroglio is similar to the US-Japan trade dispute in the 1980s."Back then, targeted trade actions failed to significantly reduce the US-Japan trade imbalance," Michael Cahill wrote in a research report. "Under growing bipartisan support, the US pushed Japan to take more sweeping action such as pledging to increase imports, and significantly cut its trade surplus, or potentially face a 25 percent tariff on all its imports."The result was the Plaza Accord reached in September 1985.The deal sought to correct the trade imbalance between the US, Japan and Germany. Between 1980 and 1985, the US dollar rose by more than 50 percent against the yen, deutsche mark, franc and British pound as the US economy boomed and the value of the dollar rose, making US exports more expensive.The Plaza Accord, named for the New York hotel where the deal was signed, allowed the dollar to decline by more than 50 percent against the yen and the deutsche mark by the end of 1987, making US exports more affordable."I think it's in the best interest of China and the US to reach a trade agreement — and I think they will," Haley said.

                Tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans demand governor resign
            </a>
            <p>
                SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Waving flags, chanting and banging pots and pans, tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans jammed a highway Monday to demand the resignation of Gov. Ricardo Rosselló in a crisis triggered by the leak of offensive, obscenity-laden chat messages between him and his advisers.The demonstration appeared to the biggest protest on the island in nearly two decades."Finally, the government's mask has fallen," said Jannice Rivera, a 43-year-old mechanical engineer who lives in Houston but was born and raised in Puerto Rico and flew in solely to join the protest.The protest came 10 days after the leak of 889 pages of online chats in which Rosselló and some of his close aides insulted women and mocked constituents, including victims of Hurricane Maria.The leak has intensified long-smoldering anger in the US territory over persistent corruption and mismanagement by the island's two main political parties, a severe debt crisis, a sickly economy and a slow recovery from Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in September 2017."The people have awakened after so much outrage," said 69-year-old retired nurse Benedicta Villegas. "There are still people without roofs and highways without lights. The chat was the tip of the iceberg."The crowd surged along the American Expressway despite the punishing heat — toddlers, teenagers, professionals and the elderly, all dripping in sweat and smiling as they waved Puerto Rico flags large and small and hoisted signs.One group dragged a portable karaoke machine and chanted, "Ricky, resign!""This is to show that the people respect themselves," said Ana Carrasquillo, 26. "We've put up with corruption for so many years."Rosselló, a Democrat, announced Sunday evening that he would not quit, but sought to calm the unrest by promising not to seek re-election in 2020 or continue as head of his pro-statehood political party. That only further angered his critics, who have mounted street demonstrations for more than a week."The people are not going to go away," said Johanna Soto, of the city of Carolina. "That's what he's hoping for, but we outnumber him."The territory's largest newspaper, El Nuevo Dia, added to the pressure with the front-page headline: "Governor, it's time to listen to the people: You have to resign."Rosselló's secretary of public affairs, Anthony Maceira, said Monday morning he didn't knew Rosselló's whereabouts. Asked who was advising Rosselló on staying in office, Maceira said the governor was speaking with his family, and "that carries a great weight." Rosselló's father, Pedro, was governor from 1993 to 2001.Asked whether the governor should step down, President Donald Trump said that Rosselló is a "terrible" governor and that hurricane relief money sent to Puerto Rico has been "squandered, wasted and stolen" and the island's top leadership is "totally, grossly incompetent."Organizers labeled the planned road shutdown "660,510 + 1" — which represents the number of people who voted for Rosselló plus one more — to reject his argument that he is not resigning because he was chosen by the people.In a video posted Sunday night on Facebook, Rosselló said he welcomed people's freedom to express themselves. He also said he is looking forward to defending himself as Puerto Rico's legislature begins exploring impeachment."I hear you," he said. "I have made mistakes and I have apologized."The demonstrations in this territory of more than 3 million American citizens represent the biggest protest movement on the island since Puerto Ricans rallied to put an end to US Navy training on the island of Vieques more than 15 years ago.Monday was the 10th consecutive day of protests, and more are being called for later in the week. The island's largest mall, Plaza de las Américas, closed ahead of the protest, as did dozens of other businesses. The upheaval also prompted at least four cruise ships to cancel visits to Puerto Rico, and many officials worry about the effect a resignation would have on the already fragile economy.Puerto Rico is struggling to restructure part of its $70 billion in debt under federal supervision and deal with a 13-year recession through school closings, cutbacks in infrastructure maintenance and other austerity measures.At the same time, the island is trying to rebuild from Maria, which caused more than $100 billion in damage, threw Puerto Rico into a year-long blackout and left thousands dead, most of them succumbing during the sweltering aftermath.Also, the island has seen a recent string of arrests of Puerto Rico officials on corruption charges. Those arrested included the former education secretary.AP

                Death toll in West Texas shooting rampage rises to 7
            </a>
            <p>
                MIDLAND, Texas — The death toll in a West Texas shooting rampage increased to seven Sunday as authorities investigated why a man stopped by state troopers for failing to signal a left turn opened fire on them and fled, shooting more than 20 people as he drove before being killed by officers outside a movie theater.Odessa police spokesman Steve LeSueur said that at least one of the shooting victims remained in life-threatening condition. The gunman has been identified as a white male in his 30s, but police have not released a name or possible motive.A news conference was scheduled for later Sunday in Odessa.The shooting began Saturday afternoon with an interstate traffic stop where gunfire was exchanged with police, setting off a chaotic rampage during which the suspect hijacked a mail carrier truck and fired at random as he drove in the area of Odessa and Midland, two cities in the heart of Texas oil country more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) west of Dallas.Police initially reported possible multiple shooters, but Odessa police Chief Michael Gerke later said there was only one male suspect.The suspect shot "at innocent civilians all over Odessa," according to a statement from Odessa police, which did not name the man or offer motive.The terrifying chain of events began when Texas state troopers tried pulling over a gold car mid-Saturday afternoon on Interstate 20 for failing to signal a left turn, Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger said. Before the vehicle came to a complete stop, the driver "pointed a rifle toward the rear window of his car and fired several shots" toward the patrol car stopping him. The gunshots struck one of two troopers inside the patrol car, Cesinger said, after which the gunman fled and continued shooting. Two other police officers were shot before the suspect was killed. The condition of the three law enforcement officers injured was not immediately released.Gerke said there were at least 21 civilian shooting victims.Shauna Saxton was one of the terrified drivers who said she encountered the gunman during his rampage, during which multiple witnesses described gunfire near shopping plazas and in busy intersections. Saxton was driving with her husband and grandson in Odessa and had paused at a stoplight when they heard loud pops."I looked over my shoulder to the left and the gold car pulled up and the man was there and he had a very large gun and it was pointing at me," she told TV station KOSA.Saxton said she was trapped because there were two cars in front of her. "I started honking my horn. I started swerving and we got a little ahead of him and then for whatever reason the cars in front of me kind of parted," she said sobbing. She said she heard three more shots as she sped away.Gerke did not go into detail about the chase, but the movie theater where the suspect was killed is more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) from where state troopers originally pulled over the gunman.The shooting comes just four weeks after a gunman in the Texas border city of El Paso killed 22 people after opening fire at a Walmart. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott this week held two meetings with lawmakers about how to prevent more mass shootings in Texas. He said he would visit the area Sunday.The shooting Saturday brings the number of mass killings in the US so far this year to 25, matching the number in all of 2018, according to The AP/USATODAY/Northeastern University mass murder database. The number of victims for this year has already reached 142, surpassing all last year.Seven people had remained in critical condition at one hospital hours after the West Texas shooting, said Russell Tippin, CEO of Medical Center Hospital in Odessa. He said a child under 2 years old was transported to another hospital.Dustin Fawcett said he was sitting in his truck at a Starbucks in Odessa when he heard at least six gunshots ring out less than 50 yards (46 meters) behind him.He spotted a white sedan with a passenger window that had been shattered. That's when he thought, "Oh man, this is a shooting."Fawcett, 28, an Odessa transportation consultant, "got out to make sure everyone was safe" but found that no one had been struck by the gunfire nearby. He said a little girl was bleeding, but she hadn't been shot, and that he later found out she was grazed in the face.Vice President Mike Pence said following the shooting that President Donald Trump and his administration "remain absolutely determined" to work with leaders in both parties in Congress to take such steps "so we can address and confront this scourge of mass atrocities in our country."Pence said Trump had spoken to the attorney general and that the FBI was assisting local law enforcement.Trump has offered contradictory messages in reacting to recent mass shootings. Days after the El Paso shooting he said he was eager to implement "very meaningful background checks" on guns and told reporters there was "tremendous support" for action. He later backed away, saying the current system of background checks was "very, very strong."Most recently, Trump has called for greater attention to mental health, saying that new facilities are needed for the mentally ill as a way to reduce mass shootings. However, some mental health professionals say such thinking is outdated, that linking mental illness to violence is wrong, and that the impact of more treatment would be helpful overall but would have a minor impact on gun violence.AP

                5 dead, 21 hurt in Texas shooting
            </a>
            <p>
                Attacker opened fire at random before he was shot dead by police WASHINGTON - A gunman hijacked a US postal truck and opened fire at random in the US state of Texas on Saturday, shooting dead at least five people and wounding many others before dying in a shootout with officers. Police identified the suspect as a white man in his mid-30s, but could not yet name him or say why he carried out the attack in the West Texas cities of Midland and Odessa. Coming less than a month after a gunman killed 22 people in the Texas city of El Paso, the latest bloodshed immediately ignited fresh calls for gun control to stem the US scourge of mass shootings.  Authorities control traffic on the street after the shooting in Odessa, Texas, on Saturday. Mark Rogers / AP"We have at least 21 victims, 21 shooting victims and at least five deceased at this point in time," said Odessa city Police Chief Michael Gerke. Three police officers were injured, he said. The Odessa Police Department had earlier reported that a suspect was "driving around Odessa shooting at random people" and "just hijacked a US mail carrier truck". Troopers had initially tried to pull over a passenger vehicle on the Interstate 20 highway but before it stopped, "the male driver (and only occupant in the vehicle) pointed a rifle toward the rear window of his car and fired several shots toward the DPS patrol unit," the Texas Department of Public Safety said in a statement. One trooper was wounded, the suspect fled the scene, "and continued shooting innocent people", the department statement said. Some of the shots were fired on the highway linking the cities of Odessa and Midland, where cars were left with bullet holes. "I just found out a friend of mine passed away," David Turner, the mayor of Odessa, told Fox News. "This coward pulls up beside" and opens fire on the car where the man and his family were waiting at a stop light, Turner said. During his rampage, the suspect had switched vehicles by hijacking the postal van, and Gerke said he "would assume" the postal worker was among the victims. Police said the suspect died during an exchange of fire with law enforcement at a movie theater in Odessa. Shauna Saxton was one of the terrified drivers who said she encountered the gunman during his rampage, during which multiple witnesses described gunfire near shopping plazas and in busy intersections. Saxton was driving with her husband and grandson in Odessa and had paused at a stoplight when they heard loud pops. "I looked over my shoulder to the left and the gold car pulled up and the man was there and he had a very large gun and it was pointing at me," she told TV station KOSA. Saxton said she was trapped because there were two cars in front of her. "I started honking my horn. I started swerving and we got a little ahead of him and then for whatever reason the cars in front of me kind of parted," she said sobbing. She said she heard three more shots as she sped away. US President Donald Trump tweeted that he had been briefed by Attorney General Bill Barr. A day earlier, at least 10 people were injured in a shooting at a high school football game at Ladd-Peebles Stadium in Mobile, Alabama. A 17-year-old suspect was arrested on Saturday. Mobile Police Chief Lawrence Battiste said the shooting stemmed from a fight, and the suspect pulled a gun and started "indiscriminately shooting". "This is a cowardly act by an individual who didn't know how to deal with a situation," Battiste said. The latest incidents came after the early August mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart store, where many victims were Hispanic. In that case, officers arrested Patrick Crusius, 21, a white Texan, who told police that he was targeting "Mexicans", according to an arrest warrant published by US media. The tragedy in El Paso was committed on the basis of "racist" anti-Mexican rhetoric, Jesus Seade, Mexico's foreign ministry undersecretary for North America, said during a memorial after that shooting. Critics of Trump have accused him of stoking such hatred. The shooting in El Paso came hours before a gunman in Dayton, Ohio killed nine people, again reigniting calls for gun control in the country where firearms were linked to nearly 40,000 deaths in 2017. "We need to end this epidemic," former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke reacted on Twitter after the latest killings. O'Rourke, a Democratic presidential hopeful, expressed sympathy with "everyone in West Texas who has to endure this again". Another Democratic contender, former San Antonio mayor Julian Castro, appealed on Twitter to the Republican-controlled Senate "who refuse to move on gun reform." "What is the number? How many Americans are you willing to sacrifice to the NRA?" NRA is the National Rife Association. After a series of mass shootings since late July Trump had expressed provisional support for implementing universal background checks. The president's position is crucial, because congressional Republicans, who count on gun rights supporters for votes, cannot move on tougher firearms legislation without his support.
