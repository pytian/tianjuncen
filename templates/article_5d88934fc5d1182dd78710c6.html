                Karma targets luxury market
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Karma Automotive, an electric luxury car maker owned by China's Wanxiang Group, announced Tuesday the launch of a new Moreno Valley-based customization and innovation center, during a ceremony attended by employees, government officials and business partners.The center, rebranded "the Karma Innovation and Customization Center (KICC)", will house the production of its new 2020 Revero luxury electric vehicles, company leaders said.Victoria Baca, mayor pro tem of Moreno Valley, described the city and Karma Automotive as "ideal partners"."It's also a significant step toward fulfilling the vision for both entities. The vision for the City of Moreno Valley to be the regional leader in economic growth and to expand the employment opportunities for those who live in our beautiful city and the vision for Karma Automotive to be the industry leader in luxury, customization and craftsmanship," she said.According to Baca, the KICC, which is just 60 miles from Karma's global headquarters in Irvine, California, has created over 200 new jobs for Moreno Valley.Karma's factory in Moreno Valley first opened in 2015. The sprawling 556,000-square-foot facility is made up of a body shop, general assembly, paint shop and final process alignment and test stations.It represents an investment of more than $100 million, the company said.KICC currently produces the company's 2019 Revero and is transitioning to its next generation 2020 Revero, which is scheduled for dealer showrooms during the second half of this year.During a roundtable discussion on Tuesday, Zhou said the luxury car market has traditionally been led by European manufacturers, but in the last decade, it has gradually been taken over by American car companies, especially those in California, which he called "a land where everything is possible.""The new generations of customers are totally different," he said. "In the past, the customers who buy luxury cars are usually over 50 years old, but now people over 30 can buy them."Zhou said the company is currently focused on selling cars in the US market. It will then expand its sale to the European and Chinese markets.He described California as "the most competitive and demanding luxury market in the world"."It's been nearly 30 years since any auto maker has built vehicles in Southern California. While others have left our state, Karma made a conscious decision to stay and do business in California," Zhou said."We believe if we can win here, we can win anywhere," he added.The sale price for Karma 2019 is around $140,000, the company said.

                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Over 40 years ago when Professor Leonard Blusséof Leiden University was a young student he was introduced to a Chinese book chronicling the lives of the Chinese people in Batavia (today's Jakarta) in the 17th and 18th centuries. He found it fascinating and made it his goal to translate it into English. But due to the complexity of the language and the dialects involved, he had to shelve the project.Then 10 years ago, he met Professor Nie Dening from Xiamen University in Fujian province, and they decided to do the work together. Their book, The Chinese Annals of Batavia, the Kai Ba Lidai Shiji and Other Stories, was recently published by Brill, a long-standing Dutch publishing house. It edits, annotates and translates the original book entitled Kai Ba Lidai Shiji.Professor George Bryan Souza of the University of Texas at San Antonio, a historian on global maritime economic history, is full of praise for the book, saying "Blussé and Nie have produced an exemplary volume."He says aside from its scholarly importance, it will appeal to anyone interested in Southeast Asian history, Chinese history, and intercultural history.It is a timely reminder of the maritime trading routes that were the precursor of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road that countries are building today.Zhuang Guotu, former dean of the Research School for Southeast Asia Studies at Xiamen University, says that Kai Ba Lidai Shiji is an important work for reconstructing Southeast Asian history. "That the two professors spent 10 years to compile the English annotated version is a reflection of their academic quality and dedication, and blazes a new path for Sinology research in the world."

                    Chinese auto companies set sights on US, beyond
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Four Chinese auto-industry companies that have established a presence in the US and Europe are aiming to become household names globally.The companies are Shanghai-based NIO and other electric vehicles; Karma Automotive, an electric-vehicle maker based in Irvine, California, owned by Wanxiang Group in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province; Yanfeng Automotive Interiors, which makes parts for car interiors; and Sanhua Automotive, an auto-parts manufacturer.Executives of the companies discussed the US market and their plans for future growth and expansion. They spoke at a session on Friday called the "China Genius Series"' at the Automotive News World Congress, held in conjunction with the 2019 North American International Auto Show (Jan 14-27)."It's a global world. You cannot stop it mobility-wise,'' Jack Cheng, the CEO of XPT and co-founder of NIO, told China Daily. "There are so many good companies coming from China because China has the youngest generation and the most diversity. We welcome everyone.''Cheng said his company's cars have "very European styling, a smart US mind, and a Chinese body and soul".The 4-year-old NIO, which is being dubbed the "Chinese Tesla'', went public in New York last year. Nio's models include the EP9, which the company claims is one of the world's fastest electric cars. Its 1,360-horsepower engine propels it to 160 mph in 7.1 seconds. It will go on sale in China next year, and then around the world.The ES8 — an upscale electric-battery three-row SUV positioned as a domestic Chinese alternative to Tesla's Model X — went into production in late June 2018. NIO will introduce a second mass-market model in June, the five-passenger SUV ES6. It's smaller than the ES8, with longer range and a lower price.NIO also makes charging devices for cars and a smart device for inside a car called Nomi, which can take selfies and even close the roof if it starts to rain.Boutique automaker Karma Automotive makes the Revero, a luxury sedan with a plug-in hybrid powertrain designed to allow it to operate solely on electric power most of the time."Karma will deliver luxury electric-vehicle strategies over the next five to 10 years. We will not be a mass production company. We will provide incubation technology in Southern California,'' said Lance Zhou, CEO of Karma.Zhou said that he intends to keep the cars luxurious and bespoke and focus on selling them in the US and then European and Chinese markets."In my mind, we are a global company located in Southern California," he said.During the auto show, Zhou announced a partnership with Pininfarina, the Italian design firm that has shaped some of history's best-looking cars. He said the partnership will speed up his company's product development and customization options.Zhou said Karma also has chosen to sell through dealers and not online. Karma has at least 15 franchise dealerships throughout America and Canada. He said one-to-one service helps the company better serve its customers, whom he described as "VVIP" — very, very important people.Tiger Lou, president of Sanhua Automotive, said that his company focuses on "smart thermal management'', products that help regulate the temperature in vehicles.The parts maker said it has achieved more than 7 percent annual sales growth over 10 years. It works with major auto companies, including General Motors, Ford, Tesla, BMW and Audi, and opened its North American automotive technical center in Auburn Hills, Michigan, in June 2017. The company is based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, and has 2,000 employees worldwide.Shanghai-headquartered Yanfeng Automotive Interiors' products include instrument and door panels, floor consoles and smart technologies. Its North American technical center is in Holland, Michigan.Yanfeng will release a new product on Wednesday, the XIM20, an autonomous ride-share interior concept.Contact the writer at belindarobinson@chinadailyusa.com

                Riga, an official in a Tibetan village, was both sad and pleased after a tour of the newly opened Tibet Serfs Emancipation Memorial Hall on Thursday, which was opened to mark the 60th anniversary of the emancipation of the region's serfs.March 28 is Serf 's Emancipation Day, which coincides with the democratic reform movement in the Tibet autonomous region.Sixty years ago, about 1 million serfs were freed when the feudal serf system ended in the region, accounting for 95 percent of the region's population, according to data from the Tibet Academy of Social Sciences.Riga, 52, a village official of Driru county, said he was sorry to see the brutality inflicted on Tibetan serfs before democratic reforms in 1959. The serfs suffered too much under the dark system at that time, he said."The serfs were disadvantaged. They couldn't meet their basic needs in life, including economic benefits and basic human rights," said Riga, adding that his heart was broken upon learning the dark history via photos and descriptions in the hall.Despite his sadness, Riga said he was also pleased with the sea change that has taken place over the years, and he had much to share about his time working as a village official for more than three decades."Thanks to the central government's preferential policies, most of our villagers are no longer poor," he said.Riga said in old times, ordinary people did not have the right to a basic education. But he noted that currently all people are able to receive a normal education, and the government pays tuition and an allowance for up to 15 years."Thanks to the government providing equal opportunities for education, four people in my family received college educations, and they have stable government jobs," he said."I have much more to share about the benefits from the government. And to repay my debt I will work harder and do a better job for the rest of my life."

                    Tibet seeks balance of ecology, economy
                </p>

                Editor's Note: After 40 years of high-speed growth, China's economy has entered a high-quality development phase. China Daily is featuring a series of reports to show the new landscape across the country.Home to the world's deepest canyon, some of the highest lakes and Mount Qomolangma, the Tibet autonomous region is known as one of the purest landscapes on Earth.Maintaining that requires not only following Tibetan traditions, which see polluting the environment as a sin, but also practicing ecological civilization along with high-growth economic development, said Karma Tsegyal, an official from the region's northwestern Jangngon village."Protecting the clear rivers and lush mountains is protecting our own lives in the long run," he said.Today, the village has more than 400 residents working as patrol guards and cleaners every month. Together, they take turns to prevent the village from being polluted by garbage tossed by drivers on the national highway, which runs through the town, or by debris from construction sites.Their patrols cover local forests, animal farms, grasslands and rivers.Apart from environmental protection, Jangngon has also been encouraging residents to plant trees and potatoes to help boost their incomes and lift economic development in general.Depending on plantation yield, potato farmers earned extra income of 1,500 to 30,000 yuan ($223 to $4,475) each last year.Jangngon is a reflection of the region's overall policies and the harmony between ecological civilization and economic development. The Tibet region achieved GDP growth of 10 percent last year, the highest of all provincial-level regions in China. This year, it has set a growth target of around 10 percent.According to the region's Government Work Report, the added value of green products hit 5.3 billion yuan last year, up 14.3 percent year-on-year."In 2019, we will continue to strengthen the construction and management of natural reserves," said Qi Zhala, chairman of the regional government, during the annual congress in January."We prohibit mining in the reserves, while increasing our spending on ecological protection and ensuring that the investment growth rate is above 20 percent," he said.All levels of government are responsible for the environment, and the regional government has been encouraging rural residents to undertake the task, with 667,000 jobs related to the environment offered last year.The annual ecological subsidy paid to residents agreeing to conduct ecology patrols was raised to 3,500 yuan last year.The region invested more than 10 billion yuan in ecological construction projects last year, according to the latest figures. Meanwhile, greening of the land continues with 742,000 hectares planted with trees. Forest coverage in the region now exceeds 12 percent.

                I'm not a believer in karma, but I can see the attraction. It's a delicious thought that bad people will meet their comeuppance in the end. Some do, but it's nothing to do with imaginary forces. Sometimes, it comes down to bad luck.History has shown that karma cannot be relied upon to dish out justice. There is a long list of crooks, liars and warmongers who carry on regardless.It is absurd to sit back and wait for something to happen. Taking action is a surer path to achieve change.
