                Chinese police want to strengthen cooperation with their counterparts in Southeast Asian and African countries on cross-border telefraud after recently busting 11 Chinese syndicates located in Laos.The police escorted 191 suspects back from Laos to Henan province on two chartered airplanes on Friday. They were linked to more than 800 fraud cases in various provinces and regions across China that involved more than 60 million yuan ($8.9 million), according to the Ministry of Public Security.The crackdown was a joint action by Chinese and Lao police.The Chinese police will continue advancing pragmatic judicial cooperation with their foreign counterparts on some major telefraud cases, said Chen Shiqu, deputy director of the ministry's criminal investigation bureau.Since last year, Henan province has reported a string of telefraud cases in several cities. The suspects convinced the targets on social media that they can earn money by "click farming" - generating likes or high ratings for fake orders to help boost the sales on e-commerce platforms, the ministry said.The victims completed and paid for the orders and instead of earning money, their payments simply vanished. They ranged from 5,000 to 30,000 yuan.Local public security bureaus deployed by the ministry launched an investigation and found the criminal operation centers located in Laos. In December, Chinese police flew to Laos and, supported by the Chinese embassy there, continued the investigation together with local police.Officers raided the operations recently, busting 11 gangs, capturing 191 suspects and seizing a large number of bank cards, computers, mobile phones and scam scripts, the ministry said.The crackdown is part of the latest special campaign initiated by the ministry in December and is planned for one year nationwide.Telecommunication and internet crimes have been rising in recent years, and suspects have started to eye Southeast Asian or African countries to set up their fraud networks, Chen said."With the help of internet technology, foreign suspects usually directed the Chinese suspects to pretend to be customer service personnel or law enforcement officers to target people on the Chinese mainland," he said.By using fake identities to buy lots of phone cards, they call Chinese victims claiming that their personal privacy or credit card information had been leaked or stolen, he said. He said they are frequently involved in money laundering, drug trafficking and smuggling."They ask the victims to follow their orders and transfer their money to a designated 'safe bank account', offered by the suspects, to 'guarantee' the money is protected," he said.To curb cross-border crimes, Chen said, law enforcement officers in China and other countries will establish an effective working mechanism and meet regularly to exchange information and discuss major concerns.They will also enhance joint investigations to smash cross-border fraud rings and nab the main suspects, he added.

                Five telecom fraud suspects have been repatriated from Vietnam, the Ministry of Public Security announced on Wednesday. The suspects - one from the Chinese mainland and four from Taiwan - were arrested following allegations that they had been masquerading as law enforcement officials to extort money from people in East China's Zhejiang province through telephone scams. The five have been implicated in at least 27 fraud cases involving more than 1.33 million yuan ($191,300), the ministry said.

                With large numbers of older people using WeChat, experts warn that a growing risk of online payment fraud could follow, since seniors are more vulnerable and more easily influenced.A study released on July 25 by Tencent Research Institute and Shenzhen University said users age 55 and older spend an average of 1.37 hours per day on the popular social media app, each with an average of 104 WeChat friends.The figures are based on a survey of 956 families across 58 cities.Zhu Wei, deputy director of the Communication Law Research Center at China University of Political Science and Law, said the strong social bonds offered by WeChat have provided positive options for seniors.However, their growing use of online payments, such as WeChat Wallet and its main rival, Alipay, comes with a growing risk of fraud.Criminal gangs target older people, particularly retirees, and hope to gain their trust in order to defraud them, Zhu said."With online payment, it has now become much easier for seniors to pay someone directly after they have established trust," he added.Seniors have long been a key target of fraud in China and elsewhere. In April, police officers in Jilin province broke a telefraud case involving more than 500 million yuan ($73.2 million). The company, based in Changchun, had gained elderly people's trust and convinced them to buy drugs at twice the normal price.Police arrested 114 suspects and found the victims were mostly seniors with low incomes.A report in March by the Tencent Center for Internet and Society found that 67.3 percent of middle-aged and elderly people had experienced some form of internet fraud.However, more than half of seniors are reluctant to seek help after being deceived. The report showed only 0.6 percent of those sampled chose to call the police for help."It is also due to a lack of channels for seniors to seek help," said Zuo Xiaodong, vice-president of the China Information Security Research Institute. "Citizens don't know where and how to ask for help when bad things happen."Zuo suggested that a system for supervising online payments should be set up, and hotlines for help should be promoted.About 7.68 million seniors were active WeChat users in September 2016, according to the Tencent Research Institute's data. In September last year, the number had surged to 50 million.The study also said 50.3 percent of older users learned how to use WeChat from their children or grandchildren. It suggested that family members should do more to educate elderly people about new technology and cybersecurity to help them enjoy a better digital life.

                    94 telefraud suspects are brought back from Spain

                Ninety-four suspects from Taiwan believed to be involved with cross-border telecom fraud have been extradited to China from Spain as part of an intensified crackdown on wire fraud, the Ministry of Public Security announced on Friday.On Friday morning, Chinese police boarded a chartered airplane with the suspected swindlers and escorted them to Beijing, the ministry said.In 2016, police from China and Spain launched a joint coordinated action plan to fight cross-border telecom fraud.To date, 225 suspects have been extradited from Spain to face justice. Of those, 218 were from Taiwan, including the most recent 94."Judicial cooperation between China and Spain has achieved a great success. It is the first time that Chinese police have escorted a large number of swindlers back from Europe," a ministry statement said on Friday.In 2016, police discovered many fraud operations hidden in Spain, where swindlers pretended to be the judicial officers to target people on the Chinese mainland. Many wire fraud cases involving up to 10 million yuan ($1.45 million) were reported in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces, and in Beijing, the ministry said.It said the primary suspects were mainly from Taiwan and that the ringleaders often set up their network centers in Europe and directed the other gang members to commit crimes from remote locations.According to the ministry, the fraudsters cheated the victims by claiming their personal information had been leaked or that their credit cards or bank accounts had been stolen, or they threatened people with accusations of money laundering or drug trafficking.People who believed the tales thought their bank accounts were unsafe, so they transferred their money to a designated safe account offered by the suspects, the ministry said.In December 2016, police in both countries jointly arrested 237 suspects in Spain, destroyed 13 fraud centers and confiscated many criminal tools valued at 120 million yuan.In 2017, China requested that Spain extradite the swindlers. After a two-year-long judicial procedure in Spain, the Spanish court ordered that all the suspects be extradited to China. So far, 225 have returned.The police action seriously hit wire fraud criminal rings from Taiwan and has played a in deterring transnational telecom fraud, according to an official at the ministry who asked not to be named."We will strengthen intelligence sharing and joint investigative cooperation with other countries in Europe to combat such crimes and bring the suspects to justice," he said.
