                Foreign legislatures should not interfere in Hong Kong's internal affairs: HKSAR gov't
            </p>
            <p>
                HONG KONG -- The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government on Monday expressed regret over the re-introduction of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act at the US Congress and reiterated that foreign legislatures should not interfere in any form in the internal affairs of the HKSAR.Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the HKSAR has been exercising "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy in strict accordance with the HKSAR Basic Law, and the "one country, two systems" principle has been fully and successfully implemented, a spokesman of the HKSAR government said."Human rights and freedom in Hong Kong are fully protected by the Basic Law, the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and other legislation. The HKSAR government attaches great importance to them and is determined to safeguard them," the spokesman stressed.A demonstration held Sunday in Hong Kong's Central district over the re-introduction of the act at the U.S. Congress turned violent as some radical demonstrators blocked roads in the area, extensively vandalized the Central Mass Transit Railway (MTR) station and set fire outside the station.The radical protesters later continued the vandalistic acts and road blockage in places including Wan Chai, Causeway Bay, Mong Kok and Prince Edward.The Central MTR station and the Wan Chai MTR station were seriously damaged, and the stations in Central, Wan Chai, Prince Edward and Mong Kok had to be closed to protect the safety of passengers, MTR staff members and the facilities.In response to the demonstration, the spokesman said the HKSAR government condemns the illegal behavior of the radical protesters."Their vandalizing acts deprive the rights of other members of the public to use the MTR and must be stopped immediately."

                Aussie state gov't left red-faced after accidentally publishing name of secret intelligence agent
            </a>
            <p>
                SYDNEY -- Australia's Queensland state government has issued an apology after publishing the name of a secret intelligence agent by accident.It was first uncovered by the Guardian News outlet on Thursday evening. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the embarrassing blunder was an "administrative error" and has now been removed.Although the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) goes to extreme lengths to keep the identities of their agents a secret, on this occasion the name of the operative that was published as part of the state government's ministerial diaries, remained online for up to one month.Under the Australian law, it is illegal to reveal the identity of an ASIO employee and anyone who does so is liable to face up to 10 years in prison.Although it remains highly unlikely anyone will face prosecution due to the accidental nature of the breach, other members of the state Parliament are calling for an inquiry into the matter."A full investigation must be carried out into this farce," Deb Frecklington, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland for Nanango, said."It has compromised national security and compromised an intelligence officer who is serving our nation."

                German gov't records surplus of 45.3 bln euros in H1
            </a>
            <p>
                BERLIN -- The German government has recorded a surplus of 45.3 billion euros ($50.3 billion) in the first half of 2019 (H1), the German Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) announced on Tuesday.Measured as a percentage of Germany's gross domestic product (GDP), the surplus ratio amounted to 2.7 percent, according to Destatis."The good situation of public finances is mainly due to high employment," Thiess Petersen, senior advisor at the German Bertelsmann Foundation, told Xinhua.High employment would generate high revenues for public budgets, "especially for social security contributions" while expenditures to combat unemployment would be falling "at the same time", noted Petersen.With 17.7 billion euros, Germany's central government had achieved the highest surplus in the first half of 2019, followed by the governments of Germany's 16 federal states with 12.7 billion euros. Social security funds contributed 7.7 billion euros to the governmental surplus.Total revenues of the German government amounted to 791.8 billion euros in H1. The most important source of income for the German government were taxes, which amounted to 415.4 billion euros, marking a "moderate" increase of 2.8 percent, according to Destatis.Governmental expenses saw a "significant" increase of 4.3 percent to a total of 746.5 billion euros during the period, said Destatis, adding that government investment expenditures increased at an "above-average" rate.Interest payments of the German government declined by 10.8 percent in H1 due to the "continuing very low interest rates and the lower debt level", which had a "dampening effect on expenditures", it said.However, following the slight decline of Germany's GDP of 0.1 percent in the second quarter of 2019, the outlook for the second half of 2019 would be "worse", commented Petersen, adding that a recession could "no longer be ruled out".In a case of a recession, the German government would need financial resources for measures to "stabilize the economy" such as "higher public investments", stressed Petersen.

                British gov't to suspend parliament to stop MPs blocking no-deal: media
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON -- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government is expected to ask Queen Elizabeth II to prorogue or suspend the Parliament from mid-September to mid-October, the BBC reported Wednesday.The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg tweeted that a suspension will pave the way for Johnson's new administration to hold a Queen's Speech -- laying out the government's future plans -- on Oct 14.According to Kuenssberg, a senior Downing Street source has said that the Queen's speech process is "not about Brexit," and instead about "the NHS and violent crime ... the courts have no locus to interfere in a bog standard Queen's Speech process."The idea of shutting down Parliament has caused controversy, with critics saying it would stop MPs being able to play their democratic part in the Brexit process.Members of Parliament who oppose a no-deal Brexit have feared Johnson would attempt to stop them meeting, and won't take it lying down. Some have talked of simply continuing to meet in another building, and defying the government. Parliament has also passed measures aimed at forcing the government to let it meet.However, Sky News reported that Johnson said it is "completely untrue" when asked if he was denying opposition MPs the time to stop a no-deal Brexit."We are bringing forward a new legislative programme on crime, hospitals, making sure we have the education funding we need," he said.Johnson said there would be "ample time" for MPs to debate Brexit both before and after a "crucial" Brussels summit of EU leaders on Oct 17, Sky News said.Some political opponents viewed Johnson's action as an attempt to limit their chances of preventing a no-deal Brexit on Oct 31.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said MPs must come together to stop the plan next week, or "today will go down in history as a dark one indeed for UK democracy.""We do not have a 'new government.' This action is an utterly scandalous affront to our democracy. We cannot let this happen," deputy Labour leader Tom Watson said.British Parliament will return from summer recess next week and another recess was expected to take place later in September to cover the political conference season.Parliament is normally suspended -- or prorogued -- for a short period before a new session begins. It is done by the Queen, on the advice of the prime minister.

                Italy's Conte receives formal mandate to form new gov't
            </a>
            <p>
                ROME -- Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Thursday formally gave Giuseppe Conte a mandate to form a new government.Conte, who became prime minister on June 1, 2018, announced on Aug 20 that he planned to hand in his resignation to Mattarella, following leader of the far-right League party submitted a no-confidence motion against the prime minister.Mattarella's mandate to Conte means the former law professor is now all but assured to head his second consecutive government. This one will be supported by the populist Five-Star Movement, which was also part of the previous government, along with the center-left Democratic Party that had previously been in opposition.The nationalist, rightwing League, the Five-Star Movement's former coalition partner, is now on course to become the main opposition party.The League had been pushing for new elections to be held this year, something that might have made it possible for the League to form its own government without support from either of the other two parties.Speaking to reporters briefly after his meeting with Mattarella, Conte said his first order of business will be to make a list of ministers to submit to Mattarella for his approval. Once the ministers are approved, Conte said the government's first priority will be to start work on the country's 2020 budget.The new government will formally have a mandate to lead until 2023, when the next general election is scheduled to take place. But analysts said it is not yet clear how well the Five-Star Movement and the Democratic Party -- which have been opponents for years -- will work together.

                HKSAR gov't severely condemns illegal, violent acts of radical protesters
            </a>
            <p>
                  HONG KONG - The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government has severely condemned the illegal and violent acts of the radical protesters, which continued to escalate with no regard for the safety of the public.Noting the issuance of a notice of objection by the police, a spokesperson of the HKSAR government said in a statement issued late Saturday that unauthorized assembly and procession in various districts on Hong Kong Island and in Kowloon on Saturday extensively blocked thoroughfares and paralyzed traffic on Hong Kong Island, seriously affecting emergency services and people's daily living.The radical protesters confronted police in various areas, hurled numerous petrol bombs at the government buildings, the Legislative Council building and the Police Headquarters as well as in other places, and attacked police officers with corrosive liquid and bricks, said the statement.The radical protesters set fires in different places, vandalized public property, set up barricades, and damaged facilities at MTR stations such as platform screen doors, said the statement, adding that the fire at Hennessy Road was very fierce at one point, posing serious danger.The behaviors of the radical protesters gravely breached the public peace and posed a serious threat to the safety of police officers on duty and members of the public at the scene, it said.Stressing that the police will strictly follow up on all the illegal and violent acts, the statement said that the HKSAR government appealed once again to members of the public to say no to violence together, so that order can be restored in society as soon as possible.

                No peace talk would work with continued Taliban violence: Afghan gov't

            <p>
                KABUL - No peace talks in Afghanistan would yield desired result in the absence of government delegation, said a statement of presidential palace on Sunday."The obstacle for achieving peace in Afghanistan is the continued Taliban-led war and violence," said the statement."The real peace won't return to Afghanistan unless and until the Taliban halts Afghan killing, accepts ceasefire and initiate direct talks with Afghan government," the statement added.The statement came after the US President Donald Trump called off the peace talks with the Taliban outfit in the wake of a suicide car bomb claimed by the armed group on Thursday in Kabul, which left 12 people dead, including one American soldier, and 42 Afghan civilians injured.

            <p>
                BEIJING - China's local governments picked up their pace of issuing bonds in August after a fall a month ago, official data showed Wednesday.The value of local government bonds issued in August totaled 569.5 billion yuan ($80.52 billion), up from 555.9 billion yuan in July but down from 899.6 billion yuan in June, according to the Ministry of Finance (MOF).In the first eight months, local governments issued nearly 3.96 trillion yuan in bonds, including 2.35 trillion yuan worth of special-purpose local government bonds aimed at providing financial support for public-interest projects.To further spur the economy, China has eased the restrictions on infrastructure construction financing, allowing local governments to use part of special-purpose bonds as project capital to support major national infrastructure projects.Local authorities were also required to accelerate bond issuance and try to complete the annual bond quota by the end of September.MOF data also showed outstanding local government debt amounted to 21.41 trillion yuan by the end of August, below the official ceiling of 24.08 trillion yuan set for the year.
