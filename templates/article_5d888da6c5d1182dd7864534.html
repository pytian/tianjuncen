                Lagarde wins approval as head of ECB
            </p>
            <p>
                She'll take central bank post as European economy faces Brexit, other challenges The European Parliament approved Christine Lagarde on Tuesday as the next president of the European Central Bank, at a time when the European economy is challenged by Brexit and trade conflicts. Lagarde received 394 votes in favor and 206 against, with 49 abstentions, in a secret ballot vote on Tuesday after a debate during which members of the European Parliament from both the euro and non-euro states praised and challenged her nomination. Lagarde was not present for the debate or the vote. The 63-year-old French lawyer and politician will replace Mario Draghi, an Italian economist, on Nov 1 in the Frankfurt-based ECB, which sets interest rate benchmarks and supervises banks for the 19 EU member states that use the euro as a currency. Lagarde was nominated for the job by the European Council on July 2. She resigned her job as IMF managing director on July 16, a post she had held since 2011. When the resignation took effect on Sept 12, Lagarde praised the IMF on Twitter as an institution "with a brain, a wallet - and a heart". Before the Tuesday plenary vote in Strasbourg, France, Lagarde had appeared before the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in Brussels, where she was grilled on Sept 4 by the members of Parliament. In the committee vote, Lagarde received 37 votes in favor and 11 against, with four abstentions. In her remarks to the committee, Lagarde said the job requires both a commitment to the basic mandate to keep prices stable and the "agility" to come up with new ways to meet unforeseen trouble. She will assume the job just a day after the scheduled Brexit on Oct 31. If Britain leaves the EU without a deal, many expect a huge disruption in normal business between Britain and the 27 EU member states. In addition, the trade war between the United States and China, the EU's two largest trade partners, is having a heavy impact on EU industries. The US has also been given the green light by the World Trade Organization to impose billions of euros in punitive tariffs on EU products in retaliation for illegal subsidies granted to Airbus, Politico reported. Lagarde has also voiced support for such European Central Bank measures as bond purchases and negative interest rates, which have drawn criticism for reducing savers' returns. She said the measures had helped create 11 million jobs since 2013 and eased financial turmoil. Without such measures "the crisis would have been a lot worse", she said, adding that she agrees with the bank's view that the economy would need monetary support "for an extended period of time". Lagarde said she would aim to communicate clearly with the public to explain the bank's decisions. She said that while "financial market operators" were likely to understand the ECB's message on monetary issues, "I want the people of the euro area to understand why decisions are being made." ECB Governing Council member Yannis Stournaras indicated that Lagarde will probably keep up the controversial, ultra-loose policy in the stimulus package rolled out by Draghi last week, according to Bloomberg. "There are strong monetary, economic and financial arguments suggesting that (Lagarde) will more or less continue along the same lines," the Greek central bank governor said in Athens on Monday. In recent remarks, Lagarde also suggested the ECB should "move towards more green products" and pledged to "continue to look at that and how the ECB can be an actor in this". While the amount of carbon assets in the ECB's portfolio "can't change overnight", a "move to a gradual transition to eliminate this type of assets" is something that should be done, she said.

                Johnson voices optimism on Brexit talks, but doubts cast on EU side
            </a>
            <p>
                British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was hopeful that progress could be made in Brexit talks on Monday with the European Union, even as outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warned that time is running out. Johnson had said that he would make clear he would reject any offer to delay Brexit beyond Oct 31. It is the first meeting between the pair since Johnson took office in July. The two leaders were joined at lunch by the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier. Johnson was scheduled to be accompanied by his new Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and Downing Street's Brexit representative David Frost. Juncker, who will finish his term as commission president on Oct 31, was expected to ask Johnson to spell out his ideas for replacing the Irish backstop negotiated by his predecessor. The backstop is the controversial policy in the existing withdrawal agreement - already rejected three times by members of Parliament - which would require the United Kingdom to follow the EU's customs rules to ensure no physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and EU member Republic of Ireland. Johnson had said there were "real signs of movement" in Berlin, Paris and Dublin on getting rid of the backstop, the persistent stumbling block to a Brexit agreement. "A huge amount of progress is being made," he told The Daily Mail newspaper. But The Guardian newspaper quoted EU officials involved in talks with Johnson's envoy, Frost, as saying that this upbeat account was not an accurate assessment of the situation. "No, in fact people are a bit dismayed," said one EU source, describing the mood. "I am not even going to call them negotiations - the last session on Friday did start touching on content - that's actually quite a step forward, ... but we still should have been there a long time ago and (an end result) is still quite far away." Reports have suggested Johnson is considering a plan to keep Northern Ireland more closely aligned to the EU after Brexit, as an alternative to the current backstop. A Downing Street source told the BBC that Johnson would make clear to Juncker that "he would not countenance any more delays" beyond Oct 31. "The PM will stress to Juncker that, while he wants to secure a deal, if no deal can be agreed by Oct 18, his policy is to leave without a deal on Oct 31 - and reject any delay offered by the EU." The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the issue of whether the United Kingdom has the legal right to leave the EU on Oct 31, come what may, could end up in court. Meanwhile, at their annual conference on Sunday, Britain's Liberal Democrats overwhelmingly approved the party's plan of going into any election with the promise to revoke Brexit without a referendum. The Liberal Democrats still support a second Brexit referendum with an option to vote to remain. They have said that they would promise to revoke Article 50 - the process of leaving the EU - if they win an absolute majority in a general election. jonathan@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily Global 09/17/2019 page7)

                Making mascots come to life
            </a>
            <p>
                A behind-the-scenes look at how a panda and a red lantern won the hearts of 2022 Games organizersA cute panda "from the future" and a traditional red lantern signifying China's past were unveiled as the respective mascots for the Beijing Olympics and Paralympics on Tuesday, ratcheting up anticipation for the 2022 Winter Games.Just over a year since submissions were first invited for the project, panda Bing Dwen Dwen and red lantern Shuey Rhon Rhon were revealed as the winners at Beijing's Shougang Ice Hockey Arena.The 2022 organizing committee is confident the pair will resonate with the world."Today is an important step on Beijing's historic journey as the first city in Olympic history to host both summer and winter editions of the Games," said International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach."The mascot will be a wonderful ambassador for both China and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games."International Paralympic Committee (IPC) president Andrew Parsons said the mascot "is a message of the future to the future generation of Chinese people who will be inspired by the amazing faith of the Paralympic athletes".Added Gao Tian, vice-director of the culture and ceremonies department of the organizing committee: "The two mascots are a combination of inheritance and innovation, culture and technology, as well as the Olympic Games and daily life."Back to the futureBing Dwen Dwen is described as a panda wearing an icy shell that is stylized as a sports helmet. The outfit is similar to a spacesuit, so the panda can be imagined as a winter sports athlete from the future. The ice shell also allows for the addition of new elements.Many details of the design reference signature elements of the 2022 Games.A series of colored floating lines around its head resemble tracks on an ice rink, similar to Games venue the National Speed Skating Oval, aka the "Ice Ribbon". The rings are also a nod to the implementation of ultra-fast 5G technology and are meant to empower the panda.Bing means "ice" in Chinese, which is a symbol of purity and toughness, in line with the spirit of the Olympics. Dwen suggests health and ingenuity, with the repetition of the word giving it a more informal, friendly feel. Altogether, Bing Dwen Dwen is a representation of physical strength, mental toughness and the spirit of the Olympics.Paralympic mascot Shuey Rhon Rhon is equally intricate in its meaning. It resembles an iconic Chinese red lantern commonly seen on doors and streets during Chinese New Year, which in 2022 falls three days before the Olympic Games opening ceremony. Red lanterns symbolize happiness, harvest and affluence, while the crown-like ruyi is a symbol of sovereignty in Chinese culture.Shuey Rhon Rhon's head is adorned with paper cuttings of pigeons, a common motif in Chinese culture. Their arrangement forms the shape of the Temple of Heaven, one of Beijing's most famous landmarks. The blush on the mascot's cheeks adds a festive feel, with the color red associated with good luck.Billed as the first-ever luminous Olympic mascot, Shuey Rhon Rhon is intended to convey a message of lighting up people's dreams and symbolizes friendship, courage and persistence. It is also a representation of the unbending will and fighting spirit of the Paralympic athletes.Shuey means "snow" in Chinese, while Rhon Rhon are two different Chinese characters with the same pronunciation, meaning inclusiveness and integration respectively. The name symbolizes harmony and exchanges between different cultures, and building a community with a shared future."The mascots draw inspiration from China's rich culture, at the same time reflecting the Chinese philosophy of communicating with the world and reaching out to the future," explained review panel member Zhang Yiwu, a professor at the Department of Chinese Language and Literature of Peking University.Tough decisionThe 2022 organizing committee launched a global appeal for mascot design proposals on Aug 8 last year, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics.Elementary and high school students across China were encouraged to create their own mascots for the Winter Games. Nearly 15 million students from 45,000 schools were involved, with their designs used as barometers of what appeals to kids."When we visited schools in northern China, we could tell they were familiar with winter sports and had a great passion for them. When we visited southern cities, students came with curiosity and listened attentively. The contrast left a deep impression on me, but all of them were happily involved in the designs," recalled Piao Xuedong, the organizing committee's marketing director.When the two-month submission period closed on Oct 31, a total of 5,816 designs were spread over 100 desks in a room inside the Beijing 2022 headquarters at Shougang Industrial Park.Submissions were received from all over the world－35 countries and regions in total－while the designers ranged in age from 3 to 75. Among the more commonly used ideas were indigenous deers, pandas and tigers, and cultural symbols such as dragon dancing and the Great Wall.According to the organizing committee, the number of design proposals was nearly three times that of the 2008 Games."There was a lot of diversity, with everyone from little children to professionals submitting proposals. It's interesting to see the different directions people have taken," said panel member Alexis Georgacopoulos, director of the University of Art and Design in Lausanne, Switzerland, where the IOC is based.The 18-person review panel was comprised of experts from fields including graphic design, animation, children's literature and marketing, and after two days of evaluation whittled the submissions down to 100 possibles on Jan 7. The next day, the panel compiled a shortlist of 10 designs.The panel was guided by an online survey that sought to discover the public's preference for features such as color and personality of the mascots."A great number of the designs were quite creative, and that really amazed me," said panel member Lin Cunzhen, who designed the emblems for Beijing 2022.
