                New edition marks 40th anniversary of normalization of ties On the evening of July 15,1971, United States President Richard Nixon spoke to the nation from a television studio in Burbank, California. "I have requested this time tonight to announce a major development in our efforts to build a lasting peace in the world," he began, before reading an announcement that was also being made in Beijing. This stated that Premier Zhou Enlai and Henry Kissinger, Nixon's assistant for national security affairs, had held talks in Beijing from July 9 to 11, 1971.Knowing that Nixon wanted to visit China, Zhou, on behalf of the Chinese government, had invited him to come to the country at an "appropriate date "before May 1972. Nixon had accepted the invitation "with pleasure". Nixon said, "The meeting between the leaders of China and the United States is to seek the normalization of relations between the two countries and also to exchange views on questions of concern to the two sides." More than two years of complex, subtle and determined diplomatic efforts and negotiations preceded the announcement. Nixon wrote in his memoirs published in 1978, "Despite the almost miraculous secrecy we had been able to maintain, the China initiative was actually one of the most publicly prepared surprises in history." The latest Chinese edition of the book, RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon, was published in May to mark the 40th anniversary of the normalization of Sino-US ties. Different translated versions were also published in 1979 and 2001. The 1,166-page book, an intensely personal examination of his life and career, sheds light on the Nixon administration's behind-the-scenes decisions on dealing with a then-isolated China. In an article published by Foreign Affairs magazine in October 1967, Nixon stressed the importance of Asia to the US and the world, concluding with a section on US policy toward China. "For the short run, then, this means a policy of firm restraint, of no reward, of a creative counter-pressure designed to persuade Peking (Beijing) that its interests can be served only by accepting the basic rules of international civility. For the long run, it means pulling China back into the world community - but as a great and progressing nation, not as the epicenter of the world revolution," Nixon said. According to the book, shortly after taking office in 1969, Nixon urged Kissinger to explore the possibilities of rapprochement with the Chinese. The book tells how China and the US sent signals to each other. Nixon wrote, "The first serious public step in the China initiative had been taken in February 1970 when I sent the first Foreign Policy Report to Congress." The report called the Chinese "a great and vital people who should not remain isolated from the international community". "It is certainly in our interest, and in the interest of peace and stability in Asia and the world, that we take what steps we can toward improved practical relations with Peking," the report read. Nixon said Chinese leaders clearly understood the significance of the language in the report, because two days later, during a meeting in Warsaw, Poland, with US Ambassador Walter Stoessel, the Chinese charge d'affaires, Lei Yang, suggested moving their previously unproductive meetings to Beijing. He also hinted that China would welcome a high-ranking US official as head of the delegation. Messages and signals had been going back and forth between the two countries for more than two years. In an interview with Time magazine in October 1970, Nixon said: "If there is anything I want to do before I die, it is to go to China. If I don't, I want my children to." In March 1971, Washington ended all restrictions on the use of US passports for travel to the Chinese mainland. In April that year, Nixon terminated the 20-year embargo on trade between the two nations. He also ordered new steps to be taken to ease currency and shipping controls placed on China. At a news conference on April 29, 1971, Nixon said he expected to visit China sometime in some capacity. He added that he hoped to contribute to "a policy in which we can have a new relationship" with China. In August 1970, Chairman Mao Zedong invited the US writer Edgar Snow to Beijing, and on Oct 1, Mao placed Snow next to him on the reviewing stand at the parade celebrating the 21st anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. In December that year, in an interview with Snow, Mao said China was considering allowing US citizens of all political persuasions to visit the country. When Snow asked whether a rightist such as Nixon, who represented the "monopoly capitalists", would be allowed to visit, Mao said he would be happy to talk to Nixon, whether he came as president or as a tourist. Snow's interview appeared in Life magazine in April 1971. Nixon recalled in his book that it was now public knowledge that Mao would welcome him to Beijing. Intermediary sought China and the US moved closer to negotiations after largely not communicating with each other for 20 years. According to Nixon's memoirs, his administration attempted to find an intermediary who could "pass word directly to Beijing". When Nixon visited Pakistan in July 1969, he told President Yahya Khan that the US had decided to try to normalize relations with China, and asked for his help as an intermediary. The Pakistani leader said his country would do anything it could to help, but added, "Old enemies do not easily become new friends." When Khan visited the White House in October 1970, Nixon used their meeting to establish the so-called Yahya Channel. During a visit to Romania in 1969, Nixon also talked with President Nicolae Ceausescu about the need for a new Sino-US relationship. Nixon's toast at a dinner in Romania was the first occasion on which a US president had intentionally referred to China by its official name, the People's Republic of China, rather than Communist China. "This was a significant diplomatic signal," Nixon wrote. In his meeting with Ceausescu next day, Nixon said that, even short of the ultimate goal of re-establishing full diplomatic relations with China, there could be an exchange of high-level personal representatives. Ceausescu agreed to pass this on to Beijing, marking the opening of the so-called Romanian Channel. In December 1970, Zhou sent word through the Pakistani president that Nixon's representative would be welcome in Beijing to discuss the "Taiwan question". Nixon wrote that with characteristic subtlety, Zhou concluded with a play on words. "We have had messages from the United States from different sources in the past," Zhou said, "but this is the first time that the proposal has come from a Head, through a Head, to a Head." The US, through the Yahya Channel, replied that any meeting should not be limited to a discussion of Taiwan, and proposed that Chinese and US representatives meet in Pakistan to discuss the possibility of a high-level meeting in Beijing. Zhou sent a message for Nixon through the Romanian Channel, stating that there was only one outstanding issue between the two countries - the "US occupation of Taiwan". China had attempted to negotiate on this issue in good faith for 15 years, and if the US wished to resolve the situation and propose a solution, China would be prepared to receive a US special envoy in Beijing. On April 6, 1971, there was a surprise breakthrough for the Nixon administration. It heard from the US embassy in Tokyo that a US table tennis team competing in the world championships in Japan had been invited to visit China to play exhibition matches. "I was as surprised as I was pleased by this news," Nixon wrote. "I had never expected that the China initiative would come to fruition in the form of a ping-pong team." The US immediately accepted the invitation, and China granted visas to several Western reporters to cover the team's tour. Some reporters sent back "almost lyrical descriptions of the contented and productive lives" led by Beijing residents, Nixon wrote. Later in April, another message from Zhou was sent to the US through the Yahya Channel. Insisting that Taiwan was the "principal and prerequisite problem", which had to be resolved before any relationship could be restored, the message added that China was now interested in direct discussions as a means of resolving the issue. In May 1971, the US sent a message to China via Pakistan, stating that Nixon was prepared to accept Zhou's invitation to visit Beijing. "I proposed that Kissinger undertake a secret visit in advance of my trip in order to arrange an agenda and begin a preliminary exchange of views," Nixon said in his book. In May and June 1971, Washington received messages from Beijing via Pakistan. These said that Mao looked forward to having direct talks with Nixon, and that Zhou welcomed Kissinger to China as the US representative for a preliminary secret meeting with high-level Chinese officials to prepare and make necessary arrangements for the US president's visit. "This is the most important communication that has come to an American president since the end of World War II," Kissinger said. For Kissinger's 10-day mission to Asia, the US arranged for him to fly to Vietnam for consultations early in July 1971 and to stop in Pakistan on his way home. In Islamabad, he would develop stomachache that would keep him in bed, thus avoiding the press. Then, with Pakistan's cooperation, he would be flown to China by a Pakistani jet. The stomachache was scheduled for July 9 to 11. Need for secrecy Kissinger's Beijing trip was codenamed Polo after Marco Polo, the Venetian merchant and explorer who made history by traveling to China. Everything went without a hitch, Nixon said. Because of the need for complete secrecy, and the lack of direct communications between Beijing and Washington, he knew the US would have no word from Kissinger while he was in China. "Even after he had returned to Pakistan it would still be important to maintain secrecy, so before Kissinger left, we agreed on a single codeword - eureka - which he would use if his mission were successful and the presidential trip had been arranged," Nixon said in his memoirs. On July 11, 1971, Al Haig, an assistant to Kissinger, who knew the codeword, phoned Nixon to say that a cable that included it had arrived from Kissinger. Nixon then announced on TV that he would be going to Beijing. In October 1971, Kissinger returned to China for a publicly announced six-day visit to prepare an agenda for the meetings between Nixon and Chinese leaders and to work out the basic language for the communique that would be issued at the end of the president's trip. While Kissinger was in Beijing, the UN General Assembly voted 76 to 35 on Oct 25, 1971, with 17 abstentions, to expel Taiwan and to admit the PRC as the sole government representing China. On Feb 17, 1972, Nixon left Andrews Air Force Base for Beijing, where he shook hands with Zhou at the airport. "When our hands met, one era ended and another began," Nixon said. He quoted Zhou as saying, "Your handshake came over the vastest ocean in the world - 25 years of no communication." In his toast at a banquet in the Great Hall of the People, Nixon said: "We have at times in the past been enemies. We have great differences today. What brings us together is that we have common interests which transcend those differences. "As we discuss our differences, neither of us will compromise our principles. But while we cannot close the gulf between us, we can try to bridge it so that we may be able to talk across it." The two countries issued a joint statement from Shanghai at the end of Nixon's trip. The statement, which became known as the Shanghai Communique, broke diplomatic ground by stating frankly the significant differences between the two countries on major issues, rather than smoothing them over. In a banquet toast on his last night in China, Nixon described his visit as "the week that changed the world". He visited China again in February 1976 at the invitation of the government. Even though he had resigned as president, he was afforded the same treatment as four years earlier. For example, a 10-course banquet was held in his honor. The latest Chinese version of Nixon's memoirs is published by the Tiandi Press in Chengdu, Sichuan province. Yang Yonglong, project editor for the publishing house, said: "Nixon was one of the most controversial American presidents ... the book is basically the history of the US in the third quarter of the 20th century. He had a razor-sharp intellect and the quality so lacking in politicians these days - courage." In an interview with NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw in Washington in 2012, Kissinger described Zhou as "an extraordinary fellow with wonderful human instinct" adding, "he was elegant, thoughtful, well-prepared and infinitely patient". In November 2014, at a Washington forum on Nixon's legacy, Richard Solomon, a National Security Council staffer for Asian Affairs from 1971 to 76, said: "Today, the Soviet Union is history; China is now approaching certainly No 2, if not No 1, in the world economy. It has emerged, risen as an international force, in no small measure because of the opening that President Nixon and Chairman Mao initiated." In January, former diplomat Lian Zhengbao wrote in the monthly literature and history magazine Across Time and Space that during his first Beijing visit, Nixon vowed that if re-elected he would finalize the normalization of US-China relations in his second term. Nixon was re-elected in 1972, and sent Kissinger to China in February the following year for discussions on establishing liaison offices in Beijing and Washington. The US appointed David Bruce, who served as ambassador to France, West Germany and the United Kingdom, as the first head of its liaison office in Beijing. China named Huang Zhen, who took part in the Long March (1934-35) and served as ambassador to France, as the first head of its liaison office in Washington. After issuing a joint declaration in December 1978, China and the US normalized diplomatic relations in January 1979. In a banquet toast on his 1972 visit, Nixon quoted one of Mao's best-known poems: So many deeds cry out to be done, and always urgently. The world rolls on. Time passes. Ten thousand years are too long. Seize the day, seize the hour. "This is the hour, this is the day for our two peoples to rise to the heights of greatness, which can build a new and a better world," Nixon said. caihong@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 08/12/2019 page1)

                Memoirs shed light on Nixon's Beijing visit
            </a>
            <p>
                New edition marks 40th anniversary of normalization of tiesAt 7:30 pm on July 15, 1971, United States President Richard Nixon spoke to the nation from a television studio in Burbank, California."I have requested this time tonight to announce a major development in our efforts to build a lasting peace in the world," he began, before reading an announcement that was also being made in Beijing.It said that Premier Zhou Enlai and Henry Kissinger, Nixon's assistant for national security affairs, had met for talks in Beijing from July 9 to 11. Knowing that Nixon wanted to visit China, Zhou, on behalf of the Chinese government, had invited him to come to the country at an "appropriate date" before May 1972. Nixon had accepted the invitation "with pleasure".Nixon said, "The meeting between the leaders of China and the United States is to seek the normalization of relations between the two countries and also to exchange views on questions of concern to the two sides."More than two years of complex, subtle and determined diplomatic efforts and negotiations preceded the announcement.Nixon wrote in his memoirs, published in 1978: "Despite the almost miraculous secrecy we had been able to maintain, the China initiative was actually one of the most publicly prepared surprises in history."The latest Chinese edition of the book, RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon, was published in May this year to mark the 40th anniversary of the normalization of China-US ties. Different translated versions were also published in 1979 and 2001.The 1,166-page book, an intensely personal examination of his life and career, sheds light on the Nixon administration's behind-the-scenes decisions for dealing with a then-isolated China.In an article published by Foreign Affairs magazine in October 1967, Nixon stressed the importance of Asia to the US and the world, concluding with a section on US policy toward China."For the short run, then, this means a policy of firm restraint, of no reward, of a creative counter-pressure designed to persuade Peking (Beijing) that its interests can be served only by accepting the basic rules of international civility. For the long run, it means pulling China back into the world community-but as a great and progressing nation, not as the epicenter of world revolution," Nixon said.According to the book, shortly after taking office in 1969, Nixon urged Kissinger to explore the possibilities of rapprochement with the Chinese.The book tells how China and the US sent signals to each other.Nixon wrote, "The first serious public step in the China initiative had been taken in February 1970 when I sent the first Foreign Policy Report to Congress."The report called the Chinese "a great and vital people who should not remain isolated from the international community"."It is certainly in our interest, and in the interest of peace and stability in Asia and the world, that we take what steps we can toward improved practical relations with Peking," the report read.Nixon said Chinese leaders clearly understood the significance of the language in the report, because two days later, during a meeting in Warsaw, Poland, with US Ambassador Walter Stoessel, the Chinese charge d'affaires, Lei Yang, suggested moving their previously unproductive meetings to Beijing. He also hinted that China would welcome a high-ranking US official as head of the delegation.

                Ping-pong once again facilitates relations
            </a>
            <p>
                The click-clack sound of ping-pong balls against paddles filtered through the friendly cheers at the John Wooden Center at the University of California in Los Angeles.Fifty-eight members of the Chinese Table Tennis National Team, including star players and coaches such as Ma Long, Ding Ning, Xu Xin, Liu Shiwen, Fan Zhendong, Ma Lin and Chen Qi, are in Los Angeles for a 20-day visit, training with players from Team USA.Athletes skimmed ping-pong balls across nets and moved nimbly from side to side Saturday during a daily training session."I think table tennis is kind of what we call our Chinese national sport, and the Chinese table tennis team is a team with a lot of honors. It's a glorious team," Zhang Ping, Chinese consul general in Los Angeles, told an audience of table tennis players, officials from the USA Table Tennis Association, UCLA representatives, Chinese students and ping-pong enthusiasts.Table tennis is closely associated with China-US relations. It's because of the "ping-pong diplomacy" of the 1970s that people from the two countries were able to reconnect, which served as a backdrop to the establishment of US-China diplomatic relations, Zhang said."I think your visit this time is very important to promoting the friendship between the Chinese and American people. Also, here you are not only helping to change the American players, but also get a chance to get into the American society, and let people know that you are the friends of American people," the consul general told the Chinese national team.The team's visit mirrors one by Chinese team in 1972.Liu Guoliang, the president of the Chinese Table Tennis Association, said the Chinese team's visit was made possible after USA Table Tennis and the US Olympic Committee invited the team for a joint training camp with the US squad during the 2019 World Table Tennis Championships in Budapest, Hungary."It's already the 48th anniversary of ping-pong diplomacy, and it's a strong foundation jointly developed by several generations of Chinese and American table tennis people, so I think our friendship and the spirit of ping-pong diplomacy will continue," he said.He said that around 30 Chinese table tennis players — 18 male players and 12 female players — and about 10 American players participated in the joint training camp.The training not only improves the skills of the two national teams, but also helps promote the sport in the US and around the world, Liu said."I believe that ping-pong is not only the national sport of China, it should be the sport of the world. Since China is a major force in table tennis, it should have the responsibility to further promote it to the world," he said.Gao Jun, a Chinese-American table tennis player who competed for the Chinese National Team and is now a coach for the US National Team, said that there is actually a large ping-pong-playing population in the US."But a lot of people see it as a form of exercise; only a few see it as a profession. Another reason is that you need opponents to practice ping-pong. However, in the US, people live far away from each other, and everyone has a different schedule, so it's pretty difficult to get together and play," she said.At one table, an athlete from Team USA enjoyed a friendly game with a Chinese player. Not far from them, an American athlete pivoted around the table to return a ball sent over the net by a Chinese coach."This is a rare learning opportunity for the US Table Tennis Team. We not only see the skill, but we also see the spirit of the Chinese team," USA Table Tennis CEO Virginia Sung told China Daily."We hope the joint training camp will become an annual event, whether it's the US team visiting China, or the other way around. It will enhance the relationship and interaction between our two ping-pong associations," she added.Ma Long, a famous Chinese ping-pong player and reigning Olympic champion, spoke to China Daily."I think the American campus culture is very interesting. I feel that athletes hardly get to experience campus, so I've enjoyed it very much," said Ma, who was making his first visit to the United States."Ping-pong facilitated the diplomatic relations between China and the US 40 years ago," he said. "I am very honored to represent the Chinese table tennis team to participate in this friendship event. I hope that China and the US will both become better in table tennis.""Any political factor between countries should not affect sports exchange. Sports could only make people-to-people exchange even smoother," Gao said.

                Players relive moments of 'ping-pong diplomacy'
            </a>
            <p>
                Current Chinese and US national teams convene to commemorate friendshipConnie Sweeris was one of nine table tennis players who traveled to China at the end of the 31st World Championships 48 years ago, a trip that gave birth to the "ping-pong diplomacy" and paved the way for the re-establishment of United States-China relations.On Thursday night, she joined two other long-ago teammates, Judy Hoarfrost and George Braithwaite, in reliving the 1971 experience by playing friendship matches against some of the current top players from the Chinese National Table Tennis Team.Current Chinese and US national table tennis players convened at the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, California, to celebrate the anniversary of the ping-pong diplomacy.At the event, the three original members of the 1971 USA team and some of China's most established players had a friendship exhibition game."This was a real neat experience for us to come to the Nixon Library here and be able to play against the Chinese national team. I got a chance to play against Ding Ning, and we had some really good points. They are No 1 in the world. So, it just seems really fun for the US players, especially from way back in the 1970s, to meet one of the top players and be able to play a top player now," Sweeris said."This means a lot, because of the exchanges that happened in 1971 precipitated our friendship that has been developing down through the years now," she added.Judy Hoarfrost, who was only 15 years old when she toured across China in 1971, enjoyed a friendship match with reigning world champion Liu Shiwen."It is very exciting to have the Chinese table tennis team here. It's very generous of them to have the best players in the world to come here and train with the American athletes. So we feel very honored that they are here," she said."It was a really amazing thing that table tennis, my sport, played a role in bringing the people of USA and the people of China together to eventually have diplomatic relationship with China," she added.The banquet was put together by the Chinese Consulate General in Los Angeles, Nixon Foundation, USA Table Tennis, as well as the Chinese Table Tennis Association, to welcome the Chinese National Table Tennis Team. The team is in Los Angeles from Aug 5-25 for a training camp with Team USA."It is true that ping-pong diplomacy occurred in a bit of an unexpected way. Nobody would've expected that a small ping-pong ball could have such a magical power to open the door that has been long shut between our two countries. Yet it came as a natural outcome of the efforts as well as the desire of our two people for friendship and good relationship," said Zhang Ping, Chinese consul general in Los Angeles.Although the ping-pong diplomacy took place more than 40 years ago, its legacy remained important for the China-US relationship today, the diplomat noted."At present, the China-US relationship is standing at a critical juncture. In the current situation, it's more important that we carry forward the legacy of the ping-pong diplomacy, bringing into full play the role of'a small ball rotating a big globe'. We need to strengthen people-to-people connections, further deepen our friendship and make concerted efforts to maintain a stable and sound development of China-US relations," Zhang said.

                New vision would advance China-US ties, benefit world
            </a>
            <p>
                Leading voices at event in New York discuss ways for two countries to resolve differencesWith rapid changes in the world, the old era of Sino-US relations is over, and there's no going back. The two countries should therefore work to create a better future and a new vision for the world.That is a point Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai made at the Vision China event, hosted by China Daily and Bank of China, on Tuesday in New York City. At the event, leading voices on China-US relations discussed how the two countries should resolve their differences and advance their ties.The event, "China-US Relations: 40 Years & Beyond", took place shortly before Beijing and Washington are to hold another round of high-level talks in Washington in early October to address their outstanding trade disputes. Twelve such meetings since February 2018 failed to produce a deal.In his keynote speech, Cui said: "We have learned from the past four decades that cooperation is the only right option for us. It is something we should always uphold."The envoy said that some in the US blame a rising China, which they claim will displace the US to become the world's new hegemon."But I do not see the onus on the side of China. It is how America perceives China that should be held to account."Cui's points were echoed by Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs."We have a lot of problems in the United States. Unfortunately for us, it is very convenient for us - always when we have problems - to blame them on somebody else," said the former chief economist at Morgan Stanley and chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia."We did that with the Japanese 30 years ago. We are doing it again with China," Roach said.Speaking at the opening of the event, Zhou Shuchun, China Daily's publisher and editor-in-chief, highlighted the importance of the two nations proceeding based on what they have achieved over recent decades."If we could break the ice 40 years ago when there were virtually no exchanges and interaction, then in today's world of interdependence, with the two countries being each other's biggest trade partner and main investor, owning very much a piece of each other, there is absolutely no reason for the future to be going against the tracks of history, and the talk of 'decoupling' is sheer nonsense," Zhou said.Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council, recalled the history of China-US business relations.He discussed the first major rebellion of Britain's North American colonies in 1773, virtually the spark that created the United States of America, in which patriots at the Boston Tea Party, disguised as Native Americans, threw tea imported from Fujian province into Boston Harbor to protest a new tax that the British colonial government had placed on the tea.The uprising was referenced in the US Declaration of Independence, its founding document, in which Thomas Jefferson laid out the formal claims for independence when he complained that England's King George III had illegally cut off trade with all parts of the world and "imposed tariffs without our consent", according to Allen."This is interesting and has a relevance even today," he said.Talking about the current trade tensions between China and the US, Allen said he hoped the leaders of the two countries will be inspired by the friendship, cooperation and mutual benefit that have characterized the bilateral relationship in the past."We have a glorious history. We have a mutual responsibility to ensure that the success of the past continues into the future," he said.Maurice Greenberg, chairman of Starr Cos, said he believes it's time for both countries to have a trade agreement."If both sides can't do it, both sides will suffer. I'm convinced of that," said Greenberg, also vice-chairman of the National Committee on United States-China Relations.Kenneth Quinn, president of The World Food Prize Foundation, recalled the 2012 visit by then Vice-President Xi Jinping to Muscatine, Iowa, where Xi talked about and quoted US writer Mark Twain, and about seeing the sun over the Mississippi River."To have someone who is a head of state, but of another country, speak about my country that way, was so impactful, so dramatic. It left a very, very deep impression on me," said Quinn, former US ambassador to Cambodia.Xu Chen, president and CEO of Bank of China USA, said that while his bank acts on corporate social responsibility by engaging in poverty relief projects in China and helping low-income local communities and small businesses in the US, it's important for countries to commit to the social responsibilities of statehood."If the US is willing to work together with China for mutual benefits and shoulder ... (social responsibilities of statehood) on the world stage, I believe that China will gladly work hand-in-hand with the US and jointly promote a more peaceful, stable and prosperous global community," Xu said.Speakers at the event also highlighted the role that people-to-people exchanges played in boosting the relations between the two countries.Connie Sweeris, a player behind the ice-breaking "ping-pong diplomacy" of the 1970s, encouraged people to play a part in the relationship, just like she did with sports and cultural exchanges."We need to be ambassadors for peace," Sweeris said.The event also featured a panel discussion on Chinese companies' investment in the US, featuring Xiao Yuqiang, chairman of the US Management Committee of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China; Vivek K. Sarin, interim secretary of the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development; and Jeff Liu, president and CEO of Fuyao Group North America. The discussion was moderated by Ji Tao, editor-in-chief and president of China Daily USA.The New York event at the Asia Society was hosted by China Daily and Bank of China. It was the eighth Vision China since it was launched in 2018.

                Humorous and serious stories of China-US relations shared
            </a>
            <p>
                How many Americans can say they've shaken hands with President Xi Jinping — and with his father?That was one of the anecdotes offered by the speakers at a Vision China event in New York on Tuesday. The distinguished guests enlightened the 300-strong diverse audience at the Asia Society, who turned out to hear the topics discussed at "China-US Relations: 40 Years & Beyond".Kenneth Quinn, now president of the World Food Prize Foundation in Iowa, joked about a mistake on a graphic posted on the stage's video screen that said in 2012, with the signing of the US-China Strategic Cooperation Agreement in Agriculture, China would buy $3.5 million in Iowa soybeans. The number should have said $3.5 billion."I have to text my special assistant. That's what maybe we get today," Quinn deadpanned, to much audience laughter, referring to the dropoff of soybean exports to China during the current trade dispute.Quinn got to escort Xi Jinping, who was vice-president at the time, to the World Food Prize Hall of Laureates in Des Moines, Iowa, for the agricultural agreement signing. Xi also had been on a "sentimental" return trip to Iowa, which he first visited in 1985."By the way, I just shook your hand, and I'm one of the few Iowans to shake your hand who also shook your father's hand when your father came to Iowa in 1980," Quinn said to Xi through an interpreter."So, Vice-President Xi is walking along. He literally stops in his tracks and he turns and looks at me, and his eyes get big, and a big smile comes across his face and he says, 'You have two interesting stories.'"Quinn then proceeded to tell the first interesting story, when the then-governor of Guangdong province, Xi Zhongxun (father of now President Xi Jinping), arrived in October 1980, where the province and Iowa made a toast to "future trade and friendship". At the time, Iowa had zero agriculture sales to China.After taking the elder Xi to see various sights around Iowa, "We ended up on the second day stopping at the Amana colonies," Quinn said.The colonies were started by German immigrants in the 19th century."It was a total communist society," Quinn said. "It was organized exactly the same as any Chinese village and commune. He (Xi Zhongxun) could not stop asking questions about it."Because in China at that time was this discussion. He was about to start the Shenzhen special zone for manufacturing. Could agriculture be put on a free market basis in China, could it be socialism with Chinese characteristics?" Quinn said."Whatever he took away, they went back, and with Deng Xiaoping, Xi Zhongxun began the incredible transformation of China."The gregarious Quinn also proudly displayed a photo of his 4-year-old granddaughter, who is of Irish and Chinese descent.Other guest speakers included Connie Sweeris, who along with her husband, Dell, played a key role in the "ping-pong diplomacy" of the 1970s between the two nations.In April 1971, she traveled to China just shy of her 24th birthday on a historic trip by a nine-member US table tennis team.There, team members got to meet then-premier Zhou Enlai."What a joy it is to bring friends from afar," Zhou told the team."Every place we went we were served eight-to-10 course banquet meals," Sweeris recounted Tuesday of the hosts' hospitality.Besides the lighter moments, there were some serious ones, such as the current trade standoff between the US and China. (Incidentally, that issue will be addressed once more on Thursday, with a round of talks in Washington, to be followed by high-level talks in October.)Economist Stephen Roach, a leading Wall Street expert on China, explained in simple terms why the current approach to US-China trade disagreements needs to be rethought."I think we need to be much more creative in our negotiating tactics," said Roach, who is senior fellow at the Yale University Jackson Institute of Global Affairs. "I'm looking for macroeconomic adjustments in both countries, where we save more and China saves less."On a video screen behind Roach was a timeline of the various starts and stops to the trade negotiations over the past year and a half, over who wants a deal and who doesn't.Maurice Greenberg, chairman of the Starr Companies, said: "It's time that we have an agreement. I believe it's possible. If both sides can't do it, then both sides will suffer. I'm convinced of that."And the only person on the stage sprinkling in any Mandarin was an American, Max Horne, an avid student of Chinese language and culture. A freshman at Harvard University, Horne was the champion of the 2018 Chinese Bridge Speech Contest for US high school students. He and China Daily's Dong Leshuo cheerfully served as the emcees of the event.
