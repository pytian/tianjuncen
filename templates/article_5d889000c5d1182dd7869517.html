                China steps up bid for port integration, reorganization

                Moves designed to enhance earnings ability, diversify development modelsJust five minutes away by cargo train from one of Dalian Port's container terminals in Northeast China's Liaoning province, crane operators are busy unloading containers shipped from Japan and South Korea, and transferring them to a freight train that will depart for Moscow in two days."Sea routes combined with railway transportation will further cut costs and transportation times. These fully loaded containers leaving Dalian Port will arrive in Moscow in just one-third of the time that traditional waterways take," said Xia Ting, manager at the business development department of Dalian Port, a subsidiary of the newly founded Liaoning Port Group.With trade links to more than 300 ports in over 160 countries and regions, Liaoning Port Group and its partner Russian Railways are currently investing and building a logistics center outside Moscow, which is expected to be operational by the end of 2020.With the business starting in January, the establishment of Liaoning Port Group is a typical example of the country's intensified efforts to integrate the nation's ports and diversify their business development model to enhance their earning ability via measures such as sea-rail transport, intelligent port development and further expanding connectivity with markets related to the Belt and Road Initiative.As shipping is a lifeline of global trade and ports play a key role in regional development, the government is expected to release the guideline for building world-class ports across the country to support China's foreign trade and service businesses this year, according to a report by Beijing-based Economic Information Daily.Among them, the integration of regional ports has become one of the notable trends, as the recent pace of port reorganization and integration in Tianjin municipality, and Shandong and Jiangxi provinces has either implemented or accelerated, indicating more port conglomerates may emerge sooner or later.Because China currently is in the process of building a modern economic system and pushing its industries to move toward the quality development stage of the global value chain, well-connected and efficient container ports enabled by busy shipping activities are critical in cutting trade costs and facilitating sustainable development, said Lu Chengyun, an assistant researcher at the Institute of Transportation Research at the National Development and Reform Commission.As an infrastructure industry, Lu said the development level of a port needs to adapt to economic and industrial development in different stages, as well as consider measurement indicators including throughput capacity, economic contribution rate, business environment and green development.East China's Shandong established Shandong Port Group last month in Qingdao by integrating major ports in the province, including Qingdao Port, Yantai Port, Rizhao Port and the Bohai Bay Port Group.In addition to enlarging their shipping service categories in more areas such as crude oil, coal, iron ore and vehicle transportation, the group will enhance connections with more "waterless ports" in inland provinces participating in the BRI development, and provide services for hinterland areas involved in the Eurasian Continental Bridge via international freight train services and other multimodal transportation methods.Shandong Port Group has set goals to have its cargo throughput exceed 1.65 billion metric tons by 2022, including more than 800 million tons of goods for foreign trade, as well as a large amount of volume generated by 28 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units).To ensure smooth development, Li Jin, chief researcher at the China Enterprise Research Institute in Beijing, suggested that China's ongoing port integration should be market-oriented, and adapt to the development logic of intercity economic cooperation and regional economic integration. The government should tighten its supervision and avoid negative factors such as unfair competition and low efficiency caused by integration.Dong Liwan, a shipping professor at Shanghai Maritime University, said: "It is necessary to introduce wider mixed-ownership reform in those planned port operating groups, as it can optimize asset structure and boost their service capability in particular in areas such as e-commerce, cold-chain storage and ship maintenance services."All those moves will help domestic ports to further compete with established rivals such as those in Singapore and Busan in South Korea, he said, noting that the successful reorganization and expansion of Ningbo Port and Zhoushan Port in 2015 has brought more practical operational measures, references, inspiration and confidence to other domestic players, as well as provincial governments.Ningbo-Zhoushan Port, one of China's busiest ports, saw its cargo throughput jump 5.5 percent year-on-year to 557.96 million tons in the first half of 2019. Its container throughput ranked second in the country only after Shanghai Port, data from the Ministry of Transport show.As many economies are seeking new ways to minimize the impact caused by unilateralism and protectionism, Ningbo-Zhoushan Port Group, the operator of the port, said it has been accelerating smart port construction to improve efficiency in its 19 port areas such as Beilun Port and Yangshan Port, and tapping the inland markets to seek new growth momentum so far this year.The port has also embraced the BRI by optimizing shipping routes to related regions. The economies related to the BRI contributed to more than 40 percent of its container throughput during the January-June period, with the container throughput from Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean routes in the first half surging 41 percent and 15.8 percent year-on-year respectively.It is not only in coastal provinces, East China's Jiangxi province is also drafting a resource integration plan for its ports including Jiujiang Port, Nanchang Port and Shangrao Port to better participate in the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt.A provincial-level port management group, similar to those in Liaoning and Shandong, is scheduled to complete all the industrial and commercial registration to develop inland waterways before October this year, according to information released by Jiangxi Provincial Port and Waterway Construction Investment Group.In the meantime, many local governments are also studying how to allow large cargo vessels to reach the Yangtze River's upper reaches after many water channels have been expanded over the past three years, said Yi Jiyong, deputy head of the Water Transport Bureau under the Ministry of Transport.

                Seaboard province extends its transport reach
            </a>
            <p>
                In the early 1950s, Jiangsu province had only 3,000 kilometers of roads, most of them nothing more than compacted earth.Seventy years later, the province has 159,000 km of roads and residents of towns with a population over 100,000 can access a highway within 30 minutes, according to the provincial transport department.But development hasn't stopped with the roads, and progress has been made in air, rail and water travel.The latest of Jiangsu's nine civil airports began operations in 2017, transporting millions of domestic and international travelers every year.Wu Zhenglong, governor of Jiangsu, said during a news conference in Beijing on Friday that five high-speed rail links totaling 1,236 km are now under construction. Another five high-speed links totaling 737 km will start construction before the end of next year."By the end of 2018, Jiangsu had 4,711 km of highways," Wu said."It also had 24,400 km of inland waterways and 497 berths of 10,000 metric tons and above. It had eight ports with annual throughput capacity of 100 million tons, and the annual throughput of all the province's ports reached 2.58 billion tons, ranking first in China."Rail and sea transport have also combined to extend Jiangsu's transport reach.Cross-border trains from the port city of Lianyungang now stop at more than 200 stations in five Central Asian countries before they transport goods to Middle Eastern and European countries.Lianyungang is also the only port of departure in China for grains imported from Kazakhstan. In 2017, the first batch of 720 tons of wheat was freighted from Kazakhstan's largest city Almaty to the Sino-Kazakhstan International Logistics Base in six days. The wheat was then transported by cargo ships to Southeast Asian countries.From January to April, the base transported 12,460 containers of produce and goods to Asian and European countries.Kong Fancheng, manager of the Lianyungang New Oriental International Container Terminal, said he has seen the base getting busier and people's lives improving. "We didn't have ocean routes in the past and goods had to be shipped to Qingdao or Shanghai to be transported to other countries," he said."Now we have more than 20 ocean routes that enable us to ship goods to many countries, including the west coast of the United States, the Middle East and the Mediterranean."Kong added that a route to South Africa started in December that will help promote relations with African countries.

                'Fuse with' -- not fear of -- Chinese investments, Italians say
            </a>
            <p>
                VADO LIGURE, Italy -- The Mediterranean port city of Vado Ligure, with a population of some 8,500, might be small in size, but it has an ongoing big construction project on its shore.The Vado Gateway terminal, scheduled to open in December, will be able to service the world's largest container ships which are so huge that they can only dock at select ports across the globe.Making that possible was the Netherlands-based APM Terminals, part of the Danish conglomerate Maersk, together with two Chinese companies including COSCO SHIPPING Ports.Ports are among the most traditional and strategic infrastructures in the world, and Chinese investment here -- thousands of miles from homeland -- are not feared but welcomed, local officials and industry insiders say.FUSING WITH CHINA"Our local community is well aware that a foreign investor is not in Vado to conquer but to collaborate, this is the message that I gave to my citizens," Monica Giuliano, mayor of Vado Ligure, told Xinhua.In the view of Gian Enzo Duci, a professor at the University of Genoa and president of Federagenti (Italian National Federation of Ship Brokers & Agents), Chinese companies that are involved with ports are doing just what their international counterparts do year after year."What COSCO is doing in Italy is not different from what MSC -- that is a Swiss company -- is doing; or Maersk, that is a Danish company; or that in the past was done by American or Japanese companies. So in this respect, I don't see why we should have such a scare of (Chinese) presence here," Duci told Xinhua.The city of Genoa is known for its central role in maritime trade over many centuries and is currently Italy's busiest sea port. The city's deputy mayor, Giancarlo Vinacci, said he believes "in this case there is a need in the western world to fuse 'old' Europe together with 'young' China."SPEEDING UPChinese investments are welcomed as they bring exactly what Italy need the most -- infrastructure.Italy hasn't developed infrastructures in its ports or inland areas in the past few years, Paolo Cornetto, managing director of APM Terminals at Vado Ligure, told Xinhua."In Italy, the period required to create an infrastructure is very long. In this context, the arrival of COSCO has accelerated the conclusion ... of the project," Giuliano said.The Vado Gateway is set to be the first semi-automated port in Italy with a fully-automated gate and stacking yard after the construction of the terminal is completed.Anticipating booming transportation of goods at the terminal, logistic companies have rented or bought warehouses nearby in the hope of taking a slice of the cargo in the future."It is good that all these firms want to enter into Vado (Ligure) port. Now we have to develop the infrastructure to speed up the transportation process," said Danilo Causa, who is in charge of the local transport federation of the Italian Confederation of Trade Unions."It would be useful if part of the investment in infrastructure could come from China. This would speed up the process, as in Italy it is quite slow," he added.GAINING GROUNDThe China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) provides "an extraordinary opportunity" for Italy and its ports in particular, Duci said.The initiative refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, which is aimed at building trade and infrastructure networks connecting Asia with Europe, Africa and beyond.If fully implemented, the initiative could boost global trade by 6.2 percent and by up to 9.7 percent for BRI corridor economies, according to a study published on June 18 by the World Bank.Compared with established ports up north in Europe such as Rotterdam, Antwerp or Hamburg, Italian ports could save around five days' sailing time for ships passing the Mediterranean, Duci said.If the cost and time of land transfer of goods after their arrival by sea can be slashed, "we can be the real kingmaker of the European logistics," Duci added.Upbeat about business prospects of the terminal, locals have been looking forward to a brighter future, as they believe the project will boost employment.Jobs will be created in "port labor, workshops, restaurant, everything that is developing around the terminal," said Cornetto.

                Mountain retreat offers a natural welcome
            </a>
            <p>
                At every organized homestay or B&B in the rustic Zhejiang villages hidden in the mountains, tourists are welcomed as family. Here you can laugh, talk, enjoy the clear air, clean water and ancient mountains, finding a retreat from the busy urban life.Brandon Shanhaiyunsu in Jinhua is no doubt one of the best. Located at the Hengla village of Jindong district, it is nestled in the nearby hills, making the rustic homestay a pearl among the floating clouds around the mountains.The operator of the B&B, Zhang Jinlin decided to maintain an original Jiangnan-style design-indicative of dwellings south of the Yangtze River. Inside, visitors will find a lot of antiques and old bric-a-brac that Zhang has collected over the past 10 years, such as a wooden puppet from India, carvings from Africa, bestowing each room with its own distinctive decor.Sitting with the window open, you can enjoy the nearby mountain views, and a panorama of Jinhua city, which is around 10 kilometers away from the village.Li Jin, an IT manager who works in Hangzhou, says his family has formed a habit of traveling to the retreat during weekends, especially during summertime."The altitude here is higher in Hangzhou, so my wife and I can find a precious cool and refreshing breeze away from the summer heat," he says."We usually take the high-speed train, within one hour we will be in Jinhua to start our summer holidays," he adds.He says what impressed them most is the infinity pool, situated right in front of the B&B."You feel like you're being embraced by mother nature, watching the clouds drifting above, it's like swimming in the Mediterranean."Shao Yongquan, Party head of Hengla Village, adds "All the rooms in Brandon Shanhaiyunsu and its nearby B&B are fully booked nowadays, with more farmers coming to us asking for help in building such facilities".
