                Big prospects for Sino-US service trade
            </p>
            <p>
                China and the United States have great potential for cooperation in services trade, and need to further expand their common interests in the field, according to a top government think-tank report released on Thursday.Trade in services refers to the sale and delivery of intangible products such as those related to transportation, tourism, telecommunications, advertising and computing.Sino-US services trade has been growing, and unlike the situation in goods trade, the US has run a trade surplus in services with China, according to data from the Global Services Trade Development Index Report 2019.The US' services trade surplus with China stood at $38.8 billion in 2018, which accounted for 15 percent of the US total trade surplus in the area, and was the highest percentage compared to other countries, the report said. The Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, a research body by the Ministry of Commerce, prepared the report.The report said the Sino-US trade imbalance in services does not mean gains or losses for either party, but reflects the differences between the needs of the two sides or their stages of development. China-US services trade is a win-win situation, and both sides have the common goal of promoting extensive cooperation in the field, it said.Li Jun, director of the international trade in services institute of CAITEC, said: "You can't say one side suffers a loss because of trade surplus, and vice versa." Trade imbalance between two countries, either in services or goods, is a result of their comparative advantages, he told reporters on the sidelines of 2019 Global Trade in Services Summit.China's services trade surplus can naturally shrink, if services industries further improve their competitiveness, Li said. "It (decline in service trade surplus) is a natural outcome during the process, not the only goal that we are seeking after."Last year, trade in services between China and the US grew 2.7 percent year-on-year to $75.5 billion, accounting for 11.4 percent of total Sino-US trade, according to the report. Their services trade mainly covers tourism, transportation, intellectual property, and finance.China's huge expenditure on service trade has improved its balance of international payments, the report said.It said China and the US need to avoid lose-lose thinking, and constantly expand the common interests in the field of services trade. Services trade should play a unique role in Sino-US economic and trade relations and inject new vitality into it, the report said.Gu Xueming, head of CAITEC, said the development of China's services trade has created tremendous opportunities for countries around the world. He said the country welcomes entrepreneurs from all over the world to actively cooperate with China in trade and investment in the services industry and share the fruits of China's development in the field.

                Washington, thy other name is hypocrisy
            </a>
            <p>
                The United States always has its hands full trying to force its laws and values upon other countries and, if resisted, to impose sanctions on them. But as usual, it has failed with its filthy trick in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by openly supporting the violent demonstrators and introducing the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act" in Congress. So now it is trying to extend its dirty hands into the Tibet autonomous region, by unveiling a new bill that would prohibit Beijing from opening any new consulates on US soil until Washington is permitted to establish its own diplomatic office in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet autonomous region. And all in the name of human rights protection. As is its wont, Washington cannot bear to see peace and stability anywhere, except within its borders, for it has mastered the art of fishing in troubled waters. No wonder the bill also has provisions for the US taking punitive action against any Chinese officials who "interfere" in the Dalai Lama's succession. Which should make it clear the real purpose of the bill is to prevent the Chinese central government from using its authority to approve the successor to the octogenarian Dalai Lama after he dies. Perhaps US lawmakers, especially Massachusetts Democrat James McGovern who introduced the bill in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, and Florida Republican Marco Rubio who has been screaming his head off in support of the Hong Kong demonstrators, have forgotten that Tibet is an inseparable part of China, a fact the US, too, recognizes. As such, any attempt to interfere in Tibet's affairs would be a violation of China's sovereignty. More important, supporting the Dalai Lama is like mollycoddling a separatist, for his activities over the past decades to split Tibet from China make him exactly that. The economic development and social progress Tibetans have been enjoying fly in the face of the US congressmen, who without any knowledge about the region, have been beating their democracy and human rights drum. In keeping up with the US' practice of poking its nose into other countries' matters, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomed Hong Kong protesters on Wednesday. She even thanked them for unleashing violence and holding the city to ransom, and warned the US administration not to allow commercial interests to drive foreign policy in the region. The double standard resorted to by the self-proclaimed guardians of human rights becomes even more evident when they applaud rioters in other countries and deal with protesters in their own country with an iron hand. Have American values also come to mean hypocrisy? (China Daily Global 09/20/2019 page11)
