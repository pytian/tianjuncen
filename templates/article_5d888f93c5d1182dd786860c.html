                Legendary performer Yanni to play at Beijing Pop Festival
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1997, Greek composer and performer, Yanni, was the first Western artist to perform at the historic Forbidden City in Beijing, which made him one of the most popular Western musicians among Chinese fans. Between 1997 and 2015, the Grammy-nominated musician launched five tours to China that have included visits to more cities, including Shanghai, Chengdu in Sichuan province and Guangzhou in Guangdong province. On Nov 9 and 10, Yanni will return to China with two performances at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing that will feature one of his most famous songs, Nightingale, which he wrote for China after that first concert in 1997.Yanni's performances will be part of the upcoming annual Beijing International Pop Music Festival, which will be held in the capital from October to November.Featuring live concerts, master classes and forums, the festival will gather together international acts including German piano duo Olha Chipak and Oleksiy Kushnir, Inner Mongolian rock band Hanggai, and Beijing-based folk band Xiaojuan and Residents From the Valley.Jiang Tao, general manager of Chia Tai Music Group, the organizer of the festival, notes that the event was first launched in 2015 with six indoor concerts held in the capital.From 2015 to 2018, the festival has hosted 35 groups from across the globe and has, so far, attracted a total audience of over 8 million both on the internet and at the festival's live venues."This year, we present the festival with the theme 'crossover'. We've confirmed four acts so far, but more will follow and will cover a diverse range of music genres," Jiang says in Beijing.The eponymous lead vocalist of the band Xiaojuan and Residents From the Valley, is known for her soothing voice and original folk sounds. Founded 10 years ago by Xiaojuan and her husband, guitarist Li Qiang, the band performs in Beijing every spring on the day of Guyu, which literally translates as "grain rain", one of the 24 traditional Chinese solar terms."This year, we perform during autumn and the theme of our show will be to use music to portray a man's entire life, from his childhood to his twilight years," says Xiaojuan, adding that, as well as the four members of the band, a contemporary dancer and an electronic musician will join the group for the performance.In 2018, about 24,000 indoor concerts were held around the country, an increase of more than 8.5 percent compared to the previous year, showcasing the booming market for live music performances, says Song Guanlin, deputy director of the China Association of Performing Arts.Song adds that Chinese audiences have embraced a variety of music styles ever since the country started to produce its own original pop material during the early 1980s."We will also bring international musicians to campuses to host master classes and forums, providing the next generation with the latest information about, and developments in, the world of pop music," Song says.

                Luminaries, poets and the jet set never tire of Italy's charming resort island of CapriThe island of Capri is about as glamorous as island living gets. One of the largest islands in the Gulf of Naples, the Greeks called it Pausilypon, meaning "pause from troubles".In the early 20th century, it took in political refugees, including Russian writer Maxim Gorky and Vladimir Lenin; the famous Chilean poet Pablo Neruda followed suit in the 1950s and lived in exile there.Today, Capri is a romantic, artistic, shopping and recreational mecca, especially in its celebrated La Piazzetta, known as "the living room of the world" and in which cars are prohibited.Classic cinema plays a large part of Capri's allure. Witness the spontaneous, erumpent beauty of Brigitte Bardot captured on the roof of Casa Malaparte in Jean-Luc Godard's Contempt (1963) and Marcello Mastroianni and Claudia Cardinale in Liliana Cavani's The Skin (1981), which depicted La Piazzetta under German invasion. The famous Bay of Naples attracted the mega-wattage star power of Sophia Loren, Clark Gable, Audrey Hepburn and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, among numerous others.With glamour has come fashion and luxury - can you guess where the famed capri pants originated? The island has been the setting for a number of high-end advertising campaigns for brands, too. For the last two seasons, Chanel has taken a summer vacation in Capri by setting up a pop-up store - featuring a terracotta facade with an ivy-entwined pergola - in the heart of the island on Via Camerelle, with offerings from its Métiers d'Art and Coco Beach collections.

                Greek PM says nation's economic stagnation is coming to an end
            </a>
            <p>
                The dark clouds that shrouded the Greek economy for almost a decade are clearing, according to the nation's prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis."Greece is no longer Europe's black sheep," he said at a trade fair in the port city of Thessaloniki on the weekend while insisting that, after being dependent on international loans for many years, his nation's future is rosy."Greece has turned a page. ... We're a self-confident country now," he said at the Thessaloniki International Fair, a platform leaders traditionally use to unveil economic policy in front of an audience of the nation's business elite.The Greek economy is now on course to expand by 2.2 percent this year after having contracted by more than a quarter during its decade-long economic crisis.Mitsotakis insisted that Greece's turnaround will be a "pleasant surprise for Europe" and said investor confidence in Greek bonds is stronger now than it has been at any time during the past decade.His center-right party, New Democracy, won a general election in July and took over the nation's reins for the first time since 2007.Mitsotakis, himself the son of a former prime minister, campaigned on the platform of revamping the economy, getting rid of red tape, and introducing fast-track reforms aimed at modernizing state-run enterprises."With a bold wave of reforms, we will win strong credibility and, with the right timing and our positive results as a weapon, we will claim more realistic annual primary budget surpluses," The Guardian newspaper quoted him as saying while announcing a range of corporate and individual tax cuts and national restructuring. "One stone at a time, we're setting the foundations of the country's regeneration."Mitsotakis plans to appeal to the European Union for a relaxation of the bloc's strict fiscal targets that accompanied EU bailouts of the debt-stricken nation, including the goal of having an annual budget surplus of 3.5 percent of GDP. The Financial Times said the prime minister hopes that target can be cut to 2 percent by 2021.At a news conference after the trade fair, the former banker said his pro-business government will attempt to attract more foreign investment for such things as the 8-billion-euro ($8.8 billion) redevelopment of the now abandoned Ellinikon International Airport in Athens into a business and leisure center. It aims to generate 10,000 jobs during construction and 75,000 when completed.Former prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who agreed to the EU rescue packages that ensured the nation could carry on using the euro as currency, said Mitsotakis is making promises he will not be able to keep."He will soon find himself faced with the dead ends and inconsistencies of his policies, and will consider early elections irrespective of what we ask for," Tsipras told the Efimerida ton Syntakton newspaper.The bailout negotiated by Tsipras allowed the nation to pay off its debts of more than $330 billion and was the largest ever directed at a major Western economy.
