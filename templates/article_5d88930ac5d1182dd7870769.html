                Business leaders and technology experts from China and the US will converge in Seattle on Saturday for the one-day Seattle Biz-Tech Forum at the HyattRegencyBellevue Hotel. Hosted by the Nan Hai Company, the Seattle Biz-Tech Summit is an interactive and engaging platform for public-private dialogue, as the Greater Seattle area has become a bigger business center of the West coast for foreign investments. Nan Hai, a company founded in San Francisco in 1986, currently is headquartered in Millbrae with offices in Santa Clara, CA and Kirkland, WA. The annual summit is in its second year. Last year, the Seattle Biz-Tech Summit attracted about 500 attendees, including a veritable A-list of companies from the US and China - Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Expedia, Boeing, Oracle, China Telecom, Lenovo, Baidu, ZTE, Tencent, Huawei and many others. High-tech products, services and innovations were presented by keynote speakers, panels, and roundtable meetings, addressing clean energy technologies, in particular, and other trends such as cloud computing, big data, international trade, mobile computing and biotechnology. This year, the summit will build on the pioneering success of last year's conference as it continues to bring together major business and technology organizations and leading companies from China and the US. Billed as a one-of-a-kind international technology and business conference, the event highlights and promotes exchanges between investors, innovators and academia. Under the theme of "Innovation, Investment, and Connection", the conference sessions will explore several highly relevant business and technology topics, including: cloud security issues, mobile internet, smart business solutions, e-commerce and digital markets, internet finance and more. Summit participants will have the opportunity to interact with many high-profile industry executives, software developers, scientific researchers and prominent community leaders during informal receptions and break times, or at organized events during happy hours and lunch and dinner events. Recently the Greater Seattle area has been gaining prominence as a hot spot for international business conferences and meetings and China has been one of the keywords. In July, top business leaders from around the Pacific Rim gathered at Bell Harbor International Conference center in Seattle for the APEC China CEO Forum 2014, an initiative of the Beijing-based APEC China Business Council, produced this year in partnership with the National Center for APEC. To promote business and economic communications between Chinese business leaders, officials and other stakeholders in China and the Asia-Pacific region, this year's forum engaged 250 private sector delegates from the APEC region, including APEC Business Advisory Council members from all 21 APEC Economies and a delegation of executives from China's newly established APEC China Business Council. Then on Sept 4, the two-day Boao Seattle conference, the first of its kind, was hosted by the Boao Forum for Asia in North America. The summit initiated by Nan Hai attractsBrad Owen, lieutenant governor of Washington, and Jim Reavis, co-founder and CEOatCloud Security Alliance,as keynote speakers. Some of the panel speakers will includeformer US Congressman Don Bonker; David Nelson, chief strategist for cloud computing at Boeing; and Henry Liebman, CEO and chairman of American Life. So far, about 600 participants have registered for the event. lindadeng@chinadailyusa.com (China Daily USA 09/26/2014 page2)

                As US President Barack Obama enters his second term, international trade has become a high priority. The US may be ready to negotiate a free trade agreement with Europe and complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership that involves Pacific Rim countries. Left out is China, the world's second largest economy and America's top trade partner. As Obama champions trade pacts elsewhere, it appears that a trade war with China is brewing. The president's first-term trade record proved to be more about politics than economics, particularly with Asia. The TPP is clearly intended to position the US as a geopolitical strategy to counter China's influence in the region. The US already has trade agreements with six of the nine countries involved in the TPP. This is even more evident in his administration's actions on trade cases, which reveal his political, if not protectionist, sentiments on China. A series of government rulings clearly target Chinese companies, imposing punishing tariffs on imported products, particularly in the renewable energy sector. The most notable example is the Department of Commerce actions against imports of Chinese solar cells, imposing a series of antidumping tariffs as high as 250 percent. There is obvious legitimacy given that US laws are written to deal with foreign subsidization and dumping situations that hurt American companies. But there is also increased politicization of the regulatory process that is causing injury not only to foreign producers but also to US companies, who are becoming the victims of heavy tariffs. While America's trade laws are rightly intended to protect domestic producers from unfair trade practices, what is little understood is that the imposed tariffs actually penalize the US importers who end up paying the tariffs. In most cases, the vast majority of US importers are small and medium-sized US companies who are often unaware of this liability and must cope with what amounts to a heavy fine that can also be applied retroactively. The duties, or tariffs, can be substantial. In a case involving the importation of wooden bedroom furniture, the duties for one Chinese exporter went from 16 to 216 percent, which amounted to an estimated $200 million liability that had to be paid by US importers purchasing the furniture. US importers are coping with millions of dollars in trade-related liability cases, ranging from garlic, crawfish and honey to citric acid, silicon metal, ironing tables, wooden bedroom furniture, steel wire nails and many products too numerous to mention, often causing US import companies to go bankrupt. In some cases, prohibitive tariffs can be counterproductive. The Obama administration has clamped down on the importation of renewable energy products (wind towers, solar cells, etc), driving up costs of clean and efficient energy production, thus undermining what was a high priority for his first term. In the last two years, countless solar and wind towers plants have gone bankrupt due, in part, to the higher tariffs that make it difficult for these startups to be cost effective. Reciprocity is inevitable if one country deems another of engaging in unfair or discriminatory trade practices. In response to the solar cells case, China has initiated an antidumping and countervailing duty case against the US for $2 billion worth of US-produced polysilicon that goes into Chinese solar cells, which are exported to the US. In a trade war, nobody wins. How can we avoid going down the path of protectionism and possibly trigger a trade war with our most important trade partner? Congress should re-write US trade laws to insure more balance and fairness to replace the current laws that strongly favor one set of US companies over others. A key issue in the near future is making China a market economy country. If China becomes a market economy, the Commerce Department will have to use actual costs and prices in China to calculate dumping rates. But there will be resistance, to be sure, from those domestic companies who will fight any changes in the current system that maintains their competitive advantage. They are well equipped in the lobbying business given the coalitions formed to promote their interests on Capitol Hill and before government agencies. The importing companies must likewise collaborate to more effectively get their side of the story to the decision-makers to insure that the effects of prescribed duties on US importers are properly considered. This is not only about flaws in our trade laws, but it is also the politicizing of the bilateral trade relationship with China. Hopefully the second Obama term will be more about economics and less about politics. Don L. Bonker, former US congressman and chairman of House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Trade and currently executive director at APCO Worldwide. William E. Perry, formerly with the US International Trade Commission and US Commerce Department, is the international trade partner at Dorsey & Whitney. (China Daily 03/22/2013 page15)

                Editor's Note: "My China Album", a story-sharing project run by the Chinese embassy in Washington and China Daily, aims at highlighting the friendships between Chinese and American people, as expressed in photographs and accompanying captions. Those interested in participating in the program are invited to submit up to three photos with accompanying captions of 300 words or less, explaining the person-to-person exchange or relationship depicted in the photo. The deadline for submissions is April 19, 2019. For more details visit http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/mychinaalbum.Five years into representing the state of Washington in the US Congress in the late '70s, Don Bonker got a rare treat: a visit to China, a country once regarded by the United States as the "red enemy" and eventually considered its new friend.Bonker landed in China on the official US Air Force plane in April 1980 — less than one and half years after the two countries established diplomatic relations in January 1979 — along with five other congressmen from committees that oversaw the bilateral relationship.The delegation, presumably the first to visit China since normalization, was organized by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, according to Bonker, who at the time chaired the Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade.Now in his early 80s, Bonker still vividly remembers what China looked like then."The US–China normalization of relations was an eye-opener. We had knowledge of China's glorious history but were stunned by what we witnessed in each of the cities we visited, Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou. On the streets, no vehicles, and people mostly wore masks, probably due to pollution. There were no prominent hotels or restaurants," said Bonker.Bonker's wife, Carolyn, who accompanied him on the trip, still keeps the bi-lingual pamphlet from where they stayed in Shanghai, the Jin Jiang Hotel, the best in the city, and the elaborately decorated bi-lingual menu from a banquet hosted by Shanghai's mayor.Although China at that time looked gray and backward with bicycles everywhere and facilities in dire condition, everyone in the trip could feel there was something powerful just waiting to be unleashed, Bonker said."You could just tell. A nation of this size, a population of this scale, now with the cultural revolution (1966-1976) behind it, was bound to reborn itself to the greatness it once had," said Bonker.The spirit of the Chinese people also has stayed in Bonker's memory. Sitting in a bus stuck in traffic along the famous harbor road of Shanghai, Bonker and the delegation found that they were suddenly surrounded by thousands of staring Chinese, most of whom had rarely seen foreigners. They were all in military-like attire, looking curious but cautious.Suddenly, Charles Vanik, chair of the powerful House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade, opened the bus window and started singing the popular song from the Disney movie Song of the South: "Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay, My, oh, my, what a wonderful day…".Everyone in the bus joined in singing along. Then magic happened."We witnessed a sea of smiles that spread throughout the crowd. It was a delightful few minutes, as smiles replaced the otherwise grim faces," recalled Bonker.In the heavy album of their China trip, there is one photo Bonker likes most. It is a child asleep on the shoulder of an adult, a scene they captured on street. Carolyn wrote a caption under the photo: "China is truly a sleeping giant awakening.""My wife really had the vision to predict China's future," said Bonker proudly.The Bonkers experienced one "awakening" of China firsthand. While taking a stroll in Shanghai, the delegation was approached by a young man, who invited the group to his parents' small apartment for dinner.A few years later, as China was opening up to the world, the same young man came to American University in Washington to study, becoming a welcomed guest at the Bonker's apartment on many holiday occasions."We treated him like our family. He was very committed to his education here," said Bonker.In 2018, Bonker returned to Shanghai as a member of a delegation organized by the US Association of Former Members of Congress. That same young man, David Jin, former CEO of Philips Healthcare China and now chairman and president of Harman International, a Fortune 500 company, hosted the group in one of the most prestigious business clubs in Shanghai, a city that had completely transformed itself from the one that Bonker had visited 38 years earlier.Another former US congressman, Tim Roemer of Indiana, was also in the delegation. "He murmured to me, 'Don, I feel like I am in New York'," recalled Bonker.After leaving Congress in 1989, Bonker founded non-profit organization International Management and Development Institute, promoting collaborations between the US and European nations.He also served as an executive for APCO Worldwide, a public relations firm that has established itself well in China, serving leading Chinese companies and bringing Bonkers back to China from time to time."What's amazing is the growth of private sector companies, many now leaders in the global economy. Even SOE's adhere to market economies and are often more accountable to banks than to ministries. China still embraces Communism, but it has entrepreneurial talent that is unmatched in the 21st century," said Bonker.While in Congress, Bonker also served on the President's Export Council, authoring significant trade legislation. He also published a book titled America's Trade Crisis.Trade, Bonker says, is his subject and he's been paying particularly close attention to the current trade dispute and negotiations going on between China and the US."The US should focus on increasing its exports to China instead of trying to suppress imports from there," Bonker said. "Exports to China have generated numerous jobs in the US and raised the living standard of Americans. Now exports are being hurt significantly by tariffs, which hurt jobs."The bottom-line is China is surpassing the US as the global leader, and for many US government and policy leaders, it is disturbing," he added.Bonker is working on a new memoir, Dancing to the Capitol, which he hopes will come out in a few months."I know the Chinese like the hugely popular TV soap opera House of Cards. My book does not offer that kind of excitement, but it does have a lot of entertaining anecdotes about how the US Congress works," said Bonker.
