                Mexico accuses Paris auctioneer of 'illegal' sale
            </p>
            <p>
                Mexico's Foreign Ministry is disputing an auction held in Paris over the legality of the artifacts being auctioned. The items being auctioned are pre-Columbian sculptures, masks and religious artifacts dating as early as 1000 BC up to the 18th century.Mexico's ambassador to France claims some of the items on auction were either stolen, illegally sold or possibly not authentic. Alexandre Millon, auctioneer and president of Millon Auction House, who is auctioning the artifacts, says the collectors met all legal criteria.

                GM, striking workers resume negotiations
            </a>
            <p>
                The union striking General Motors says the automaker should have made its latest offer sooner, and the walkout by nearly 50,000 workers may have been averted. GM said it had offered to make more than $7 billion in new investments in US plants, add 5,400 jobs and increase pay and benefits. United Automobile Workers Vice-President Terry Dittes said in a letter to GM on Sunday that the union was disappointed that GM waited two hours before the contract expired on Saturday night to make what the union considered "its first serious offer". "If the union received that offer earlier," he added, "it may have been possible for the two to reach a tentative agreement, and the strike may have been avoided." GM and the UAW resumed negotiations Monday to end the strike at factories across the Midwest and South, the first walkout since the automaker emerged from taxpayer-funded bankruptcy a decade ago. US President Donald Trump said Monday that he was "sad" to see the strike and hopes it is "a quick one". "My relationship has been very powerful with the autoworkers, not necessarily the top (UAW) person or two but the people that work doing automobiles," Trump said at the White House, where he was meeting with the crown prince of Bahrain. "Nobody's been better to the autoworkers than me," he said. "I'd like to see it work out, but I don't want General Motors building plants in China and Mexico... I don't want these big massive auto plants built in other countries, and I don't think they'll be doing that anymore." Trump later said that "federal mediation is always possible, if that's what they want". A prolonged strike could disrupt local economies in factory towns in several swing states like Michigan and Ohio, where Trump has promised to increase manufacturing jobs. Democrats seeking their party's presidential nomination, including former vice-president Joe Biden and senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, gave their support to the striking workers. Democrats see recapturing blue-collar votes in the region and the loyalties of union members there as central to winning the White House in 2020. Four US Democratic members of Congress from Michigan also announced on Monday that they supported the union autoworkers. Trump won Michigan, GM's home state, by 10,704 votes in 2016. He carried Wisconsin by 22,748 votes and Pennsylvania by 44,292 votes, promising manufacturing workers he would overhaul trade deals that he said sapped US manufacturing jobs. Those three states were enough to give Trump a victory in the Electoral College against Hillary Clinton, even though she won the popular vote by close to 3 million votes. Meanwhile, the union's bargaining agreement expired on Saturday and the UAW leaders in Detroit voted to strike, which immediately halted production in the United States. The UAW's demands include higher wages, improved healthcare, job security, profit-sharing and the reopening of idled plants. GM wants employees to pay a greater portion of their healthcare costs, and to increase work force productivity and flexibility in factories. A prolonged strike could affect GM's bottom line and thousands of its parts suppliers, as well as Canadian and Mexican operations. The strike hits GM's revenue nearly immediately because GM records wholesales to dealers."We estimate lost daily revenue of $312.6 million," said David Whiston, automotive equity analyst for Morningstar, a financial services firm. Workers would be losing millions in aggregate, too. Union members will receive $250 a week while out of work, but the assistance pay is available after the 15th day of the strike. If GM's North American profits are hit, the company could lower annual profit-sharing checks union members receive each March. Those checks have averaged $11,000 over the last three years. "Workers will feel it immediately because if they move to strike pay, that's miserable," said Kristin Dziczek, vice-president for industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan, told The New York Times. GM made $8.1 billion globally last year but it has idled three plants in the US as sales and overall demand for vehicles weakens. GM operates 12 vehicle assembly factories in the US and 22 parts plants. aiheping@chinadaily.com (China Daily Global 09/18/2019 page3)

                Mexico's post-quake rebuilding to conclude in 2020
            </a>
            <p>
                MEXICO CITY - The restoration and reconstruction in southern and central Mexican regions attacked by two powerful quakes in 2017 will end next year, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday."We believe the (rebuilding) program will be completed by the end of next year," the president told a daily press conference.The Lopez Obrador administration, which took office on Dec 1, expects 40 percent of the reconstruction work will be completed by the end of the year, he added."There are no budget constraints ... and we will fulfill any demand, (which) is included in our government priorities," Lopez Obrador said.On Sept 7 and Sept 19, 2017, Mexico was hit by magnitude 8.2 and 7.1 earthquakes respectively, in which some 500 people were killed and a large number of buildings damaged in southern and central states, including capital Mexico City.The quakes had damaged some 186,526 houses, along with 19,198 schools, nearly 297 hospitals and clinics, and 2,340 historic buildings, said Minister of Agrarian Development and Urban Planning Roman Meyer, citing the estimates of the previous administration.National Commissioner for Reconstruction David Cervantes said 30 percent of the reconstruction project has been finished so far.

                Design week puts Chinese creativity on show
            </a>
            <p>
                Icons of the founding of the People's Republic of China a major highlight The Beijing Design Week 2019 is showcasing China's top creativity and innovation across a vast palette of art, industry, history and culture as it runs from Sept 5 to Oct 7. The design week has been held every autumn in the capital since 2009, except in 2010, and has become a leading international platform for Chinese design. A major highlight of this year's event is the Exhibition of National Image Design at the Beginning of the Founding of the People's Republic of China.  Guests unveil this year's classic design award at the opening ceremony of the 2019 Beijing Design Week in early September. Wang Zhuangfei / China Daily Left: A craft expert shows his skills at an exhibition during the ongoing Beijing Fashion Week. Right: Visitors show interest in metal designs on display. Photos Provided to China DailyIt reflects the importance of design in the early years after the foundation of the PRC, said Wang Yudong, general manager of Beijing Design Week Co. The exhibition, held throughout the 2019 design week, showcases designs of the country's flag, emblems and anthem and tells the stories behind the archives, design drawings and file photos. The event coincides with celebrations of the PRC's 70th anniversary. Mexico City is the guest city being featured at this year's design week. It is helping Chinese people to learn more about Mexico City as a design destination, organizers said. At the award ceremony for the Beijing Design Awards held on Sept 5, a Mexican-made pottery design called The Sinkhole was honored with the traditional craft design award. The blackened pottery mimics the land formation of a sinkhole hanging from a wooden frame, and according to the organizers, combines practical and artistic elements. Mexico City is hosting an exhibition called Design Beyond Borders at the China Millennium Monument from Sept 5 to 16, showcasing the city's original design concepts from the perspectives of craft innovation, space design and culture. Isaac Landeros, curator of the exhibition, is a Mexican architect and designer who has lived in Beijing since 2012. He said at a forum during the week that design is a powerful language, and it is necessary to use diverse modes of design to integrate culture from different countries. The guest city title each year is an official means of communication between the Beijing government and foreign cities in innovation and design fields, organizers said, adding that it is important for the event to display the world's latest design concepts and traditional design essence of different ethnic groups. Previous guest cities include London, Milan, Amsterdam, Dubai, Seoul and Berlin. This year's classic design award, the top gong of the Beijing Design Awards, was given to the Shenzhou V manned spacecraft. The spacecraft features automatic defect diagnosis and escape systems, and is especially designed with solar wings on the orbital module, which enables the module to keep track and carry out spatial experiments while unmanned. The design has greatly extended the spacecraft's working life for spatial experiments and applications, increasing its comprehensive functions, the design week's organizers said. Other activities of the design week include the Beijing Design Expo that took place from Sept 12 to 16. It showcased the development of design craft over the past seven decades and its influence on social development at different times. Public artworks were also exhibited alongside communication and trade among influential Asian architects, designers, real estate developers, retailers and buyers. Fashion Beijing has hosted events such as runway shows and an online fashion design contest, which promoted clothing brands and discussions on China's creative design, the organizers said. Beijing Gehua Cultural Development Group has been among organizers of the Beijing Design Week for several years. Li Danyang, general manager of the company, said when the design week was held for the first time in 2009, there was no consensus on the importance of design, including its significance in promoting development and industrial upgrading. Li said in the past decade social progress has been made with Chinese and international design. Beijing boasts a strong design ambience and vitality, according to the organizers. The city is home to 119 design schools with more than 30,000 students. More than 250,000 people work in the design sector, one of the city's pillar industries. Beijing has more than 30 areas featuring cultural creativity such as the 798 Art Zone and 751 D��Park. Noted works of design in the city include the National Centre for the Performing Arts designed by French Paul Andreu and Galaxy SOHO designed by Zaha Hadid. songmengxing@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily 09/20/2019 page19)
