                Japan-S. Korea dispute hits businesses
            </p>
            <p>
                Consumer boycotts, canceled tours, poor sales of automobiles among trade conflict's impactsJapan's decisions to tighten controls on exports of some materials to South Korea and remove the country from its "white list" of preferential trading partners has created a backlash, and the trade dispute between the two is hitting their businesses hard.In addition, South Korean consumers are boycotting Japanese goods and canceling tours to Japan.Airfares from Japan to Seoul are in a free fall this month, with one-way fares from smaller Japanese cities as cheap as 1,000 yen ($9.30), and 1,500 yen from major hubs Kansai International Airport and Narita International Airport, before taxes and fuel surcharges - roughly 60 to 80 percent less than a year ago, according to AirPlus, operator of the Ena budget ticket site.Large South Korean carriers such as Korean Air Lines and Asiana Airlines have reduced or suspended service to Japanese destinations due to a sharp drop in the number of South Koreans visiting Japan.Japanese companies have also faced consumer boycotts in South Korea of products ranging from cars to beer.According to the Financial Times, Nissan Motor Co is considering pulling out of South Korea, citing poor sales and ongoing financial losses as the main reasons.The Japanese carmaker sold just 58 vehicles in South Korea in August, down 88 percent from a year ago, according to the Korea Automobile Importers & Distributors Association.At a news conference in Tokyo on Monday, Hiroaki Nakanishi, the chairman of the Japan Business Federation, warned that Japanese companies continue to face major risks stemming from heightened tensions with South Korea and the uncertain outlook for Britain's exit from the European Union.South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in a show of his administration's resolve to support the domestic production of major industrial materials amid the trade dispute with Japan, said on Tuesday that enhancing competitiveness on industrial materials, component parts and other technological equipment is a "strategic task for (becoming) an economic powerhouse".It's a "matter of establishing the foundation of the South Korean economy, beyond the level of South Korea-Japan relations," he said at a meeting in Seoul at the Post-Silicon Semiconductor Institute of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology.The Post-Silicon Semiconductor Institute has mapped out a blueprint for South Korea's industries, including shipbuilding, steel and automobiles, which led to the miraculous growth of Seoul from 1953 to 1996.Moon considers the nurturing of local suppliers as a mid - to long-term solution, Yonhap News Agency said.The South Korean government is planning to spend 5 trillion won ($4.2 billion) on related projects over the next three years, according to Yonhap.Japan's removal of South Korea from its "white list" of preferred trading partners went into effect last month, in addition to restrictions it placed on exports of key resource materials for smartphones and smartphone displays to South Korean companies in July.In a tit-for-tat move, South Korea also removed Japan from its list of trusted trading partners.Kimura Kan, a professor at Kobe University, wrote in an article published on nippon.com, "Both Seoul and Tokyo keep upping the ante in the expectation that Washington will ultimately settle the dispute in their favor."US foreign affairs experts are worried that the Japan-South Korean dispute will deal a blow to the US alliance with the two countries.Seoul has decided to scrap a 2016 intelligence-sharing pact with Tokyo, saying that the pact did not comport with South Korea's national interest.In Foreign Affairs magazine, Bonnie S. Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and Oriana Skylar Mastro, assistant professor at Georgetown University, wrote that for more than half a century, US power in Asia has rested on the alliance system that Washington built in the years after World War II. "Now, a dispute between Japan and South Korea ... threatens to undo decades of progress."Amid worsening bilateral ties over wartime history, trade and territorial disputes, nationalist sentiment is growing on both sides.On August 31, six South Korean lawmakers visited the islets controlled by Seoul and claimed by Tokyo - known as Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan - in part to protest Japanese curbs on shipments of essential components to South Korea.In response, Hodaka Maruyama, a lawmaker from a Japanese opposition party, wrote in a tweet, "Isn't war the only way to get them back?"In a Cabinet reshuffle on Wednesday, outgoing Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono was shifted to the defense portfolio, a move that the Japan Times said was "seen as reinforcing Tokyo's hard line toward Seoul".caihong@chinadaily.com.cn(China Daily Global 09/12/2019 page1)

                Housing inventories in 100 Chinese cities continue to grow
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - The size of unsold new commercial residential houses in 100 surveyed Chinese cities rose 6 percent year-on-year to 449.27 million square meters by the end of July, an industry report showed.The pressure of destocking housing inventories has been growing as the inventory capacity has maintained a trend of growth for eight consecutive months, according to E-house China R&D Institute.The inventory in first-, second-, third- and fourth-tier cities by the end of July grew by 19.7 percent, 2 percent and 9.1 percent year-on-year, respectively."The inventory pressure will continue to increase with the follow-up new supply of commercial houses", said Yan Yuejin, research director at E-house China R&D Institute.China's property market has remained stable as the government maintains tighter regulations, including curbing home purchases and stricter mortgage policies, to ensure that "house is for living in, not for speculation."

                Pig farmers get support to reduce financial pressures
            </a>
            <p>
                China plans to boost financial support for pig farmers to stabilize production after the spread of African swine fever has reduced herds in the country.Pig farmers who are required to slaughter infected hogs will receive subsidies within three months, half the previous period of six months, according to a statement jointly released by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs on Wednesday.More subsidies and benefits will be issued to large pig-breeding farms and counties to ease their financial pressure. In the meantime, insurance coverage for breeder female swine and pigs fattened for sale will be increased by about 50 percent, the statement said.Authorities also plan to promote artificial insemination technology and subsidize farmers who purchase high-quality pig semen to impregnate female pigs.African swine fever, which is fatal to pigs but not harmful to humans, was first detected in China in August last year. As of early July, 143 outbreaks were recorded in the country and more than 1.16 million pigs were culled to curb virus spread.The latest case was confirmed on August 26 at a farm with 120 live pigs in Yunnan province's Zhaotong city.Wholesale prices of pork in China hovered around 20 yuan ($2.80) per kilogram in the first half of this year and have been rising markedly since June, reaching 25 yuan per kg in early August and surpassing 30 yuan per kg two weeks later, according to the Ministry of Commerce.Data released on Tuesday show that the wholesale pork price last week shot up to a new high of 34.6 yuan per kg, up by nearly 9 percent from the previous week.The sharp price increase in recent months is in line with predictions from agricultural authorities.Tang Ke, chief of the market and economic information department at the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said in mid-July that the spread of African swine fever had slashed the population of hog herds in China and that this would result in strained supply of pork products during the second half of this year, pressuring businesses to raise prices."However, the country's overall supply of meat will remain stable this year thanks to increased production of poultry meat, eggs and dairy products, as well as higher imports of pig products," he said.
