                Malaysia arrests suspects with link to IS
            </p>
            <p>
                KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia arrested 5 men with suspected involvement in terrorist activities, including three linking to the Islamic States(IS), police said Saturday.The three suspected with link to IS were arrested respectively in the Central state of Selangor, northern Kelantan and southern Johor. they were believed to belong to a small cell headed by a 31-year-old mechanic from Indonesia.Police said the ring leader had pledged allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakar al-Baghdadi via Facebook in 2014, and had contact with several Malaysians who joined IS in Syria.The suspect is believed to serve a facilitator to send people from Malaysia and several neighboring countries to join IS in Syria and other terrorist groups in Southeast Asia.The other two suspects in the group arrested were a 59-year-old Malaysian who helped to arrange trip for the would-be terrorists, as well as a 25-year-old Bangladeshi who planned to join the IS, police said.In a series of raids from mid-November, police also arrested a 44-year-old English teacher from Europe, who was believed to have joined al-Qaeda and involved in terrorist activities in Afghanistan and Bosnia. An African college student was also taken into custody.The latest operations by police came after increased security concerns over potential terrorists attacks in the region. Local media reported that the authorities have beefed up security after warnings that several terrorists have sneaked into neighboring Thailand.An international Squash tournament scheduled to be held next week is likely to be postponed or cancelled despite Malaysian government officials and police have brushed off any imminent threats to the country.The authorities have been closely monitoring any potential terrorist activities in the country, detaining more than 130 Malaysians for links with IS so far. But a top Indonesian counter-terrorists official warned recently that Malaysia has become a major transit point in the region for those who want to join the fight in the Middle East.

                Russia seeks int'l cooperation to counter IS
            </a>
            <p>
                MOSCOW -  Russia on Tuesday called for wide international cooperation in the fight against the Islamic State (IS), as Moscow is concerned about the growing influence of the terrorist group. "It is common knowledge that Russia has been expressing concern at the highest level about the growing influence of the so-called Islamic State and how it is expanding territory under its control in Syria and Iraq," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Russia wants to call on everyone to cooperate in this regard, he added. The spokesman also said it is too early to disclose any details about Russia's plans to fight the IS, as Moscow has been waiting for its partners' response. Everything depends on the modality of cooperation, he said, noting that uncoordinated actions of the international community would only deteriorate the situation, particularly in Syria. On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told his U.S. counterpart, John Kerry, that Russia has been seeking a joint front against the IS. During their encounter in Qatar's capital Doha, Lavrov said any U.S. strikes against Syria's government troops would complicate the fight against the group. The IS has been the main danger in Syria and Iraq and this is why Moscow supported the governments of both countries, he said.

                Russia to keep sending arms for Syria's fight against IS: FM
            </a>
            <p>
                Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov attends a meeting with his Mongolian counterpart Lundeg Purevsuren in Moscow, Russia, September 11, 2015.[Photo/Agencies]MOSCOW - Russia will continue to send military equipment to Syria to help it with the fight against the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday."We will continue to deliver this equipment to the Syrian state in order to ensure its defense capabilities to confront the terrorist threat," Lavrov said at a press conference.He added that Russian soldiers and military experts are in Syria to service the military equipment and teach Syrian servicemen to use it.Last week, US Secretary of State John Kerry expressed to Lavrov concerns about reports of alleged Russia's military build-up in Syria, which he said could lead to "an escalation of conflict" in the war-torn country.Dismissing the comments, the top Russian diplomat insisted that the resolution of the crisis should include all forces in the region capable of resisting the IS, including the Syrian army.However, Western countries and their allies insist on the resignation of the country's president, Bashar al-Assad.Lavrov clarified that what Russia supported in Syria was not Assad's regime but Damascus' struggle against the IS."We support the struggle of the Syrian state against the so-called Islamic State, which does not present any Islam and is not a state for that matter," he said.Lavrov said Moscow has always defended collective efforts based on international law, adding that he considered the Syrian army the most efficient and powerful ground force to fight the IS."We have been saying this from the very beginning of operations by the coalition led by our American colleagues, and we are still, better late than never, inviting its members to start cooperating with the Syrian government and the Syrian army," Lavrov said.

                LONDON - British RAF (Royal Air Force) have carried out its second mission of airstrikes in Syria against the IS, local media reported Saturday.Targets in the second mission were oil fields as its first strikes, and the mission involved two Typhoons and two Tornados, said the BBC.British warplanes conducted six strikes against IS-controlled oil fields earlier on Thursday morning, just hours after MPs voted to extend bombing missions to Syria.A vote in the House of Commons following a ten-hour debate on Wednesday evening resulted in a vote of 397 to 223 in favour of Britain bombing targets in Syria.

                Iraqi forces launch offensive to free IS-held Ramadi
            </a>
            <p>
                BAGHDAD - Iraqi security forces on Tuesday launched a major offensive to complete the capture of the city of Ramadi, the capital of western province of Anbar, from Islamic State (IS) militants.The anti-terrorism troops, backed by Iraqi and US-led coalition aircraft, began their advance from several directions into the central part of Ramadi, some 110 km west of Baghdad, the Joint Operations Command said in a brief statement.On Saturday, Iraqi Defense Minister Khalid al-Obeidi said that "Iraqi forces are close to free Ramadi" and pledged that "during the next days, Iraqi forces will free the IS-held territories in the provinces of Anbar, as well as Salahudin and Nineveh."The latest offensive came as the security forces have recently made significant advance in Ta'mim district in southern Ramadi and in several areas on the edges of the city as part of their efforts to flush out IS militants from Ramadi.The troops have been fighting for months to retake control of key cities and towns in Iraq's largest province of Anbar from IS militants, who have seized most of Anbar and tried to advance towards Baghdad.

                Turkey says to keep up military support for Iraq until Mosul is freed from IS
            </a>
            <p>
                ANKARA - Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Tuesday that Turkey's military training and equipment support for Iraq will continue until Mosul is liberated from the Islamic State (IS) militants.Turkey is part of a US-led coalition against the IS and will continue to participate in anti-terrorism operations, said Davutoglu at a meeting of the ruling Justice and Development Party's (AKP) parliamentary group.He underscored that Turkey will continue to stand up against all oppressive forces, including Russia, which bomb civilians, instead of IS terrorists in Syria.Tensions remain high between Turkey and Russia following Turkey's shooting down of a Russian military jet on Nov. 24 over airspace violation. After the incident, Russia imposed a range of unilateral sanctions against Turkey, including a ban on food imports.Russia has been carrying airstrikes in Syria since Sept 30 in a bid to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.The Syria-Turkey relations have hit the bottom since the beginning of the Syrian crisis in 2011. Turkey blames Assad for prolonging the crisis, while Damascus accuses Ankara of facilitating the flow of foreign jihadists into Syria.

                Iraqi army denies bombing civilians at IS-held town in Anbar province
            </a>
            <p>
                BAGHDAD - Iraq's army denied on Thursday that its air fleet targeted civilians in the Islamic State (IS)-held town of al-Qaim near the border with Syria, confirming that the warplanes bombed buildings housing dozens of IS terrorist militants, said the Iraqi military. "It is not correct that some media and political leaders depend on the propaganda of terrorist IS group," the Joint Operations Command (JOC) said in a statement denying media reports and statements by some officials which claimed that dozens of civilians were killed during air strikes against al-Qaim. The statement clarified that Iraqi warplanes carried out an air strike at noon (0900 GMT) against a two-storey building in al-Qaim's suburb of Karabula, housing 25 suicide bombers from different nationalities led by Abu Maysara al-Quqazi. At 12:55 p.m. (0955 GMT) the warplanes carried out another air strike against another two-storey building in al-Qaim housing between 30 to 40 terrorists from various nationalities, the statement said. "The targets have been identified by intelligence information and were confirmed by our sources inside the town," added the statement. The statement pointed out that the town of al-Qaim, 330 km northwest of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, is "under firm control of IS group and news or photos coming from there are scrutinized by the extremist militants in order to serve their criminal propaganda." In the past 24 hours, local and foreign media reports quoted parliament speaker Salim al-Jubouri as saying that air strikes hit a civilian market area in the town of al-Qaim, resulting in the death and injury of dozens of people. Jubouri said he "holds the government responsible for such mistakes," demanding an immediate probe into the attack. In addition, the office of Suhaib al-Rawi, the governor of Anbar province, said that "Rawi condemned the massacre committed against unarmed civilians in the town of al-Qaim, and called for conducting an urgent investigation into the incident to bring the perpetrators of this massacre to justice." Rawi also called on the Iraqi JOC and the US-led coalition to direct their attacks toward precise targets to avoid killing innocent civilians in IS-held areas where IS militants use civilians as human shields, according to the statement. However, Eid al-Karbuli, a spokesman and member of Anbar's provincial council said it was not immediately clear if the air strikes were conducted by Iraqi or international coalition air fleet, demanding a government probe. He said that the air strikes targeted a crowded market, a residential building and another building where seniors were collecting their pensions, killing and wounding over 100 people, including women and children. On Wednesday, provincial security and medical sources said the air strikes targeted IS posts in the town, killing up to 70 people, including many IS militants and wounding over 50 others. Also on Wednesday security reports put the death toll at 12 IS militants and nine civilians, with five militants wounded. Provincial authorities could not give exact casualty figures nor confirm whether Iraqi or international aircraft executed the attacks, as the town has been under IS militant control for over two years. The attacks come as Iraqi security forces backed by the anti-IS international coalition are carrying out a major offensive to drive out IS militants from their final major stronghold in and around Mosul.

                Number of displaced civilians from Iraq's Mosul nearing 100,000: IOM
            </a>

                GENEVA - Altogether 96,864 civilians have fled the Iraqi city of Mosul and its adjacent districts since military operations to reclaim one of the Islamic State (IS)'s last strongholds began in October, according to figures released by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) Thursday. Up from 82,698 a week ago, IOM data showed that 16,100 families have been forced to flee their homes as a result of almost two months of fierce fighting in the northern city. Over three quarters of the displaced, or 76 percent, have ended up in formal camps, with the rest finding shelter in private settings, emergency sites and critical shelter arrangements. According to IOM, Al-Hamdaniya district in Ninewa governorate is hosting most of the internally displaced people (70 percent), followed by Mosul (27 percent) and Hatra (1.5 percent). Supported by Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Iraqi troops kicked off operations on Oct 17 to recapture the city which fell into IS hands in June 2014 after government forces fled, enabling IS militants to take control of parts of Iraq's northern and western regions. International aircraft as well as Iraqi and US-led coalition artillery units are supporting ground operations there. According to reports, more than 5,000 IS militants were initially holed up in Mosul. The UN Refugee Agency UNHCR had warned before operations started that as many as 1.2 million people could be forced to flee their homes.
