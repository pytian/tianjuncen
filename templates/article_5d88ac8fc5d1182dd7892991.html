                Time UN focused on solution providers
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Doing more good better than doing less harm to reduce emissions In a few weeks the UN will con-vene a climate summit in New York. Unfortunately, the event will, again, be problem-focused. While well-intended, the focus on just reducing emissions from companies and countries is an approach we must move beyond in order to ensure a solution agenda for climate change in the future. The current approach by the UN and the World Economic Forum, which is helping it organize the event, is an accounting approach that focuses on commitment from business to reduce emissions. So, when companies, cities and financial institutions attend the UN climate action summit and talk about their contributions, they will focus on their own reductions and how big emitters can reduce their emissions within existing business models, rather than how innovative new products and services lead to reductions in society. This problem approach is not relevant if we are to deliver the dramatic emission reductions that are needed and ensure delivery on the other sustainable development goals. It is time to move beyond a business-as-usual approach where companies and countries only focus on reducing their existing emissions. We need a solution approach driven by companies, cities, countries and accelerators that focuses on accelerated uptake of innovative and disruptive solutions that will bring about significant changes in how we deliver what society needs. Many of the significant emission reductions today have been made possible by companies delivering solutions for nutrition, mobility and buildings in different parts of society, while not simply reducing their own emissions. Companies cite examples such as renewable energy, electric cars, dematerialization and virtual meetings, rather than reducing their own emissions. The Fourth Industrial Revolution (with global connectivity, new materials and new business models, and falling prices for many key technologies) provides ample opportunities that could radically reduce emissions by delivering much smarter solutions for mobility (including virtual mobility), building spaces (including virtual spaces) and nutrition (especially when linked to health and wellbeing). To accelerate emission reductions, companies, governments and the financial sector cannot be driven primarily by cost and risk reductions in existing systems. They must use their capacity to deliver the kind of innovation that delivers the solutions we need. Governments need to be able to set targets that support solution providers. Investors need to be able to identify winners in a low/zerocarbon economy (not just avoid the losers). Cities must assess how much they can help emission reduction. What is needed is a shift in emphasis from "doing things less bad" to "doing good things", but we will also need tools and methods to quantify and compare the impact of different solutions and potential solutions. By embracing a solution perspective, we will also support companies from traditional sectors and move toward sustainable innovation. Mining companies will shift focus from mines to providing materials in society with sustainable recycling. Automotive companies will move from cars to sustainable mobility, including teleworking and virtual meetings. There are positive signs that we are moving in the right direction, but too slowly. A problem focus will slow us down further. A number of studies show that experts now see real leadership among companies that try to deliver what society needs. In the report on the GlobeScan-SustainAbility annual survey, The 2017 Sustainability Leaders, two separate eras were identified. The first leadership era, "do less harm", lasted until 2006. The second era, "sustainable growth", began in 2007. It is therefore understandable that the UN is lagging behind, but it is time for it to move beyond "do less harm". The first era was dominated by big polluters who showed leadership by reporting and focusing on their own pollution, using traditional tools to measure carbon emissions. The UN needs to base future summits on solution frameworks, such as Mission Innovation's 1.5 C Compatibility Framework. Establishing new structures, knowledge and tools that support the move toward a service-based circular economy, where companies can assess their positive contributions, can help accelerate a sustainable transition. Let's hope that the next summit focuses on solutions and welcomes companies, cities and countries with such focus. The fact that Chile, which will host the global climate meeting in December (COP25), will present solution providers with the potential to reduce emissions by more than 150 million metric tons - more than Chile's current emissions - is good reason for hope moving forward. Emerging countries have a special role to play and hopefully we can see new solution initiatives from countries like Chile, India and China, where companies, countries, the finance sector, cities and accelerators commit to help accelerate the uptake of tomorrows' sustainable solutions. Such a solution perspective would also provide muchneeded optimism for the future and turn the existential threat of climate change into our generation's driver of innovation.

                Over 1,000 visitors attended an e-commerce party -- one of the Chile Week activities -- at the Chilean embassy in Beijing recently. The annual Chile Week aims to promote the country's trade, tourism and culture.At the event, visitors sampled the country's wine, fruit, seafood and snacks at food stalls in the yard of the embassy.Luis Schmidt, the Chilean ambassador to China, said that he was glad to showcase Chilean products at the event, and that they are available on major Chinese e-commerce platforms.Visitors at the event also posed for photos with a replica of Moai, Easter Island's iconic statues. And they wore virtual reality equipment to enjoy views of Chile's popular destinations, ranging from deserts to national parks.

                    Farmers, chefs fight to save classic ingredients in Mexican cuisine
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                SAN ANDRES CALPAN, Mexico-Speaking against a backdrop of two soaring, snow-capped volcanoes, Asuncion Diaz explains his fight to save the original poblano chili, one of the most important ingredients in Mexican cuisine, from climate change and other threats.The pristine panorama notwithstanding, Diaz and other producers in Puebla say climate change is stalking this mountainous region in central Mexico and threatening the dark green chili pepper for which it is famous."The chilies get burned by the sun, and if it rains they go bad," says Diaz, a 55-year-old agricultural engineer, taking a break from work on his plantation outside San Andres Calpan, a village nestled in the skirts of the region's twin volcanoes, Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl.Looking up at the first volcano, which locals affectionately call "Popo", fellow farmer Hilda Cruz concurs that the region is heating up."When I was a little girl, Popocatepetl had snow year-round. I was 35 when I saw it without snow for the first time. It made me cry," says Cruz, now 64.The disappearing snow has been caused in part by increased volcanic activity inside Popo's crater. But Mexico's environment ministry says climate change is also wreaking havoc on the region, causing droughts, frost and heavy precipitation.Climate change is just one of the threats facing the ingredients of Mexico's renowned cuisine, which was named an essential part of the world's cultural heritage by UNESCO in 2010.Hybrid seeds, globalization and consumers' demand for immaculate produce are also taking their toll on ingredients like the poblano, which is used in Puebla's luscious mole dish - a spicy, chocolatey sauce - as well as in chiles en nogada, an iconic dish associated with Mexican Independence Day, September 16.Some farmers and chefs now are fighting back to save Mexico's indigenous chilies, beans, tomatoes, gourds, maize and more.They include star chef Ricardo Munoz Zurita, the man behind Azul, one of Mexico City's top restaurants.Every year in August and September, which is chile en nogada season, he regales customers with his lavish take on the traditional dish. Munoz buys his chilies from Diaz's plantation, which meticulously protects its crop from hybrid seeds."They are saving the poblano chili," says the chef.But he is worried about many of the other 31 ingredients in the traditional chile en nogada, which is stuffed with a mixture of ground meat and fruits."The fruits in the stuffing are in serious trouble: panochera apples, San Juan pears, creole peaches, pink pine nuts and fresh walnuts," he says.Agence France-Presse
