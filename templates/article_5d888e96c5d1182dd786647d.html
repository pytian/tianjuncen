                Sixteenth edition of conference to feature new topics and exhibitions
            </a>
            <p>
                The 16th China-ASEAN Expo, running from Sept 21 to 24 in Nanning, capital of the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, will feature new exhibitions compared to previous sessions, said a local official in charge of the event. Wang Lei, secretary-general of the Secretariat of China-ASEAN Expo, said this year's event will feature five new highlights - a new vision, new hot issues, new business opportunities, new influences and new experiences. Focusing on the China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership Vision 2030, a key document approved at the 21st China-ASEAN leaders' meeting held in Singapore in November 2018, a range of high-level exchange activities will be held during this year's China-ASEAN Expo. Wang said industries prioritized by the Vision 2030, such as trade, investment, industrial capacity cooperation, digital technologies, finance, e-commerce and tourism, will also be highlighted at the expo.  Nanning, capital of the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, is the permanent host city of the China-ASEAN Expo. Wu Zhiyong / For China DailyThe new hot issues to be discussed during the expo will include the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor, China (Guangxi) Pilot Free Trade Zone, further opening-up of China's financial sector, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the China-ASEAN Information Harbor. The China (Guangxi) Pilot Free Trade Zone is among the latest free trade zones in the country, as its general plan was approved by the State Council on Aug 26. The 120-square-kilometer zone covering areas in Nanning, Qinzhou and Chongzuo will offer a new driver for Guangxi's opening-up and create new opportunities for business. To present the business opportunities in China and the 10 ASEAN members, there will be more than 80 trade and investment promotion events at the expo, according to Wang. He added that a development report on the China-ASEAN industrial parks will be released at the expo, helping investors identify their priority fields and ideal destinations for investment. Wang noted this year's expo will further extend its influence with several events scheduled for the media industry in China and ASEAN members. With the application of new information and digital technologies, Wang said this year's event is set to offer new experiences to visitors. He said the new venue for exhibitions, the Guangxi Agricultural Convention and Exhibition Center, will be equipped with more digital facilities. New applications to be used at the venue include an online trade and investment matching system and a WeChat app to help exhibitors and visitors to register and search for event information. Wang said this year's event is not limited to the China-ASEAN category, but covers a range of countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative. For instance, Poland is invited to be the special partner of the event. Wang said the host region of Guangxi expects to use this event to display its achievements in its reform and opening-up and opportunities in trade and investment. "We hope the China-ASEAN Expo will become a platform not only for business cooperation, but also for cultural and people-to-people exchanges," Wang said. He predicted the expo will become a more professional and internationalized platform in the near future, as the organizers are drafting a new five-year plan to upgrade the event.

                City opens up economy to the world
            </a>
            <p>
                Jinan, capital of East China's Shandong province, showcased its industrial and economic development to overseas media representatives who took part in the three-day Discover Jinan tour earlier this month. The city of Jinan is developing an open economy and cultivating new engines of growth via its China (Shandong) Pilot Free Trade Zone, which was launched in late August. With an area of over 10,000 square kilometers and a population of 10 million, the GDP of Jinan hit 886.2 billion yuan ($125.4 billion) in 2018 while its per capita GDP reached 101,900 yuan, making it a member of Asia's top 50 cities, according to a report from Royal Society, a research institute in the United Kingdom. Sun Shutao, mayor of Jinan, said the city is working to optimize its regulations and the way it operates amid deepening economic globalization. Policies beneficial to overseas capital such as cutting negative lists, streamlining customs clearance and encouraging foreign ownership of companies in more sectors are on the way to construct an open, equal and efficient business environment, according to Sun. "Jinan will open itself wider to investment, finance, education and medical fields, and allow more foreign-owned or foreign-funded enterprises to operate or invest in more fields so as to provide a more open and inclusive market for companies," Sun said. For example, some 53 medical groups from home and abroad have registered with the Jinan International Center for Medical Sciences. By 2030, the center is expected to have 10 internationally renowned medical institutions and 100 key industrial projects. By that time it is anticipated that the medical center will receive 10 million visits annually, with an annual output value up to 100 billion yuan. As a key transport junction of the Belt and Road Initiative, Jinan is playing a bigger role in global trade in part due to its strengths in intelligent manufacturing, transportation and logistics. The Qilu China Railway Express, operated by Shandong High-Speed Logistics Group, is a major contributor to regional opening-up. The train travels from Shandong province to countries in Europe, Central Asia and Southeast Asia, including Russia, Belarus, Poland, Vietnam and Thailand, according to Liu Ying, deputy general manager of the company. The shorter transportation time, higher level of security and lower logistics cost compared with maritime and air transport have created new opportunities, she said, adding the express has made 88.3 trips per month on average in 2019, up 215.2 percent year-on-year. Trains from Jinan have delivered 102,300 metric tons of goods this year, with a value of $254 million. The category of goods has been expanded from daily necessities, apparel and small goods, to automobiles, home appliances, machinery equipment, laser-engraving machines and auto parts. Nhem Sophal, a senior reporter from Rasmei Kampuchea Daily Newspaper in Cambodia, a participant in the media trip, showed interest in the train. "Before, I never knew that a freight train can go to so many countries," he said. "It may be one of the best ways to increase China's economy because it can save the cost for import and export." Monthian Xayasith, deputy editor-in-chief of Champamai Newspaper in Laos, was impressed by China National Heavy Duty Truck Group, also known as Sinotruk, the nation's largest producer and exporter for heavy duty trucks, based in Jinan. "It is a very big company, which exports the most heavy-duty trucks in China and covers more than 100 countries and regions," he said. The 780-meter-long production line produces 100 vehicles every day, according to the company. Zhang Yanling, vice-president of the international department of the company, said it sold 303,000 vehicles last year, making 65.9 billion yuan in revenue. The Jinan-based Jier Machine-Tool Group, one of the top three CNC punching machine manufacturers in the world, showcased how over 82 years it has managed to innovate and globalize. When first produced, more than 600 of the company's products were the first of their kind in China. Its large CNC punching machine occupies 85 percent of the market share in China and is sold to more 60 countries and regions. It has provided high-end automatic stamping equipment to leading global auto brands such as General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen. Its operations cover 13 countries. Jinan has developed its intelligent manufacturing and high-end equipment industries in recent years, whose revenues surpassed 300 billion yuan in 2018, data from the local government showed.
