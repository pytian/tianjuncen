                Zimbabwe to host Belt and Road Afro-Sino exhibition
            </p>
            <p>
                HARARE -- The National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) will host the Belt and Road Afro-Sino Cultural Exchange program, which begins Saturday and ends next Wednesday.NACZ spokesperson Cathrine Mthombeni said Friday that the concept of the Belt and Road exchange program is an initiative by the Chinese government which also aims to enhance world connectivity while embracing business cooperation.Zimbabwe won the bid to host this prestigious exhibition in China last year.The exchange program incorporates an arts exhibition, art forum and launch of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Chapter of the Afro-Sino Cultural Exchange Association and will run under the theme: South Meeting the East: A Tale of Two Communities.The exhibition, which aims to create an opportunity for the artists from both the South and the East to network, has 120 artworks from China, Kenya, Seychelles, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe, making it the largest exhibition in Zimbabwe in recent times.

                Realize industrialization with China's help
            </a>
            <p>
                Should the continent look to Asian friend's 'regional' model and adapt this approach? As a result of an emphasis on industrialization as the potential key driver of Africa's development at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Johannesburg Summit in 2015, it has become a major area of focus for policymakers, implementers and thought leaders in Africa. There is great hope that, in partnership with China, the African continent will finally realize its long-delayed industrial revolution. But the knotty question that Africans should ask themselves is this: Should the push for industrialization take a continental, regional or national trajectory? While it is all fine for plans to be strategized and planned at the supra-continental level - as implied in the Agenda 2063 aspirations - the reality is that Africa's vastness and diversity is a bottleneck. Seamless implementation of industrialization projects is hampered by geographical, political, policy and legal variances from one country to another. The alternative would be to implement industrial projects country-by-country. In other words, national industrial projects can be the building blocks for a continental industrial revolution. This seemingly perfect remedy to grand African industrialization projects has its drawbacks. For instance, it is doubtful that industrialization projects would take off in countries beset by policy and political challenges unless nudged by others outside the continent. But many African countries are small by economic, geographic and population size, which reduces the appetite of international investors to invest in certain industrial projects in these countries. Additionally, it is imponderable that some African countries would agree to wait for foreign investors, such as China, to implement industrial projects in other countries as they await their turn. A two-pronged challenge emerges from the foregoing. On the one hand, rolling out cross-border industrialization projects is not feasible. On the other, national level industrial projects suffer from factors such as economies of scale. Therefore, a middle ground favoring a continent wide approach, mingled and melded with national strong points, is called for. Fortunately, African countries are organized in regional blocs, which can serve as the midway strategy for attracting foreign investment in the industrial sector. The regional economic communities on the continent can be leveraged to overcome the problems associated with the binary of continental vastness and the narrowness of national perspectives. Indeed, many of the natural resources that form the base for Africa's industrialization cut across countries in specific regions - oil and gas in eastern and western Africa, and metals, such as copper, in southern Africa, for instance. A recent case in point in using regional economic relationships as building blocks for industrialization was a topic at a policy seminar of the Southern Africa Development Community, with a view toward its collaboration with China. Held in Johannesburg in mid-April, the conference was hosted by the University of Johannesburg's Confucius Institute and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, in collaboration with Oxfam International's Africa-China Dialogue Platform based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The main objective of the seminar was to examine relations between China and southern Africa in the context of the SADC Industrialization Policy (2012), the SADC Industrialization Strategy and Roadmap (2015) and the Revised Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (2015-20). The seminar reflected on the background and trajectory of the relationship between China and the SADC's 15 member states in promoting industrialization in the region. Of particular interest was the dimension of trade and investment exchanges in the industrialization plans. The seminar also explored how China can better support, promote and contribute to industrialization in southern Africa in line with China's commitments at the FOCAC 2015 and the G20 Summit, held in Hangzhou, China, in September. Interestingly, the China-SADC industrialization dialogue has precedent. Tanzania and Zambia have benefitted from Chinese industrial investment since the 1960s. The Tazara railway was built to help Zambia's copper get to international markets. That the industrial investment across minerals and agriculture has performed below par, or summarily collapsed, should be a major consideration in charting region wide industrial plans. The regional blocs' approaches to Africa's industrialization can also benefit from China's own industrialization experience. China is a vast country and indeed a subcontinent. If you visit eastern and southern China, you will see hundreds of factories humming along as they produce goods for world markets. These Chinese factories stand as living testimony to the foresight and political leadership of Chinese leaders. Out of necessity, they prioritized eastern and southern provinces of the country as the pioneer industrial bases, understanding that attempting to industrialize the whole country at once would scatter resources too widely and end up in failure. Can Africa study the Chinese "regional" model and adapt it to the African regional bloc-led approach to industrialization?

                Peace urged for Zimbabwe amid crisis
            </a>
            <p>
                HARARE, Zimbabwe - Calm and peace have been urged for the country where the military announced on Wednesday that it has taken control of all government institutions. Zimbabwe's 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe and his wife have since early Wednesday been reportedly put under house arrest. Military leaders said on state TV that they were not taking over the government, but "targeting criminals around" Mugabe, and that Mugabe and his family are safe and their security is guaranteed. Armored carriers cordoned off the presidential seat of power and the parliament building in the capital, and unconfirmed reports said a number of ministers and some top officials of the ruling ZANU-PF party were arrested. Political analysts stressed the military's continued respect for Mugabe and his role in Zimbabwe's revolution that won it independence from Britain in 1980 can likely lead to a peaceful settlement. The unfolding situation in Zimbabwe poses serious political uncertainty that may impact on the region, raising widespread concerns. Countries and regional blocs are closely watching the situation. The Southern African Development Community has repeated the call for calm, restraint and peace in Zimbabwe, and called an urgent foreign ministers meeting to be held on Thursday to discuss the situation there. In a statement, Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairman of African Union Commission, said: "I urged all stakeholders to address the current situation in accordance with the Constitution of Zimbabwe." Special envoys South African President Jacob Zuma has called for a peaceful solution. Zuma, in his capacity as the SADC chair, also said he was sending special envoys to meet with Mugabe and Zimbabwe's military leaders. "We are monitoring this situation very closely," British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Wednesday. "At the moment it's very fluid and it's hard to say exactly how this will turn out. Everybody wants to see a stable and successful Zimbabwe. We are appealing for everyone to refrain from violence," he said. China's Foreign Ministry said China hopes Zimbabwe's relevant parties can properly handle the internal affairs, noting that maintaining peace, stability and development in Zimbabwe conforms to the fundamental interests of the country and its neighboring regions, and is also the common aspiration of the international community. In a statement, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari also appealed for calm, peace and respect for the Constitution in Zimbabwe. Namibia voiced concerns about the political uncertainty in Zimbabwe. "As neighbors, member states of SADC and the African Union, Namibia and Zimbabwe share a common destiny and common aspirations for peace, economic prosperity and democracy for our countries and people," Namibian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of International Relations Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah said in a statement. Zambian President Edgar Lungu, currently on a state visit to Egypt, said in a statement released by his spokesperson: "I have encouraged all parties in Zimbabwe to work toward a quick and peaceful resolution to the impasse and to uphold human rights." Embassies of countries including the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, Spain, and Canada have advised citizens to take precautions due to the military activities and intense situation in Harare. Tanaka Aggrey Chitsa, a political analyst based in Harare, said the situation in Zimbabwe is still unpredictable. Since Mugabe is still the head of state and commander in chief of the military, he said, adding that the unraveling of the situation over the next few days should be closely watched. Dr David Monyae, a policy analyst at the University of Johannesburg, said he believes that investments of Chinese and other foreign interests in Zimbabwe won't be threatened by the military.

                Chinese national liquor Moutai eyes Southern African market
            </a>
            <p>
                Zhang said this during a welcoming dinner for the visiting Moutai delegation held in the capital Windhoek Monday.Executives from the Moutai Group are in Namibia on a fact-finding mission, led by general manager Li Baofang.The ambassador said he was very excited to host a delegation from the Moutai group, a leading liquour maker from China with annual revenues in excess of 7.5 billion U.S. dollars."They (Moutai) would like to set up a distribution network in Africa through Namibia which I think should be encouraged by the ministry of trade in Namibia because this would result in more tax revenue being generated for the Government and job opportunities being created for local people. We encourage these companies to invest in Namibia and to expand their business cooperation with Namibia," Ambassador Zhang said.Namibia's Industrialization, Trade and SME Development Minister, Immanuel Ngatjizeko, said Moutai was welcome to set up shop in the country."We have a conducive environment for their business to grow and for them to diversify their business into other areas other than liquor. They are welcome," Ngatjizeko told Xinhua.The trip to Namibia by the Moutai executives follows a similar trip to Cape Town, South Africa last week.Moutai, which predominately thrives on Chinese domestic sales, is looking at expanding its distribution network across Africa.The businesses delegation is expected to fly out to Mozambique after the Namibian leg of their trip.

                DR Congo elections put back because of violence
            </a>
            <p>
                 KINSHASA - Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday announced that key elections due to take place nationwide on Dec 30 would be postponed to March in two regions troubled by violence.But those delays will not affect the timetable for the presidential ballot, which is being held alongside legislative and provincial elections, the national election commission CENI announced."The elections in the Beni region and the cities of Beni and Butembo in North Kivu province as well as Yumbi in the (southwest) Mai-Ndombe province initially scheduled for December 30 will now be held in March," according to CENI.The "final results" of the presidential vote will still be published on Jan 15, and the next president will be sworn in on Jan 18.CENI did not explain how this would dovetail with the outcome of the vote in the troubled regions, which would take place much later.Roughly 3 percent of about 40 million registered voters will be affected by the delay.The elections were due to have been held on Dec 23, climaxing a long period of bloodstained turbulence.But CENI ordered a weeklong postponement, blaming a warehouse fire that destroyed voting machines and ballot papers earmarked for Kinshasa.Meanwhile, five African heads of state on Wednesday voiced "strong concern over acts of violence" during the presidential campaign of the DRC.Clashes in some locations are enough "to compromise voter's peace of mind", added a statement issued at the end of a one-day summit held in the neighboring Republic of Congo.A DRC representative was not present, but summit leaders decided that a delegation of foreign ministers would present "their conclusions" to DRC President Joseph Kabila on Thursday.On Wednesday, eight nations in southern and Central Africa mulled the situation in DRC, a country that has been a regional battleground twice in the last quarter-century.The mini-summit was held in Brazzaville, four days before problem-strewn elections across the border.African leaders focused on "the electoral process in the DRC", said Cyprien Sylvestre Mamina, secretary-general for foreign affairs in the Republic of Congo.The meeting brought together many members of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and International Conference of the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR).Those attending were Angola, Botswana, Republic of Congo, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Uganda and Zambia.Five countries were represented by their presidents, while the others sent foreign ministers or lower-level officials.The DRC elections are to choose a successor to President Joseph Kabila, in charge of the volatile mineral-rich country for nearly 18 years.Agence France-Presse

                Calls for national dialogue increase in Zimbabwe
            </a>
            <p>
                Many Zimbabweans say that broad national dialogue is required immediately to mend deteriorating political conditions in the country.During the past few weeks, the country has plunged into civil unrest, with a restive population protesting government measures to increase the price of fuel and what they consider the dire economic conditions prevailing in the country.Calls for national dialogue have been increasing across social, religious and political divides. ,Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa has led from the front, inviting leaders of all political parties, religious and civil leaders to set aside any differences and come together to work for the good of the country. His invite comes in the aftermath of violent civil protests that have claimed dozens of lives and maimed scores of people."What unites us is stronger than what could ever divide us. Let's begin a national dialogue. Let's put the economy first. Let's put the people first," Mnangagwa said recently on his Twitter account.The main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic for Change (MDC) – Alliance, blamed by government as instigators of the civil unrest, have equally called for talks with the ruling ZANU PF government.MDC president Nelson Chamisa however has accused president Mnangagwa of lacking the political commitment to drive the talks.Zimbabwe is undergoing a difficult economic period, punctuated by rising inflation estimated at 42 percent, cash and commodity shortages – particularly fuel and cooking oil – along with acute shortages of foreign currency, runaway government expenditure, and huge debts owed to international creditors.Through the Transitional Stabilisation Plan, the current national economic blueprint, finance minister Mthuli Ncube has announced a series of austerity and cost containment measures aimed at restoring fiscal discipline, reducing a gaping budget deficit, and reining in inflation, along with a number of tax measures to shore up government coffers.Heal Zimbabwe, a peace-building civil society organization, said an urgent, citizen-driven national dialogue is needed to arrest the "dire economic situation and looming political turmoil that has put the country on the verge of civil unrest"."The proposed national dialogue must be preceded by an all-stakeholder summit mediated by regional guarantors including the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union (AU)," the organization said in a communique to journalists this week. "All Zimbabweans from across the political divide, including women, youths, children and people living with disabilities, must drive the process and collectively define the current crisis facing the country and how they would want it addressed."United Refineries CEO Busisa Moyo said the talks must be broad-based, inclusive, candid but respectful, constructive, and put the country first."The economy is a priority, and personalities must come second. There is also need for a change of mindset," he said.Brains Muchemwa, an economist based in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, said it was not good for the country to beg for financial bailouts from everyone, instead suggesting that Zimbabwe must manage its public finances properly, save and invest, as well as create the right environment to promote foreign direct investment into the country.Political analyst Ibbo Mandaza has said that talks must begin with a resolute response from civic society and a strategy to stop the violence, killings and security forces clampdown, which has seen many citizens, including members of opposition political parties, languish in detention or hospitals.Last week in an address to the media, heads of civil society organizations added their voice to the growing calls for talks, with various state and non-state actors arguing that national dialogue is critical in finding a lasting solution to the socioeconomic and political crises confronting Zimbabwe.These calls however been met with no real action on the ground.

                SADC attacks countries undermining Venezuela's Maduro

                WINDHOEK - Hage Geingob, president of Namibia and chairperson of Southern African Development Community (SADC), on Sunday attacked the countries that sought to interfere in the affairs and sovereignty of the Republic of Venezuela.A statement released by the presidency on Sunday said countries had sought to undermine a democratically elected government of Venezuela."In particular, these countries have sought to undermine a democratically elected government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela led by president Nicolas Maduro Moros by proclaiming Juan Guaido Marquez as Interim-President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela," the statement said."SADC condemns such violations of the principles of international law, especially, the respect for sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states," he said.He further noted that the people of the Republic of Venezuela had expressed their political choices through parliamentary elections and presidential elections held in December 2015 and May 2018 respectively and "urges the international community and all stakeholders to respect the outcomes of these elections."

                Kenya renews calls for closing global Ivory markets
            </a>
            <p>
                Ivory markets in the European Union and Japan are fueling the international market for ivory, said a senior Kenyan government official on Wednesday, as the east African government increased its calls for the closing of those markets.The markets continue to undermine global conservation efforts, said Najib Balala, the cabinet secretary for Tourism and Wildlife. "Poaching is the biggest threat to the livelihoods of more than a million Kenyans who are directly employed in the industry," he said.Balala made his comments at his office in Nairobi where he had hosted Gloria Guevara, CEO and president of the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC). She releaseda survey by the council that showed Kenya's travel and tourism sector was responsible for 1.1 million jobs, which is 8.3 percent of total employment in the country.The sector's growth had exceeded global and regional levels in 2018, she said. It grew by 5.6 percent, contributing $7.9 billion, which is 8.8 percent to Kenya's GDP. This rate of growth was faster that the global average of 3.9 percent and the Sub-Saharan Africa average of 3.3 percent.The EU is the world's major exporter of legal ivory and exported 1,258 tusks in 2014 and 2015 alone, more than the previous eight years combined, according to a US-based global advocacy group Avaaz. Similarly, Japan supports a booming domestic market, with up to $27 million worth of ivory put up for sale in the last 10 years, according to the African Wildlife Foundation."The continued legalizing of these markets is pushing up demand for ivory, further fuelling Africa's elephant crisis," said Balala.He said that the move to close those markets had a significant impact to poaching. Balala commended the Chinese government's decisive move to shut down its legal markets and said the poaching incidences in Kenya have consequently decreased. Balala said that Kenya lost 38 elephants in 2018 and 68 elephants in the previous year."But if you look at the numbers in 2016, they were very high. Our success can also be attributed to increased investments in anti-poaching programs by the government," he said.Balala reaffirmed Kenya's stand that wildlife was more valuable when alive. The east African country burned 100 tons of ivory in 2016 to rally the global community behind protecting the endangered animals."The moment a country sells its stockpile, it is inadvertently fueling illegal trade of ivory. That is why we will be appealing to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITIES) to upgrade African elephants from Appendix II to I in the list of endangered species," he said.Kenya plans to meet other countries, among them the US, during the ongoing fourth session of the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi and lobby them to support its bid to have all African elephants listed in Appendix I of CITES.Currently, all African elephants are included in Appendix I, except for the populations in Southern African Development Community (SADC), which are in Appendix II.Kenya fears that the EU will back SADC in retaining them in this category during the forthcoming 18th meeting of CITES, scheduled to be held in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in May. "This means that the countries can sell their ivory stock pile through the permit system allowed by CITES. This would be a signal that would fuel poaching," said the CS.Nevertheless, he agreed that the country needed a double pronged approach, which would not only increase its anti-poaching campaign but also strengthen the management of parks to reduce human-wildlife conflict.Contact the writer at Lucymorangi@chinadaily.com.cn

                SADC accelerates industrialization strategy
            </a>
            <p>
                Leaders of the Southern African Development Community have agreed to accelerate the implementation of industrialization strategy in effort to promote regional development.In the 39th summit of the trade bloc held from Aug 17-18 in Tanzania's capital Dar es Salaam, leaders from the 16 African countries that make up the community noted with great concern the slow growth of intra-SADC trade levels.They noted the region continues to export unprocessed raw material to the rest of the world, thereby forfeiting potential benefits of resource endowments.Member states were also called upon to implement comprehensive multi-year response plans to tackle recurrent droughts and food insecurity to boost agricultural production.John Magufuli, the president of Tanzania and the chairperson of SADC, said member states had agreed to improve the business environment including stepping up actions against red tape in decision-making, cross-border trade barriers and corruption."We are focused on growing economies and improving the livelihood of our people," he said.Magufuli said heads of state had directed the SADC secretariat to expedite the operationalization of the community's disaster preparedness and response mechanism as part of the regional measures to respond to climate change.Owing to natural disasters, climate change and other global challenges, he said, last year the bloc recorded an average Gross Domestic Product growth of 3.1 percent instead of the projected growth of 7 percent.Magufuli encouraged countries to invest in industrialization in order to boost trade and grow their economies.Titled "A conducive environment for inclusive and sustainable industrial development, increased intra-regional trade and job creation", the summit witnessed the signing of four protocols.They included a protocol on industry, aimed at promoting the development of a diversified, innovative and globally competitive industrial base; amendment of the protocol on extradition of suspects and legal assistance in crime.They also approved the protocol on inter-state transfer of sentenced offenders, to allow for the transfer of sentenced offenders to serve their sentences in their home countries.The leaders also agreed to address rising security threats in the region including terrorist activities and transnational organized crime. Member states were thus urged to prioritize the implementation of the SADC Regional Counter-Terrorism Strategy.They agreed to collaborate with the international conference of the Great Lakes Region, and consolidate efforts toward security stabilization in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Great Lakes Region.This is in addition to addressing maritime security threats such as piracy, maritime terrorism, drug trafficking, and illegal carrying and trafficking of weapons and ammunition.Magufuli also called on the international community to lift the sanctions against Zimbabwe to facilitate the country's socioeconomic recovery.He said SADC member states agreed to continue negotiating with the international community through their embassies and other organizations to lift the sanctions, which he said had not only affected Zimbabwe but also the entire region.To express their solidarity with Zimbabwe, the summit declared Oct 25, 2019 as the date on which SADC member states can collectively voice their disapproval of the sanctions through various activities and platforms until the sanctions are lifted.

                SADC adopts Kiswahili as 4th working language
            </a>
            <p>
                The Southern Africa Development Community, or SADC, has adopted Kiswahili as its fourth official language. Other SADC official languages are English, Portuguese and French.The decision was announced at a recent summit of 16 southern African heads of state in Tanzania. Kiswahili is already an official language in Tanzania, Kenya and Rwanda and of the African Union. It's also used in some parts of central and southern Africa.John Magufuli, chairman of SADC, made his speech in Kiswahili at the summit, appealing to the heads of state to fast-track the adoption of the language.According to a summit communique, the leaders approved Kiswahili as the fourth SADC official working language, in recognition of the contribution of the former Tanzanian President Julius Kambarage Nyerere's role in the liberation struggle of southern Africa.The Pan South African Language Board, which promotes multilingualism, said the inclusion of Kiswahili will help prevent the marginalization of African languages."Africa is the only continent where the majority of children start school using a foreign language. Across Africa, the idea persists that the international languages of wider communication including Arabic, English, French, Portuguese and Spanish are the only means for upward economic mobility," a statement from the board read.According to the SADC leaders, Kiswahili will be adopted at the level of council and summit, first as a language for oral communication, before eventually being adopted for written official communication within the bloc.Kiswahili thus becomes the first indigenous language to be used by the bloc as an official language at the interstate level, even as the world celebrates 2019 as the international year of indigenous languages.David Maahlamela, chairman of the Pan South African Language Board, said Kiswahili will help safeguard integrative multilingualism inclusive of indigenous languages."This milestone achievement toward recognition and elevation of indigenous African languages across the SADC region forms part of the greater effort in ensuring development, usage and intellectualization of our heritage languages," he said.Maahlamela said the board's vision is that indigenous languages will become commonplace at provincial, national, regional and continental levels."Kiswahili is inevitably well-positioned to integrate the SADC region, thus we fully support this long overdue resolution," he said.
