                Britain to leave EU on Oct 31 no matter what: Brexit minister
            </p>
            <p>
                NICOSIA - Britain will definitely leave the European Union on Oct 31, no matter what, visiting British Secretary of State for Brexit Stephen Barclay said here Wednesday.After meeting with Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades, Barclay was asked if Britain would be leaving the EU on Oct 31 without an agreement, and Barclay said "yes, we will."Barkley said that he was "grateful to the president for the very strong bilateral relationship that we have.""He has a deep understanding of the issues around Brexit and very much shares the prime minister's desire for a deal ... It was surely appreciated to get the president's engagement on this issue because both sides want to get a deal, which is in the interest of both sides, and that is what we are working for," Barclay said.Barkley is on his visit to Cyprus to discuss Brexit issues. A spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the EU in London told the Cyprus News Agency that the visit was part of the British government's engagement with EU member states, "as the UK seeks to reach a deal with the backstop removed."Britain has two bases on the island, which will have the status of foreign territory with boundaries with Cypriot soil.However, the two countries have reached a private agreement that the status of the base areas will not change and that Cypriots living or working within the boundaries of the bases will not be adversely affected in their everyday life after a hard Brexit.Likewise, Britain guaranteed that Cypriots living in Britain will not be affected and Cyprus guaranteed that about 80,000 Britons living on the island will not have their everyday life disrupted."We have made an unequivocal guarantee to the 30,000 Cypriot nationals living and working in the UK. They will have absolute legal certainty of the rights to work, study and access benefits and services on the same basis as now under any Brexit scenario," the Brexit ministry spokesman said.He added that Barclay will be stepping up his engagement with Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, over the coming days, following their meeting in Luxembourg on Monday, which he described as constructive.

                New vision would advance China-US ties, benefit world
            </a>
            <p>
                Leading voices at event in New York discuss ways for two countries to resolve differencesWith rapid changes in the world, the old era of Sino-US relations is over, and there's no going back. The two countries should therefore work to create a better future and a new vision for the world.That is a point Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai made at the Vision China event, hosted by China Daily and Bank of China, on Tuesday in New York City. At the event, leading voices on China-US relations discussed how the two countries should resolve their differences and advance their ties.The event, "China-US Relations: 40 Years & Beyond", took place shortly before Beijing and Washington are to hold another round of high-level talks in Washington in early October to address their outstanding trade disputes. Twelve such meetings since February 2018 failed to produce a deal.In his keynote speech, Cui said: "We have learned from the past four decades that cooperation is the only right option for us. It is something we should always uphold."The envoy said that some in the US blame a rising China, which they claim will displace the US to become the world's new hegemon."But I do not see the onus on the side of China. It is how America perceives China that should be held to account."Cui's points were echoed by Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs."We have a lot of problems in the United States. Unfortunately for us, it is very convenient for us - always when we have problems - to blame them on somebody else," said the former chief economist at Morgan Stanley and chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia."We did that with the Japanese 30 years ago. We are doing it again with China," Roach said.Speaking at the opening of the event, Zhou Shuchun, China Daily's publisher and editor-in-chief, highlighted the importance of the two nations proceeding based on what they have achieved over recent decades."If we could break the ice 40 years ago when there were virtually no exchanges and interaction, then in today's world of interdependence, with the two countries being each other's biggest trade partner and main investor, owning very much a piece of each other, there is absolutely no reason for the future to be going against the tracks of history, and the talk of 'decoupling' is sheer nonsense," Zhou said.Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council, recalled the history of China-US business relations.He discussed the first major rebellion of Britain's North American colonies in 1773, virtually the spark that created the United States of America, in which patriots at the Boston Tea Party, disguised as Native Americans, threw tea imported from Fujian province into Boston Harbor to protest a new tax that the British colonial government had placed on the tea.The uprising was referenced in the US Declaration of Independence, its founding document, in which Thomas Jefferson laid out the formal claims for independence when he complained that England's King George III had illegally cut off trade with all parts of the world and "imposed tariffs without our consent", according to Allen."This is interesting and has a relevance even today," he said.Talking about the current trade tensions between China and the US, Allen said he hoped the leaders of the two countries will be inspired by the friendship, cooperation and mutual benefit that have characterized the bilateral relationship in the past."We have a glorious history. We have a mutual responsibility to ensure that the success of the past continues into the future," he said.Maurice Greenberg, chairman of Starr Cos, said he believes it's time for both countries to have a trade agreement."If both sides can't do it, both sides will suffer. I'm convinced of that," said Greenberg, also vice-chairman of the National Committee on United States-China Relations.Kenneth Quinn, president of The World Food Prize Foundation, recalled the 2012 visit by then Vice-President Xi Jinping to Muscatine, Iowa, where Xi talked about and quoted US writer Mark Twain, and about seeing the sun over the Mississippi River."To have someone who is a head of state, but of another country, speak about my country that way, was so impactful, so dramatic. It left a very, very deep impression on me," said Quinn, former US ambassador to Cambodia.Xu Chen, president and CEO of Bank of China USA, said that while his bank acts on corporate social responsibility by engaging in poverty relief projects in China and helping low-income local communities and small businesses in the US, it's important for countries to commit to the social responsibilities of statehood."If the US is willing to work together with China for mutual benefits and shoulder ... (social responsibilities of statehood) on the world stage, I believe that China will gladly work hand-in-hand with the US and jointly promote a more peaceful, stable and prosperous global community," Xu said.Speakers at the event also highlighted the role that people-to-people exchanges played in boosting the relations between the two countries.Connie Sweeris, a player behind the ice-breaking "ping-pong diplomacy" of the 1970s, encouraged people to play a part in the relationship, just like she did with sports and cultural exchanges."We need to be ambassadors for peace," Sweeris said.The event also featured a panel discussion on Chinese companies' investment in the US, featuring Xiao Yuqiang, chairman of the US Management Committee of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China; Vivek K. Sarin, interim secretary of the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development; and Jeff Liu, president and CEO of Fuyao Group North America. The discussion was moderated by Ji Tao, editor-in-chief and president of China Daily USA.The New York event at the Asia Society was hosted by China Daily and Bank of China. It was the eighth Vision China since it was launched in 2018. Each has featured global opinion leaders invited to discuss Chinese topics of international significance.huanxinzhao@chinadailyusa.comMaurice Greenberg, chairman of Starr Companies, raises a question to Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai during the Q&A session at the Vision China event on Tuesday.Feng Yongbin/china Daily(China Daily Global 09/19/2019 page1)

                The Sino-British Joint Declaration does not have any paragraph which sets out the implementation of "dual universal suffrage".Paragraph 3(4) of the Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that "the chief executive (of the HKSAR Government) will be appointed by the Central People's Government on the basis of the results of elections or consultations to be held locally". Annex I of the Joint Declaration stipulates that "the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be constituted by elections". Both are not related to the implementation of "dual universal suffrage".

                Government clarifies inaccurate claim on social media
            </a>
            <p>
                In response to an organisation's claim on a social media platform that "the fact that universal suffrage has yet been implemented in Hong Kong is a serious violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration", a spokesman for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government clarified today that the Sino-British Joint Declaration does not have any paragraph which sets out the implementation of "dual universal suffrage".Paragraph 3(4) of the Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that "the chief executive (of the HKSAR Government) will be appointed by the Central People's Government on the basis of the results of elections or consultations to be held locally". Annex I of the Joint Declaration stipulates that "the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be constituted by elections". Both are not related to the implementation of "dual universal suffrage".The spokesman reiterated that universal suffrage of "one person, one vote" for selecting the Chief Executive and electing all members of the Legislative Council is enshrined as an ultimate aim in the Basic Law of the HKSAR of the People's Republic of China. To achieve this aim, there is a need to conduct dialogues to narrow differences with a view to attaining a consensus agreeable to all sides. The HKSAR government will assess the situation carefully and take forward constitutional development in accordance with the Basic Law and the relevant Interpretation and Decisions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

                EU executive says Britain sent in 'papers' with Brexit ideas
            </a>
            <p>
                BRUSSELS - Britain has submitted some proposals in writing of how it would like the stalled Brexit deal to be amended, a spokeswoman for the European Union's executive Commission said on Thursday, confirming an earlier Reuters report."We have received documents from the UK and on this basis we will have technical discussion today and tomorrow on some aspects of customs, manufactured goods and sanitary and phytosanitary rules," said Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva.She added that the EU and British Brexit negotiators, Michel Barnier and Stephen Barclay, will also discuss Brexit in Brussels on Friday."These are papers for now. Until we have looked at them in detail, I will not characterise them beyond being a paper," Andreeva said.The UK side said it had shared with Brussels "technical non-papers which reflect the ideas the UK has been putting forward," without going into further detail. "We will table formal written solutions when we are ready," a British government spokeswoman said.Andreeva added that there was no formal deadline for Britain to submit formal proposals but stressed that every day counted now as the Brexit date nears on Oct 31. Reuters
