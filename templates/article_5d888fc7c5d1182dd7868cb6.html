                The government of Liberia on July 19 signed a $30 million financial agreement for International Development Association (IDA) credit.Represented by Finance and Development Planning Minister Samuel D. Tweah Jr., and World Bank Liberia Country Director Pierre Laporte, the agreement intends to scale-up the rehabilitation and extension of Monrovia's piped water system.Laporte said that additional financing will also be used to extend the network of households and kiosks, and will increase access to clean water for more people.He indicated that the current target of 140,000 people will gain access to improved water supply, and the project will reduce water losses in the network so that more water will become available for the people.Laporte added that the financing will also contribute to improved human capital by reducing the current rate of infant mortality, malnutrition, and growth limitations which impair cognitive functions and physical development in children.He assured the Liberian Government of the bank's continued support which is aimed at fighting poverty and improving shared prosperity, adding that the Pro Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development is closely aligned with the bank's country partnership framework.Finance and Development Planning Minister Samuel D.

                    State-owned enterprises construct infrastructure to improve local lives

                Cooperation between China and Africa has become deeper as State-owned enterprises continue to bring Chinese technologies, capital and management experiences to Africa, experts said. Over the last several decades, China's State-owned companies have developed well in the African continent. Their revenue has grown gradually, which in turn helps increase the income of local people and the country's GDP. Their business scope has expanded to a larger scope - from infrastructural construction to energy, industrial manufacturing, transportation and finance, according to Liu Xingguo, a researcher from the China Enterprise Confederation, who made the comments to Xinhua News Agency. China Railway Construction Corp, for example, has operated in Africa for about 50 years. It built railways up to 11,000 kilometers in Nigeria, Angola and Ethiopia, as well as 4,800-km-long highways, including one expressway in Algeria. The company also built residential houses, ports and hospitals there, according to Zhuang Shangbiao, president of the company, adding that the proportion of local workers in African projects remains at 90 percent. The railway that connects Mombasa with Nairobi in Kenya is another major China-invested project. CRRC Corp not only constructed but also provided management methods to the railway. China Railway Signal and Communication Corp built its communications, signal and information parts. China Communications Construction provided operation and maintenance services. Shu Yinbiao, former chairman of State Grid Corp of China, once said that the company has 120 projects in Africa and joined energy infrastructural construction in 25 African countries, with a total contract amount up to $4.5 billion, according to a Xinhua report in September. He added Africa has advantages in developing solar power, wind power and hydropower. "After the improvement of power grids, the clean energy can meet the demand for electricity across the continent." In the past, State-owned enterprises mainly invested in infrastructural projects in Africa. Now, they transform from merely investing to helping in the sustainable development of the economy in African countries. The trend also conforms to the significant progress of the development of local technologies and economy, according to Liu. Hunan Construction Engineering Group built the first modern wrestling arena in Senegal, with an area of 18,000 square meters and can host an audience of 20,000. It also built a hydropower station in Sierra Leone and a rural primary school in Liberia. Ye Xinping, Party secretary and chairman of the company, said the economic benefit of overseas programs should go hand in hand with social benefit. The company provided one-on-one guidance to African technicians and workers. It also donated living materials and cash to families in economic difficulty.  The wrestling arena in Senegal built by the Hunan Construction Engineering Group can host an audience of 20,000.

                Private companies in China are focusing more on cooperation with Africa and hope to achieve win-win results, experts said. Their role in promoting African development and Sino-African friendships has grown in recent years and can be seen in diverse fields. Huajian Group, based in South China's Guangdong province, has built nine modern shoemaking production lines in Ethiopia that can make and export 3 million pairs of women's shoes annually. Huajian's branch in the country has created 7,500 jobs locally. King Deer, which processes cashmere, from the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, has set up five factories in Madagascar and invested $35 million. It employs nearly 6,300 local people. In the financial cooperation field, the China-Africa Development Fund based in Beijing has invested more than $4 billion in Africa and promoted Chinese companies and banks to invest and loan $17 billion. They have invested in 88 projects in 37 African countries, involving fields such as infrastructure, processing and manufacturing, benefited more than 1 million local people. The fund has promoted Chinese well-developed industries such as automobiles, electric appliances, machinery and cement to invest in Africa. Backed by the fund, about 11,000 medium and heavy trucks, 300,000 air conditioners, 450,000 refrigerators, 560,000 televisions and 1.6 million metric tons of cement produced by Chinese companies enter the African market annually. As for trade and investment help, Qingjian Group based in Qingdao in East China has established exhibition and sales centers for Chinese commodities in countries such as Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire. It wants to develop Qingdao's overseas merchandising flagship stores and has signed cooperation agreements with companies including Tsingtao Brewery. The private companies' development in Africa has promoted industrialization and urbanization and helped local young people to improve their skills, insiders said. Companies in Hunan have also played a role. Among them is Broad Homes Industrial International, based in Changsha. It is promoting construction of a real estate project in Rwanda with local governments, construction and development companies as well as thirdparty financial institutions. Rwanda became a main destination for Broad Homes to enter the African market and take part in the Belt and Road Initiative. Based on local needs, the company formulated an integrated solution involving finance, design, construction, production, development and sales for the real estate project. Liu Dong, director of operations at Broad Homes, said fabrication technologies and products are an innovation for the design standards and even the whole construction industry in Africa. He added it can not only reduce the construction duration, but also solve the problem of lack in labor. Contact the writers at songmengxing@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily 06/28/2019 page24)
