                Ex-USC doctor gives up license to practice
            </p>
            <p>
                A former gynecologist at the University of Southern California who has been accused of sexually abusing his patients, including many overseas students from China, has surrendered his medical license to the state's medical board, officials said.According to a statement provided by the Medical Board of California on Monday, the surrender of Tyndall's license became effective Sept 5. It came after the filing of an accusation charging him with sexual misconduct involving five patients."The incidents outlined in the Board's accusation against George Tyndall are egregious violations," said Kimberly Kirchmeyer, the board's executive director."On behalf of California consumers, the Board achieved the highest level of patient protection with the surrender of Tyndall's license," she added.The board said it petitioned for and obtained an interim suspension order against Tyndall after learning about the reports of sexual misconduct, which prevented the former doctor from practicing medicine until the accusation filed against his license reached conclusion.The board's accusation against Tyndall details inappropriate sexual contact with five patients he treated during his time as a gynecologist at a college student health center, the board's stated.Carlos Villatoro, a public information officer for the Medical Board of California, told China Daily that Tyndall would be able to apply for the reinstatement of his license three years after the date of surrender.Several factors are taken into account when the panel of the board or an administrative law judge hears one's petition to reinstate his or her license, according to California's Business and Professions Code.This may include: "all activities of the petitioner since the disciplinary action was taken, the offense for which the petitioner was disciplined, the petitioner's activities during the time the certificate was in good standing, and the petitioner's rehabilitative efforts, general reputation for truth, and professional ability"."No petition shall be considered while the petitioner is under sentence for any criminal offense, including any period during which the petitioner is on court-imposed probation or parole," the code states.Tyndall was accused of sexually abusing hundreds of female patients at USC's Engemann Student Health Center, where he was the only full-time campus gynecologist for 27 years. He allegedly targeted Asian women, including many Chinese international students.After a yearlong investigation, Tyndall was arrested and charged with 29 felony counts in June and with assaulting 16 patients at USC from 2009 to 2016. If convicted, he faces up to 53 years in prison.Los Angeles authorities said more than 350 women came forward to offer information on Tyndall over the course of the investigation.The case led to the resignation of USC president C.L. Max Nikias in August 2018 and resulted in hundreds of lawsuits against the university.USC received preliminary approval from a federal judge in June for a $215 million class-action settlement that the school had agreed to pay to Tyndall's former patients.If approved by the court, the proposed agreement would grant $2,500 to $250,000 in payments, based on a three-tier claims system.According to the Los Angeles Times, Tyndall chose to surrender his license rather than contest a 13-page accusation filed by the Medical Board of California last September.Peter Osinoff, a lawyer who represented Tyndall before the board, said the state had denied a request to put Tyndall's license-revocation proceeding on hold until after his criminal trial. He would have had to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in the hearing rather than testify in his own defense.

                University-managed Research Facilities: To lead creative innovations in key areas
            </a>
            <p>
                November 19th, 2018 will go down in history as one of the coldest days, as Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) officially unveiled its Cryo-electron Microscopy Iinnovation and Research Center (Cryo-EM Center). Cryo-electron microscopy pioneer and Nobel Laureate in Chemistry Richard Henderson was on hand to attend the ceremony, along with SUSTech President Chen Shiyi, Deputy Director Cai Yu of the Shenzhen Municipal Development and Reform Commission and Academician Sui Senfang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.The SUSTech Cryo-EM Center is a major basic scientific facility platform funded by the Shenzhen Municipal Government. It aims to support the science of biomedicine, precision medicine and new energy and new materials in both Shenzhen and across the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. The Center plans to install 6 sets of 300 kV cryo-electron microscopes and 71 sets of related auxiliary instruments and sample preparation facilities. Once the equipment is installed, it will be the most advanced cryo-electron microscope laboratory in China.At the ceremony, Chen Shiyi welcomed the guests and thanked the Shenzhen Municipal Government and Committee for their support. He also congratulated Professor Wang Peiyi and the staff of the SUSTech for all their hard work. Chen Shiyi said that in the next few years, the SUSTech Cryo-EM Center would focus on combining basic knowledge and drug development to play an important role in industrial development of Shenzhen and China. SUSTech would continue to contribute to Shenzhen’s society and economy by adhering to and carrying forward the spirit of Research, Innovation and Entrepreneurship.In his speech, Richard Henderson congratulated SUSTech for completing the SUSTech Cryo-EM Center . He pointed out that the SUSTech Cryo-EM Center will become one of the world’s three largest cryo-electron microscopy centers. The other two centers are in the United States and the United Kingdom.At present, there are about 100 similar research institutions around the world. After the completion of the SUSTech Cryo-EM Center, it will be among the top 5% in the world. This expansion in capacity will have a great impact on research of related scientific research fields.General Manager Marc Peeters of the Materials & Science Division of Thermofisher Scientific (Asia Pacific), Chairman Jonathan Jing of Enoch Technology Holdings Ltd., Chairman Cui Yuping of Shenzhen Aerospace Industry Technology Research Institute and Managing Director Chen Shiyou of China International Financial Group also spoke at the ceremony.Professor Zhou Zhenghong of the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), Professor Cheng Yifan of the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and Professor Zhang Peijun of the University of Oxford also attended the ceremony.Following the opening ceremony, the International Symposium on the Development of Cryo-Electron Microscopes was also held at SUSTech’s Lynn Library. Richard Henderson gave the keynote speech on “Cryo-EM: Progress and prospects.”He described the development history of cryo-electron microscopy from a personal perspective, and provided his detailed outlook on its future technical developments. Sui Senfang reviewed the development of cryo-electron microscopy in China. There were also presentations by Florida State University Professor Kenneth A. Taylor, Fellow of the American Academy of Sciences and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Professor Dinshaw J. Patel, UCSF Professor Cheng Yifan, Tsinghua University Medical School Researcher Xiang Ye, UCLA Professor Zhou Zhenghong, Professor Zhang Peijun of Oxford University, Yang Maojun of Tsinghua University, and Dr. Wang Qing of Thermofisher Scientific.Recently, it has been involved in groundbreaking research. Scientists in the SUSTech Cryo-EM Center have assisted in important research that has been published in both Science and Nature Microbiology. These research papers have broken new ground in scientist’s understanding of mitochondria and influenza.Cellular processes must respond to change, often by speeding up, slowing down, or stopping altogether. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthases use a transmembrane proton gradient to produce ATP, but this reaction can go in reverse and needs to be halted when conditions are unfavorable. Recently, the SUSTech Cryo-EM Center took part in research by a team led by Professor Yang Maojun from the School of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University. The paper, published in top academic journal Science, was titled “Cryo-EM structure of the mammalian ATP synthase tetramer bound with inhibitory protein IF1.” It sought to determine the structure of mammalian ATP synthase tetramer using the SUSTech Cryo-Electron Microscope.The paper focused on the most complete structure of mammalian ATP synthase, and the position and function of each subunit in the complex. ATP synthase monomer is composed of 19 different subunits and 30 proteins. The newly identified subunits are mostly encapsulated in the intermediate region of ATP synthase tetramer, meaning that all the subunits can only be contained in the tetramer protein. The structure of ATP synthase in higher mammals was analyzed, providing an important experimental and structural basis for treating metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. The research team will continue to study the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system in depth, and will devote itself to the development of new targeted drugs for mitochondrial abnormalities. Link to the paper: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6445/1068 Scientists in the SUSTech Cryo-EM Center also contributed to a recently published paper that has helped researchers understand more about the influenza D virus polymerase, the fourth of the four major influenza strains. The paper was published in Nature Microbiology under the title, “Structural Insight into RNA Synthesis by influenza D Polymerase.”The researchers have provided the structural basis for the different behaviors of influenza virus RNA synthesis and proposed a delicate regulatory mechanism for the production of different RNA species during both transcription and replication. They also identified some key residues regulating these processes, which are conserved across all four influenza strains which indicate that the mechanism might be shared by all influenza viruses. Their findings may provide new clues for the development of broad-spectrum anti-influenza drugs and therapeutics. Link to the paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-019-0487-5 The progress of these researches has been strongly supported by the SUSTech Cryo-EM Center. With the full support of the Development and Reform Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, SUSTech has taken the lead in building the largest cryo electron-microscopy center in mainland China, and the one of the top three cryo-electron microscopy centers in the world. The SUSTech Cryo-EM Center supports high-end biomedical research in SUSTech, Shenzhen, and the Greater Bay Area by providing high quality outputs quickly and efficiently. In just seven months since its official opening, the SUSTech Cryo-EM Center has had results from its facilities published in top academic journals, reflecting the vigorous, enterprising, flexible and innovative spirit of SUSTech and Shenzhen. In November 2018, SUSTech’s Taiyi high-performance supercomputer cluster was ranked 127th in the world, and 1st among civilian domestic universities, which is composed of 32,400 Intel Xeon computing cores. The theoretical computing performance is 2500 teraflops, with measured performance of 1687 teraflops. Commissioning of the system and software installation is in progress, and “Taiyi” is expected to be in service by the end of the year.

                Undergraduate research at SUSTech: To cultivate intellectual maturity
            </a>
            <p>
                Three months ago, Hu Qikun, a student of the Department of Chemistry of Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), received many Ph.D. offers from top universities including Cambridge University and Princeton University, but in fact, he is only a junior.Why do many famous universities fancy him? His passport is six high-qualified papers published on the world's authoritative journals, which made him become a legend among the academics. However, pearls are everywhere but not the same as the eyes. There was a talent scout as well as good teacher behind him, Xu Zongxiang, an associate professor in the Department of Chemistry of SUSTech.Dr. Hu, an undergraduateThe story begins with a US laboratory that sought cooperation from SUSTech to complete a set of experiments on the application of photovoltaic devices for new materials. Though this is an important task for the professionals, as an undergraduate, Hu Qikun was chosen to take part in. The truth is that he was qualified and well-prepared for challenging tasks all the time.In December 2018, Hu Qikun published two papers in the internationally renowned journal Solar RRL and Catalyst Today in the field of energy and catalysis as the first author. Both papers completed the main experiment and paper writing. It is not easy for undergraduates to publish articles in internationally renowned academic journals. It is even more difficult to publish an article as the first author, let alone publish two. Since then, he continued to make achievements in scientific research. So far, he has published 2 first-author research papers in the Journal of High-Level Materials and Energy Chemistry, and has co-authored 4 papers, one of which has just been accepted by Advanced Energy Materials."In my research group, there are masters’ and doctoral students, but on many issues, they have to ask Hu Qikun, the undergraduate." Xu Zongxiang said proudly. Zheng Zhiping, the head of the Department of Chemistry of SUSTech, also said "His research results can completely write a doctoral thesis." The students simply called Hu Qikun "Dr. Hu."Interest drives achievementsAnother reason why Hu Qizhen has had such remarkable achievements is the research conditions on offer at SUSTech.Xu Zongxiang said that Hu Qikun came to SUSTech from Fujian Province. "I know his personality very well. He used to like to do research before, so I said that SUSTech is your place." Hu agreed and said that the laboratories in SUSTech opened for undergraduates is what attracts him most.As a productive researcher, Hu Qikun believes that it is not talent that can result in many papers, but diligence. This is true for all other researchers who write many papers. In his opinion, his papers reflect his persistent efforts and hard works over the He loves his experiments and has arranged his life around them. While some people may find this lifestyle boring, but Hu Qikun loves it because he can do what he loves. Hu Qikun is also sure that his future achievements will be just as fruitful as his previous achievements. He is now preparing for summer exchanges overseas and applying for further study at the end of the year.SUSTech endeavors to provide an abundant set of resources with world-class research centers, platforms and top talent teams, in order to produce more innovative talents.

Compared with other universities with profound history and well recognition, Shenzhen’s universities are relatively young. However, thanks to a variety of resources at home and abroad, Shenzhen has developed its higher education in an innovative and quicker way, so many first-class universities and disciplines came on the stage. Meanwhile, some universities with high achievements has made and continue to make great contributions to provide talent support and intellectual support to build Shenzhen demonstration pilot zone. SUSTech is aiming to quickly build an international high-level research university. From SUSTech’s establishment, the global outlook of SUSTech has been an important strategic direction, as shown by rankings from those who monitor academe from the outside. Here are a few examples of recent rankings, primarily relating to our academic standing. Times Higher Education World University Rankings In 2019, Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranked SUSTech eighth (8th) among the 72 mainland China universities on the list.The ranking evaluated universities across teaching, research, citation, international outlook and industrial income indices by using 13 carefully calibrated performance indicators to provide the most comprehensive and balanced comparisons of over 400 universities from 27 countries and regions in Asia.Across the indices, SUSTech ranks No. 1 among mainland universities in citations and international outlook.QS World University Rankings In 2019, QS World University Rankings ranked SUSTech 38th, among mainland universities, which highlights its high competitiveness. The rankings are based on research quality and accomplishments, academic reputation, and graduate employment. ARWU World University Rankings In 2019, ARWU World University Rankings ranked SUSTech 35th among mainland university and SUSTech has been listed among world top-500 universities for high-quality research output for the first time. The rankings are based on broad disciplinary groupings and secondary data sources that primarily focus on universities’ achievements in scientific research such as the number of Nobel prizes and Fields medals won by staff and alumni, the number of highly cited researchers on staff, and the number of articles by faculty published in Nature and Science magazines. Other Rankings In the latest ranking of Nature Index for 2018, released on the Nature website, SUSTech ranked 26th among mainland universities. Nature Index has been published monthly since November 2014. It tracks the research output of more than 8,000 global institutions and identifies the countries and institutions showing the most significant growth.
