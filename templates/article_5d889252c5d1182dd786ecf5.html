                Rioters trying to 'defy central govt'
            </p>

                Violent acts show purpose is to make HK separate entityCriminal acts committed by a few rioters in Hong Kong show that their purpose is no longer related to the extradition bill but instead is intended to paralyze the Hong Kong government and make the city an independent political entity, a spokesman for the Hong Kong affairs authority said on Tuesday."They are in fact confronting the central government and imperiling the principle of 'one country, two systems'," using the high degree of autonomy as a pretext, said Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council.Yang said the rioters have not hesitated to violate the law and engage in violence to willingly serve external forces and anti-China forces.Hong Kong's situation is still grim and complex, he said, adding that the violence and illegal activities have not been totally kept at bay, with a small number of rioters doubling down on their violent and criminal activities.Yang said three rioters ambushed a police officer on Friday and attacked him with knives, causing serious injury. "The cruelty has reached the level of madness," he said.On Friday, rioters tossed gasoline bombs at police officers and government buildings and threw tear gas grenades into the military camp of the PLA Hong Kong Garrison.They incited students to boycott classes and used students as tools to achieve their political goals, Yang said, adding that the rioters even threatened to die together and tried to bend the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government under their pressure by resorting to such extreme behavior."We have reached a crucial moment to protect the 'one country, two systems' principle and maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability," Yang said. "We should not hesitate or compromise on issues concerning Hong Kong's future and destiny."Yang said people should distinguish between peaceful rallies, violent crimes and activities challenging the "one country, two systems" principle.As for the demonstrators' "five demands", including universal suffrage for the election of chief executive, Yang said they are not expressing demands but are threatening and coercing the central government."The universal suffrage they want is to elect a chief executive who is not accountable to the central government," Yang said.Xu Luying, a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said the central government will not allow the chaos in Hong Kong to continue indefinitely and will not stand idly by if it worsens and turns into unrest that threatens national sovereignty."It's totally wrong that the deployment of the People's Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong would overturn the principle of 'one country, two systems'," Xu said.The Garrison Law states that the SAR government can request that the central government let the PLA garrison in Hong Kong help maintain local public order.The Constitution and the Basic Law also grant the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress - the top legislature - the power to judge and directly announce an emergency status for Hong Kong, under which the PLA Hong Kong Garrison can perform its duties accordingly."The two conditions are both under the framework of the 'one country, two systems' principle," she said.On Tuesday morning, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor firmly dismissed media reports hinting at her broaching the subject of possible resignation in a private conversation.Speaking to reporters ahead of the weekly meeting of her Executive Council, Lam said: "From the beginning till now, I have never tendered my resignation to the Central People's Government."Lam reaffirmed that she had never contemplated resigning as she took questions from reporters. "Let me say it in a clear-cut manner: No," Lam said.In an unambiguous message, she said: "In a private session, I just attempted to explain, as an individual, given the very difficult circumstances, it (resignation) might be an easy choice to make. But I told myself repeatedly in the last few months that I and my team should stay on to help Hong Kong in a very difficult situation and serve the people of Hong Kong. That remains my position."

                World remembers the start of WWII with commemorations in Poland
            </a>
            <p>
                As world leaders gathered in Poland on the weekend to commemorate the start of World War II, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier asked his hosts to forgive his country's past "tyranny".Steinmeier was there to mark the moment 80 years ago when German bombs fell, ahead of its tanks rolling across the border into its neighbor to the east, triggering six years of global war and suffering.Steinmeier lamented Germany's "desire to annihilate" in the middle years of the 20th century, saying: "I bow my head before the Polish victims of Germany's tyranny and I ask forgiveness."He made the comments in a speech, given in both German and Polish, in the Polish city of Wielun, which was the first place to be on the receiving end of German bombs during the conflict.His Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, said Germany's attack on his country that claimed 6 million Polish lives, including those of 3 million Jewish civilians, was "an act of barbarity"."Wielun was to show what kind of war it would be, that it would be a total war, a war without rules, a destructive war," the BBC quoted Duda as saying.The dawn bombing raid prompted the United Kingdom to warn Germany to cease military operations or face the consequences and, on Sept 3, 1939, after Germany ignored the warnings and continued to attack Poland, the UK and France declared war on the Nazis.Other events took place elsewhere on Sunday to commemorate the beginning of the world's most deadly conflict, including one in the Polish capital Warsaw, which was attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and US Vice-President Mike Pence as well as French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, and the leaders of Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, and Slovakia. DW News, the English-language branch of German international broadcaster Deutsche Welle, noted that United States President Donald Trump intended to attend but was unable to do so after his attention was diverted toward a hurricane approaching his nation.

                HK rioters condemned for criminal activities
            </a>
            <p>
                Criminal acts committed by a few rioters in Hong Kong show that their purpose is no longer related to the extradition bill but instead is intended to paralyze the Hong Kong government and make the city an independent political entity, a spokesman for the Hong Kong affairs authority said on Tuesday."They are in fact confronting the central government and imperiling the principle of 'one country, two systems'," using the high degree of autonomy as a pretext, said Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council.Yang said the rioters have not hesitated to violate the law and engage in violence to willingly serve external forces and anti-China forces.Hong Kong's situation is still grim and complex, he said, adding that the violence and illegal activities have not been totally kept at bay, with a small number of rioters doubling down on their violent and criminal activities.Yang said three rioters ambushed a police officer on Friday and attacked him with knives, causing serious injury.

"We should not hesitate or compromise on issues concerning Hong Kong's future and destiny."Yang called on the SAR government and people from all sectors of society to further build consensus on containing turmoil and bringing order back to Hong Kong.As for the demonstrators' "five demands", including universal suffrage for the election of chief executive, Yang said they are not expressing demands but are threatening and coercing the central government."The universal suffrage they want is to elect a chief executive who is not accountable to the central government," Yang said, indicating that the purpose is to make the principle of "one country, two systems" exist in name only.Under the Basic Law, candidates for Hong Kong's chief executive must be endorsed by a majority of a nominating committee, and the chief executive must be accountable to the central government.Xu Luying, a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said the central government will not allow the chaos in Hong Kong to continue indefinitely and will not stand idly by if it worsens and turns into unrest that threatens national sovereignty."It's totally wrong that the deployment of the People's Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong would overturn the principle of 'one country, two systems'," Xu said.The Garrison Law states that the SAR government can request that the central government let the PLA garrison in Hong Kong help maintain local public order.The Constitution and the Basic Law also grant the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress-the top legislature-the power to judge and directly announce an emergency status for Hong Kong, under which the PLA Hong Kong Garrison can perform its duties accordingly."The two conditions are both under the framework of the 'one country, two systems' principle," she said.On Tuesday morning, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor firmly denied media reports hinting at her broaching the subject of possible resignation in a private conversation.Speaking to reporters ahead of the weekly meeting of her Executive Council, Lam said, "From the beginning until now, I have never tendered my resignation to the Central People's Government."Lam reaffirmed that she had never contemplated resigning as she took questions from reporters.

                Trump presents Medal of Freedom to NBA's Jerry West
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON — Jerry West, the NBA legend who delivered championships to the Los Angeles Lakers as both a player and an executive, said, "It never ceases to amaze me the places you can go in this world chasing a basketball" as he was honored Thursday with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.Now a consultant with the Los Angeles Clippers, West marveled at being among recipients of the nation's highest civilian honor, including such sports figures as Muhammad Ali. "I swear, my name is going to look like a misprint on this list," West quipped after President Donald Trump presented the medal in the Oval Office.Trump said West's honor was "richly deserved." He cited West's humble beginning, a basketball career at West Virginia University that led him to the Lakers and an Olympic gold medal. Trump also noted West's support for military veterans and charitable causes in Los Angeles.After retiring from play, West coached the Lakers for three seasons before moving to the front office, where he signed such greats as Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal. He also has held executive positions with the Memphis Grizzlies and the Golden State Warriors.Known as "Mr Clutch," West was named an All-Star every year of his 14-season career with the Lakers and helped lead the team to the NBA Finals nine times. West was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1979. His silhouette is ubiquitous, considered to be the basis of the NBA logo, a player dribbling a ball set against a red-and-blue background.As a teenager growing up in West Virginia, West literally grew in stature.He made the high school varsity basketball team, but often sat on the bench during his junior year. Then, as he continued to devote himself to long hours of practice, he grew 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) over the summer. As a senior, he scored 900 points in one season, helping his team win the 1956 state title, according to a profile on NBA.com. West went on to play college basketball at WVU.In his memoir, "West by West: My Charmed, Tormented Life," West revealed a lifelong battle with depression.He wrote that his childhood was devoid of love and filled with anger as a result of an abusive father. He often felt worthless and poured his energy into playing, which he has described as a gift that helped him rise above his emotional pain.AP

                Mainland spokesman says both sides of the Straits 'belong to one China'Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, strongly condemned on Wednesday the separatist acts of the Democratic Progressive Party－the ruling party of the island－in the field of education.Newly compiled history textbooks, embodied with the separatist idea of "Taiwan independence", have been used during the new high school semester in Taiwan.The textbook states that the status of Taiwan is still undecided, aiming to reserve legal space for independence."It will harm the younger generation in Taiwan and further intensify cross-Straits confrontation. Both sides of the Taiwan Straits belong to one China, and the compatriots on both sides belong to the Chinese nation," Ma said."No one can deprive our compatriots in Taiwan of the right to be Chinese. No act of the DPP can sever the historical link between the two sides, nor can it change the fact that Taiwan is a part of China," he said.The island authority has also urged Taiwan residents not to travel to the mainland to attend National Day celebration events in October and said government and military personnel will be punished if they attend those activities.In response, Ma said the DPP and "Taiwan independence" forces have been inciting cross-Straits confrontations and sparing no effort to crack down on parties, groups and people with different stances.They intimidated and punished people who participated in cross-Straits exchanges on trumped-up charges, he said, adding that it is impossible not to affect cross-Straits exchanges.In August, the mainland film regulator suspended participation of mainland movies and personnel in the 56th Golden Horse Film Festival in November in Taipei, a major film festival honoring the Chinese-speaking region.Last year's festival ceremony was overshadowed by "Taiwan independence" remarks, triggering discontent from mainland participants and evoking anger from the mainland public, especially among netizens.Trips to the island by individual tourists from the mainland have been suspended since the beginning of August."The DPP and 'Taiwan independence' forces are to blame," Ma said, adding that cooperation and exchanges are the common will of compatriots on both sides and no one can stand in the way.In July, about 1,000 young people from the two sides joined a basketball event in Taipei.In August, about 600 people joined a cross-Straits baseball event in Taichung.
