                Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, attends a grand welcome ceremony hosted by Nguyen Phu Trong, general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee, ahead of their talks in Hanoi, Vietnam, Nov 12, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]HANOI - China and Vietnam cemented their special bond of "camaraderie + brotherhood" and agreed to explore new prospects for interconnected interests during a state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping.This is Xi's first overseas trip on the heels of the landmark 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) held in October, which reflects the irreplaceable importance of the Sino-Vietnamese relations."The visit is an important diplomatic activity for implementing Xi's proposition of building a community of shared future for mankind in the new era," said Zhang Yunling, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.CEMENTING BOND OF FRIENDSHIPXi, who is also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, has been accorded with friendly and high-level reception during his trip to the Southeast Asian nation.Upon his arrival at Hanoi, Xi was welcomed by a cheerful crowd wearing traditional clothes and waving the flags of the two countries.At the Presidential Palace, he attended a grand welcome ceremony hosted by Nguyen Phu Trong, general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) Central Committee, with full military honors and a 21-gun salute."While stepping on this beautiful and fertile land once again after two years, I feel strongly the friendly feeling of the Vietnamese people towards the Chinese people," Xi told a welcoming banquet jointly hosted by Trong and Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang.During his meetings with the Vietnamese leaders, Xi repeatedly recalled the China-Vietnam traditional friendship nurtured by previous generations of the two countries' leaders.He said China and Vietnam are close neighbors connected by mountains and rivers, good friends sharing weal and woe, good comrades with similar ideals and beliefs, and good partners for win-win cooperation.During their talks, Xi and Trong agreed to carry forward, preserve and promote the traditional friendship between China and Vietnam.As a special arrangement, Xi chose the Vietnam-China Friendship Palace as the first stop of his Hanoi visit.The Palace, a landmark project built with Chinese assistance, is a reflection of the consolidated friendship between the two peoples in the new era.With Xi's visit this time, the top leaders of the two parties and the two countries have had mutual visits within a single year twice in just three years.Xi's visit is of great importance to the Vietnam-China relationship in the new period, said Do Tien Sam, the former director of the Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences (VASS) Institute of Chinese Studies.Sam said the visit has consolidated mutual political trust between the two countries and created favorable conditions for all types of cooperation between China and Vietnam in the future.

                Water flow will help 'blueberry' system bear healthy fruits
            </a>
            <p>
                The first Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Leaders 'Meeting held in Sanya, South China's Hainan province, on March 23 has got a popular Chinese nickname, "blueberry" mechanism, because its abbreviation sounds exactly like the nutritious fruit in Chinese. This reflects the close relationship between China and the countries that it shares the river with.Flowing out of China's Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the Lancang River, known as the Mekong River in the middle and lower reaches, meanders through China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam before emptying into the South China Sea. Some 326 million people live along the nearly 5,000-kilometer-long water body, which has a total drainage area of almost 800,000 sq km. And the combined trade volume between China and the five countries through which the Mekong flows was about $200 billion in 2015.As Hu Zhenyue, vice-chair of China Public Diplomacy Association, said at an international forum in Bangkok last week, the six countries are destined to be cooperative partners because they are bonded together by the same river. Bangkok played host to the first international conference after the Sanya meeting that saw the participation of experts and scholars from the six Lancang-Mekong countries. Organized by Thailand's Institute of Security and International Studies, the forum discussed ways to realize the roadmap adopted at the Sanya meeting.

                Guangxi aims to be pathway to asean
            </a>
            <p>
                Region is playing important role in China's overseas trade cooperation strategy, Hao Nan reports. Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region has become an important gateway in China's opening up strategy and trade cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, thanks to a number of development opportunities created during the 12th Five-Year Plan period (2011-15). In 2011, for example, plans were discussed to develop the region as a role model of cooperation between China and ASEAN. In 2013, the State Council approved construction of a comprehensive border financial reform pilot zone in the region, and in 2014, development of the Pearl River-Xijiang River Economic Belt was upgraded to a national strategy. In March 2015, President Xi Jinping said that to strategically reposition itself and aid its future development, Guangxi should become an international pathway to ASEAN countries, a new strategic pivot in Southwest and Central China's opening up strategy, and a dynamic portal connecting the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and the Silk Road Economic Belt. The local government has taken a number of steps to realize these goals. In 2015, it upgraded the Beibu Gulf economic area, carrying out 256 major projects in the fields of infrastructure construction, industry transformation and port logistics. A special fund was arranged to develop the Xijiang River into a "golden waterway" to the Pearl River Delta, Hong Kong and Macao. During the 2011-15 period, Guangxi accelerated subregional economic cooperation with the Pan-Beibu Gulf Zone and the Greater Mekong Subregion, speeded up construction of the Nanning-Singapore Economic Corridor and took part in negotiations on the proposed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership between China, ASEAN and other partners. Guangxi now has an annual cargo handling capacity of more than 200 million metric tons in its Beibu Gulf sea ports and has established a China-ASEAN port cities network. It has opened air routes to major ASEAN cities and finished construction of the Nanning-Pingxiang high-speed road, the Guangxi sector of China's first expressway to Southeast Asia. Since 2013, the region has accelerated infrastructure construction in ports along its borders, putting 55 projects on its agenda with total investment of over 230 million yuan ($35 million). Guangxi has 25 dry, sea and river ports, including 19 national first-level open ports. Fangchenggang has navigable channels with more than 250 ports in over 100 countries and regions, and Qinzhou Port opened five direct trade routes to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore. An increasing number of Guangxi companies tapped into overseas markets from 2011 to 2015. By the end of 2014, nearly 570 local enterprises had gone global and most of them invested in ASEAN, covering a broad range of major industries including agriculture, mining, chemicals and communication equipment. Guangxi International Construction Engineering Co, for instance, set up branches in Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and East Timor. In 2014, the company signed overseas contracts worth $130 million. During the first 10 months of 2015, Guangxi invested $161 million in ASEAN countries, 10 times more than in the same period in 2014. The region launched a project in November 2014 to simplify the procedures for customs clearance to facilitate cross-border trade. Through its participation in the Belt and Road Initiative, Guangxi has witnessed sustainable growth in foreign trade and overseas investment in recent years. Its total imports and exports trade volume rose from $23.33 billion in 2011 to $49 billion in 2015, of which trade with ASEAN rose from $9.56 billion to $27.7 billion. From January to October last year, Guangxi's foreign trade hit 221.1 billion yuan, of which 110.7 billion yuan was with ASEAN. From 2011 to 2014, investment from Guangxi companies in foreign countries rose at an annual rate of 62 percent, increasing from $400 million to $2.12 billion. During the 12th Five-Year Plan period, Guangxi enhanced communications between young people in the region and those in ASEAN through cultural exchanges. Last year, the first China-ASEAN Expo Tourism Exhibition was held in Guilin, attracting some 800 global enterprises, 300 foreign professional buyers and nearly 150,000 participants. Contact the writer at haonan@chinadaily.com.cn Thriving tourism Located in the southern part of China, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region is famous for its natural scenery of karst land forms, which are stunning geological features created on the Earth's surface by water draining into the ground. The Beibu Gulf Economic Zone in the south of the region has islands, beaches and waterfalls, making it a beautiful and tranquil spot for holidaymakers. Natural beauty In 2013, the National Development and Reform Commission of China released a strategy to build Guilin into an international tourist destination. The plan bids to develop Guilin as a world-class tourist destination as well as a platform for international tourism cooperation and culture exchanges by 2020. Guilin, with its stunning Lijiang River, which originates in the city's Maoer Mountain, is a beautiful place that attracts numerous tourists from all over the world. The city was visited by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark in 1979 and Bill and Hillary Clinton in 1998, all of whom extolled its wonders. Ethnic culture The local Zhuang people have a rich tradition of both written and unwritten folk stories, which often take the form of songs. The third day of the March in the lunar calendar is their traditional folk song festival, called San Yue San (Third Month's Third Day). Every year, Zhuang people, along with the local Han, Yao, Miao and Dong peoples, gather together to sing folk songs and play folk games. The festival is marked by a four-day holiday throughout Guangxi, giving tourists a wonderful opportunity to experience local culture and color. There are many stories about the origin of the event, but one of most popular features Liu Sanjie, the singing goddess of Zhuang legend. Liu Sanjie became hugely popular among ordinary people by fighting the practices of oppressive landlords through her songs. It is said that the festival commemorates the day of her death. Leisure Guangxi is also a great place for tourists who value rest, relaxation and, perhaps, longevity. Located in the northwest part of the region, covering 16,177 square kilometers, Bama county is reputed to have 74 residents who are over 100 years old and 531 in their 90s out of a population of only 238,000. With Bama as the centerpiece, an international tourist zone was built covering karst caves, mountains, rivers and traditional villages. By the end of 2014, there were five 4A level scenery spots, four 3As and two 2As in the zone. Tours The mountains surrounding Yangshuo county have been hailed as a climbers' paradise, and several climbing routes of varying difficult levels have been approved by expert climbers. Starting from the cities of Beihai and Fangchenggang, tourists can travel on cruise ships across Ha Long Bay to Hanoi, Vietnam's capital city, where Ba Dinh Square, Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum and One Pillar Pagoda are all worth visiting.  Foreign visitors learn to sing folk songs of the Zhuang people in Guangxi. Underground river in Bama village in Guangxi is a hidden treasure for local residents. Karst landform in Jingxi city offers tourists spectacular natural views. Silver Beach in Beihai, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, is popular with both foreign and domestic tourists because of its pleasant environment.

In 2013, the State Council approved construction of a comprehensive border financial reform pilot zone in the region, and in 2014, development of the Pearl River-Xijiang River Economic Belt was upgraded to a national strategy.In March 2015, President Xi Jinping said that to strategically reposition itself and aid its future development, Guangxi should become an international pathway to ASEAN countries, a new strategic pivot in Southwest and Central China's opening up strategy, and a dynamic portal connecting the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and the Silk Road Economic Belt.The local government has taken a number of steps to realize these goals.In 2015, it upgraded the Beibu Gulf economic area, carrying out 256 major projects in the fields of infrastructure construction, industry transformation and port logistics.

                Full text of Chinese President Xi's address at APEC CEO Summit
            </a>
            <p>
                President Xi Jinping delivers a keynote speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit in Da Nang, Vietnam, Nov 10, 2017. [Photo/Xinhua]DA NANG, Vietnam - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday made a keynote address titled "Seizing the Opportunity of a Global Economy in Transition and Accelerating Development of the Asia-Pacific" at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit.The following is the full text of the address:Seizing the Opportunity of a Global Economy in TransitionAnd Accelerating Development of the Asia-PacificKeynote Address by H.E. Xi JinpingPresident of the People's Republic of ChinaAt the APEC CEO SummitDa Nang, 10 November 2017Chairman Vu Tien Loc,Leaders of the APEC Business Community,Ladies and Gentlemen,Dear Friends,Good afternoon! I am glad to come to Da Nang and meet all of you again.Our region, the Asia-Pacific, has the biggest share of the global economy; and it is a major engine driving global growth. The business community is a primary contributor to growth, as it keeps exploring new ways of development. That's why during the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting over the last several years, I have always taken time to meet business leaders and discuss with you approaches and measures to address the challenges we face.It has been 10 years since the international financial crisis broke out. Over the last decade, the international community have worked in concert to steer the global economy back to the track of recovery. Thanks to our efforts, the global economy is improving. Despite risks and uncertainties, global trade and investment are picking up, people are more optimistic about the outlook of financial markets, and confidence is growing in all sectors.Development is a journey with no end, but with one new departure point after another. An ancient Chinese philosopher once observed, "We should focus our mind on the future, not the past." We live in a fast changing world, and the global economy is undergoing more profound changes. We must therefore closely follow the trend of the global economy, identify its underlying dynamics, keep to the right direction, and, on that basis, take bold action.-- We are seeing a profound change in growth drivers. Countries are turning to reform and innovation to meet challenges and achieve growth. The potential of structural reforms is being unlocked and its positive impact of boosting growth of various countries has become more evident. A new round of technological and industrial revolutions is gaining momentum. Digital economy and sharing economy have registered rapid growth. New industries as well as new forms and models of business are flourishing. As a result, new growth drivers are being created.-- We are seeing a profound change in the model of global growth. As time advances, development has taken on profoundly richer implications. The vision of innovative, coordinated, green and open development for all is gaining increasing public support. To achieve more comprehensive, higher quality and more sustainable development has become the shared goal of the international community. To implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and adapt to climate change and other challenges of a global nature has become an important international consensus.-- We are seeing a profound change in economic globalization. Over the last few decades, economic globalization has contributed greatly to global growth. Indeed, it has become an irreversible historical trend. Against the backdrop of evolving global developments, economic globalization faces new adjustments in both form and substance. In pursuing economic globalization, we should make it more open and inclusive, more balanced, more equitable and beneficial to all.-- We are seeing a profound change in the system of global economic governance. The evolving global economic environment demands more from the system of global economic governance. We should uphold multilateralism, pursue shared growth through consultation and collaboration, forge closer partnerships, and build a community with a shared future for mankind. This, I believe, is what we should do in conducting global economic governance in a new era.Ladies and Gentlemen,Dear Friends,Faced with the profound changes in the global economy, should we, the Asia-Pacific economies, lead reform and innovation, or just hesitate and proceed haltingly? Should we steer economic globalization, or dither and stall in the face of challenge? Should we jointly advance regional cooperation, or go our separate ways?This is my answer: We must advance with the trend of times, live up to our responsibility and work together to deliver a bright future of development and prosperity for the Asia-Pacific.First, we should continue to foster an open economy that benefits all. Openness brings progress, while self-seclusion leaves one behind. We the Asia-Pacific economies know this too well from our own development experience. We should put in place a regional cooperation framework that ensures consultation among equals, wide participation and shared benefits, build an open Asia-Pacific economy and promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. We should make economic globalization more open, inclusive and balanced so that it benefits different countries and people of different social groups. We should proactively adapt to the evolving international division of labor and actively reshape the global value chain so as to upgrade our economies and build up new strengths. We should support the multilateral trading regime and practice open regionalism to make developing members benefit more from international trade and investment.The building of a free trade area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) is the long-cherished dream of the business community in our region. It was in response to the call of the business community that APEC leaders, for the first time, initiated the FTAAP vision in Hanoi in 2006. In 2014, the FTAAP process was launched in Beijing. We should get into action, fully implement the Beijing Roadmap, move toward the FTAAP and provide an institutional underpinning for growing an open economy in the Asia-Pacific.Second, we should continue to pursue innovation-driven development and create new drivers of growth. The current global economic recovery is, to a large extent, the result of cyclical factors, while the lack of self-generating driving forces remains a nagging problem. To avoid the risk of the global economy entering a "new mediocre", we must sustain growth through innovation.The new round of technological and industrial revolutions is unfolding before us. Digital economy and sharing economy are surging worldwide, and breakthroughs have been made in new technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum science. We in the Asia-Pacific cannot afford to be just onlookers. What we should do is to seize the opportunity, increase input in innovation, change the model of development and nurture new growth areas. We should promote structural reform, remove all institutional and systemic barriers to innovation and energize the market. We should implement the APEC Accord on Innovative Development, Economic Reform and Growth adopted in Beijing, deepen cooperation on the internet and digital economy and strive to be a global leader of innovative growth.Third, we should continue to enhance connectivity and achieve interconnected development. Interconnected development is the best way to achieve mutual benefit and win-win outcome. We the Asia-Pacific economies are closely connected, and our interests are interlocked. Such an interconnected development will both open up new horizon for our own development, and create driving force for us all to achieve common development as partners. In 2014, the APEC Connectivity Blueprint was formulated. This Blueprint should guide our efforts to build a comprehensive, all-round and multi-tiered Asia-Pacific connectivity network. We should boost the real economy through the building of connectivity, break bottlenecks to development and unlock potentials. With these efforts, we can achieve coordinated and interconnected development.In May this year, the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation was successfully held in Beijing. The Belt and Road Initiative calls for joint contribution and it has a clear focus, which is to promote infrastructure construction and connectivity, strengthen coordination on economic policies, enhance complementarity of development strategies and boost interconnected development to achieve common prosperity. This initiative is from China, but it belongs to the world. It is rooted in history, but it is oriented toward the future. It focuses on the Asian, European and African continents, but it is open to all partners. I am confident that the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative will create a broader and more dynamic platform for Asia-Pacific cooperation.Fourth, we should continue to make economic development more inclusive and deliver its benefits to our people. The current headwinds confronting economic globalization is mostly generated by the lack of inclusiveness in development. Hard work is still needed if we are to bring the benefits of development to countries across the globe and people across our society, and thus turn our vision into reality.Over the past few years, we have actively explored ways to promote inclusive development and have built strong consensus about it. We should deepen regional economic integration, develop an open and inclusive market and strengthen the bond of shared interests. We should make inclusiveness and sharing a part of our development strategies, improve systems and institutions to uphold efficiency and fairness, and safeguard social equity and justice. We should invest more in education, medical care, employment and other areas that are important to people's livelihood, and address poverty and the widening gap between the rich and the poor. We should reach out to disadvantaged groups, improve business environment for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and enable the workforce to better adapt to industrial transformation, so that everyone will have his fair share of opportunity and benefits.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,As an old Chinese saying goes, a commitment, once made, should be delivered. Boosting development in the Asia-Pacific requires real actions by all of us members. As the world's second largest economy, China knows fully well its responsibility. Over the past five years, we have taken proactive steps to adapt to, manage and steer the new normal of China's economy and deepened supply-side structural reform. As a result, China's economy has maintained steady performance, and we are pursuing better-quality, more efficient, fairer and more sustainable development. Over the past four years, China's economy has grown by 7.2% on the average annually, contributing over 30% of global growth. China is now a main driver powering global growth.We have worked hard to remove systematical institutional barriers that impede development through comprehensive reform. As many as 360 major reform initiatives and more than 1,500 reform measures have been taken. Breakthroughs have been made in key areas, and general frameworks for reform have been put in place in major sectors. We have sped up efforts to build new institutions of the open economy and transform models of foreign trade and outbound investment to continue the shift from quantitative to qualitative improvement in trade.We have advanced theoretical, practical, institutional, cultural and other explorations to unleash new impetus for growth. China has become a huge platform where all factors and players of innovation converge to make a real difference. From infrastructure to various economic sectors, from business models to ways of consumption, innovation is leading the way.We have pursued a people-centered philosophy of development to make our development more inclusive and beneficial to all. Individual income has registered sustained growth, outpacing GDP growth for many years. Income gaps between urban and rural areas and between different regions have been narrowing, middle-income group expanding, and Gini coefficient dropping. More than 13 million new urban jobs have been created every year for four consecutive years. Significant advances have been made in pursuing green development, resulting in considerable reduction in the intensity of energy and resource consumption and marked improvement in the ecological environment.To lift all the remaining poor people out of poverty is a solemn commitment made by the Chinese government to the people. It is uppermost in my mind, and I have spent more energy on poverty alleviation than anything else. Over the past five years, I have been to many poor areas in China to pin down the causes of poverty and address them in a targeted way. As a result, decisive progress has been made in the fight against poverty. Over the past five years, we have lifted more than 60 million people out of poverty. The poverty headcount ratio has declined, and per capita rural income in poor areas has maintained double-digit growth. This has not come easily, and we are proud of what we have achieved in poverty alleviation.Ladies and Gentlemen,Friends,China's development is an evolving historical process. Last month, the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was successfully convened in Beijing. Responding to our people's desire for a better life, the Congress formulated a guide to action and a development blueprint for China in the new era. It is envisaged that by 2020, China will turn itself into a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and by 2035, China will basically realize socialist modernization. By the middle of this century, China will become a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally-advanced, harmonious and beautiful. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people will embark on a new journey.First, this is a new journey of deepening reform across the board and unleashing dynamism for development. To resolve difficulties and problems on the way forward, we must deepen all-round reform. We will focus more on solving problems, get rid of all outdated thinking and ideas and all institutional ailments and break through the blockades of vested interests to inspire creativity and vitality throughout society. We will develop a set of institutions that are well conceived, fully built, procedure based, and efficiently functioning and achieve modernization of China's system and capacity for governance. Next year, we will celebrate the 40th anniversary of China's launching of the reform and opening-up initiative. China's reform will cover more areas; and more and stronger steps will be taken in pursuing this endeavor.Second, this is a new journey of moving with the times and exploring new model of development. China's economy is in a transition from a phase of rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development. We will be guided by a new development philosophy, put quality first, give priority to performance and develop a modernized economy. We will pursue supply-side structural reform as our main task, work hard to achieve better quality and higher efficiency performance, and create more robust growth through reform. We will raise total factor productivity and accelerate the building of an industrial system that promotes coordinated development of the real economy with technological innovation, modern finance, and a talent pool. We will endeavor to develop an economy with more effective market mechanisms, dynamic micro-entities, and sound macro-regulation. All these efforts will make China's economy more innovative and competitive. We will promote further integration of the internet, big data, and artificial intelligence with the real economy, and cultivate new drivers of growth in digital economy, sharing economy, clean energy and other areas. We will continue to explore new mechanisms and pathways for achieving coordinated development among regions, promote coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Yangtze Economic Belt, Xiongan New Area, and Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, build world-class city clusters and foster new source of growth.As China works hard to pursue innovation and higher quality of growth, new forms of business will keep emerging, more innovations will be used, and development of various regions in China will become more balanced. All this will create a more powerful and extensive impact, present more opportunities of cooperation and enable more countries to board the express train of China's development.Third, this is a new journey toward greater integration with the world and an open economy of higher standards. China will not slow its steps in opening up itself. We will work together with other countries to create new drivers of common development through the launching of the Belt and Road Initiative. We will adopt policies to promote high-standard liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment. We will implement the system of pre-establishment national treatment plus a negative list across the board, significantly ease market access, further open the service sector, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors. All businesses registered in China will be treated as equals. We will grant more powers to pilot free trade zones to conduct reform, and explore the opening of free trade ports. We will speed up negotiations with partner countries on the concluding of free trade agreements and investment treaties, advance the building of FTAAP, work for the speedy conclusion of RCEP negotiations, and endeavor to establish a global network of free trade areas.In the next 15 years, China will have an even larger market and more comprehensive development. It is estimated that China will import US$24 trillion worth of goods, attract US$2 trillion inbound direct investment and make US$2 trillion of outbound investment. In November next year, China will hold the first China International Import Expo in Shanghai, which will provide a new platform for expanding cooperation in China's market among all parties.Fourth, this is a new journey toward a better life for the people. To secure a better life for our people is what we aim to achieve in everything we do. We will ensure and improve living standards through development and meet people's ever-growing needs for a better life. We will continue to promote social fairness and justice to see that our people will always have a strong sense of gains, happiness, and security. We will continue to implement targeted poverty reduction and alleviation measures and ensure that by the year 2020, all rural residents living below the current poverty line are lifted out of poverty. Each and every one of the over 1.3 billion Chinese people should lead decent lives. No one will be left behind!We will speed up institutional reform for ecological conservation, pursue green, low-carbon and sustainable development, and implement the strictest possible system for environmental protection. By 2035, there will be a fundamental improvement in the environment; the goal of building a Beautiful China will be basically attained. We will actively tackle climate change, and protect our common home for the sake of human survival. China's carbon dioxide emission is expected to peak around 2030, and we will make every effort for such emissions to reach the peak ahead of time. We will increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20% by 2030. Once we set a target, we will not stop our efforts until it is met!Fifth, this is a new journey toward a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind. The dream of us Chinese is closely connected with the dreams of people of other countries. Our world is full of challenges and the road ahead will not be smooth. But we will not give up on our dream. We will double our efforts and work with all others to build an open, inclusive, clean, and beautiful world that enjoys durable peace, universal security, and common prosperity.We Chinese believe that peace is most precious and that there should be harmony among all nations. We are committed to peaceful development and we will remain an anchor for peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. China will, guided by the principle of upholding justice while pursuing shared interests, actively develop global partnerships, expand the convergence of interests with other countries, and work to foster a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice, and win-win cooperation. Acting on the principle of achieving shared growth through consultation and collaboration, we will get actively involved in reforming and developing the global governance system to make the international political and economic order more just and equitable.Ladies and Gentlemen,Dear Friends,All of our people in the Asia-Pacific deserve peace, stability and prosperity; and all of us in the region should jointly deliver a bright future for the Asia-Pacific. Partnerships based on mutual trust, inclusiveness, cooperation and mutual benefit: This is what keeps our big Asia-Pacific family together and ensures the success of Asia-Pacific cooperation. Let us take solid steps to promote cooperation and usher in an even brighter future for the Asia-Pacific.Thank you.

                Here's hoping Trump-Kim summit can deliver the goods: China Daily editorial
            </a>
            <p>
                It has been confirmed a second summit between United States President Donald Trump and Democratic People's Republic of Korea top leader Kim Jong-un will take place on Feb 27-28 in Hanoi, Vietnam.Congratulations to both parties for taking another step toward ending one of the world's most dangerous standoffs and the ultimate goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.If the pending summit does end up sustaining the reportedly productive momentum of the preparatory negotiations, it will be remembered for laying solid groundwork for the critical next steps needed for the denuclearization process.There appears to be a real need on both sides for the negotiations to move forward in order for such engagement to continue making sense. Which is no doubt why the two parties seem to be diligently working together to present something truly deliverable.Trump, though he tends to on most things, sounds very optimistic about the upcoming meeting. "North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong-un, will become a great Economic Powerhouse … a different kind of Rocket — an Economic one!" he tweeted. The change-of-tone twist on an earlier tongue-in-cheek remark suggesting the two sides are at least talking cordially and respectfully to one another.But while the DPRK economy may indeed take off, it is unlikely to do so without a complete thaw in US-DPRK relations. Only then will Pyongyang be able to concentrate on developing the national economy, without having to worry about external security threats. And such a thaw is unlikely to materialize unless the current state of war is formally put to an end and the shadow of nuclear threats are removed. On these will hinge what Trump and Kim can deliver in Hanoi.Stephen Biegun, the US special representative for the DPRK, made an important point the other day on his return from "productive" preparatory talks in Pyongyang, "We have some hard work to do with the DPRK between now and then." Since he reportedly discussed specific disarmament steps that the DPRK could promise at the Vietnam summit and corresponding measures the US would be willing to take, the bargaining on who will do what in return for what seems to be getting down to the necessary nitty-gritty.And if the "set of concrete deliverables" for the second summit he reportedly discussed with DPRK officials did include Trump's readiness to officially conclude the Korean War, then perhaps we should join Trump in being optimistic about the summit, since that would show the White House is indeed committed to transforming US-DPRK ties and building lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.So let's extend our best wishes that the preparatory negotiations are both smooth and productive, and the Hanoi summit proves a success. For peace and stability in the region some concrete outcomes would certainly be most welcome.

                Bright spots seen on road to denuclearization
            </a>
            <p>
                Mutual confidence-building steps, such as suspension of US-ROK drills, are laudedA second summit between the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, concluded abruptly in Vietnam a week ago, has left much for researchers and diplomats to digest and decipher, but they seem to agree that a long, bumpy road to denuclearization lies ahead.However intricate the reasons, the breakdown of the Feb 27-28 summit between US President Donald Trump and the DPRK's top leader Kim Jong-un was widely believed to have been triggered by the differences on how far Pyongyang was willing to limit its nuclear program and the degree of Washington's willingness to ease sanctions, Reuters reported on Wednesday.To compound the issue, Trump said on Wednesday that he would be "very disappointed" in Kim if reports about rebuilding at a rocket launch site in the DPRK were true.That follows a statement from the White House a few days ago, which said the two leaders had "very good and constructive meetings" and discussed various ways to "advance denuclearization and economic driven concepts".Meanwhile, Trump's security adviser John Bolton, while defending the Trump-Kim meeting, said late Tuesday that US sanctions would increase if Pyongyang was unwilling to abandon its nuclear weapons program, a threat that would shadow the prospect of a dialogue process that both sides said they were open to.Researchers and diplomats have weighed in on the Korean Peninsula issue with cautions and alternative solutions."I think that one of the lessons that Trump administration will hopefully learn is to abandon some very unrealistic assumptions about what is achievable with the leverage that we have," Robert Einhorn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said on Wednesday."It should be clear by now that the goal of a rapid and complete denuclearization of North Korea is just not going to happen," Einhorn told a discussion on "Trump-Kim Summit 2.0".Einhorn, a former US State Department special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control, said an interim agreement, featuring "suspensions of all the fissile material anywhere" in the DPRK is not attractive, because Trump wanted to be the president who's going to resolve this issue once and for all."Maybe muddle along is the politically most comfortable thing to do," he said. "But I don't think it's sustainable."Anatoly Antonov, Russia's ambassador to the United States, also said nuclear disarmament is not an easy project."It seems to me that it's impossible to achieve a tangible result within one month or a year," he said at the Stimson Center on Monday, citing the example of how much money and time the US and Russia had to spend to dismantle the "excessive quantity" of their missiles and warheads."North Korea would like to get insurances for security. It's very easy to give up a capability that you possess just only for the future for (the) economy, for a stable development. But what will be the day after tomorrow?" he said at a discussion at the policy research center in Washington.Asked if it's time to lift sanctions on Pyongyang, Antonov said that if one side takes a step forward, it would be wise for the other to make some concessions, and that it's up to Washington and Pyongyang to decide when it's the right time to start a movement.China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China has noted the statements from both sides regarding the lifting of sanctions after the Hanoi summit."Despite persistent differences, both countries acknowledged that sanctions relief is an important part of the denuclearization process and that the two should be considered and done in tandem," Lu said on Friday. "This represents a common denominator that should be kept in mind."A day after the Hanoi meeting ended, Yang Jiechi, a veteran Chinese diplomat, told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the Korean Peninsula issue is complex and cannot be resolved in one stroke.Yang, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said in a phone call with Pompeo that Beijing hopes that the US and the DPRK remain "determined and patient", meet each other halfway and stick to peace talks, to achieve new results and new progress.On Saturday, the Pentagon said that the US and the Republic of Korea have decided to "conclude" the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle series of military exercises, part of the war games the combined forces of the two countries staged at springtime annually, which are condemned by Pyongyang as provocative rehearsals for war.Joseph DeTrani, who served as the US special envoy for the Six-Party Talks with the DPRK from 2003 to 2006, counted the suspension of US-ROK military exercises and DPRK's freeze of nuclear and missile tests as among the positive outcomes of US-DPRK diplomacy."These are confidence-building measures," he said at a panel discussion at the Second Annual Atlantic Council-Korea Foundation Forum in Washington on Tuesday, according to a press release.In fact, in their first summit in Singapore in June, the US and the DPRK agreed that mutual confidence-building steps could promote denuclearization, which represents one less bump in the road.Contact the writer at huanxinzhao@chinadailyusa.com

                Premier Li meets the press: Full transcript of questions and answers
            </a>
            <p>
                The Second Session of the 13th National People's Congress held a press conference at the Great Hall of the People on March 15, 2019. Premier Li Keqiang met with Chinese and foreign reporters and answered their questions at the invitation of Spokesperson Mr Zhang Yesui.Reuters: Last year China took a number of measures to ease monetary conditions. China also cut taxes and fees. This year China is promising more monetary easing, more tax cuts and more infrastructure spending. Are China's economic problems bigger than previously thought? And if the economic slowdown doesn't stop, would China consider taking more aggressive measures such as lifting property curbs and cutting benchmark interest rates?Premier Li: You went straight to the point in your question and I will not beat about the bush. It is true that China's economy has encountered new downward pressure against a larger backdrop of slower global economic growth. In the past month or so, several major international organizations have adjusted downward their forecast for global growth this year. We have adjusted downward, as appropriate, our projected economic growth target for 2019, and set it at a target range. This is compatible with the GDP growth rate we achieved last year. It is also consistent with our determination to prevent major economic indicators from sliding out of the proper range. By this way, we have sent a message of stability to the market.Last year, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core and guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, people across China made united efforts to advance the supply-side structural reforms, and we achieved a 6.6 percent GDP growth, which was no mean feat. Against the backdrop of growing trade protectionism in the international environment, China's GDP aggregate reached 90 trillion yuan. Our projected target for GDP growth this year is 6-6.5 percent. It will be a growth on top of a very large base figure. Keeping steady growth of China's economy in itself is important progress.We must take strong measures to cope with the current downward economic pressure. One possible option is to resort to quantitative easing, including excessive money supply and a much higher deficit-to-GDP ratio, flooding the economy with liquidity. Such an indiscriminate and expedient approach might work in the short run, but may also lead to future problems. Hence, it is not a viable option. Our choice is to energize market players to counter the downward pressure. We encountered economic downturn in the past several years, and the measures we took were aimed at boosting the vitality of the market, which generated stronger dynamism for development.China now has over 100 million market entities. When their vitality is fully unleashed, the energies that could be created would be incalculable. We must keep our policies stable and ensure their continuity. We will continue to cut taxes and fees, streamline administration, foster new drivers of growth, broaden market access and level the playing field for all market players. In this way, we will be able to lift the curbs on the market, free up space for companies and resolve concerns for our people. We will generate tremendous creativity in this process. And this will also put us in a strong position to keep major economic indicators within a proper range and achieve high-quality development.We also need to take strong measures to cope with growing uncertainties that we face this year. We have policies in reserve for that purpose. For example, we raised the deficit ratio for this year by 0.2 percentage point to 2.8 percent, which is below the international warning line of 3 percent. In addition, we can also resort to quantitative or pricing tools like required reserve ratios and interest rates. We are not going for monetary easing, but trying to provide effective support to the real economy. Facing new circumstances, we will stay firmly grounded in China's realities and take a long-term view. We will do our best to keep China's economic growth stable and maintain the sound momentum of the economic development for the long run. China's economy will remain an anchor of stability for the global economy.

                'ASEAN model' of innovation hailed as key to meeting SDGs
            </a>
            <p>
                Southeast Asia offers concrete proof that novel and localized models can help solve some of the most pressing social and development problems, a senior official said on Thursday.According to Kung Phoak, Association of Southeast Asian Nations' deputy secretary-general for ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community, local communities, social enterprises and nonprofit groups in ASEAN have shown that inclusive innovation is the key to meeting sustainable development goals, or SDGs.The SDGs, which were approved in 2015 by 193 member states of the United Nations, aim to address the world's most pressing problems by 2030. The 17 goals include ending poverty and hunger, reducing maternal deaths and providing universal access to basic education."Our region is a fertile ground for boundless innovation. This kind of innovation responds to the specific needs of the people," Phoak said at the closing of a symposium on the SDGs.The symposium, which was held in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi, was organized by ASEAN, the Chinese mission to ASEAN and the United Nations Development Programme.Phoak said the presentations, field visits and discussions held in Hanoi showed that the symposium's participants have a "collective understanding" that innovation can spring from various sources."Innovation includes rather than marginalizes and has the potential of bringing people together," he said.This kind of innovation is the "ASEAN model", according to Miguel Musngi, senior officer at the poverty eradication and gender division of the ASEAN Secretariat.Musngi cited the "innovation hubs" in Hanoi and how they are helping and empowering disadvantaged groups.Other organizations from Southeast Asia also made presentations on how they are solving social issues in ways that are more customized to the needs of the local communities.Phoak from ASEAN also cited China's contribution to ASEAN's goal to meet its SDGs."China has consistently helped ASEAN in realizing the SDGs," he said, noting that members of the regional bloc "learned a lot of from China's experience in eradicating poverty and inclusive innovation".China's Ambassador to ASEAN Huang Xilian said China's success in lifting more than 700 million from poverty is due to country's people-centered policy, noting that the government is committed to providing a better life and shared prosperity.He said China is an "active participant and contributor to global cooperation against poverty" and will continue to support other developing countries to slash poverty incidence.
