            <p>Trump Plaza</p>
            <p>Trump Plaza New Rochelle is a 40-story luxury residence located in downtown New Rochelle, New York. It was built by Cappelli Enterprises, the same developer that built Trump Tower at City Center in nearby White Plains. Trump Plaza was the tallest building in Westchester County and the tallest building between New York City and Albany until the completion of the 44-story, twin-towered Ritz-Carlton hotel in White Plains.Trump Plaza is part of a massive downtown redevelopment project that began with the construction of New Roc City in 1999.[3] The project encompasses Parcel 1A and the Lawton Street Redevelopment block known as Le Count Square. Located at 175 Huguenot Street, Trump Plaza is built on the 2-acre (8,100 m2), Parcel 1A site which the City of New Rochelle had sought to redevelop for more than 30 years. In 2008 Cappelli Enterprises will begin development of 'Le Count Square' opposite Trump Plaza, adding 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of hotel, office, retail and residential space to the area. With the development of Trump Plaza and LeCount Square, Cappelli's total investment in downtown New Rochelle will exceed $1 billion.[4],The 353,600-square-foot (32,850 m2) Trump Plaza consists of 138,000 square feet (12,800 m2) of retail space on two levels at its base, topped with a luxury condominium tower.[5] Trump Plaza rises more than 435 feet (133 m) over downtown New Rochelle. The retail portion of the project will be linked to New Roc City by an enclosed pedestrian bridge</p>
