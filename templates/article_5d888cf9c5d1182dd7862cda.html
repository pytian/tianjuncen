            <p class="style-content">
                ZHENGZHOU - Chinese President Xi Jinping called for concerted efforts to promote ecological protection and high-quality development of the Yellow River.Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks while chairing a symposium Wednesday during his inspection tour to Henan province."The protection of the Yellow River is critical to the great rejuvenation and sustainable development of the Chinese nation," said Xi, adding that it is a major national strategy.Noting that the peace of the Yellow River is significant to the stability of China, Xi said Chinese people have struggled against the floods and droughts of the Yellow River since ancient times, and the Party and the state have attached great importance to the harnessing and development of the Yellow River after the founding of New China in 1949.Originating in Qinghai province, the Yellow River, known as China's "Mother River" and the cradle of the Chinese civilization, runs through nine provinces and autonomous regions including Shaanxi and Henan before emptying into the Bohai Sea in East China's Shandong province.The river got its name Huanghe in Chinese because of its yellow, muddy water, which appears as it runs through the Loess Plateau in Northwest China.The 5,464-km-long waterway feeds about 12 percent of China's population, irrigates about 15 percent of arable land, supports 14 percent of national GDP, and supplies water to more than 60 cities.Xi also pointed out difficulties and problems in protecting the Yellow River, including fragile ecological environment, severe condition of the water resources preservation and development quality that needs to be improved.

                    A father's visit to his daughter in Hangzhou
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                My jaw dropped and all I could say was, "Wow," after 36 hours traveling from my hometown, Ahuachapan, 100 kilometers west of El Salvador's capital, San Salvador.Although I am used to long distance traveling, this was my first visit to an Asian country, China, and I was in Shanghai. I was impressed by all the skyscrapers above me, the city's modern well-signaled highways (many in English) and the crowds of people walking and touring along the Bund.For me, it was like an epiphany. Even though the US and Europe have always impressed me with their progress and development compared with other countries (especially developing countries like mine), this encounter made me realize there is a large part of the world I had no idea about at all.After graduating from college, my kid had been working here for a year as a teacher and I intended to find out if all her stories – and what the internet says – are true.After two days in Shanghai, visiting places like the Oriental Pearl Tower and the Financial District shopping at the famous Nanjing Road, we started our trip to where my daughter lives, Hangzhou.When we arrived, she led us to her apartment, just across the street from the Zhejiang University of Technology. Although it was not as developed as Shanghai in 2016 – no English street signs, only Chinese characters – the people were so friendly they immediately made me feel welcome and appreciated.Everyone we met was respectful to my daughter and to me by extension: I was her baba and in China, that counts for a lot! Even though I was 55 at the time, according to Western standards not that old, elders are treated with a kind of special respect here. I appreciated that, and in return I would provide the same treatment to whomever we met.Although there were the expected cultural differences, I learned that family is of great importance in China, as in Latin America, particularly El Salvador. All this made me feel very comfortable and safe about my daughter living here. She could teach a lot, but possibly learn even more from Chinese people than we ever imagined.Little did I know that this was going to be the city in China with which I would fall deeply fall in love.I was amazed the first time I saw the West Lake of Hangzhou. Every story I'd heard about it didn't come even close to describing the beauty of its calm waters and its relaxing walking trails, well-kept gardens and surrounding pagodas. The city almost encircles it, so it's like an oasis in the middle of a frantic and continuously growing city.Visited by thousands every day, all year long, I would undoubtedly nominate it as one of the seven natural wonders of the world. A breathtaking view from the fifth level of the beautiful Leifeng Pagoda gave me confirmation of this.Afterwards, to relax a little and grab a bite, we visited the famous Long Jing Village, one of the finest green tea plantations in China. Coming from an intensive quality-coffee growing country, it was an all-new but somehow familiar experience that really delighted me because of the similarities between our two highly regarded drinks.After a six-hour ride on a high-speed train covering the 1,200 kilometers to Beijing, sometimes at 330 kilometers per hour, and a car drive a little way up north, I was facing the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall. The world's largest man-made structure built many centuries ago was more than I could ask for.Using the state-of-the-art funicular to climb to the top, it was inspiring to walk by and absorb the beauty of the landscape. All these experiences moved me to make myself the promise to return to China and learn from its noble people and their ancient culture, only that time I would learn to speak some Chinese.

                The Neighborhood Warming Initiatives 2019, part of Beijing Design Week, is to focus on the renovation of hutong (alleyway lined with traditional residences in Beijing) and quadrangle courtyards and residents' participation in building management. The event, between Sept 10-20, aims to preserve the local housing in historical and cultural blocks in a way that also satisfies modern lifestyle demands, its organizers said. They added it comprises nearly 100 activities such as exhibitions and forums. The Master Zeng's Time Photo Studio invited 10 couples born in 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded, and took wedding photos for them. The studio activity also showcased designers' work for improving hutong residents' life quality and their emotional connections. The reception room of Baitasi Block co-hosted an activity in cooperation with Beijing Pagoda Light International Youth Hostel, inviting visitors and local residents to interact by preparing Beijing and Western food. The interaction activity can help tourists learn about culture and life in Beijing, an internationally acclaimed tourist destination, and promote neighborly relations in the new era, the organizers said. The Beijing Green Corridors 2020 exhibitions have been held four times since 2016. This year's theme is landscape inside and outside Beijing. The 2019 exhibitions displayed design results of the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway green landscape; the historical Nanluoguxiang neighborhood, a busy south-north commercial area hidden among hutong; and the ancient Changxindian town in Beijing's Fengtai district. Hutong is a cultural symbol of Beijing. There was an exhibition showing the daily life of Bing Yi, a modern artist, in hutong in Dongcheng district. By displaying how life in hutong brought vitality to her life and work, the exhibition aimed to introduce visitors to a new hutong lifestyle and to increase the use and social value of preserved residential blocks. The initiatives are held in different venues in the Baitasi historical and cultural conservation area located in Xicheng district. They can be dated back to the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). The area is home to a white pagoda in Miaoying Temple built in the Yuan Dynasty; a former residence of late renowned writer Lu Xun; a market selling flowers, birds, fish and insects; and quadrangle courtyards in a combination of Chinese and Western architectural art. The area is in an old neighborhood and one of the few existing residential areas featuring low buildings in the ancient capital. It is seeking a new path for urban improvement and community revitalization, local people said. The initiatives are part of the Baitasi Remade Plan to realize Beijing's overall plan for 2016-35. The Baitasi plan aims to explore ways to improve the public environment and help regional revitalization. Its purpose is to maintain the residential role of hutong and traditional quadrangle courtyards. Meanwhile, it is to create new cultural blocks featuring elements such as design, cultural creativity and exhibitions. (China Daily 09/20/2019 page19)

                I recently sat in a children's classroom, clutching a spear, and stretching and rubbing my aching body.I'd joined a lesson for kids studying Peking Opera for a documentary shoot.And I was quickly realizing that performing this genre is not only more difficult but also more painful than it looks.

                An old Chinese instrument is making its presence felt in many places and is winning hearts.Sit down and listen to her for just a few minutes, and the sweet sound of this lady of uncertain provenance may well strike your heartstrings.In ancient Persia they knew her as santur, among modern-day English speakers she is dulcimer - from the Latin for sweet melody - and when she reached China she became yangqin.The English name's etymology accurately reflects the timbre of the dulcimer, its two hammers striking the strings on its trapezoidal board.Dulcimer players can conjure diverse moods, hence the instrument's frequent appearances in film scores, from portraying scenes of everyday life to creating a sense of mystery in epic fantasies. The instrument's exact origin remains an enigma and can only be roughly traced back to somewhere in the Middle East thousands of years ago. It is believed to have come to China from the Persian Empire through the Silk Road about 400 years ago, in the late Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).In China it was localized and named yangqin, which meant foreign instrument, and gradually took a central role in Chinese folk ensembles, similar to that of the piano in an orchestra. As with pianos, usually only one yangqin is required in a concert, but at the third International Dulcimer Music Festival in Beijing recently the audience was treated to the uncommon presence of more than 30 yangqin on the same stage being played by musicians from around the world.

                    Modern US musician handpicks traditional Chinese instruments

                NEW YORK - Justin Scholar, a New Jersey native, has earned his name as the "Chinese instruments guy" at the annual Philadelphia Folk Festival as he brings a Chinese instrument every year to let people try."This year I brought a zhongruan (Chinese plucked string instrument) to entertain the guitarists because it's shaped like a guitar. And some people really pick it up quite quickly," Scholar told Xinhua in New York after he returned from the outdoor music festival held at the Old Pool Farm, about 56 kilometers outside of Philadelphia last month.Two clear goals The 26-year-old musician has previously presented Chinese instruments including guzheng, bawu, hulusi, sheng and erhu at the event."Even though I can't share the traditional Chinese tunes, the new instruments are enough of a fun experience," he said. "The children and non-musical folk really seem to enjoy it, and some people have bought their own guzheng after trying.""Their (musicians) unabated passion for the preservation of folk music means they are incredibly curious about the folk music that is rarer or less represented; that's where I thrive," said Scholar."I always invite people to come sit in and learn about it and try it and you'll be amazed at how some Americans who have never heard of this instrument before can figure out how to play on their own with no more instruction," he said.Scholar had his heart stolen by Chinese instruments ever since he made his first trip to Shanghai in 2015 through a study-abroad program when he was a student in New York University."I find the guzheng is my most inspirational tool of expression, and the seeming lack of experimentation with the instrument is what I aim to change," he said."I have two clear goals as a musician," he said. "In China, I hope to reinvent the guzheng for a younger audience by producing new music influenced by jazz and folk and singing in English.""My second goal is to introduce guzheng to the West, which is why I am here," he said. "I find the guzheng is the most accessible instrument for non-musicians to create beautiful sound."Scholar said his musical style can be described as "meditative and serene at times, or melancholic and expressive other times. It depends on the song.""I hope one day that many people will hear my music, especially the thousands of guzheng players, and that they will be encouraged to try writing their own music and freestyling while learning to express themselves," he said.

                The recent China International Film& TV Program Exhibition showed how determined domestic producers are to make inroads into overseas markets, Xu Fan reports.For most Chinese fans, it was a shock to see Mei Changsu, the protagonist of the TV series Nirvana in Fire, a royal period drama set in ancient China, "speaking" Spanish fluently.Interestingly, the character-a leader of a group of swordsmen-can also "speak" English and a few more other languages.These are all different foreign language-dubbed versions of Nirvana in Fire, a phenomenal worldwide hit show that has garnered more than 16 billion views online.Earlier this year, the TV series remade with a Spanish voice-over aired in Argentina and Mexico, making it the first commercially successful Chinese television program released in either of the two countries.During the 16th China International Film & TV Program Exhibition, the drama was highlighted alongside a string of television productions for making successful forays into overseas markets.The annual showbiz event held in Beijing from Sept 11-12 attracted industry insiders, producers and distributors from over 300 organizations from more than 50 countries and regions.Over 80,000 episodes of TV dramas, documentaries and animation series were on display at the event, according to the organizers.Its 93 booths, which covered 22,000 square meters at the China National Convention Center, also featured forums on the internationalization of Chinese tales.Statistics from the National Radio and Television Administration, the country's top regulator, show that more than 1,600 domestic TV shows have been translated into 36 languages and shown in over 100 countries and regions in recent decades.With the rapid development of China's television industry, the country has seen a steady rise in TV content exports year-on-year, says Ma Li, the director-general of the international cooperation department with the administration, at a forum during the exhibition.Speaking about domestic dramas that have made a big splash or broken records overseas, Ma says that the series "had opened a window for overseas audiences, enabling them to develop a more comprehensive understanding of China".She also says that the administration had launched a project, which started in August and will run until October, to broadcast 70 quality works through more than 60 mainstream media platforms and streaming sites in around 50 nations.
