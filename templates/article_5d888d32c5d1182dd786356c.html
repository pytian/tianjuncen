                Economic sanctions are human rights violations
            </p>
            <p>
                Anelise Borges, a Euronews international correspondent, told a tragic story from Tehran on Wednesday about a seven-year-old Iranian boy who needs a bone marrow transplant to cure a deadly genetic disease known as Andrenoleukodystrophy, or ALD.But due to renewed US economic sanctions imposed after US President Donald Trump withdrew his country from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the treatment was made impossible. The boy's health has been deteriorating fast. He has become nearly blind and deaf, can no longer walk and has to be fed a liquid diet.The family can do nothing but give the boy all their love. As a parent myself, it was heartbreaking to watch the boy's father, with tears in his eyes, describing his son's helpless situation.Covering the 42ndsession of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva early this week, I did not hear any condemnation of economic sanctions as a serious violation of human rights. But it is time to call it what it is.US leaders, past and present, like to tout the effects of their crippling sanctions on countries such as Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Syria. They claim that economic sanctions deprive some governments of the money to develop nuclear weapons, pressure their leaders to change course and defend human rights, freedom and democracy.I am not defending every policy of these governments. But the US and many other Western countries are indeed good at hijacking the moral high ground.What is true is that none of these sanctioned countries has surrendered to Washington after decades living under maximum pressure. In the case of Cuba, the US economic embargo has been imposed for nearly 60 years and is now widely regarded as a debacle, even among many in the US.When US economic sanctions cause skyrocketing inflation and unemployment in Iran and other countries, it is ordinary people who are collectively punished by the US administration.Iran's GDP grew 13.4 percent in 2016 after easing of sanctions as a result of the nuclear deal, but the World Bank forecast Iran's economy will contract 4.5 percent this year, largely as a result of renewed US sanctions.In an interview with Borges, an Iranian doctor talked about a shortage of medicine and medical equipment despite the fact they are supposed to be spared from sanctions. Most global companies, fearing potential US reprisal, have suspended business in Iran.If sanctions have worked as US leaders claimed, they have worked as a tool to impoverish the local population and deny them food, medicine, education and a normal life.The boy Borges discussed is just one of the tens of thousands of heartbreaking stories resulting from US economic sanctions. And if these are not human rights violations, what are they?So when US officials, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, say the US stands with the Iranian people, I doubt he dares look into the eyes of that boy's father.The international community needs to pay more attention to the suffering of ordinary people under harsh economic sanctions.Since 1991, the UN General Assembly has condemned the US embargo on Cuba every year. When the 74thsession of the UNGA opens in New York next week, there is no better time to look into the devastating effect on ordinary people caused by economic sanctions.Sanctions, though there are no bombs dropped or shots fired, constitute an act of war. And though it isn't a true shooting war, the damage done to innocent people is no different.The author is chief of China Daily EU Bureau based in Brussels.

                Elkeson's instant impact
            </a>
            <p>
                Brazil-born forward stars as Team China romps to morale-boosting win in MaldivesChina's controversial talent naturalization policy paid immediate dividends as Marcello Lippi's squad got its 2022 World Cup qualification campaign off to a flying start on Tuesday.Roared on by a large contingent of traveling fans, China's Brazil-born forward Elkeson proved the difference maker, netting two goals in his debut as the visitor romped to a 5-0 victory over the Maldives at Rasmee Dhandu Stadium in Male.China's other newly naturalized player, London-born Nico Yennaris, aka Li Ke, also contributed with a late cameo off the bench on a night when Lippi made good on his pre-match pronouncements that fans would finally see a more convincing performance from his charges.Elkeson, the first player without Chinese heritage to don the red jersey, took center stage on his historic night with his late brace capping an impressive all-round display.At the final whistle, the Guangzhou Evergrande star and Yennaris draped themselves in the national flag before soaking up an appreciative reception from hundreds of red-clad traveling fans."I am very satisfied with today's result; taking all three points is just the first step of our campaign for the tournament," Lippi told the post-match media conference after a win that sent China to the top of Group A."Elkeson's partnership with Wu Lei is a strong combination for our attack. His two goals in the second half showed his class and I am happy with the our overall fighting mentality today."After Wu Xi's 33rd-minute header broke the deadlock, Espanyol's Wu Lei extended China's lead on the stroke of halftime.Yang Xu maintained the momentum by converting a 64th-minute penalty before Elkeson's double rounded out the scoring.China will likely face a tougher test in its next match, when it hosts Guam in Guangzhou on Oct 10 in a group that also features Syria and the Philippines.The eight winners of each group and the four best runners-up will advance to a final qualifying round to compete for three direct berths for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.Having not qualified since a sole appearance at the 2002 finals, China decided to embark on the controversial naturalization route, copying the likes of Qatar and Japan.Despite concerns over the public reaction, the Chinese Football Association has targeted a total of nine players who are either already eligible for selection or are in the middle of the paper work.Still, the policy remains a sensitive subject."It's quite a struggle personally for me to consider to use naturalized players on the national team as I originally disagreed with this idea," new CFA president Chen Xuyuan said after being elected to the post last month."That's a compromise we had to make to realize our imminent goal of qualifying for Qatar. But it's not going to be part of our long-term strategy and we will only field a limited number of naturalized players as key supplements to our homegrown roster."After stepping down as China's coach following a failed campaign to reach the 2018 World Cup finals in Russia, Italian guru Lippi returned to the post in June, reportedly on condition that the CFA gave the go-ahead for naturalized players.The flair and goals that Elkeson's inclusion has instantly added up front will go a long way to silencing any opposition to the policy.Meanwhile, the sight of Elkeson singing the national anthem before kickoff and a video posted on Weibo showing his son cheering him up by saying "Jia You! Ai Kesen!" will no doubt further endear him to the Chinese public."It was a special day for my career to be able to suit up for a national team and to score for my adopted home country in my debut," Elkeson said through an interpreter after the match.The 30-year-old forward, who signed with CSL giant Evergrande in 2012 and has played a major role in the southern club winning three league titles and two AFC Champions League crowns, said he is learning Mandarin and is anxious to embrace Chinese culture.His Brazilian compatriot and Evergrande teammate Paulinho, who is said to be on CFA's naturalization radar, congratulated Elkeson in an Instagram post, saying "You well deserve it!", accompanied by a photo of Elkeson holding the national flag.Some fans, however, still remain opposed to the notion that a player with no family links to China can pull on the red jersey."I don't think it's a good idea to bring in players without any Chinese ancestry," said Zhao Wen, leader of a Beijing Guo'an fan group."Culture-wise and emotionally, it's hard for the fans to see Chinese soccer represented by totally non-Chinese players, no matter how competitive they are."

                Sanctions put human rights in crosshairs
            </a>
            <p>
                Anelise Borges, a Euronews international correspondent, told a tragic story from Teheran on Sept 11 about a 7-year-old Iranian boy who needs a bone marrow transplant to cure a deadly genetic disease known as adrenoleukodystrophy.ALD is a result of fatty acid buildup caused by enzymes not functioning properly, which damages the sleeves of fatty tissue protecting nerve cells, resulting in seizures and hyperactivity.Due to renewed US economic sanctions imposed after US President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal, treatment was not possible, because of shortages of medicine and medical equipment in Iran.In the Euronews interview, an Iranian doctor talked about the shortages of medicine and equipment, which are spared from sanctions. Nonetheless, many global companies, fearing potential US reprisal, have suspended business in the country.The boy's health has been deteriorating quickly. He has become nearly blind and deaf, can no longer walk and has to be fed a liquid diet.The family can do nothing but give the boy all their love. It was heartbreaking to watch the boy's father, with tears in his eyes, describing his son's helpless situation.Covering the 42nd session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva early last week, I did not hear any condemnation of economic sanctions as a serious human rights violation. But it is time to call them what they are.The good news is that on Thursday, the council convened a biennial panel discussion on unilateral coercive measures and human rights, where officials and experts discussed the negative impact of such coercive measures on human rights.United States leaders, past and present, like to tout the effects of their sanctions on countries such as Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Syria. They claim that economic sanctions deprive some governments of the money to develop nuclear weapons, pressure their leaders to change course and defend human rights, freedom and democracy.I am not defending every policy of these governments.

And though it isn't a true shooting war, the damage done to innocent people is no different.When the 74th session of the UN General Assembly opens in New York on Tuesday, there is no better time to look into the devastating effect on ordinary people caused by economic sanctions.The author is chief of China Daily's EU Bureau in Brussels.

                Summit held to address Syrian crisis

                Erdogan hosts Putin and Rouhani in Ankara in bid to secure a lasting truceANKARA - The leaders of Turkey, Russia and Iran were scheduled to meet on Monday to try to secure a lasting truce in northwest Syria following attacks by the Syrian government that risk deepening regional turmoil and pushing a new wave of migrants toward Turkey.The summit in Ankara, bringing together countries whose Syrian allies are combatants in a ruinous eight-year-old war, will focus on the Idlib region, the last remaining territory held by rebels seeking to overthrow the Syrian government.All three leaders are expected to hold one-on-one meetings before the summit, the Kremlin said.They will also hold a closing news conference with a view to presenting a joint declaration.Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iran's Hassan Rouhani have backed the Syrian government against the rebels. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, along with US, European and Arab allies, has supported different rebel factions in the conflict.Syrian government forces, aided by Russian air power, have regained control of most lands lost in the war. In recent months, government troops have attacked Idlib, where Syrian and foreign radical fighters hold sway alongside other more moderate factions.Under a deal with Moscow and Teheran two years ago, Turkey set up 12 military observation posts in northwest Syria aimed at reducing fighting between government forces and rebels. The Turkish military posts have recently been caught in the crossfire due to the Syrian offensive in the region."A large number of terrorists are still present in this zone, ... and fighters continue to fire on the positions of government forces," Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov said on Friday.The Turkish president's office has said the leaders would discuss the latest developments in Syria as well as "ensuring the necessary conditions for the voluntary return of refugees and discussing the joint step to be taken in the period ahead with the aim of achieving a lasting political solution".The fighting in northwestern Syria has also raised the risk of a new migrant wave toward Turkey, which currently hosts about 3.6 million Syrian refugees.The United Nations has said that more than 500,000 people have been uprooted in Syria since late April, most of them escaping deeper into the rebel bastion and toward the Turkish border.While Erdogan has said that Turkey could not handle such an influx of refugees, he has also previously threatened to "open the gates" for migrants to Europe unless Ankara receives more international support.Migration focused On Friday, Erdogan reiterated his warning and said Monday's summit would aim to stop migration from Idlib and establish a cease-fire to prevent any further civilian casualties."The expectation here is not a momentary cease-fire. First, it is to put a stop to the migration here," he told Reuters in an interview. "Second, to ensure a cease-fire here. Third, to seriously get terrorist organizations under control," he added."Turkey, which is hosting 3.6 million refugees at the moment, cannot take the millions of people that will arrive from there," Erdogan said. "We cannot carry that weight."Meanwhile, Turkey has other concerns regarding Syria.It has repeatedly threatened to launch a cross-border offensive against Syrian Kurdish forces, whom it sees as allied to Kurdish militants in its own territory.That has strained Turkey's relations with its NATO ally, the US, which backs the Syrian Kurds as the main fighting force against the Islamic State group.The US has vowed to work with Turkey to clear Kurdish forces away from its border, but Ankara says progress has so far been "cosmetic" and it could launch an operation into Syria by the end of this month.Turkey has conducted two previous offensives against the IS group in 2016 and the Kurdish People's Protection Units in 2018.Agencies

                          ANKARA, Turkey - The presidents of Turkey, Russia and Iran announced on Monday that an agreement has been finally reached on the composition of a committee tasked with rewriting Syria's constitution as part of a political solution to the country's civil war, now in its ninth year.              Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told journalists at the end of the meeting with Russia's Vladimir Putin and Iran's Hassan Rouhani in the Turkish capital Ankara that differences about one last committee member have been overcome, paving the way for the committee to start working as soon as possible.                  "We portrayed a constructive and flexible attitude to determine constitutional committee members and rules of procedure. We made an effort for the political process to move forward. In short, hitches regarding the establishment of the committee were eliminated by our mutual efforts," Erdogan said.                      The leaders did not provide a time frame for the committee - set to be made up of Syrian government and opposition figures - to begin its proceedings. The procedural rules still have to be worked out, Putin told reporters.                          "The proceedings must begin rapidly," Putin said. "Extremist groups may try and destroy this process because they do not want a final agreement since they gain money from war."                              Rouhani said he hoped for elections to take place in Syria in 2020 or 2021.                                  The leaders also agreed to de-escalate the volatile situation in Idlib - the last remaining rebel stronghold in Syria - while combating extremists and protecting civilians. A cease-fire that went into effect at the end of August has been holding despite some violations.                                      Idlib is dominated by the al-Qaida-linked group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. Syrian forces, backed by Russia, targeted the armed group in a four-month ground and air offensive.                                          Hundreds of thousands of Syrians, some already displaced from other parts of the country, have moved toward Turkey's border. A major conflict in Idlib has raised the possibility of a mass refugee flow to Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees.                                              "We cannot stand by and watch a new tragedy that would affect 4 million people right next to our border," Erdogan said. "Such a calamitous development would not only affect our country but also all of Europe."                                                  De-escalation zone                                                      A joint statement issued at the end of the meeting said the three leaders underscored the need "to fully implement" an agreement reached between Turkey and Russia last year for a de-escalation zone in Idlib.                                                          The statement said the sides had agreed to take concrete steps to reduce violations." They expressed alarm "about the risk of further deterioration of the humanitarian situation," according to the statement.                                                              "We all stand for Syria's territorial integrity and insist that after the problems of security and the fight against terrorists are resolved, Syria's territorial integrity will be fully restored. This concerns withdrawal of all foreign troops from Syria's territory," the statement said.
