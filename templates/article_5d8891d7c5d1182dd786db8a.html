                HANGZHOU -- A jade disk which dates back to the Liangzhu civilization more than 4,300 years ago has been unearthed in East China's Zhejiang province.The jade disk, with a diameter of more than 25 cm, was discovered in early July in Linghu township, Huzhou city. It is the largest such artifact discovered in the city, the local cultural relics department said.Experts have confirmed that the relic belongs to the Liangzhu civilization of ancient China. It was probably made in the late Liangzhu culture about 4,300 to 4,600 years ago. At that time, if a jade disk's diameter exceeded 24 cm, the piece would be considered a large one, said Fang Xiangming, researcher of the Zhejiang provincial institute of cultural relics and archaeology.Earlier this month, the Archaeological Ruins of Liangzhu city was inscribed to the UNESCO World Heritage List as a cultural site, bringing the total number of Chinese sites on the list to 55.The Liangzhu ruins, located in Zhejiang province, have gained the world's recognition as a testimony to the existence of at least 5,000 years of Chinese civilization.

                The 29th National Book Expo held in China's northwest, highlighted local literary legends, national history and the sciences, Mei Jia reports in Xi'an.The undoubted star of the 29th National Book Expo, which was held in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, from July 27 to Tuesday, was writer Jia Pingwa.He drew a big crowd of fans, with his name being called out wherever he turned during the four-day event.The Shaanxi native says, with a local accent, that he is working on a new novel with urban settings and themes."Most of my stories are about villages or villagers around the Qinling Mountains, or the differences in thought between generations of Chinese people throughout a century… I've been living in the city for decades. It's time to look at city life," the 67-year-old author said at a readers' meeting organized by the Writers Publishing House at the book expo."I insist that a writer stays connected (with society), while still enjoying some solitude and keeping a certain distance from the hustle and bustle," he said at another event, where he was presented with an "honorary writer" award by the People's Literature Publishing House.With his native village and his mother being his constant inspiration, Jia says he burst into tears upon a recitation of excerpts from an article about his mother on the first day of the expo.With a total 150 writers in attendance, the book expo attracted 412,000 visitors to more than 500 events. Enthusiastic readers purchased 512,000 books, totaling 21.9 million yuan ($3.17 million)."The expo has the largest exhibition area and the largest number of exhibitors in the history of national book expos," says Cheng Ningbo, director of the provincial Press and Publication Bureau.Cheng also says one highlight was the special area inside the main hall that presented 159 titles as publishers' summaries and presentations of the country's achievements over the past 70 years.

                    Hangzhou Theatre Festival presents global and home-grown creativity
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                From September 11 to 29, the Hangzhou International Theatre Festival will play host to 24 plays from China and abroad, including five uniquely immersive theater productions.The Golden Beetle, directed by Zhang Ziqi and Liao Shuyi, will open the festival, featuring female directors’ inner observations. The play will be held at the arts center of Liangzhu in northwestern suburb of Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, designed by Japanese Pritzker Prize-winning architect Tadao Ando.The Golden Beetle attaches a great importance to the performers’ body movements and multi-media presentation of imagination and creativity, creating a highly immersive experience, the festival’s artistic director, Meng Jinghui, said during a press meeting on Thursday in Beijing.Meng believes the power of the play lies in looking at the relationship between the individual and the collective, the dynamic and the static, as well as the connection between people and the environment they stay in.As one of China’s most influential theater directors himself, Meng has been leading the exploration of immersive theater works across the country, as shown by his 2015 work Mermaid Beside the Still Water and this year’s Stolen Heart. Both Zhang and Liao have also been participating in production of these two plays.Meng says this year’s event will be the first domestic theater festival that highlights immersive theater productions.Under Ice from Lithuania, welcomed by last year’s Festival OFF d’Avignon, part of the prominent Avignon Festival in France, and the Belgian piece The Forgotten Land, featuring Chernobyl’s nuclear catastrophe in 1986, as well as works from Brazil and Denmark will also be on show.Staged at the same time are also domestic experimental works created by the younger generation, alongside traditional Yueju Opera and Peking Opera works, both of which are inscribed on the list of national intangible cultural heritages.

                    Liangzhu sets jade-based ritual culture: Expert

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Liangzhu boasted the most developed jade culture in prehistoric China, an archaeological expert said."Liangzhu jade culture is much more mature compared with previous ones," Liu Bin, president of Zhejiang Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeological Research, told China Daily website in an interview.It was not until the Liangzhu period that a jade-based ritual system was established, he explained. Jade was used to worship the deity of the Liangzhu people. Previously, jade was commonly used to worship nature.He explained relationships among jade objects in appearance and function during the era in his book Ritual Tools and King Power: Jade of Liangzhu, part of the Liangzhu Civilization series published by Zhejiang University Press.A symbol of the deity-worshiped jade culture is its emblem, a human-shaped deity riding on an animal. It was used as a ubiquitous motif on jade pieces made during the era.Cong, a jade item that has a square outer section around a circular inner part and a circular hole, and bi, a disc-shaped jade piece, were invented by the Liangzhu people."Jade cong and bi were the most important objects during royal ceremonies held to offer sacrifices to heaven. They played a significant role in the ritual system of later dynasties," Liu said."The developed jade culture of Liangzhu tells us much about the religion, hierarchical structure, and art expression of the era," said Chen Tongbin, main drafter of the bidding document for the Liangzhu World Heritage Site application.Dating back 5,300 years, the archaeological ruins of Liangzhu in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, were inscribed onto the UNESCO World Heritage list in early July.

                HANGZHOU－The ancient civilization of Liangzhu, China's latest cultural site inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, has had its history recorded in middle school textbooks that are being used during the new school year that started on Monday.The archaeological discoveries of Liangzhu, including its unique water conservancy system and jade wares, have been compiled into the history textbooks published by the People's Education Publishing House for Grade 7 in China.In addition, the new high school mathematics textbooks use the carbon dating of the relics unearthed from the Liangzhu culture to explain the exponential and logarithmic functions.The ruins unearthed in East China's Zhejiang province bear the remnants of a 5,000-year-old civilization. It was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List on July 6."China has carried out more than 80 years of archaeological research at the Liangzhu site. With the Liangzhu ancient city as its core, the culture prospered between 5,300 years and 4,300 years ago in the Yangtze River Delta region," said Wang Wei, president of the Chinese Archaeological Society.He said the inclusion of the Liangzhu site in the textbooks helps foster a cultural confidence among young people and improves their awareness of cultural protection and heritage.Chen Shoutian, an official of the Liangzhu Site Administration in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang, said the Liangzhu ancient city ruins park would offer a field study area to expand cultural knowledge for students of different ages.Before the release of the textbooks, the Chinese publisher of the Zhejiang Juvenile and Children's Publishing House signed a copyright exporting agreement with two publishers from Egypt and Romania to promote an English-version children's book entitled "Ancient City of Liangzhu", which displays a panoramic view of Liangzhu in three parts－water, jade and city.The book is expected to be marketed in countries including the United Kingdom, Germany and France.Xinhua
