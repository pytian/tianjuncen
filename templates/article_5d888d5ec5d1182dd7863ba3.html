                Final words of Saudi journalist Khashoggi before death revealed by Turkish paper
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                ANKARA - Turkish newspaper Daily Sabah on Tuesday revealed the audio recordings of the final words of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered last October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The audios were obtained by Turkey's National Intelligence Organization right after the murder, and were shared with relevant Turkish authorities who carried out an investigation into the incident, said the report.The recordings included conversations between the killers of Khashoggi before his arrival at the consulate, who discussed plans to murder and dismember the Saudi journalist.After Khashoggi arrived at the consulate for his marriage procedures, Maher Mutreb, a member of the Saudi hit squad, was heard telling Khashoggi that he would be taken back to Riyadh based on an Interpol order against him, according to the transcripts.The hit squad also tried to force Khashoggi to send his son a message telling him not to worry if he did not hear from his father, which the slain journalist rejected, the report said."Help us, so that we can help you. Because in the end, we will take you to Saudi Arabia. And if you don't help us, you know what will happen in the end," Mutreb was heard saying later in the recordings.The report added that in the end, Khashoggi, who worked for The Washington Post, was apparently drugged and lost consciousness.The kingdom has put Mutreb and 10 others on non-public trials for their involvement in the murder.

                    A US-Iran military conflict unlikely
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Editor's Note: Iran announced on Friday that it would stop implementing some of the provisions of the 2015 nuclear deal with major powers to continue its nuclear research and development program. This is Iran's latest move to withdraw from the nuclear deal amid escalating tensions with the US. Two experts share their views on the US-Iran standoff with China Daily's Liu Jianna. Excerpts follow: Stalemate to continue for the time being Iran is relinquishing its commitments to the nuclear deal and rebooting its nuclear program bit by bit in a bid to force the United States to back down and ease the sanctions. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed on Monday that Iran was installing advanced centrifuges, saying it had "verified that the following centrifuges were either installed or being installed ... : 22 IR-4, one IR-5, 30 IR-6 and three IR-6". And despite France's efforts to mediate between the US and Iran, Teheran is unlikely to accept Paris's proposal of a $15 billion letter of credit in exchange for its full compliance with the nuclear deal. The reason is simple: agreeing to the proposal is tantamount to Iran disarming itself. The US president claims he doesn't seek for Iran's regime change, but what Washington is driving at is nothing less than forcing Teheran to commit suicide. The 12 demands US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo put forward last year, which include Iran scrapping all missile programs, ceasing regional expansion, not supporting Hezbollah and Hamas and not opposing Israel, basically mean Iran's complete surrender. Which Iran will never accept. The security team that helped the George W. Bush administration has become the main force prompting the incumbent US administration to adopt a more aggressive approach toward Teheran. Believing that Iran's expansion in the Middle East could threaten the security of its main allies Israel and Saudi Arabia and pose a challenge to the US' hegemony in the region, the US administration deems it necessary to push Iran into a corner. Furthermore, the US administration has strengthened its ties with Israel and Saudi Arabia. Besides, by increasing pressure on Teheran, Washington could persuade Riyadh to purchase more US weapons, which could help boost the US' manufacturing sector. The US-Iran standoff is expected to last for a while, but both sides will avoid a military confrontation. Iran hopes a Democratic Party candidate wins the 2020 US presidential election because Democrat president Barack Obama had signed the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, while the US aims to force Iran into giving unprecedented concessions by threatening military action against and imposing the most serious financial sanctions on the country. Ma Xiaolin, a professor at Zhejiang International Studies University Third-party mediation needed more than ever Despite Iran reducing its commitments to the nuclear deal and the US tightening sanctions on Iran, the situation in the Middle East has not gone out of control. The US intends to prolong the stalemate till Iran can no longer endure the economic pain, and Iran is putting up a strong fa?ade thanks to the pressure from the opposition forces at home. Yet the tools that Iran could wield to counterattack the US are indeed few. So Teheran has adopted an approach of gradually putting pressure on the US and its allies. But neither Iran nor the US wants a military confrontation. France inviting Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to the G7 Summit was quite a diplomatically significant move. It shows European countries such as France and Germany are becoming more independent as far as their foreign policies are concerned and more freely voicing their views on global and regional affairs - a development that is expected to strengthen in the near future. Indeed, the Middle East situation demands more effective third-party mediation, because preventing the situation from getting out of control not only suits the interests of the US and Iran but also other countries. Still, expecting the other signatories to the Iran nuclear deal to take concerted action would be impractical because not all of them would risk angering the US. So the stalemate will continue for some time. And domestic politics will largely determine the US' next move toward Iran. Li Weijian, a senior research fellow at the Center for West Asian and African Studies, and the Institute for Foreign Policy Studies, Shanghai Institutes for International Studies The views don't necessarily represent those of China Daily.

                    Saudi Arabia: Drone attacks knocked out half its oil supply
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - Yemen's Houthi rebels launched drone attacks on the world's largest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia and a major oil field Saturday, sparking huge fires and halting about half of the supplies from the world's largest exporter of oil.The attacks were the latest of many drone assaults on the kingdom's oil infrastructure assaults in recent weeks, but easily the most damaging. They raise concerns about the global oil supply and likely will further increase tensions across the Persian Gulf amid an escalating crisis between the US and Iran over its unraveling nuclear deal with world powers.The attacks resulted in "the temporary suspension of production operations" at the Abqaiq oil processing facility and the Khurais oil field, Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said in a statement carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency. The fires "were controlled," the statement said, and no workers were injured.The fires led to the interruption of an estimated 5.7 million barrels in crude supplies, according to the statement, which said part of that would be offset with stockpiles. The statement said Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil giant, would provide updated information in the next 48 hours.The Iranian-backed Houthis, who hold Yemen's capital, Sanaa, and other territory in the Arab world's poorest country, took responsibility for the attacks in the war against a Saudi-led coalition that has fought since 2015 to reinstate the internationally recognized Yemeni government. But the US blamed Iran, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeting, "There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.""Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply," Pompeo added.In a short address aired by the Houthi's Al-Masirah satellite news channel, military spokesman Yahia Sarie said the rebels launched 10 drones after receiving "intelligence" support from those inside the kingdom. He warned that attacks by the rebels would only get worse if the war continues."The only option for the Saudi government is to stop attacking us," Sarie said.Houthi rebels have been using drones in combat since the start of the Saudi-led war. The first appeared to be off-the-shelf, hobby-kit-style drones. Later, versions nearly identical to Iranian models turned up. Iran denies supplying the Houthis with weapons, although the UN, the West and Gulf Arab nations say Tehran does.UN investigators said the Houthis' new UAV-X drone likely has a range of up to 1,500 kilometers (930 miles). That puts the far reaches of both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in range.First word of Saturday's assault came in online videos of giant fires at the Abqaiq facility, some 330 kilometers (205 miles) northeast of the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Machine-gun fire could be heard in several clips alongside the day's first Muslim call to prayers, suggesting security forces tried to bring down the drones just before dawn. In daylight, Saudi state television aired a segment with its local correspondent near a police checkpoint, a thick plume of smoke visible behind him.President Donald Trump called Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to offer his support for the kingdom's defense, the White House said. The crown prince assured Trump that Saudi Arabia is "willing and able to confront and deal with this terrorist aggression," according to a news release from the Saudi Embassy in Washington.Saudi Aramco describes its Abqaiq oil processing facility in Buqyaq as "the largest crude oil stabilization plant in the world."The facility processes sour crude oil into sweet crude, then transports it onto transshipment points on the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea or to refineries for local production. Estimates suggest it can process up to 7 million barrels of crude oil a day. By comparison, Saudi Arabia produced 9.65 million barrels of crude oil a day in July."This is one of the biggest central processing facilities in the world. The Iran conflict is going to be hitting the world in a new way," said Kevin Book, managing director, research at ClearView Energy Partners LLC.The Khurais oil field is believed to produce over 1 million barrels of crude oil a day. It has estimated reserves of over 20 billion barrels of oil, according to Aramco.There was no immediate impact on global oil prices as markets were closed for the weekend. Benchmark Brent crude had been trading at just above $60 a barrel.While Saudi Arabia has taken steps to protect itself and its oil infrastructure, analysts had warned that Abqaiq remained vulnerable. The Rapidan Energy Group, a Washington-based advisory group, warned in May that "a successful attack could lead to a monthslong disruption of most Saudi production and nearly all spare production." It called Abqaiq, close to the eastern Saudi city of Dammam, "the most important oil facility in the world."In a report published Saturday, Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, noted that although Aramco officials have indicated that exports will resume in the next few days, "there is nothing to suggest that this is a one-off event and that the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels will forgo further strikes on Saudi sites."The war has become the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The violence has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine and killed more than 90,000 people since 2015, according to the US-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or ACLED, which tracks the conflict.The rebels have flown drones into the radar arrays of Saudi Arabia's Patriot missile batteries, according to Conflict Armament Research, disabling them and allowing the Houthis to fire ballistic missiles into the kingdom unchallenged. The Houthis launched drone attacks targeting Saudi Arabia's crucial East-West Pipeline in May. In August, Houthi drones struck Saudi Arabia's Shaybah oil field.Associated Press

                    Attacks on Saudi oil facilities cut half of kingdom's capacity, raise global concerns

                RIYADH -- Drone attacks on two Saudi Arabian oil production facilities on Saturday have halted about half of the supplies from the world's top exporter and raised global concerns over oil supplies.A "10-drone attack," for which Yemen's Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility, targeted Saudi state-owned oil company Aramco's facilities in Abqaiq in Eastern Province and the Hijrat Khurais oilfield on Saturday.Aramco's industrial security teams controlled and extinguished the fire before the flames spread.The attacks resulted in "the temporary suspension of production operations," Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said Sunday in a statement.After Saturday's attacks, Saudi Arabia saw production cut by 5.7 million barrels a day, according to Aramco.The country's total production hovers around 10 million barrels per day, with an average of 9.85 million barrels per day in August, data from the US Energy Information Administration show.An investigation has been launched, according to the Saudi Interior Ministry.The international community has voiced its condemnation of the attacks and concerns over the oil supply.On Saturday afternoon, US President Donald Trump spoke by phone with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, discussing the attacks and Saudi Arabia's self-defense, according to the White House.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran on Saturday, saying "there is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.""Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply," Pompeo said in a tweet.King Abdullah II of Jordan, in a phone call with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, expressed his condemnation of the drone attack, saying "the national security of Jordan and Saudi Arabia is one.""The security of the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and Saudi Arabia is inseparable. Any threat to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is seen as a threat to the stability and security of the UAE," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the United Arab Emirates said in a statement.The Houthis have recently stepped up drone attacks on Saudi Arabia, but most of the drones were intercepted by the kingdom's air defense systems.On Aug 17, Saudi Arabia said that a Houthi drone attack on its Aramco plant in Shaybah Oil Field caused a minor fire.In May, a Houthi drone attack damaged two oil pump stations of Saudi Aramco, according to the Saudi authorities."We promise to widen our attacks as long as the Saudi regime's aggression and economic blockade against our country continue," Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea was quoted as saying after Saturday's attacks.

                    Peace, not Iran, ought to be US target: China Daily editorial

                Drone attacks on one of the world's largest oil processing plants and a major oilfield in Saudi Arabia on Saturday sparked huge fires and halted about half of the supplies from the country, sounding a warning to all countries that they beef up security in and around their oil facilities to prevent such attacks and avoid triggering a new round of blame game between the United States and Iran.The attacks on Saudi Arabia's Abqaiq oil processing facility and Khurais oilfield disrupted the supply of about 5.7 million barrels of crude oil — more than 5 percent of the daily global supply — which Riyadh said would be offset with stockpiles.It is not difficult to imagine the concern of the international community and the global anger against those behind the drone attacks.Yet it is irresponsible for countries such as the US to jump to conclusions without having any evidence whatsoever to prove their claims. Although the Iran-backed Houthis, who control the Yemeni capital of Sana'a and other areas in the Arab world's poorest country, claimed responsibility for the attacks, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted: "There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen."Still, Pompeo blamed Iran for the attacks, alleging that, "Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply".Is there a reason to believe Washington is simply using the attacks to vent its spleen against Teheran?Saturday's attacks were not the first on oil facilities in a Middle East country. Such facilities have been targeted, albeit on a smaller scale, over the past few months with the flaring up of tensions between Washington and Teheran.This is therefore the right time for the international community to give a clarion call to defuse tensions in the Middle East given that the global energy supply is at stake. With the US putting "maximum pressure" on Iran, the security outlook for the region, the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz in particular, has become increasingly bleak.Washington has already dealt a severe blow to the prospects of peace and stability in the Middle East by pulling out of the multilateral Iran nuclear deal last year. But contrary to its belief, it will not benefit by stoking conflicts in the Middle East. Instead, it will also be scaled by the fire it sparks in the region to fulfill its own narrow political and economic gains.
