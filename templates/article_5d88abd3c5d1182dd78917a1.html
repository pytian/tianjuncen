                Foreign firms optimistic about Chinese market
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                BEIJING - Despite of international economic uncertainties, China has maintained stable economic growth and the Chinese market remains the favorite of many foreign firms.A group of corporate giant leaders gathered in Beijing over the weekend, discussing business prospects and voicing their confidence in China for its position as an irreplaceable market and beyond."For us, China's not simply a large-scale consumer market, but also an important source of innovation as well as a major element of the industrial value chain," said Jochen Goller, president & CEO of BMW Group Region China, during a special session of the China Development Forum which concluded Saturday in Beijing.In the first seven months of this year, BMW saw car sales up 16.6 percent year on year to some 404,000 units in the highly-competitive Chinese market. "This strong performance is reinforcing our confidence to further grow with China, and as a result, BMW is taking decisive actions to significantly increase our investment as well as enlarging our footprint," Goller said.The moves include full upgrading of research and development bases in China and enhancing cooperation with local enterprises such as China Unicom and Tencent in autonomous, connected, electrified and shared areas to better embrace the global auto industry's major transformation, he said."Our commitment is constantly evolving, from Production in China to Create in China," Goller said. "The development of BMW is an excellent showcase of how an open economy can benefit all stakeholders.""More investment," "deeper integration" and "more localization" were frequently used by executives of foreign firms when describing their development plans in China at the session, which was themed "Trade, openness and shared prosperity" and also attended by government officials and renowned scholars.Pascal Soriot, CEO of pharmaceutical multinational AstraZeneca, said the company now exports medicines to 80 countries from China and is building an international life science innovation park in east China's Jiangsu Province to attract companies from around the world to develop their technologies and make discoveries."Our contribution to global innovations as a company has been through expanding our footprint in China," he said.Matthew Echols, a corporate vice president of Coca-Cola, said the U.S. beverage giant is encouraged by China's efforts in improving its business environment such as the launch of new pilot free trade zones and the upcoming implementation of foreign investment law and is proud of its strong production innovation capabilities in China.According to the latest annual survey conducted by the U.S.-China Business Council, a group with 220 U.S. companies as its members, the vast majority of U.S. companies report that their China operations are profitable, and they remain committed to the Chinese market which has priority over other markets due to its comparative significance as a driver of revenue growth.Zhang Xinsheng, executive chairman of Shell Companies in China, said the Chinese market still has a wealth of untapped potential and the energy company is benefiting from China's new round of opening-up measures, including easing access to the upstream exploration of its oil and natural gas resources by scrapping joint-venture restrictions."China has made solid and encouraging efforts in improving the business environment, which created more opportunities for foreign investors and offers more choices to consumers," Zhang said.Foreign direct investment (FDI), a key yardstick to measure an economy's potential, into Chinese mainland expanded 7.3 percent year on year in the January-July period, while FDI in July alone was up 8.7 percent year on year, higher than the 8.5 percent growth in June, according to the Ministry of Commerce.Attendees at the session also expressed enthusiasm toward China's consumers. Zhu Xiaojing, president of dairy nutrition company Fonterra Greater China, said a factor driving the continuously growing investment in China by multinational companies like Fonterra is the country's increasingly brand-savvy consumers."We are seeing a generation of young consumers who have stronger emotional connections to brands, a shift from simple cost-effectiveness to the pursuit of brands," Zhu said. "The next decade will see the emergence of great brands in China."

                    China Unicom, Telecom announce 5G cooperation
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China Unicom and China Telecom said on Monday they will work together to build one nationwide 5G network as the country's second- and third-largest telecom operators join hands to reduce construction costs for fifth-generation wireless technology.The two companies claimed they will jointly build and share network infrastructure to offer the same level of service.All three major Chinese telecom operators — China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom — co-own China Tower Corp, which makes it easier for China Unicom and China Telecom to cooperate on building 5G base stations.Besides offering a way to reduce the high cost of building 5G networks, the new agreement will also help ease operator pressures, especially as the domestic telecom services market is contracting.Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Information Consumption Alliance, a telecom industry association, explained that given the government's push to boost speed and reduce mobile data tariffs, operators are under certain pressures and it is difficult to see steady growth in revenue."5G construction will not only bring operators opportunities and new streams of revenue, but also boost development of the whole industry and economic growth," Xiang said during a recent interview with China Daily.Based on their total number of 4G base stations, China Unicom and China Telecom will work together to build 5G networks in 15 cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Nanjing in Jiangsu province.China Unicom will independently build 5G networks in 9 cities in Guangdong province, five cities in Zhejiang province and eight northern regions, including Hebei, Henan, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Shandong, Shanxi and the Inner Mongolia autonomous region. China Telecom, meanwhile, will build 5G networks in 10 cities of Guangdong province, five cities in Zhejiang province and 17 southern provinces.

                China Unicom, China Telecom team up to accelerate rollout of the superfast techThe joint push by China Unicom and China Telecom to build one nationwide 5G network is expected to accelerate the rollout of superfast wireless technology in the country, but its impact on upstream telecom equipment makers remains to be seen, analysts said on Tuesday.Ma Jihua, an independent analyst who has been following the telecom industry for more than a decade, said the move will undoubtedly reduce the construction costs for 5G given the current financial pressure faced by China Unicom and China Telecom."It will speed up the rollout for the two companies' 5G services by cutting duplicate investment, and this will also accelerate the shipments of telecom equipment," Ma said.The remarks came after the second and the third largest telecom operator in the country announced in a rare move on Monday their cooperation on building and sharing 5G network infrastructure.The two companies' shares on the Hong Kong bourse jumped following the announcement.China Unicom shares rose almost 5 percent to settle on Tuesday at its highest level in two months at HK$8.44($1.08). The shares of China Telecom also ended at a two-month peak, rising 4.74 percent to close at HK$3.76.Under the agreements inked by the two companies, China Unicom and China Telecom will work together to build 5G networks in 15 cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Nanjing in Jiangsu province, based on their total number of 4G base stations.China Unicom will also independently build 5G networks in nine cities in Guangdong province, five cities in Zhejiang province and more cities in another eight provinces and regions. China Telecom, for its part, will build 5G networks in 10 cities of Guangdong province, five cities in Zhejiang province and cities in another 17 provinces and regions.China International Capital Corporation Limited said in a research note the partnership between China Unicom and China Telecom will significantly relieve the financial pressure on the two companies. The acceleration of the 5G rollout will also bring benefits to telecom equipment makers such as Huawei Technologies Co and ZTE Corp."Currently, China Mobile, the country's largest telecom operator, has as many 4G base stations as those of China Unicom and China Telecom combined. That could also be the case in terms of 5G base stations in the future," the research note added.Last year, the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government think tank, forecast that the country's telecom carriers are expected to spend 900 billion to 1.5 trillion yuan ($127 billion to $211 billion) on 5G network construction from 2020 to 2025.The cooperation deal though sparked worries that the total investment size on 5G will be reduced sharply since the two major players will only build one network instead of two separate networks as originally expected. If that is the case, it could be bad news for Huawei and ZTE.Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Information Consumption Alliance, a telecom industry association, said it remains to be seen how the move will affect telecom equipment makers' businesses.

                TAIYUAN - China's largest hard coal producer Yangquan Coal Industry Group has inked a framework agreement with China Mobile and Huawei on promoting 5G-based intelligent mining.The new alliance, based on their advantages in 5G and underground mining, is expected to explore the applications of the 5G network in coal mine communication, management, safety production and monitoring, said Wang Yongge, general manager of the mining group.Shanxi has more than 900 coal mines and produces about 900 million tons of coal annually, with some 300,000 coal miners working long hours underground."The use of 5G technology in underground application scenarios will bring effective improvements to safety production and the operating environment of coal miners," Wang added.Yankuang Group, a Shandong-based mining conglomerate, previously set up a joint lab with China Unicom and ZTE to develop 5G and intelligent mining.Open-pit coal mines are also keeping up with the trend by integrating GPS, facial recognition, big data and other technologies, as 5G-powered tramcars went into service in a coal mine in North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region, assisting the drivers to offload without blind spots.Hong Fangming, president of Huawei Cloud China, said the new engines for corporate innovation brought by cloud computing, artificial intelligence, 5G and other technologies will be crucial for industrial upgrading.

                    Does the advent of 5G technology signal the next big retail evolution?
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                5G is poised to power the next generation of internet connectivity and e-commerce. Faster and more reliable than anything that has come before, 5G networks will enable people to communicate, consume entertainment and shop at unprecedented speeds.5G could prove pivotal for Asia-Pacific economies. Leading data analysts predict that it will contribute $900 billion to Asia's economy over the next 15 years, with 24 Asia-Pacific markets expected to launch 5G services by 2025 (GSMA, The Mobile Economy Asia Pacific 2019; GSMA is the Global System for Mobile Communications Association).Markets like South Korea and Japan are leading the way in 5G adoption: indeed, tech journalists from around the globe excitedly reported on the world's first nationwide 5G network which went live in South Korea earlier this year (TechRadar, 2019).China is another market leading the charge toward 5G adoption, and is set to become the world's largest 5G market by 2025 with 460 million 5G users. On June 6, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued commercial licenses for 5G. Four major telecom carriers - China Telecom, China Mobile, China Unicom and China Broadcasting Network - received the first batch of four 5G commercial licenses.Businesses in the e-commerce space, and indeed any retailer today, should be paying close attention to the arrival of 5G. The highspeed connectivity of 5G will transform the way people shop, signaling the arrival of the next big retail evolution and presenting new challenges and opportunities for brands.5G is set to power significant growth in mobile commerce, with some researchers estimating that it will produce an additional $12 billion in mobile commerce revenue for retailers in just three years, according to A Mobile-First World, a new report from Adobe Digital Insights.That growth will be in part due to simple economics of speed - faster, cheaper internet on your mobile phone means more opportunities to shop. This is especially true for emerging digital customers in developing countries.But there are other factors of innovation driving new revenue possibilities for retailers, too. 5G networks will enable a new level of access and ubiquity for groundbreaking retail technologies that leverage augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and the internet of things (IoT).Imagine getting the best parts of the brick-and-mortar shopping experience without ever setting foot in a store. You're not simply scrolling through a website: you're actually looking at the shelves of a fashion retailer or supermarket via AR through your mobile phone, as well as exploring new offerings, hunting for discounts and deals, and even using a virtual fitting room to try on outfits; from the comfort of your couch.This futuristic consumer experience could be closer than we think, thanks to 5G and its unprecedented capability to handle huge amounts of data at high speeds. 5G will unlock a new wave of consumer preferences - and if e-commerce businesses want to win amongst Asia Pacific's fierce digital competition, they must harness the power of 5G. Then, they can truly transform the customer experience, through innovative technologies like AR and VR.Of course, the possibilities of 5G are not limited to the digital retail space. 5G is also set to rapidly accelerate omnichannel commerce, bringing the digital and physical worlds together in a completely new way.Brick-and-mortar stores can connect to shoppers via their mobile devices - you might walk into a shop and receive a personalised SMS communication with a special deal just for you, based on your browsing history. Or, through facial recognition tools, retailers could soon be able to track the in-store products you spend the longest time looking at, then send you a digital offer to encourage online purchase after you leave the shop.As retailers consider how to innovate in the era of 5G, it will be paramount to provide the right payment experience, one that feels fast and frictionless, to match the overall 5G shopping journey.For online merchants, this means investigating the possibilities of innovative new payment systems - think facial recognition authentication, social payments and invisible payments. But it also means simply taking the first step toward understanding consumers' preferred payment methods in any given market and catering to these.Asia, for example, is home to eight of the world's top 10 markets for mobile payments (PwC, Global Consumer Insights Survey 2019), so offering Alipay, WeChat Pay or other popular options can be key to driving conversion, especially as the decreased network latency of the 5G era makes these seamless one-click payments even easier to use.E-commerce in Asia is evolving at speed, and the arrival of 5G is set to turbocharge this innovative landscape. Retailers can prepare for the future today by doing a deep investigation into what opportunities 5G can unlock for their business - whether that's new VR and AR shopping experiences, tailored omnichannel offerings, or enabling the quick and seamless payment choices that might make all the difference.Phil Pomford is general manager for Asia-Pacific, Global Enterprise e-commerce, Merchant Solutions at FIS.

                TIANJIN - The Binhai New Area in north China's Tianjin Municipality is expected to basically achieve full 5G network coverage by 2020, with 2,400 5G base stations in operation, local authorities said Tuesday.The area is expected to have quality 5G network coverage with 4,500 base stations by 2022.The Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, located in the area, has been rapidly developing in the application and promotion of 5G technology and is expected to be fully covered by the 5G network by the end of this year.The eco-city signed a cooperation agreement with Chinese telecom giant China Mobile in July to jointly build a 5G-based data platform, Internet of things and infrastructure.The two parties will enhance the application of 5G technology in more areas such as autonomous driving, drones, public transport service, GPS service and energy and medical services.Binhai New area will boost the industry application and is expected to have more than 20 demonstration application scenarios of 5G technology by 2020 and over 50 by 2022, according to sources with local authorities.China has sped up its efforts to develop 5G technologies and networks. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology granted commercial-use 5G licenses in June to the country's top three telecom operators -- China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom.
