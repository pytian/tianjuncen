                Editor's note: This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.On Sept 2, 1958, China Central Television (formerly Beijing Television) went into official operation. For the first time, domestic TV signals were broadcast in Beijing.In 1972, CCTV conducted its first simultaneous satellite broadcasts nationwide.From 1973, it began broadcasting experimentally in color on its second channel, and fully converted to color broadcasting by 1977.By 1985, CCTV had become a leading television network in China, and by 1987 its popularity had soared due to the adaptation and presentation of Dream of the Red Chamber.The 36-episode TV series was the first Chinese television drama to enter the global market.In December 1996, CCTV's website began trial operations, and on Sept 2,2008, a new CCTV headquarters was opened to mark its 50th anniversary, as seen in an item from China Daily.CCTV currently has a network of about 50 channels, broadcasting different programs, and is accessible to more than 1 billion viewers. The broadcaster provides programming in different languages.CCTV has opened offices in dozens of countries and regions as well as at the United Nations.It dispatches reporters to cover major events in various parts of the world, whenever such events take place.Its rapid development over the past six decades reflects the dramatic changes in the country's television sector. In 1978, China had fewer than one television set per 100 people. In 1987, the country overtook Japan as the world's largest manufacturer of TV sets, and in 2016 it produced 58 percent of them.Since Dream of the Red Chamber, China has become one of the largest producers of content for television and online, with at least 400 dramas a year, half of them sold overseas.The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television said that in China more than 1,600 domestic movies and television productions have been translated into 36 languages in recent years, including English, French, Russian, Spanish, Arabic and Portuguese, and they have been aired, or are currently being aired, in more than 100 countries.

                    'Easy Rider' star Peter Fonda dies at 79
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                LOS ANGELES (AP) — Actor Peter Fonda, the son of a Hollywood legend who became a movie star in his own right after both writing and starring in the counter-culture classic "Easy Rider," has died. His family said in a statement that Fonda died Friday morning at his home in Los Angeles. He was 79.The official cause of death was respiratory failure due to lung cancer."I am very sad," Jane Fonda said in a statement. "He was my sweet-hearted baby brother. The talker of the family. I have had beautiful alone time with him these last days. He went out laughing."Born into Hollywood royalty as Henry Fonda's only son, Peter Fonda carved his own path with his non-conformist tendencies and earned an Oscar nomination for co-writing the psychedelic road trip movie "Easy Rider." He would never win that golden statuette, but would later be nominated for his leading performance as a Vietnam veteran and widowed beekeeper in "Ulee's Gold."Fonda was born in New York in 1940 to parents whose personas were the very opposite of the rebellious images their kids would cultivate. Father Henry Fonda was already a Hollywood giant, known for playing straight-shooting cowboys and soldiers. Mother Frances Ford Seymour was a Canadian-born US socialite.He was only 10 years old when his mother died. She had a nervous breakdown after learning of her husband's affair and was confined to a hospital. In 1950 she killed herself, slashing her throat with a razor. It would be about five years before Peter Fonda learned the truth behind her death.Fonda accidentally shot himself and nearly died on his 11th birthday. It was a story he told often, including during an acid trip with members of The Beatles and The Byrds during which Fonda reportedly said, "I know what it's like to be dead."John Lennon would use the line in the Beatles song "She Said She Said."Fonda went to private schools in Massachusetts and Connecticut as a child, moving on to the University of Nebraska in his father's home state, joining the same acting group — the Omaha Community Playhouse — where Henry Fonda got his start.He then returned to New York and joined the Cecilwood Theatre, getting small roles on Broadway and guest parts on television shows including "Naked City" and "Wagon Train."Fonda had an estranged relationship with his father throughout most of his life, but said that they grew closer over the years before Henry Fonda died in 1982."Peter is all deep sweetness, kind and sensitive to his core. He would never intentionally harm anything or anyone. In fact, he once argued with me that vegetables had souls (it was the '60s)," his sister Jane Fonda said in her 2005 memoir. "He has a strange, complex mind that grasps and hangs on to details ranging from the minutiae of his childhood to cosmic matters, with a staggering amount in between. Dad couldn't appreciate and nurture Peter's sensitivity, couldn't see him as he was. Instead he tried to shame Peter into his own image of stoic independence."Although Peter never achieved the status of his father or even his older sister, the impact of "Easy Rider," which just celebrated its 50th anniversary, was enough to cement his place in popular culture.Fonda collaborated with another struggling young actor, Dennis Hopper, on the script about two weed-smoking, drug-slinging bikers on a trip through the Southwest as they made their way to New Orleans for Mardi Gras.On the way, Fonda and Hopper befriend a drunken young lawyer — Jack Nicholson in a breakout role — but raise the dander of Southern rednecks and are murdered before they can return home.Fonda's character Wyatt wore a stars-and-stripes helmet and rode a motorcycle called "Captain America," re-purposing traditional images for the counter-culture.Actress Illeana Douglas tweeted her condolences Friday with the hashtag "RIPCaptainAmerica.""'Easy Rider' depicted the rise of hippie culture, condemned the establishment, and celebrated freedom," Douglas wrote. "Peter Fonda embodied those values and instilled them in a generation."Fonda had played bikers before "Easy Rider." In the 1966 Roger Corman-directed "Wild Angels," in which he plays Heavenly Blues, leader of a band of Hells Angels, Fonda delivers a speech that could've served as both a personal mantra and a manifesto for the youth of the '60s."We wanna be free!" Fonda tells a preacher in the film. "We wanna be free to do what we wanna do. We wanna be free to ride. We wanna be free to ride our machines without being hassled by the man! And we wanna get loaded!"Fonda produced "Easy Rider" and Hopper directed it for a meager $380,000. It went on to gross $40 million worldwide, a substantial sum for its time.The film was a hit at Cannes, netted a best-screenplay Oscar nomination for Fonda, Hopper and Terry Southern, and has since been listed on the American Film Institute's ranking of the top 100 American films. The establishment gave its official blessing in 1998 when "Easy Rider" was included in the United States National Film Registry for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."In 1969, he told The Associated Press that, "As for my generation, it was time they started doing their own speaking. There has been too much of the 'silent majority' — at both ends of the generation gap."Although he did reflect later in a 2015 interview with The Hollywood Reporter that it may have impacted his career prospects: "It certainly put a nail in the coffin of 'the next Dean Jones at Disney.'"Fonda's output may have been prolific, but was not always well-regarded which he was acutely aware of. But he said that "Ulee's Gold," which came out in 1997, was the "most fun" he'd ever had making a movie. He wore the same wire-rimmed glasses his father wore in "On Golden Pond," although he said beyond that he was not channeling Henry Fonda in the performance. He lost out on the Oscar to Nicholson, who won for "As Good as It Gets."Nicholson said in his acceptance speech that it as an honor to be nominated alongside "my old bike pal Fonda."He remained prolific for the rest of his life with notable performances performances as the heel in Steven Soderbergh's "The Limey," from 1999, and in James Mangold's 2007 update of "3:10 to Yuma." He'd even play himself in an episode of the spoof documentary series "Documentary Now!" about life as "an Oscar Bridesmaid."Fonda is survived by his third wife, Margaret DeVogelaere, his daughter, actress Bridget Fonda and son, Justin, both from his first marriage to Susan Brewer."In one of the saddest moments of our lives, we are not able to find the appropriate words to express the pain in our hearts," the family said in a statement. "As we grieve, we ask that you respect our privacy."AP

                Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property.It was established by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, also known as UNESCO.As the anniversary approaches, the agency is renewing calls for cooperation and dialogue from member states in the fight against the illicit trade of cultural property.Lazare Eloundou Assomo, deputy director of the division for heritage and the UNESCO World Heritage Centre, said challenges will remain when the 1970 convention reaches the half-century milestone but UNESCO will continue to review challenges, identify actions, and share good practices."The world is evolving, there are new issues, and cooperation and partnership are absolutely important," Assomo said."(The anniversary) will be a good opportunity to reflect for all the UNESCO member states who have signed the convention and also look at how to better cooperate with all partners… some of the important subjects we will be discussing will pave the way for the next 50 years."The convention is an international treaty created to combat the illegal trade in cultural items. To date, 140 states have ratified it.Cultural property is deemed to be anything of scientific, historical, artistic, or religious significance. But the convention notes that every state can define its own cultural property, as long as the item is of importance to it.Emiline Smith, a lecturer in art crime and criminology at the University of Glasgow, said such items are important to nations' identity."Certain social values, belief systems, and traditions are passed on from generation to generation, and cultural heritage is proof of this: a reflection of human civilization," she said."Most countries have indicated certain objects that they deem most valuable to be national cultural heritage. As such, it can unite or divide a nation. It can be used in the creation of a political narrative. It can be a source of personal or national pride, and create a sense of belonging and connection. Making, owning, preserving culture and cultural heritage is a human right."In efforts to tackle the issue of illicit trade in art and antiquities, groups made up of intergovernmental committees meet every year to review all issues related to illicit trafficking around the world.Assomo stressed that UNESCO cannot act alone and noted that cooperating with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the International Police Organization, customs services, the private sector, and museums is key to protecting cultural heritage.One major concern for UNESCO is the phenomenon of terrorist groups exploiting cultural sites to finance their activities while strengthening links with transnational organized crime.Smith said they are using attacks on cultural heritage"as a strategy to undermine national governments and intimidate local populations"."In some cases, the looting and destruction of cultural heritage have been found to generate income for terrorist groups to extend their operations, for example in Iraq and Syria," she said. "They know that there is a market for the art and antiquities that they sell."As part of international peace-building efforts, the UN Security Council adopted resolution 2347 in 2017, which aims to strengthen international cooperation in order to deprive terrorists of funding and to protect cultural heritage and curb the illicit trade.The resolution encourages member states to take preventive steps through documentation and consolidation of their nationally owned cultural property in a network of"safe havens".There is also a need to ramp up the fight against illicit trafficking of cultural objects in the global art market. According to UNESCO, Europe is reportedly the largest exporter of art and antiquities, and the second-largest importer.UNESCO acknowledges that, while most of the estimated $14.6 billion European trade is licit or"clean", there is no doubt that it also falls victim to organized crime, money laundering and terrorist financing as a means for generating illicit proceeds.Illicit art is being detected as objects make their way in, through, and out of Europe and, at times, these objects make their way into the European licit market . Because this black market is hard to trace and quantify, UNESCO believes preventative and tracking measures must be strengthened.Assomo explained that education and the importance of reinforcing due diligence measures is key for the art market.He said museums in Europe have, in the past 10 years, put a lot of work in on checking provenance, but he pointed out that more work is needed when it comes to Europe's auction houses.Auction giant Christie's recently hit the headlines when Egyptian authorities urged it to cancel the sale of a Tutankhamun statue that Egypt claimed had been looted from a temple. Assomo said UNESCO reached out to Christie's after they were asked to do so by the Egyptian authorities.Christie's went on to sell the statue for $5.96 million."We played our role and, of course, the auction houses have their own procedures in checking provenance, but when there is a country that is really concerned about the selling of an object that it considers at part of its cultural identity, I believe dialogue is important," he said. "This is something which we would like to push and will continue to push in the future."

                China and Iceland are building on the long friendship particularly in the fields of sustainable development, Arctic issue and environmental protection In January 2018, after 27 years, I returned to Iceland, a country both familiar and unfamiliar to me, as the 14th Chinese ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary. I was sent to Iceland as the government-funded student to study overseas in 1985.When I stepped on this remote land the first time, I was deeply impressed by the unique scenery and the hardworking people in this country of "ice and fire".Almost six years of study and work experience in Iceland has linked me and this country together closely. As one of the few Chinese diplomats who have studied and worked in Iceland, I regard Iceland as my second home. So the return was like going back home. I am amazed at the great changes that have taken place in Iceland over the past 30 years. She is no longer an isolated island, and has turned into a leader in the trend of globalization. Modern communication technology has eliminated the distance between Iceland and the outside world. Free trade has given it wings. The creative Icelandic people work hard and its national economic strength and people's living standards have improved greatly. Hit hard by the 2008 international financial crisis, Iceland's economy has rapidly recovered through the implementation of strict capital controls, stable and effective macroeconomic policies and the development of tourism. It has achieved rapid economic growth for eight consecutive years. It is among the best performing of the developed economies. Iceland's ranking in the UN Global Happiness Index continues to be high and it is also rated as the safest country in the world. Thirty years ago, it was difficult to find a Chinese face on the streets of Iceland. Nowadays, Chinese tourists can be seen both in the capital Reykjavik and at tourist attractions across the country. Iceland is no longer strange and mysterious. Many Chinese people hold the belief that "If going to the moon is impossible within this life, then go to Iceland". Also, the outstanding performance of the Icelandic men's national football team in international competitions such as the World Cup in Russia and the unique refueling method of Icelandic fans "Viking Roar" have become talking points among the Chinese. More and more Icelandic people are beginning to learn Chinese and take keen interest in Chinese culture. While Chinese brands such as Huawei can be found everywhere and Alipay mobile payment is used broadly in Iceland, it is also becoming common to greet people with "ni hao" (Hello in Chinese). It will not be wrong to describe China's relationship with Iceland through an ancient Chinese saying: "Though bosom friends miles apart, no distance if sharing a heart". Exchanges between China and Iceland date back 260 years. Shortly after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Icelandic Chinese Cultural Society (ICCS) was established in Iceland in 1953. Since then, it has built a bridge for friendly exchanges between China and Iceland. The former president of ICCS, Arnpor Helgason, visited China dozens of times and has become one of the few foreign friends awarded the title of "Friendship Ambassador" by China. China and Iceland opened a new chapter in relations with the establishment of diplomatic ties on Dec 8, 1971.China's advocacy of equality between large and small countries enjoys popular support in Iceland. Also, China provided Iceland timely help during the 1970s Cod War with Great Britain, in the 1973 volcanic eruption on Westman Island and in the 2008 financial crisis. On the other hand, Iceland was the first Western European country that recognized China's market economy status, the first European country to sign a free trade agreement with China, and also, one of the first founding members of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Bilateral economic and trade cooperation has been expanding. In 2018, the trade volume between the two countries exceeded $700 million for the first time. China has become the largest trading partner of Iceland in Asia. Iceland's advanced geothermal technology and experience has been promoted in many places in China. Nearly 90 Chinese geothermal experts have been trained at the United Nations Geothermal University in Iceland. China-Iceland Arctic Science Observatory, officially launched in Karholl in October last year, the second arctic station after "Chinese Arctic Yellow River Station", will play an important role in scientific research in the Arctic. The number of Chinese tourists visiting Iceland reached nearly 90,000 person-times in 2018, showing a good momentum. More and more Icelandic people, too, are visiting China for business, tourism or study. There are various forms of cultural exchanges too. China's "Happy Chinese New Year" event entered Iceland in 2019 to a warm response. A number of Icelandic language talents have been cultivated in China since China's Beijing Foreign Studies University opened its Icelandic language major in 2008. The Confucius Institute at the University of Iceland has become a center for promoting Chinese language and culture, since its establishment 10 years ago. Chinese classic literature, such as The Analects of Confucius and Tao Teh Ching, are enjoyed by Icelanders. Icelandic literature like the Sagas of Icelanders has also been introduced to China. The two countries share common interests in safeguarding world peace and stability, international multilateral systems, and free trade, and cooperate closely in the fields of climate change, sustainable development, and environmental protection. As the People's Republic of China celebrates the 70th anniversary of its founding, it is fascinating to review the extraordinary path China-Iceland relations have taken. Year 2021 will be the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. The Belt and Road Initiative and the concept of building a community with a shared future for humankind proposed by President Xi Jinping will provide new impetus to developing China-Iceland relations. The two countries have broad prospects for cooperation in infrastructure construction, trade and investment, tourism, the Arctic research, climate change and environmental protection. Through joint efforts, China and Iceland can write a new chapter in the history of their bilateral relations. The author is the Chinese ambassador to Iceland.

                Two decades ago I first came to China, just at the right time to experience the 50th anniversary of People’s Republic of China in Guangzhou. Out of the past 20 years I’ve spent seven living and working in China, first for an international German sports company for two years, later after a long break in Europe I joined a Chinese supplier company for the international sports industry. Twenty years ago it was unimaginable for a Westerner to work in a local Chinese company. Today, it is a common sight. I am welcome to contribute to the growth of China, and Chinese companies are becoming global companies and brands. Our HAPTIC 3D textile coating company is a great example how Chinese companies are setting up globally leading B2B brands. What a rapid change and great development! Business environment and Chinese people are opening up to international experience and global exposure.However, you can still find the traditional old Chinese culture and lifestyle, especially in the rural country side. Recently I managed to get the driving license for motorbikes, a difficult challenge for a foreigner as the test is conducted in Chinese language. I love motorbikes because they allow so much more contact with nature. You feel the wind, the rain, the sunshine, the temperature and the smell of the air every kilometer you drive. You are connected with your environment and still have a tool to explore the country and discover areas not everybody can easily go. Immediately after I got the license I bought a nice Chinese Zhongshen 450 cc adventure motorbike. I wanted to get a Chinese brand, something that really connects me to the Chinese development, not an established Western or Japanese motorbike brand where the quality is good but but price is high.After buying the bike my life has changed. Suddenly I feel much more integrated into Chinese life. And much more independent. I can take it and go wherever I like, whenever I like. My bike is a kind of adventure bike, in our city of Putian it appears to be a very big bike. Most of the people drive small 125 cc “working horses” but not fun bikes. My bike is made not only for transportation but also for enjoying life and exploring the country. And I feel this is an enormous trend in China. Chinese people are getting to a point where they want more than only working hard, making money and enjoying family life. Many Chinese now start looking for new experience, not only work experience but also new life experience. Outdoor sports for example are growing fast. Sport overall is growing fast. People realize that beside work you need some activity to keep your body and mind healthy.Something you really enjoy and something which teaches you a new experience and connects you better to your environment and the world you are living in. For me, driving my motorbike is one part of it – and I can meet more and more Chinese adventure motorbike drivers feeling the same. When I take my motorbike and ride out of the city into the mountain regions of Fujian province there is not only great nature to experience. Sometimes I stop in small villages, buy water in a local shop or some food in a small restaurant. And every time I do so I experience so much friendship, lovely people who are interested to connect although language is still a big barrier.Anyway, all of us can feel that we all are nice people from different parts of the world and happy to meet. And happy to exchange a few minutes of our life. People in the countryside are often not familiar with such type of adventure motorbikes and may not fully understand the purpose but they can feel it is something special and great. They can feel that I am bringing a message from future to them. We all live together here on this planet, we all enjoy meeting each other in peace and friendship, and we are hoping the future will bring us communication tools making it easy for us to connect and exchange our experience and thinking. Friendly people on the way invite me for a cup of tea and often we spend an hour enjoying the tea and trying to exchange some information. Not always you need to talk a lot.Sometimes you can just feel that all the talking about cultural differences is pretty much exaggerated. On the ground level of living together we are 90 percent the same, we all have the same dreams, happy family, good food, peaceful and exciting life. Why most of the time we talk about the small differences and why these small differences sometimes make daily life so complicated? International exchange and friendship helps to see the real importance of focusing on people. Connecting by opening up, by trusting you can find friends in every corner of the world. Exploring, understanding and respecting the little differences is the best way forward to future. My motorbike is a tiny small step enabling international experience on a very personal level. Arriving back at home in Putian I always feel to this day that I have connected a little bit with the world. I have planted a seed to grow friendship between our different cultures. And I am looking forward to the next weekend for the next adventure.Thomas Schmidt is the director of innovation and RSL at Huafeng company in Putian, Fujian province.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                    Celebrating China’s 70 years of achievements

                October 1, 2019 is a key date for Chinese across the globe. 70 years have passed since Chinese Communist Party’s Chairman Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the People’s Republic of China in Beijing at Tiananmen Square. This year’s anniversary encompasses seven decades marked by undeniable success and struggle for a nation which is continuously striving to improve the lives of its people, as well as securing an active role in enhancing international cooperation.Over the past 70 years, China has remained strategic and determined to increase the country’s social, economic and political strength. The Chinese Dream acknowledges that a nation’s rejuvenation depends on its human resources and well-being. Likewise, organizations such as the United Nations and the World Bank confirmed that in the past 40 years more than 800 million people in China have been lifted out of poverty and given more tools to cultivate personal growth through access to high-quality education, decent housing and entrepreneurship opportunities. What began as commitment to national poverty eradication has reverberated across society into an important accomplishment in human history. As a top priority in the UN Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030, China, the most populous country in the world and the 4th largest by size, has set a remarkable example for poverty eradication.Home to 56 ethnic groups it,China has successfully navigated the complexities of a multi-cultural society. It has provided China with a higher gear in diplomacy by acquiring a deeper understanding of and respect for diversity. The past 70 years have been characterized by a multitude of examples of long-term international partnerships which have translated into research, investment and high-end technology projects, creating new jobs and growth opportunities for both developed and developing countries. Favorable visa policy implementations, an increasing number of scholarships for both national and international scholars, and the opening of several free trade zones across the country represent an important part of the actions carried out by China in ensuring people mobility, cultural exchanges and trade flow.As a former Chinese Government Scholarship post-graduate Italian student, I currently work in the cultural industry, and have spent nearly 5 years in - specifically, Chongqing. Compared to many peers who have been spending a decade or more living and working in China, five years be a relatively short time; however, I do feel that this country has exerted a huge influence on my personal and professional growth, exposing me to new cross-cultural narratives while honing my language proficiency and professional skills. In the past 5 years I have been able to bring knowledge acquired during my previous studies and work experience in my home country to China, build upon this solid foundation and even provide a small and humble contribution together with other foreigners working in this country. All this was made possible first and foremost by the welcoming and cooperative environment provided by China, and last but not least by the concerted efforts made by a large number of people and institutions.This year marks an important moment in Chinese history, and 2020 is just around the corner. I am looking forward to witnessing the celebrations and activities planned for the 70th Anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, and eager to salute the 50th Anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and Italy in 2020, which is also set to be the Italy-China Culture and Tourism Year.Lorella Brienza has been living in China since 2015 first as a graduate student recipient of CSC scholarship and now as a professional working in the culture industry.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                    Chery Jaguar Land Rover makes plans to shake up luxury car market
                </p>

                British premium carmaker Jaguar Land Rover and its Chinese joint venture with Chery Automobile plan to launch many high-quality products, in efforts to lead the upgrade of China's luxury car market.A joint brand day of Jaguar Land Rover China and Chery Jaguar Land Rover was launched in Chengdu, Sichuan province, early this month where some updated models were unveiled.The new Jaguar XEL made its debut in Chengdu with a new interior, upgraded materials and technologies. The Jaguar F-Pace Checkered Flag and F-Pace 300 Sport, Range Rover 50th Anniversary edition and Range Rover Sport SVR of the British premium carmaker's luxury sub-brand Special Vehicle Operations were also showcased.Murray Dietsch, president of Chery Jaguar Land Rover, and Chris Chen, vice-president of Chery Jaguar Land Rover, introduce the new XEL in Chengdu.In August, Jaguar Land Rover exceeded the monthly sales target with an increase of 17 percent year-on-year. The figure was 40 percent in July.Pan Qing, a board member of Jaguar Land Rover and executive director of Jaguar Land Rover China said: "By the end of 2021, Jaguar Land Rover will launch 30 new and updated models in China to provide more exciting experiences and services for customers in the world's largest auto market."In an interview at the auto show, Murray Dietsch, president of Chery Jaguar Land Rover, said that the joint venture is always listening to voices in the Chinese market and customers. It is also doing lots of research to learn about policies and market trends, which helps to integrate localized voices with global system strength.An example is that WeChat, a part of Chinese customers' daily lives but little-known in other countries, must be integrated with vehicle information systems, Dietsch added.Chery Jaguar Land Rover has operated its world-leading intelligent manufacturing system and produced localized products in its Changshu plant, Jiangsu province.The plant is a model of Jaguar Land Rover operations worldwide. It ranks top in terms of interaction technology, efficiency, quality and operation management, according to Chris Chen, vice-president of Chery Jaguar Land Rover.The plant has two phases in operation, which can produce 200,000 vehicles annually. It can also handle more than 300,000 individual options to meet customers' requirements.One of the highlights is that the Changshu plant has introduced Jaguar Land Rover's world-leading aluminum technology. It is China's first purpose-built aluminum body shop.An aluminum body can provide a lighter and stronger solution with the advantages of fuel saving and flexible control performance, said Chen."To bring the all-aluminum body to China, we brought the requirements of the aluminum supply chain to the country and drove a large number of suppliers, which also contributes a lot to China's auto industry," he added.The aluminum body workshop has 344 robots, 232 among which are self-piercing, riveting robots.The welding workshop can finish one car body in two minutes and has introduced laser as well as radar-based tools to ensure precision in production.The assembly workshop has adopted an advanced pick-to-voice system, which guides workers to sort materials via voice control.The system has helped improve material sorting efficiency by 20 percent.To deliver a solution that is flexible, more efficient and electric-ready, the plant uses Premium Transverse Architecture, or PTA, which is the latest manufacturing platform independently developed by Jaguar Land Rover.The internet of things has been widely applied in the plant. The advanced radio frequency identification system, or RFID, is used in welding, painting, assembly and logistics processes, to ensure traceability of production and quality control."We also have built a quality management system that covers procedures from planning to the process of supervision and post-sale feedback to solve and prevent potential quality problems," Chen said.The Changshu plant is also home to Jaguar Land Rover's only engine plant outside the United Kingdom. The plant produces the family of its Ingenium engines, including the Ingenium 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines for localized models, which boast outstanding performance and good fuel economy.The facility set a record when its engine plant started production within 32 months of vehicle production on the same site.The company said that the third phase of the plant is on schedule, which will improve the production and R&D capacity.Last December, Chery Jaguar Land Rover unveiled its Design Studio in Shanghai to better learn about and reflect the voice of China in its product design.In the future, the studio will design models especially for China auto market, which is an important part of the company's strategy plan.caoyingying@chinadaily.com.cn(China Daily 09/16/2019 page19)
