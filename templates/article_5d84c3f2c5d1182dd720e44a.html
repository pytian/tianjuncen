                1,200 lost hikers in Gobi Desert rescued
            </a>
            <p>
                Over 1,200 lost hikers, mostly university students, were rescued after they called the police during a Gobi Desert hiking contest on Friday in Aksay Kazak autonomous county, Gansu province, according to the Beijing Youth Daily on Monday.The police managed to locate their whereabouts based on the information and showed the direction for the way out, said Zhang Qiang, deputy director of the command center in the police bureau of the county, as the report showed.The hiking contest was organized by a cultural development center in Changsha of Hunan province and a local outdoor activity center supported the activity, the report said, adding that in the 1,200-plus team of hikers, there were only seven coaches from the organizing centers.The 1,200 hikers lost their way in the Gobi Desert in the county, which covers an area of 31,000 square kilometers with an average altitude of 3,200 meters. Some areas have forbidden cattle grazing to protect the environment, leaving them empty all year long.The local temperature can approach 0 C at night though it hovers above 30 C during the day in the summer. But the hikers planned to stay outdoors at night, the police said.The local police in the county also asked for joint search and rescue from neighboring areas including Dunhuang city police after receiving the report.The police finally found the lost hikers at 2:40 am on Friday, according to the report.The police warned that such outdoor activity organizers should inform the relevant authorities beforehand for the sake of security.Ye Qian in Beijing contributed to this story

                Xinjiang Uygur sees big influx of visitors
            </a>
            <p>
                The Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region experienced a travel boom from January to June, and the growth is projected to continue through the rest of 2019, according to a recent report by the region's government.The report said that in the first half of 2019, the region received about 76 million visits, up 46 per-cent year-on-year. Revenue generated by tourism exceeded 115 billion yuan ($16 billion), registering an increase of about 48 percent over the same period last year.Urumqi, Ili Kazak autonomous prefecture and Changji Hui autonomous prefecture were the three hottest destinations for travelers in the past half year. Year-on-year, Urumqi saw a 56 percent increase in travelers, Ili Kazak saw 81 per-cent, and Changji Hui 46 percent.Domestic travelers accounted for 98 percent of those visiting the region, while the top three sources of overseas visitors were Kazakhstan, Russia and Mongolia.According to the report, tourism will maintain high-speed growth of 40 percent in the next half year thanks to stable public security, enhanced infrastructure construction and flourishing winter tourism.Zhang Xiaoyu, general secretary of the Xinjiang Tourism Association, said that winter used to be the slack season for Xinjiang because of the rather low temperatures and heavy snow."Numerous scenic spots were shut down when winter came, but they grew to be new attractions to travelers thanks to the popularity of winter tourism," he said.In February, 351 attractions were available to travelers, much more than the 69 that opened around that time last year, according to the report.Scenic spots also saw an increase in travelers during the winter. Zhang said that the region offers diversified entertainment to travelers during the season."In the southern part, people can join a desert exploration event in winter that is hard to carry out in the summer sun," he said. "Skiing and hot springs are popular choices for travelers visiting the northern areas."The region, however, still faces challenges because of insufficient tour products, inconvenient transportation, a shortage of talent and insufficient planning and management, according to the report."Talent is the main problem," Zhang said. "Tour guides and management staff are in high demand. Also, there are few training courses available to people in the tourism industry. We need people to bring new ideas to help promote the region's tourism development."Mao Weihua contributed to this story.

                Yurt co-op gives tourists taste of Corban Festival in Xinjiang
            </a>
            <p>
                People staying in guesthouses during celebration get glimpse of ethnic culture Bahargul Asat got up very early to prepare for the celebration of the Corban Festival in the traditional Kazak yurts on the fertile grassland in Narat, Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, on Sunday. There were more things to do because all the tourists who stayed at her yurts were on her guest list, she said. Bahargul said she was making a grand effort to show the guests how people from the Kazak ethnic group celebrate one of the most important Islamic festivals of the year in style. The Corban Festival, also known as Eid al-Adha and the Sacrifice Festival, is celebrated by people from many of Xinjiang's ethnic groups, including the Uygur, Kazak, Uzbek, Tajik and Hui. People began to prepare food and snacks days in advance to give to friends and visitors. The festival kicked off after people completed their morning prayers on Sunday at mosques around Xinjiang. The slaughtering of sheep as a sacrifice is an essential part of the celebration. "We have to slaughter more sheep and prepare more traditional Kazak pastries so my family and guests from all over China can have a good time together on the beautiful grassland, which has always been the summer pasture for Kazak herdsmen like my father and grandfather," Bahargul, 40, said. Dubbed "grassland in the sky" for its altitude, Narat, partly surrounded by the Tianshan Mountains on three sides in the Ili Kazak autonomous prefecture, has become one of the top tourist spots in Xinjiang. Besides carrying on the tradition of raising livestock on the grassland, some local Kazaks, including Bahargul, also decided to start their own tourist-related businesses. Bahargul set up a cooperative with other herdsmen providing yurts as guesthouses in 2014 so they can provide standardized and quality services for the tourists. Now the cooperative owns 40 yurts, which were fully booked on Sunday, she said. "The yurt cooperative is also a good platform to promote the Kazak culture," she said. The Corban Festival, which began Sunday, is a three-day public holiday for people of all ethnicities in Xinjiang. Railway authorities in the region have increased the number of trains to meet public demand during the festival. A total of 157 trains have been added to ease public transportation during the festival, according to China Railway Urumqi Group. The trains mainly link Urumqi, the regional capital, and many important cities in northern and southern Xinjiang as well as tourist destinations, the company said. cuijia@chinadaily.com.cn  Dalil (left), an ethnic Kazak, makes fried twisted dough known as sanzi to celebrate the Corban Festival along with his wife and his neighbor Zhu Wenjun (right) at his home in Barkol Kazak autonomous county in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region on Friday.Zhang Jiangang/for China Daily(China Daily Global 08/12/2019 page4)

                Kazak restaurateur's passion produces cultural harvest
            </a>
            <p>
                URUMQI-Music interrupts the conversation of contented diners as dancers dressed in traditional Kazak and Uygur costumes invite the restaurant's customers to put down their cutlery and dance. The waiters and waitresses set down their trays and join in.Backstage, 49-year-old restaurateur Hellat Deleilikhan watches. It is the highlight of his busy day."I feel happy watching my customers join in," he said. "They enjoy themselves, and I'm satisfied. I have worked for so many years to build a place just like this. It is the wheat that I reap."It is not unusual for Hellat, an ethnic Kazak from the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, to drop farming terms in this way. In fact, it's in his blood.For centuries, the Kazak people were nomadic herders who drove their cattle and sheep across the pastures of Xinjiang. They shunned the idea of commercial activity, even going as far as regarding business as a disgrace."Fifty years ago, it was shameful for a Kazak to even sell a cup of milk tea to someone else," Hellat said. "If someone ate at your house and you charged money for that meal, other Kazaks would look down on you-it would be worse than death. But the times have changed, and now it is OK to earn money from your hard work."Today, more Kazaks have left their flocks and yurts to lead modern lives with access to education and health service.Growing up in a city, young Hellat excelled in the arts, but he took his parents' advice and majored in Russian at college. That led to a respectable job in the local administration for foreign trade.The job meant travel. A lot of travel, to far-flung countries where he developed an obsession-restaurants. He drank up the exotic atmosphere, admired the unusual decorations and reveled in the amazing performances. The more places he saw, the more he knew that he wanted a career that he was really passionate about.In 2001, he quit his job and opened his first venture, a Kazakstyle milk tea shop in a tiny 43 square meter space in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang.He decorated the shop like the cafes that had impressed him and named it "Father of Apples" after the saying "the three apples that changed the world". The first was the one eaten by Eve, the second fell on Isaac Newton, and the third was created by Steve Jobs.Hellat was determined to find his own apple that would change his world.In 2007, the tea shop was transformed into a restaurant, and singers and dancers were hired to perform."It's not about making more money," he said. "For me, my restaurant is like a container which houses all my hobbies, from decoration design to singing and dancing. I've realized a childhood dream."The restaurant soon moved to a 800 sq m space, then 1,600 sq m and again to 2,800 sq m."I often joke that we Kazak people traditionally lead a nomadic life," Hellat said. "We live in a place for just a few years and will then migrate to new pastures. In my catering business, our moves are about business and the need to expand."He said that instead of taking classes or reading books on management, he mainly relied on his intuition. "I stick to just one principle-follow my heart."After a decade of expansion, Hellat opened a second restaurant. Both restaurants are now household names in Xinjiang.Diners sit in surroundings that are opulent and full of character as they enjoy some of the best food on offer in Xinjiang. And then, of course, there is the traditional singing and dancing.Dina, also a Kazak, studies dance at Xinjiang Arts University and works part-time at Hellat's restaurant."It's my dream to become a dancer," she said. "This job allows me to improve my movements and learn how to interact with the audience."Hellat said: "Sheep and cattle are inseparable parts of our history and culture. But we need to keep up with the times and lead a modern life. We Kazak people can put down the whip and live modern lives. It's a good thing."He still loves to travel and credits his exposure to many different cultures for his belief that all ethnic groups should be inclusive."Cultures don't have boundaries," Hellat said. "As long as it's good, we like it. So, I believe cultures can blend. It's like pollen. Cross-pollination can make the flowers bloom so much more beautifully."Xinhua

                New Silk Road helps wealth bloom in desert
            </a>
            <p>
                Horgos was a remote outpost which 'the camels passed by' until President Xi's blueprint was turned into a realityEditor's note: As the People's Republic of China prepares to celebrate its 70th anniversary on Oct 1, China Daily is featuring a series of stories on the role regions have played in the country's development and where they are today.The Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, which covers one-sixth of China's territory and borders eight countries, was a key link on the ancient Silk Road. Many ancient kingdoms thrived because of the famous trade route connecting China, Central Asia and Europe.Nowadays, the wealth generated by the Silk Road is being replicated by the Belt and Road Initiative, which is bringing financial rewards to workers and businesses along its routes.The dramatic transformation of the land port of Horgos, Ili Kazak autonomous prefecture, which has grown out of the Gobi Desert in only five years, is one of the great success stories of the BRI.Yu Chengzhong, CEO of Jinyi International Trade which exports fruit and vegetables from China to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Russia, has reaped the rewards of the new Silk Road. He is known locally as the "fruit king"."The fruit sourced from Ili can arrive at the market in Almaty, Kazakhstan, via Horgos within six and a half hours. This is the perfect example of how the initiative has taken effect," he said.Yu first heard about Horgos, which is 300 kilometers from Almaty, when he was wholesaling fruit to Kazakh buyers at a market in Yining in 1999. He then formulated the idea of relocating his business to the border town.In Mongolian, Horgos means "Where the camel train passes" and in Kazak it translates to "the land of wealth".Yu said his first impression of Horgos when he arrived in 2000 was of an underdeveloped outpost in the middle of the desert. "Besides a few one-story buildings and small shops, there was nothing but Gobi Desert in Horgos, which was only a land port," he recalled.

                'King of Naan' succeeds on an industrial scale
            </a>
            <p>
                As the fourth generation of naan makers in his family, Tursonjon Abula said his latest goal is to produce 25,000 of the flatbreads in a day.The 45-year-old from Hotan prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, was told by his grandfather when he was young he would have to make 400 in a day to call himself the "King of Naan".With modern production methods, he easily surpasses that.Tursonjon was brought up in his grandfather's naan shop in a village in southern Xinjiang's Moyu county. There he learned the skills of making quality naan in traditional wood-fired clay pits.After taking over the family business, he started to change the traditional ways. "I decided to stuff the naans with jam made from roses grown in Hotan and dry fruits. The new varieties immediately became a hit," Tursonjon said proudly.In 2016, he expanded his business to the regional capital of Urumqi and registered the brand name "King of Naan" to honor his grandfather.Besides the naan stores he owns around Urumqi, Tursonjon now runs a naan factory with 40 employees. His factory, which began operations in September last year, is in the naan industrial and cultural park in Urumqi.

                Organisé par la Fondation Soong Ching Ling et le China Welfare Institute, un spectacle pour célébrer la Journée internationale des enfants s'est déroulé le 1er juin au Centre national pour des arts du spectacle à Pékin. [Yan Tong/pour China Daily]Un nouveau livre d'images a pour but de rendre compte de ce qui s'est passé pendant les sept dernière décennies en Chine.Pour marquer la publication d'un album de photos intitulé « 100 Photographers Focus on 70 Years of the People's Republic of China » (Zoom de cent photographes sur les 70 années de la République populaire de Chine), une exposition de photographie s'est ouverte le 10 septembre à la Bibliothèque de la Capitale.Organisé par le journal China Daily, la maison d'édition China Pictorial Publishing House et la Bibliothèque de la Capitale, le vernissage de l'exposition s'est tenu en présence d'environ 150 invités d'honneur, dont M. Zhou Shuchun, éditeur et rédacteur en chef de China Daily.Le livre d'images contient 374 œuvres pris par 283 photographes, chacun exposant leurs propres images en matière de développement de la Chine et illustrant les changements survenus dans la vie quotidienne du peuple chinois au cours des 70 dernières années. L'exposition fera la tour dans 20 universités, dont l'Université Renmin de Chine, l'Université Tsinghua et l'Université Normale de Pékin, ainsi que 22 bibliothèques dans la capitale chinoise à partir du 10 septembre.A propos de l'album, M. Zhou a écrit dans la préface : « Au cours des 70 dernières années, en disant adieu à la pauvreté et au sous-développement, en laissant derrière le chagrin et l'humiliation nationale, la Chine est entrée avec confiance dans la nouvelle ère du socialisme avec des caractéristiques chinoises. Une Chine pleine de vigueur et d'espoir se tient solidement debout à l'Est et elle se rapproche de plus en plus du centre de la scène mondiale ».L'éditeur de China Daily a ajouté : « A travers les moments historiques qui ont été capturés les uns après les autres dans ces photos, les visiteurs peuvent mieux comprendre la transformation remarquable de la Chine durant les sept dernières décennies et son succès exceptionnel que l'on ne peut décrire qu'en utilisant le mot "miracle" dans les domaines de la croissance économique, des progrès politiques, de l'amélioration de la vie du peuple, de la prospérité culturelle et de la conservation écologique. Les spectateurs peuvent également apprécier comment le Parti communiste de Chine (PCC) n'a jamais oublié ses aspirations initiales et a toujours gardé à l'esprit sa mission historique, et a par conséquent ramené le peuple chinois à travailler ainsi à construire une Chine splendide et magnifique ».« Nous nous en tiendrons à nos intentions originales, lorsque nous continuons à nous avancer, en nous associant au peuple de tous les horizons pour raconter de très belles histoires de la Chine, en faisant entendre la voix de la Chine dans le monde entier et en contribuant encore plus au renforcement de la puissance culturelle douce de la Chine ».Li Ge, président de l'Association des photographes de la Chine, a déclaré au China Daily : « Nous promouvons cet album de photos au moment où la Chine célèbre le 70ème anniversaire de sa fondation. C'est une interprétation en profondeur et une démonstration authentique de la logique interne des changements et réalisations historiques de la Chine, et permet aux lecteurs chinois et étrangers de mieux comprendre la Chine dans la nouvelle ère ».Des membres du syndicat distribuant la soupe de haricots mungo (une sorte de soupe réconfortante après une journée crevante en plein été) auprès des travailleurs dans une usine métallurgique à Xi'an dans la province du Shaanxi (nord-ouest de la Chine) en juin 1959.

                Visiting Kazak President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev hailed the Belt and Road Initiative on Wednesday as a way to a promising future, saying the modern Silk Road has restructured the global economy.Tokayev, who kicked off his first state visit to China on Tuesday since taking office in June, made the remarks during a speech at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing.Thanks to the BRI, 11 cross-border railways and highways through Kazakhstan have facilitated transportations across the Eurasian continent, and enabled Chinese commodities to reach consumers in Europe, the Eurasian Economic Union and the Near East three to four times faster than six years ago, the Kazak president said.He said China and Kazakhstan have started 15 projects on joint building of the Belt and Road with a value of $4 billion. "All the projects help create new job opportunities and foster new enterprises that produce high value-added products, develop renewable energy and promote new technologies in agriculture and manufacturing."The two countries are also actively pushing for cooperation on refined products in the areas of oil, petroleum, natural gas, nuclear energy and mining, Tokayev said.The president called China "a friendly neighbor and reliable partner", and said the Kazakhstan-China relationship has become a good example of state-to-state relations."The important thing is there remains nothing that impedes the development of bilateral relations and further cooperation between the two countries," Tokayev said, adding the two nations will sign a joint statement to further consolidate and deepen their comprehensive strategic partnership during his visit.
