                1 killed, 8 wounded in Saudi's Abha airport attack
            </p>
            <p>
                RIYADH -- At least one person was killed and eight others injured in an attack that targeted the Abha International Airport in the southern province of Saudi Arabia on Sunday, Al Arabiya TV reported.A Syrian resident was killed, while eight civilians were wounded in an apparently drone attack that hit the parking area of the airport, the media said.On Saturday, the fighter jets of the Saudi-led alliance intercepted and destroyed two drones in the Yemeni air space, launched by the Houthi militias.The coalition said that the drones were launched by the Iranian-backed Houthi militias from the Sanaa governorate.On June 12, the pro-Iran fighters targeted Abha airport with a cruise missile that fell on the arrivals hall, injuring 26 civilians.

                Nepal's "living goddess" passes school leaving exam
            </a>
            <p>
                Perhaps divine intervention helped.A Nepali girl revered by many as a "living goddess" has become the first sitting deity to pass the high school leaving certificate exam, setting her on course for a career in banking.Chanira Bajracharya, 15, called Kumari, was among nearly half a million children who took the exams in March. The results were declared late on Friday."She scored 80.12 percent marks in the exam," said Abha Awale, a teacher who gave private tuitions to the girl in her temple as she is not allowed to mingle with outsiders."This is a distinction (top grade)," she said.Bajracharya has already scored high marks among devotees in the ancient town of Patan, south of Kathmandu, where she rides in decorated chariots 18 times year during Hindu and Buddhist festivals. She has been Kumari of Patan for nine years now.Relatives and friends gathered outside Bajracharya's red brick house on Saturday to greet the Kumari with folded hands.Bajracharya, who has a third eye painted on her forehead, told Reuters in a rare interview in April she wanted to study commerce or accounting and work in banking.Former Kumaris, considered incarnations of the Hindu goddess Kali, have gone on to work or got married after they retired, which is usually at the onset of puberty.Girls from Kathmandu's Newar community are chosen by Buddhist priests to serve as "living goddesses," and confined to temples in the three ancient cities of the Kathmandu valley.Critics say the centuries-old tradition denies them a normal life and leaves them unprepared to face real life after retirement.Two years ago, Nepal's Supreme Court ordered the government to ensure basic healthcare and education for the Kumaris.Early this week, the Nepali government raised by a quarter the maintenance allowance provided to the Kumari and said it would bear the expenses for her education.

                The perils of eating fire in Saudi Arabia
            </a>
            <p>
                Saudi artist Maher al-Luqman is always nervous when he goes on stage to eat glass and fire or to walk on nails, for fear the country's religious police will disrupt his show.The leader of a troupe of 12 strongmen, Luqman struggles for acceptance in a country whose austere version of Sunni Islam means that many forms of entertainment and unusual feats of strength are sometimes seen as sorcery."They have stopped us for two years, branding us as sorcerers, and calling for people to fight us and report us," Luqman, 35, told Reuters.Bearded religious policemen roam the streets of the Gulf Arab kingdom of 25 million people to enforce gender segregation, search for drugs and alcohol and to stop behavior they consider immoral.The Saudi government is trying to promote internal tourism but its efforts are complicated by restrictions on singing, dancing and mixing of unrelated men and women enforced by a powerful religious establishment.Public entertainment like that provided by groups such as Luqman's Altineen -- which means "dragon" in Arabic -- is rare. Every summer the Saudi Commission for Tourism and Antiquities organizes public festivals in cities in the kingdom.Last year, concerts and some circus shows were banned due to what the religious police described as contradiction to Islam.Conservative clerics and religious police, backed by powerful members of the Saudi royal family, resist some activities that they believe do not comply with the cultural and religious norms of the country.Jeddah's annual summer film festival was canceled last year despite the support of local governor Prince Khaled al-Faisal. In Abha in the kingdom's southwest mountains, some concerts were also banned from a tourism festival.Luqman's group had permission to perform last week in a desert town 200 km north of the capital Riyadh but was abruptly stopped from going on stage by an order from the religious police."I am fed up. I want to leave. It is so sad to see these talents go to waste," Luqman said.He keeps trying to perform because of the loyal fans who flock to his shows."I really enjoyed the show. They deserve encouragement," said Ahlam Abdullah, a woman clad in black after watching how Luqman's men piled five huge bricks on his stomach and smashed them one by one with a hammer while he was lying still."Frankly, this was quite a performance," agreed Mezher al-Qarni who to came with his daughter to watch the group performing in a park near Riyadh.

                Citizens the central figure in smart city transformations
            </a>
            <p>
                Today's political states seem too big to solve the problems that directly affect their citizens. Hence, in cities around the world public administrators are demanding greater self-governance from their respective national governments. Another challenge facing cities is how to effectively implement Smart City initiatives. At the Smart City World Congress, participants in the plenary session dedicated to governance and funding debated over which governance model is best suited to the greater autonomy that cities are demanding."To determine the success of Smart City initiatives, you have to consider long-term indicators," remarked Greg Clark, CEO of The Business of Cities Ltd. His comment may serve as a wake-up call for city governments that risk prioritizing politically motivated policies that encompass electoral periods and that are typically limited to 4 or 5 years. This type of city governance is totally inconsistent with Clark's concept of a Smart City: one that in 50 years will be able to absorb huge numbers of new residents from around the world that will have been forced to move because of global climate change.Leadership: a key elementWithout delving into an exhaustive study on governance, the participants debated over the best political systems for cities to make decisions today that will affect them over the next few decades. Greg Clark affirmed the importance of leadership in this context, underscoring the consequences of administrative barriers that can block genuine attempts at generating truly Smart Cities: the aforementioned short-term thinking, as well as insufficient power, governmental fragmentation, inadequate financial instruments, and even cynicism among the public or in the media.The importance of leadership was echoed by Paul Tilsley, Deputy Leader of Birmingham City Council. According to Tilsley, leadership has been critical to the success of Smart City initiatives taken in Birmingham. He also highlighted the role of the private sector in this success. "City governments must push an agenda of change, but they can't do it by themselves," he declared. The administrator explained that Birmingham City Council has a pragmatic attitude when it comes to working with private companies. "We don't rely on a single model; we work on a case-by-case basis, stimulating collaborations that can include long-term contracts or even joint ventures," he said. Tilsley also recognized that without the knowhow and experience of private-sector companies, which are hard to find in the public sector, his city would not have witnessed so many improvements and so quickly.Anti-democratic privatizationAlthough she did not renounce the type of private-sector participation described above, Mildred Warner, from the Department of Urban and Regional Planning at Cornell University, warned of the dangers of sub-contracting city services, a trend that has grown over the past few years. "Markets do not do a good job of coordinating public needs," she stated. Furthermore, Warner affirmed that the large majority of studies on this issue indicate that the private sector not only does not offer any savings for administering public services, it also leads to greater dissatisfaction among the residents that receive them. She pointed out that this trend is especially pronounced in developing economies, where price-hikes from privatization of basic services like water and electricity have made these services inaccessible to many of the people that need them most. "Private-sector companies have a role," she explained, "but they have to fulfill it without breaking down the fundamental democratic relationship between city residents and their city governments that exists when public services are provided."Eliminating 19th century governanceManuel Ausaberri, Director of Smart Cities at Indra and the participant who represented the strongest link to the private sector, emphasized pragmatism when dealing with urban problems. "City residents have hundreds of demands; unfortunately, the financial resources are limited, especially in the past few years." For Ausaberri, the answer may lie in technology, which can end up paying for itself. However, he believes that this would first require a revolution in how public administrations operate: to terminate with a 19th century system of governance in which each department or agency only deals with its own problems.Echoing Manuel Ausaberri's call for an integrated approach to governance was Abha Joshi-Ghani, who manages the Urban Development Unit at the World Bank. Joshi-Ghani considers Smart Cities to be those that can do more with less and that know how to manage the interdependence between different actors and areas. Nevertheless, she reiterated that "citizens are more than just customers."

                The World Bank yesterday warned that Bangkok faced a high risk of natural disaster, especially massive flooding that could cause huge economic losses. It suggested that policy-makers make three preparations to deal with disasters: optimise the effectiveness of the Bt350-billion water-management budget; ensure cooperation among agencies assigned to analyse and study legal aspects of disaster issues; and develop city plans that minimise disaster risks from urban expansion, said World Bank official Abhas Jha.Jha, sector manager for transport, urban and disaster risk management for East Asia and the Pacific for the bank, also praised the government for its quick and effective resolution of the flood disaster in 2011."The Thai government has budgeted Bt350 billion to invest in water management, which will lead to fast rehabilitation of the Thai economy. [Efficient] space utilisation and having good plans for land use and planning to serve the expansion of cities at the highest efficiency to [make urban centres less vulnerable] will be a new challenge for Thailand's policy-makers. With the strong growth of urbanisation, the Kingdom faces a serious problem [deciding where] its production and industrial sectors should be located."Bert Hofman, the World Bank's chief economist for the East Asia and Pacific region, said major cities including Bangkok had faced increasing risk of disasters as they lacked good urban planning. This has the potential to cause huge economic losses despite the strong growth the region currently enjoys."More than 50 per cent of the population of East Asia lives in cities such as Bangkok, Jakarta and Manila. The high expansion of cities within the region is of concern as it creates higher risks of disasters. The expansion of cities will increase continuously in the next 30 years and [oblige] the governments in this region to launch good management techniques to protect their countries from disasters," he said.According to the World Bank's report, there is uneven capacity and readiness to invest in disaster risk management (DRM) among the countries of East Asia and the Pacific. The region includes developed countries with sophisticated institutions and instruments to manage the risks of disasters effectively (Australia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, New Zealand), countries that have made considerable steps in mainstreaming DRM into development (China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam), and countries that face severe capacity and institutional constraints (Cambodia, Laos, Mongolia, Myanmar, Pacific island countries).Small Pacific islands, Papua New Guinea and East Timor face serious challenges in their ability to recover from disasters. Significant capacity and funding gaps also exist between the central and local levels of government, as well as between rural and urban areas.Low-income countries are unprepared and underfunded for their task of managing risk and leading recovery, and this is particularly true for local-level institutions. For example, globally, fewer than 20 per cent of low- and lower-middle-income countries invest in land-use planning, fewer than 30 per cent of low-income countries invest in landslide-mitigation measures, and fewer than 50 per cent of low-income countries invest in drainage infrastructure to mitigate flooding.Many countries in East Asia and the Pacific have made advances in DRM at the national level in formulating legislation and strategies, but implementation remains a challenge. Local-level institutions lack the appropriate budgets, human resources, and technical capacity in their role as first responders and leaders in mainstreaming resilience into local-level investments.In the past five years, Asia has experienced a large share of wide-scale natural catastrophes, including floods in 2011 in Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines.The year 2011 was the costliest on record for natural disasters with cascading effects (Japan) and trans-boundary consequences (Thailand), adding up to US$380 billion (Bt11.6 trillion) in economic losses, almost doubling the 2005 record of $262 billion. In the first nine months in 2011, East Asia sustained about 80 per cent of all disaster losses worldwide.Growth of assets and population in harm's way is the single largest driver of disaster risk. Asia's urbanisation is unique in terms of growth of population, cities and densities. From 1980 to 2010, Asia added more than a billion people to its cities - more than all other regions combined - and another billion dwellers will live in cities by 2040.Urban Asia has high population densities and most of the world's mega-cities - by 2025, their number is expected to increase to 21 out of a global total of 37. Growth of assets and mega-cities means that multibillion-dollar disasters are becoming more widespread in the region.According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Extreme Events and the latest scientific evidence, long-term trends in normalised losses have not been attributed to natural or man-made climate change. Unplanned or poorly planned rapid urbanisation creates highly vulnerable communities, particularly through informal settlements and inadequate land management.

                SINGAPORE - The Pearl River Delta comprising a cluster of cities in Southern China has overtaken Tokyo as the world's largest urban area in terms of both population and land area, the World Bank said on Monday. The Pearl River Delta, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan and Dongguan, has 42 million inhabitants, a population larger than that of Argentina, Canada or Malaysia, the bank said in a report on urbanization in East Asia. The report said that almost 200 million people in East Asia, which includes Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia, moved to urban areas in the decade ended 2010. About 36 percent of the population in the region lived in urban areas as of 2010, up from 29 percent at the beginning of the decade. The report, based on data including those gathered through satellite imagery and geospatial mapping, said that the region has 869 urban areas with more than 100,000 people, including eight megacities with a population of over 10 million as of 2010. Urban areas in the region expanded at an average rate of 2.4 percent per year during the decade, with urban land reaching 134,800 square kilometers in 2010. Urban populations rose at a faster rate of 3 percent. The report also finds a link between urbanization and income growth. World Bank urban development expert Abhas Jha said he hopes the report will push policy makers to a shift from a "car centric" to a "people centric" strategy in growing cities to address challenges such as traffic congestions. The report also said that data shows that only less than one percent of the total area studied is urbanized and that the urbanization in the region has just begun given that only 36 percent of the population is urban.

            <p>
                China's urbanization drive will create larger clusters of cities, in terms of economic power as well as size and population, according to experts.Chinese policymakers favor the development of clusters of relatively large cities, rather than megacities.According to a World Bank report on Monday, the Pearl River Delta in South China has overtaken Tokyo as the world's largest urban area in terms of population and land mass.

                Yemen's Houthis announce missile attack on Riyadh
            </a>
            <p>
                SANAA - Yemen's Shiite Houthi rebels fired a barrage of ballistic missiles on the Saudi Defense Ministry in Riyadh and oil giant Aramco in Saudi border region of Najran, the Houthis said in a statement on Wednesday."The rocketry forces of the Yemeni (Houthi) army and popular forces have already fired a barrage of long-range ballistic missiles, Burkan-H2, toward the headquarters of the Saudi Defense Ministry in the capital Riyadh," said the statement, which is posted on the Houthi-controlled state Saba news agency."Other several ballistic missiles were fired toward the headquarters of the Saudi oil giant Aramco in Saudi border region of Najran," the Houthis added.Houthis said the barrage of missiles also targeted King Abdullah city in the Saudi border province of Jizan.Though, the Saudi-run Al Arabiya television channel reported that Saudi air defence forces had intercepted and destroyed several ballistic missiles over the capital Riyadh, and southern provinces of Jizan and Najran.Hours earlier, the Houthis said that they had launched drone air strikes on a facility run by oil giant Saudi Aramco in Najran and on a civil airport in Abha city in the Saudi border province of Asir.However, the Saudi company tweeted that its establishments were operating "normally and safely."Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV reported that the Saudi air defence forces had shot down the drones over Abha city and Jizan province.Houthis have recently intensified such attacks with the completion the third year of Saudi-led war against the Iranian-allied militias in Yemen.A day earlier, Houthis said they fired 2 ballistic missiles; one on a military camp in Asir and the other on a military camp in Jizan.In March 2015, Saudi Arabia led a military coalition of Arab forces, backed by the United States, to intervene in Yemen's conflict to back the government of exiled President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.The coalition has launched thousands of airstrikes on the Iran-aligned Shiite Houthis, in attempts to roll back rebels and reinstate President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi in the capital Sanaa.In return, Houthis have fired hundreds of ballistic missiles toward Saudi cities, with most of them intercepted by Saudi air defense forces.The war has so far killed more than 10,000 Yemenis, mostly civilians, and pushed the Arab country to the brink of mass famine.
