                Irrational behavior of US increases risk of recession
            </p>
            <p>
                Editor's note: The United States recently announced it would further raise tariffs on Chinese goods, a move that highlights the nature of its trade bullying. Zhong Sheng, a columnist for People's Daily, comments:According to Morgan Stanley, raising tariffs to 25 percent by the US would be enough to slow global economic growth to below 2.5 percent. Bernard Dewit, chairman of the Belgium-Chinese Chamber of Commerce, believes that the "weaponization of tariffs" by the US will not only lead to increased global trade barriers and a decline in trade volume, but also create a negative demonstration effect triggering vicious competition that drags the global economy into the mire.The US administration has tried to undermine multilateral trade rules and sabotage the security of global industrial and supply chains, causing turbulence in the international financial market and impeding international trade and world economic growth. Their activities go against the trend of economic globalization and the principles of market competition, and have significantly increased the risk of a global recession. In an interconnected global economy, any attempts to promote decoupling and confrontation through protectionism and unilateralism are a deviation from reality and will not work. An article recently published on The New York Times website revealed the cruel reality that "Apple Inc tried to manufacture a small number of high-end computers in Texas, but could not find a supplier in the US to supply all the screws".More and more people of insight point out that the irrational activities of the US administration, that are without any sense of justice and responsibility, have seriously damaged market confidence and triggered turmoil in the global financial market. The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization and other international institutions have repeatedly warned that if the trade war continues, it will have a greater impact on the global economy. At the recent G7 summit, leaders from France, Germany, the United Kingdom and other countries expressed deep concerns about the economic and trade frictions provoked by the US. European Council President Donald Tusk warned that escalating trade tensions between the US and other countries will likely plunge the world into recession.It is an irreversible trend that multilateralism will replace unilateralism, and win-win cooperation will replace zero sum policies. If some in the US continuously attempt to stop this trend, it will undermine not only the interests of China and the US, but also the interests and well-being of the people all over the world.

                China Daily editorial: Message delivered; was it received?
            </a>
            <p>
                The US leader has not been very happy to be seen as an outlier among the other leaders attending the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, mainly because of his different stance on issues such as the Iran nuclear deal and climate change, which have made it impossible for the world's major industrialized countries to unite around common goals.But then he prefers to talk rather than listen, and he has hitherto paid little heed to complaints that the trade war he has launched against China is aggravating the woes of other countries.The European economy faces dim prospects, with Germany already on the brink of a recession after its economy declined in the second quarter, and a possible no-deal Brexit set to bring even more chaos. The trade war between China and the United States has only worsened the situation.That is why, just before the start of the G7 summit, European Council President Donald Tusk said that "trade wars will lead to recession" while stressing that the Sino-US trade confrontation would be really risky for the whole world.That worry was shared by French President Emmanuel Macron, who told other leaders at the summit on Saturday that "trade tensions are bad for everyone. We have to try to get a de-escalation, to stabilize things to avoid this trade war that is happening everywhere".Even British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, described by the US leader as the "right man for the job", told the US leader at a Sunday breakfast meeting that "we don't like tariffs on the whole … We are in favor of trade peace", having said on his arrival on Saturday that the trade war was "not the right way to proceed".Rarely have European leaders spoken with such unity on an issue. By doing so they will have hoped to drive home the message to the US leader that in a closely interconnected global economy, no one wins in a trade war, everyone loses.Hopefully, that message has been received, since the US leader said on Monday that the two sides will begin "serious negotiations" soon, as both sides understand the consequences and where the other stands.China wants to make a deal. But that deal can only be reached based on equality and mutual respect. It does not want any "decoupling" of the world's two largest economies, as some in the US have trumpeted, knowing it benefits from that coupling. But it will not acquiesce to unreasonable demands.Let us hope his talks with the European leaders have helped the US leader appreciate that the interconnectedness of the US and Chinese economies also benefits the US, and that a trade deal is in everyone's best interests, the US included.

                G7 leaders struggle for breakthrough
            </a>
            <p>
                Summit produces no communique as differences remain on key issuesG7 Leaders posed for a family photo in the French oceanfront town of Biarritz on Sunday evening as a sign of unity, but the meetings have been marred by sharp differences on key issues.It is the first time in the 45-year history of the G7 summit that no joint communique is issued. Leaders had stark differences over trade, climate change, Iran nuclear issues and inviting Russia back to the table.In a meeting with US President Donald Trump on Sunday morning, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson congratulated Trump on "everything the American economy is achieving", and quickly added: "But just to register a faint sheep-like note of our view on the trade war: We're in favor of trade peace on the whole, and dialing it down if we can.""We think that, on the whole, the UK has profited massively in the last 200 years from free trade, and that's what we want to see... We don't like tariffs on the whole," said Johnson, whom Trump has often praised.Like Johnson, many European leaders, from European Council President Donald Tusk to French President Emmanuel Macron, voiced their opposition to the trade wars during the meeting.The summit kicked off on Saturday as China and US announced a new round of tit-for-tat tariffs in their escalated trade conflict.When asked by reporters on Sunday, Trump admitted to having second thoughts about raising tariffs against China. The words have been widely interpreted as hope for a possible truce between the world's two largest economies.But White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham and White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow later said Trump only responded "in the affirmative－because he regrets not raising the tariffs higher".Grisham said Trump's "answer has been greatly misinterpreted".Some analysts interpreted the move as White House crisis management of Trump's conciliatory message which might be harmful to his 2020 election campaign.Trump has been sending conflicting messages on China trade. On Sunday he said US and China were getting along very well and were talking. On Monday, Trump said that China is ready to come back to the negotiating table and the two countries will start talking very seriously."I think we are going to have a deal," he said, according to CNBC.While Trump was isolated on the trade war at the summit, he claimed victory on Sunday when he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said they hope to sign a trade deal in New York next month.Trump said that Japan had agreed to purchase excess US corn, but Abe referred to a potential buy of the corn and said it would be handled by the private sector.Abe said that more work remained, but expressed optimism that it would be finalized in September.Inviting Russia?Aside from trade, Trump met strong opposition from other leaders about whether to invite Russia back to the G7 summit. Russia was kicked out of the G8 in 2014.On Sunday, the French government said G7 leaders had agreed during the Saturday dinner that it is far too soon for Russia to be invited to rejoin the exclusive club.But Trump said no such decision had been taken to keep Russia out. The US will be the host of next year's summit and the host usually can decide who is invited, but doesn't have the power to restore membership."Trump evidently fought vigorously at the G7 to have Russia invited back, but was rebuffed by the Europeans," Carl Bildt, former Swedish prime minister, said in a tweet on Monday.Douglas Paal, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the G7 is on life support. "Trying to bring Russia back into it will do nothing to revive it," he said.The Guardian contributed to the reporting.
