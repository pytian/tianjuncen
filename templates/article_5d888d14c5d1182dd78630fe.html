                At least 40 people feared dead or missing in latest shipwreck off Libya coast: UN
            </p>
            <p>
                GENEVA - At least 40 people are believed to have drowned off the coast of Libya in the latest boat disaster on the Mediterranean, the UN refugee agency UNHCR said Tuesday in a statement.The UNHCR statement said that some 60 survivors have been rescued and brought to shore in the coastal town of Al-Khoms, around 100 kilometers east of Tripoli."A rescue operation, carried by the Libyan Coast Guard and local fisherman, has been underway since this morning and is ongoing," it said.This shocking incident has prompted UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency to renew its urgent call for action to save lives.UNHCR said its teams are providing the survivors with medical and humanitarian assistance.This latest incident follows just weeks after a shipwreck where some 150 lives are estimated to have been lost in the worst single incident on the Mediterranean this year."We must not simply accept these tragedies as inevitable," said Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR Special Envoy for the Central Mediterranean. "Sympathies must now become actions that prevent loss of life at sea, and prevent the loss of hope that motivates people to risk their lives in the first place."According to UNHCR, following Tuesday's tragedy, it is estimated that some 900 people have lost their lives attempting to cross the Mediterranean in 2019.

                Divided G7 starts tough summit with trade tensions high on agenda
            </a>
            <p>
                BIARRITZ, France - Leaders from the world's seven most industrialized countries started the divided group's 45th summit, clouded by a pile of tough issues with trade tensions high on agenda, on Saturday evening at the French seaside resort Biarritz.After an informal welcome at the landmark lighthouse overlooking the extremely heavily secured small town, French President Emmanuel Macron and his guests -- Angela Merkel (Germany), Boris Johnson (Britain), Justin Trudeau (Canada), Giuseppe Conte (Italy), Shinzo Abe (Japan) and Donald Trump (the United States) -- will strive to search for common ground amid worsening divergency in next two days.Tough issues piled on the agenda: tightened trade tensions, trans-Atlantic relations at historical low, climate challenges with unprecedented fires in Amazon rainforest, Brexit with a highly probable scenario of no-deal, Iran nuclear deal at stake, Russia-Europe relations as well as digital taxation dividing not only Brussels and Washington but also members within Europe, just to name a few."This meeting is useful, important ... otherwise we would have to divide among ourselves," said Macron in a televised speech earlier in the day.Conflicts relating "Iran, Syria, Libya, Ukraine and several other international crisis" will be discussed. "Tensions, especially commercial ones, are bad for everyone. We must succeed in reaching a de-escalation, stabilise things and avoid this trade war which is already taking place everywhere," he added.

                US fooling no one with claims of innocence in HK: Opinion
            </a>
            <p>
                For no particular reason I've been thinking of Claude Rains in Casablanca lately. You remember him; the Moroccan police captain who is "shocked, shocked" to find gambling in Humphrey Bogart's establishment during a raid, only to be handed his winnings without missing a beat.You might wonder at the relevance of that famous movie moment. I'll explain.Amid ongoing violence and turmoil in Hong Kong, Chinese media outlets have brought up a few relevant facts: That "pro-democracy" opposition heads had met with politicians in the United States, protest leaders had been in contact with State Department officials and major figures like Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi have issued statements supporting the demonstrators. With all this in mind, it's been suggested the US has been inflaming tensions in the city and encouraging escalation in an already heated environment.To wit, the Claude Rains moment: Members of the diplomatic corps were "shocked, shocked" by this news. Why, it's unthinkable that the US, that bastion of democracy and freedom, would ever attempt to interfere in the affairs of another country! China was called a "thuggish regime" for even bringing this up — naturally, the "free press" was all crickets when it came time to do their purported jobs and speak a little truth to power.Safe to say none of these faux-outraged government functionaries or their lapdogs in the media bothered to ask a Libyan what they thought of the idea. The NATO intervention there in 2014 turned the African country with the highest standard of living into a disaster zone, complete with open-air slave markets.They wouldn't have asked an Iraqi, either. I'm sure the families of the million-plus people killed by the US military since 2003 would have a few things to say about their invaders' good intentions.Or a Haitian. Or a Syrian. Or a Venezuelan. Or a Honduran. Or an Iranian. The list goes on.The truth is US "diplomacy" has never been that innocent, and everyone knows it. State Department personnel — in league with military and intelligence agencies — have spearheaded countless interventions since the turn of the 20th century, destroying countries or political formations they saw as counter to US interests. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 and especially after the Cold War began, this meant subverting communists or socialists and materially supporting anti-communists and fascists.Among the best-known examples of this skullduggery are the hundreds of assassination attempts on Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro — none successful; he died at 90, probably laughing at the US as he went — and the overthrow of democratically elected Chilean Marxist Salvador Allende. The US loved democracy so much in the latter case they replaced Allende with a military dictator. These and many other interventions were overseen by the same sort of "diplomats" who now act offended at the notion they may be doing something untoward in Hong Kong.But things are a little different now. These clandestine activities used to be the sole purview of the Central Intelligence Agency, and when word got out the US' definition of "liberty" really meant "not being communists", quite a few people were furious. So in a long process which began in the 1970s, the CIA delegated its regime change responsibilities to a host of organizations, each given a degree of separation with some legalese and clever accounting.Though the Agency remains a potent force for subversion — and you would have to be truly naïve to think their cloak-and-dagger era is over — the interventional landscape has been somewhat diversified, with a host of non-governmental organizations taking the place of traditional spies. The National Endowment for Democracy, the largest among them, has of course given a great deal of money to "pro-independence" forces in Hong Kong. Nothing to worry about, I'm sure.Allan Weinstein, an early leader of one such think tank, admitted it outright when he said "A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA." While this makes US influence operations easier to track, it also gives them a veneer of respectability among the general public. It's a bigger deal when a government agency is funding rebellious elements in another country; much less so if it's some "non-governmental" cutout with a bit of plausible deniability.When news of CIA activity broke in the past, it was big news. That was bad for optics. Somewhere along the way, powerful government figures and capitalists realized by doing all their influencing in the open — and with a media that had long since stopped pretending to question motives — the scandal brought by secrecy would go away. This has worked wonders on a browbeaten population fed a steady diet of propaganda. It turns out if you're told every other country on earth is inferior to yours, you'll start thinking intervention is great for everybody else.Some people normally skeptical of official US narratives look back on this sordid history and conclude it's a thing of the past, the stuff of ancients. But what's changed between then and now? Why would any empire stop consolidating its influence if it had the ability to continue? In fact, the US' capacity for interference has only grown more sophisticated since the end of the Soviet Union. With that country's dissolution in 1991, the world lost a counterweight against imperialism — and logic dictates things would get worse rather than better in an era of unilateral hegemony.So the question remains: Why would the US' well-established, well-funded campaigns of subversion suddenly cease? Well they wouldn't, of course. There's an equally bizarre notion from otherwise right-thinking people that intervention stops at certain countries' borders. This is patently ridiculous. If it can happen in Venezuela, Iran, Libya, Cuba or Syria, it can happen in Hong Kong — a geographically small Chinese territory with longstanding ties to the West. It is, in fact, perfectly positioned as a pressure point for the rest of China.And it's not just a question of economic or political systems anymore. The US doesn't trust anyone, even its own imperial allies; recall that the National Security Administration had German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone tapped for years. There's no telling how they're keeping tabs on other NATO members. Because the US has the largest economy and military many times over, however, leaders who might otherwise speak out against this treatment stay silent. Yet the idea of US benevolence still has a hold on the world's imagination. I encourage anyone on the fence to think about it this way: If this is how the US treats its friends, imagine what it tries to do to its enemies.And make no mistake, the US considers China an enemy. It says so in official statements and policy briefings, and academics and journalists uncritically launder these claims for a mass audience on their enormous platforms. No matter how many times China says it wants peace and to handle its own affairs, the myth of the "China Threat" persists — stoked by US "diplomats" and their lackeys in the press.These inflammatory statements serve a twofold purpose. On a personal level, they attract attention to the authors' work and better position them for career advancement. More broadly, they further US interests and provide cover for narratives that wouldn't get consideration by the public if they came straight from the military-intelligence apparatus. It's a win-win for everyone — except the US' victims.None of this is to say that things in Hong Kong are perfect, or that everyone in the city was happy as a clam before the State Department and NED came along. Severe inequality plagues the city, and must be addressed for the government to enjoy continued support from the people. But bad actors take advantage of existing negative sentiments and amplify them, turning issues that could be handled peacefully into profound existential crises.This playbook has worked for decades now, undermining countless sovereign governments whose existence ran counter to the interests of the United States; it's the height of foolishness to think it can't happen here.The author is a copy editor with chinadaily.com.cn.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                Vienna holds off Melbourne to top EIU ranking of most livable cities
            </a>
            <p>
                VIENNA, Austria－The Austrian capital has retained its ranking as the world's most livable city, according to an annual report from the Economist.Vienna once again came ahead of Melbourne, Australia－which had held the top ranking for seven years until losing it to Vienna in 2018－according to a report from the Economist Intelligence Unit, or EIU, released on Wednesday.The top two were followed by Sydney, Australia; Osaka, Japan; and Calgary, Canada.Each year, the EIU gives 140 cities scores out of 100 on a range of factors such as living standards, crime, transport infrastructure, access to education and healthcare, as well as political and economic stability.Vienna－known for its convenient public transport, refreshing Alpine tap water and varied cultural life－scored 99.1 points out of 100, as it did last year."Western Europe and North America continue to be the most livable regions in the world," the EIU said in a news release.Europe claimed eight of the top 20 spots, with cities in Australia, Canada, Japan, and New Zealand making up the rest.However, the City of Light, Paris, dropped six places to 25th due to this past year's anti-government yellow vest protests－images of which went around the world.For the first time, the index noted the effects of climate change on livability, with New Delhi and Cairo plunging in the rankings to 118th and 125th place, respectively, due to "poor air quality, undesirable average temperatures and inadequate water provision"."We expect problems relating to climate change to put increasing pressure on livability scores in the coming years and for the number of cities affected to grow," Agathe Demarais of the EIU said.Improvements in livability that had taken place in cities of emerging markets in recent years－thanks to greater stability as well as better education and healthcare－"are under serious threat from an increasingly adverse climate", she said.London and New York rank 48th and 58th, respectively, as they continue to struggle under the perceptions of the risk of crime and terrorism and overstretched infrastructure.The least livable cities were Karachi, Pakistan; Tripoli, Libya; Dhaka, Bangladesh; Lagos, Nigeria; and, at the very bottom, Damascus, Syria.Vienna, for the tenth time, also won top place in another survey this year, the annual quality of living index by human resources consulting firm Mercer.AFP

                Wintery Xinjiang offers warm welcome
            </a>
            <p>
                Xinjiang was under a quilt of white snow when we landed at the Urumqi airport. Though my country, Nepal, is a land of majestic mountains, in my hometown snowfall is rare. So I was quite excited to see the panoramic snowy land in Urumqi.It was February and weather in Xinjiang was freezing. A white blanket of snow stretched as far as our eyes could see. Every breath turned into white mist. Thanks to the administration of Urumqi, every corner of Xinjiang more magnificent with under a cover of white snow. We almost disregarded the chill and enjoyed every moment, even at night.Before I landed to Urumqi, I thought life in Urumqi would not be like other Chinese cities, including Beijing. I have read news about riots and instability in Xinjiang, but, contrary to my expectation, I found Urumqi totally different. Not only did the snowy land impress me, the rather charming and smiling faces of local people and their colorful dress attracted me as well. There seemed to be no signs of despair in the smiles of people there.The Grand Market, which we visited first, was a model market where we experienced the diverse ethnic flavor of the region. Some old women were dancing to indigenous steps. Their faces were glowing with pleasure and their pleasant mood inspired visitors to dance along. Local people, mostly youths, were enjoying a musical concert. Though we didn't understand the lyrics of the song we felt the warmth of their art. The Southern Mosque near the Grand Market is an iconic signature monument of Urumqi.Even on snowy days, roads were filled with traffic.Behind our hotel was a grand statue of Buddha. Wow! That was what I never expected there. I thought there must be mosques and a few churches in Xinjiang, but never expected any Buddhist statue. It made me feel proud, as I am from the Buddha's land.We went to a restaurant near the Southern Mosque. Salient features of the restaurant were the local food they serve and the traditional cultural program they perform. We experienced the prosperous ethnic culture of Xinjiang through ethnic dances and songs. Cultural performances were so energetic, not only did the artist dance and sing, almost all in the audience, people from various countries, participated in the performances in their own ways.Our next destinations were some of the major mosques in Urumqi. We found mosques there, more academic institutions where Islam is taught as knowledge of life rather than any dogma. Imams at the mosques were happy to meet some Muslims with us, who share the same religious faith. Really impressive was the intricate art and architecture inside the mosque. An imam trained in Libya described the religious life of the Xinjiang people to us.Xinjiang is a land of various ethnicities and religions. History has framed Xinjiang as the large lake where tributaries from various civilizations meet and intermingle with each other to frame a new society.In one of the community centers, a large monument of a pomegranate was constructed to symbolize the ethnic unity among the various communities in Xinjiang. Children in the center were really charming, like flowers in a garden. They showed their talent and asked us to dance with them. Children there are taught two languages - one their mother language and Mandarin Chinese. They sang the Chinese national anthem and showed their deep respect to their motherland.Xinjiang is one of the major parts of the Belt and Road Project. It is a main entrance of central and west Asia to China. Xinjiang was a trade hub during the era of the Silk Road and hence a conjunction of various world civilizations. Gold was one of the major trade stuffs during those days. Xinjiang has continued the tradition of the gold trade. We were amazed to see the grand collection of gold and jewelry during our visit to the Gold Park in Urumqi.During our visit, some leaders of CPC local committees shared their experiences of poverty alleviation in various areas of Xinjiang. Impressive was their attempt to narrow-down the cultural and economic gap between various ethnic groups there. Xinjiang government, with assistance of the central government, has laid a strong foundation of economic and infrastructure development. Moreover, some developed Chinese metropolises, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, are assisting in the economic and infrastructural development of Xinjiang through technological aid, knowledge and human resources sharing.Some so-called international media have been propagating "terror" and "pathetic" people's life in Xinjiang. But we found all such propaganda to be fake and politically motivated when we witnessed on-the-ground reality there. People seem busy with their businesses. Modern industries are flourishing at a higher pace.When we were on the way back from Urumqi, the day was warm and brighter. From the sky, we wave our hands to bid farewell to the beautiful and magnificent heavenly city, Urumqi.Niraj Lawoju is a Kathmandu-based journalist.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                ROME - Rome and Paris showed a willingness to move in a coordinated way after Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and French President Emmanuel Macron held talks late Wednesday on such key issues as immigration and instability in Libya.Macron was the first European leader to pay a visit to Rome after the formation of Conte's new coalition government of the Five Star Movement and the Democratic Party."Opinions may diverge, but this must always happen within a solution-oriented dialogue based on mutual respect, as it is due between two founding members of the European Union (EU)," Conte told a joint press conference after the meeting.Echoing Conte's remarks, Macron said that "it can happen to quarrel sometimes, but we will always find ourselves in the end."During this visit, the two leaders vowed to move in a coordinated way."It is crucial for the EU to move towards a structural management of migration inflows, instead of (taking) an emergency approach," Conte said."We need to get this topic out of the anti-European propaganda," he said. "We also need to manage the phenomenon in an efficient and realistic way."The prime minister said he had "the full openness of president Macron" on working together for a European mechanism to manage arrivals and distribution of refugees, and for a more efficient repatriations of migrants not entitled to asylum.Italy has long asked EU partners to accept shares of the migrants brought to land by rescued ships operated by humanitarian groups in the Mediterranean."I am sure we can agree on such a European mechanism coordinated by the European Commission," the French president said."This would allow (countries of first arrival such as) Italy or Malta to have the guarantee before the rescue boats arrive that all these people will be taken care of," he said.The two countries' interior ministers will meet next week to follow up on these proposals, according to Macron.On the Libya issue, a topic that Conte's office had anticipated it would be a crucial issue in the talks, the two leaders discussed a common strategy, and in this case not only in the EU framework but also within the United Nations."On Libya, there is a real convergence between France and Italy," Macron told reporters."Rome and Paris have worked together, providing specific messages to our partners, and we are both convinced the only way out for the Libyan crisis has to be found in the dialogue and a political process," he added.
