                Overseas investment inevitably means risks and uncertainties for Chinese companies, but many have started using insurance services to help control and reduce risks."Chinese companies face new situations while investing overseas, namely that global politics and economics have become more complex," said Wang Tingke, general manager of China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation, or Sinosure, China's State-funded policy-oriented insurance company."So while going abroad, Chinese companies need to increase their awareness of risks and set up comprehensive risk management systems."Sinosure, established in 2001, said that it has supported Chinese companies export or invest in countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative to a total of value $724 billion by the end of March, since 2013.It has set up more than 2,300 insurance policies for projects that Chinese companies are carrying out in countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, and has paid a total of $2.8 billion in insurance claims to Chinese companies.The Belt and Road Initiative, proposed by China in 2013, aims to build stronger links among countries across the globe.Guan Wenfeng, assistant general manager of Sinosure Fujian branch in Fujian province, said that about 10 years ago he needed to keep telling companies that have international business or want to invest overseas what policy-oriented insurance products are. But gradually more companies started contacting Sinosure to find out about insurance services for investing overseas."The first year we established Fujian branch in 2002, the insured amount by Sinosure Fujian was only $34 million," he said. "Last year it was $13.6 billion."At present Sinosure's overseas investment insurance protects investors from economic losses resulting from political risks such as expropriation, exchange restrictions, war, political instability and breach of contract in countries where investments are made.It also offers insurance products to companies or financial institutions, encouraging financial institutions to provide loans or other Sinosure-approved forms of financing for Chinese companies' overseas investment projects by assuming the loss of their claims on debts.Sinosure also offers consultancy services to its customers, including evaluating risk in places where investment is proposed. The Handbook of Country Risk, an annual report first published in 2005, has become an important reference for Chinese companies investing overseas.The report conducts in-depth analyses on four types of risk in destination countries: political, economic, business environment and legal. It also reports on risks in different industries, providing company case studies, and then offers suggestions accordingly."The annual handbook by Sinosure is an important guidance for us in avoiding risks overseas or when we are looking for new market opportunities," said Wang Lijun, vice-president of China Road and Bridge Corporation.A policy-oriented insurance company such as Sinosure offers a great deal of support for Chinese companies and products going overseas. With the support of Sinosure's insurance services, CRBC has received loans totaling about $10 billion and has completed several important projects in countries including the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway in Kenya and the Maputo Bridge and Link Roads in Mozambique.Chen Zhongjie, general manager of Hongdong Fishery, a company based in Fujian province, said that as a private fishery company, it is difficult for it to obtain loans for investing overseas, and his knowledge about overseas markets is limited.Sinosure's insurance services have helped Hongdong obtain financing and accelerated Hongdong's construction of a whole industrial chain fishery plant in Mauritania, where infrastructure was very poor."Chinese companies do invest in the fishing industry overseas, but everybody faces different situations, including differences in policies, regulations and cultures," Chen said. "Sinosure has given us a lot of information about investment destinations. Its insurance services have increased our credit and helped us obtain financing from banks, which in turn has helped ensure the success of our project."

                    Fear of heights is no obstacle to obtaining high achievement
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                A fear of heights is not the best prerequisite when checking on the restoration of tall buildings. But Guo Qianru, 32, was able to compartmentalize her misgivings when checking restoration work on the nine-story high Basantapur Tower in Nepal's famous Kathmandu Durbar Square. No mean feat, considering part of her daily routine involved negotiating 20-meter scaffolding every day.Working for the Chinese Academy of Cultural Heritage, she was dispatched by the Chinese government in 2017 to help Nepal reconstruct the landmark tower and its auxiliary buildings which were partly destroyed during the earthquake that hit the country in April 2015.However, when the China-aided project was given the go-ahead, Guo found she and the local cultural heritage protectors had differing opinions on whether to tear down the dilapidated exterior walls of the historical complex."I preferred to repair the walls and reinforce the existing structure because we follow the principle of minimum intervention, while local officials hoped that we could build a new structure in place of the remaining exterior walls," says Guo.The walls, she discovered, could be saved and maintained by filling the gaps between bricks with mortar. This meant her team could protect the original brickwork, structure and components as much as possible.Finally, the two sides agreed on a course of action that ensured that the old walls and structure would be maintained. Later, local officials started to understand her ideas and even tried to search for old tiles for Guo's team."It's common to be confronted with difficulties when I'm playing a part in an overseas project," says Guo. "When I have successfully overcome a dilemma, I become more confident in myself."Guo's story in Nepal is told in a documentary, My Youth on the Belt and Road, which spotlights how young Chinese people strive for peace as well as economic and social development in countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, including Honduras, Indonesia, Zimbabwe and Uganda.The documentary has notched up nearly 90 million hits on MGTV, a streaming platform, and has been shown overseas. Its third season will be aired on Hunan TV on April 7."To make the 10 episodes of the new season, the production unit had to face various challenges and difficulties, such as extreme weather, weak mobile phone signals and sometimes attacks by wild animals," says Fu Zhuo, the documentary producer.Fu adds that some of her colleagues suffered from dermatitis, inflammation of the skin, and appendicitis during their work. They were exposed to a breakout of measles when recording the work of a Chinese medical team in Madagascar.Fu says she hopes that by making the program, the spirit of all the young explorers working in BRI-related projects could be passed on. They plan to make 100 episodes of the documentary and cover all the countries involved in the initiative.The new season focuses on another group of young people who work on infrastructure construction, environmental protection or medical services in countries mainly in Africa and Latin America. These stories relate the experiences of a number of workers, including 34-year-old Zhou Na, who works out ways for curbing desertification in Mauritania, 28-year-old Xiao Hanbing who helps increase pepper yields in Nigeria, and 35-year-old Zhang Guangrui who helps combat elephant poaching in Zimbabwe. These stories, as well as that of 36-year-old Li Manxiong who teaches farmers in East Timor how to process coffee beans to achieve higher incomes, show not just the professionalism but also the dedication of the workers.Ma Li, an official from the National Radio and Television Administration, says the documentary has provided a detailed picture of how China is strengthening its bonds with other countries by filming the day-to-day life of ordinary people.She believes that this will lead to many more touching and inspiring stories being revealed in the future.

                    Belt and Road makes good progress in Arab world
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Through continuous efforts, both sides have made significant progress under the framework of the initiative The Belt and Road Initiative has been widely supported and welcomed by the Arab countries. At the eighth Ministerial Meeting of China-Arab States Cooperation Forum held in Beijing July 2018, China and Arab countries signed three important documents including the Beijing Declaration, the Action Plan for 2018-2020 and the Declaration of Action on China-Arab States Belt and Road Cooperation. Earlier, China signed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative with nine Arab countries - Saudi Arabia, the Republic of the Sudan, Iraq, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Lebanon, Egypt and Morocco. At the same time, cooperation documents on energy with five Arab countries including the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Egypt were signed as well. Further, seven Arab countries - the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and Egypt - have become founding members of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The Arab countries actively participated in the first Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing in May 2017. Through continuous efforts, both China and Arab countries have made significant progress in cooperation within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative. In the progress of key infrastructure projects, for example, China has collaborated with Algeria in the construction of the Algerian central port, with Egypt on the"10th of Ramadan" railway and main power grid transmission line, an Egyptian glass fiber production line and the Egyptian small satellite assembly test center. Besides, achievements have been made in areas such as the Abu Dhabi port in the United Arab Emirates, the expansion of the friendship port in Mauritania, and the Mohammed VI Bridge, China Reinforce Energy Cooperation in Morocco, the Road stadium in Qatar, the oil shale power station in Jordan, a power station project in Oman and the upper Atbara water conservancy project in Sudan. Financially, China has allocated $15 billion of special loans (loans for special purposes) to support industrialization in the Middle East, which consists mostly of Arab countries, and $10 billion in concessional loans (loans on favorable terms). China has also set up renminbi clearing centers in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and a joint investment fund totaling $20 billion with the two countries as well. With the efforts from both China and the Arab countries, the cooperation between them has made remarkable progress, for instance, the Sino-Egyptian Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone, the Sino-Arab Industrial Park in Oman, the Industrial Agglomeration Zone in Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates Capacity Cooperation Demonstration Park in China have been continuously promoted. China and Arab countries have also focused on strengthening dialogue and consultation, and wedding the Belt and Road Initiative in line with the development strategies and policies of the Arab countries based on their own situations. China and Arab countries strongly benefit from each other in economic and trade exchanges. Specifically, in recent years, the business environment of Arab countries has improved, and the governments have made great efforts to attract Chinese investors. Thus the Belt and Road cooperation between China and Arab countries is building a road of peace, prosperity, and opening-up for both China and the Arab world, which helps expand cooperation and serves the common interests of both sides. Arab countries are supportive of the rules of multilateral trading under the framework of the World Trade Organization to achieve the goal of realizing the sustainable development of all nations. However, there are still some issues in China-Arab economic and trade cooperation such as the unstable multinational political situation, economic policy, government efficiency as well as the legal and compliance rules in Middle East, which reduces the confidence of Chinese investors. Also, prominent financial risks make financing difficult. Al these instabilities hinder the progress and development of Chinese-funded enterprises in Arab countries. In this situation, the Chinese business community should strengthen cooperation with the Arab commercial sector to standardize and give guidance to business activities under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative. Chinese investors should promote dialogue with Arab countries on the basis of the existing industrial and commercial cooperation mechanism, with a focus on the security, taxation and employment restrictions for Chinese companies. Chinese companies should strengthen investigation and analysis of the market environment, and the political, legal, cultural and religious situation in Arab countries to improve the risk evaluation and risk control. To sum up, China and Arab countries should push forward the Belt and Road Initiative on the basis of their own situation and characteristics. And all sides must adhere to an inclusive approach toward cooperation and promote openness to achieve mutual benefits.

                The people of Islamic Republic of Mauritania on Saturday went to the polls to vote for the next president to replace President Ould Abdel Aziz. He is stepping down after serving two five-year terms as stipulated by the constitution.Polls opened at 7 am local time (0700 GMT), reported African News Agency.The incumbent president, who positioned himself as an ally of the west in the fight against the Islamic militants, is supporting Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, a 62 year-old former general and defense minister.Five other candidates are also on the ballot including a prominent anti-slavery campaigner and a former Prime Minister, Sidi Mohamed Ould Boubacar, who is tipped as Ghazouani's main rival.The Northwest African country has 1.5 million eligible voters, according to the official figures.

                An exhibition showcasing China's progress in human rights opened at the United Nations' main office in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday.The exhibition, named Pursuing Happiness for the People: 70 Years of Human Rights Progress in China, displays some 120 photos as well as films and virtual reality videos related to the topic.Mauritania's permanent representative at the UN Office at Geneva, Mohamed El Habib Bal, spent nine years as his country's ambassador in Beijing before taking up his new post early this year."It's a very good exhibition," he said. "I appreciate the effort made by China in human rights."Arline Diaz, Venezuelan counselor to the UN Office at Geneva, was particularly impressed by a VR video showcasing landscapes of the Great Wall, mountains, rivers and cities."They are generating electricity with solar panels. So amazing," said Diaz, who has traveled extensively around the country.Lu Guangjin, director-general of State Council Information Office's human rights department, said the happiness of the people and further development of human rights are high priorities for the Communist Party of China."The achievement of China's development boils down to one fact: The livelihoods of the Chinese people have been improving day by day," Lu said at the exhibition's opening ceremony on Monday, which coincided with the opening of the 42nd session of the UN Human Rights Council.Gennady Gatilov, Russia's permanent representative to the UN Office at Geneva, said China has made significant steps in promoting human rights over the last 70 years.Gatilov said Russia and China have a common vision about how to promote human rights according to the UN Charter and on the basis of the rule of law and international agreements. "We will be continuing our fruitful cooperation with Chinese colleagues and friends here in Geneva," he added.Kham-Inh Kitchadeth, the Laotian permanent representative to the UN Office at Geneva, said: "I know personally the evolution of human rights in China. The country has made major achievements in human rights. China's great achievements are important to learn for other developing countries."Speaking at the opening ceremony, China's permanent representative to the UN Office at Geneva, Chen Xu, said the collection of more than 100 photos and dozens of short videos "captures some wonderful moments over the past seven decades as China consistently made progress in human rights, improved the well-being of its people and made joint efforts with international partners for better human rights protection".At a related event on Monday during the UN Human Rights Council session, Chinese human rights experts and academics shared their research and personal experiences of human rights progress in various fields."China's human rights cause has achieved comprehensive progress," said Wu Leifen, deputy secretary-general of the China Society for Human Rights Studies, citing a long list of statistics which show China's phenomenal progress in everything from per capita GDP growth, education and longevity to poverty alleviation and the rule of law.
