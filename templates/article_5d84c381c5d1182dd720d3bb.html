                Kenneth M. Quinn, president of the World Food Prize Foundation, has a great story about President Xi Jinping's 2012 visit to Iowa, when the Chinese leader talked about his interest in author Mark Twain and the Mississippi River.In 1985, Xi, then party secretary of Zhengding county in Hebei province in North China, led a delegation to Muscatine, Iowa, and stayed with a local family for two days.Muscatine, a city located near the Mississippi River, did not come into the spotlight until Xi, who was so impressed with the hospitality of the local residents, returned to the small Midwestern city to meet his old friends during his US visit in 2012 as Chinese vice-president.Quinn recalled that he talked about Twain and about "seeing the sun over the Mississippi River".Xi made the comments during a toast at a reception in 2012 hosted by the then-governor Terry Branstad at the Iowa Capitol in Des Moines. Quinn was a guest at the reception.On the next day, then-agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack and China's minister of agriculture Han Changfu signed a historic Plan of Strategic Cooperation that would guide the two countries' agricultural relationship for five years."And the agricultural agreements were signed for the purchase of $3.5 billion in soybean, reflecting the tenor of the time," Quinn recalled. Quinn spoke at a Vision China event at Asia Society in New York on Tuesday.The former US ambassador to Cambodia, deputy assistant secretary of state as well as a member of the National Security Council staff at the White House has seen firsthand the transformation China has undergone in the past four decades.Earlier in 1979, Quinn made his first trip to China, when he accompanied Iowa governor Robert Ray on one of the first post-normalization of relations exchange visits.With Ray, Quinn had the opportunity to meet with China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping. Since then, Quinn has paid frequent visits to China."Arguably, the past decades may come to represent the most dramatic period of economic growth ever to occur in China's history," he said."I tell people all the time that China is the most transformed country on Earth, that no other country has done more in the past 40 to 50 years," he said, adding that the success of the Chinese model cannot be ignored by the Western world and is pertinent to every nation.Quinn, 76, who is retiring at the end of the year, has led the organization since 1999. The World Food Prize is annually bestowed upon individuals who work to end the scourge of global hunger.In 1993, He Kang, as China's minister of agriculture, traveled to Des Moines to receive the World Food Prize, a $250,000 award. The prize was created in 1986 by Norman Borlaug, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, to recognize scientists and others who improve the quality and availability of food supplies.While He was recognized as a representative of China's efforts to boost agricultural production exponentially, Yuan Longping, the "father of hybrid rice", received the World Food Prize in 2004 for developing a plant that yields more grain than anyone thought possible."He (Yuan) is an incredible example of Chinese scientific achievement," Quinn said. "And he's spreading his knowledge and his capacity through his National Hybrid Rice Research and Development Center."The president of the World Food Prize Foundation, which is often referred to as the Nobel Prize in food and agriculture, praised China's efforts for the future of food.

                Former Trump campaign manager uncooperative at House hearing
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - Corey Lewandowski, former campaign manager for US President Donald Trump, showed an uncooperative attitude on Tuesday at a congressional hearing on alleged presidential obstruction of justice and abuse of power."We as a nation would be better served if elected officials like you concentrated your efforts to combat the true crises facing our country as opposed to going down rabbit holes like this hearing," Lewandowski said in his opening remarks before the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee.Lewandowski was the first witness of what some Democrats have called an impeachment investigation against Trump.The hearing came less than two months after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified about his report on a 22-month probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election and Trump's actions to obstruct the inquiry.As the hearing began, Lewandowski demanded that Democrats provide him a copy of the report before reading directly from it and making it clear that he wouldn't say much beyond Mueller's findings."He's filibustering," said Jerrold Nadler, chair of the Judiciary Committee and a New York Democrat.Trump praised Lewandowski's performance on Twitter.A public version of the Mueller report released earlier this year stated that there was no evidence that Trump's campaign conspired with Moscow during the 2016 election but didn't offer any conclusions about the obstruction case.There were two episodes in which Trump asked Lewandowski to direct then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit Mueller's investigation, according to the report.The uncooperative attitude from Lewandowski was expected as the White House had tried to limit the scope of his testimony.In a letter to the House panel on Monday, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone said that Lewandowski could not testify about conversations with Trump after he became president or with his senior advisers."The White House has directed Mr. Lewandowski not to provide information about such communications beyond the information provided in the portions of the Report that have already been disclosed to the Committee," according to the letter.The White House also ordered two other witnesses, former Trump White House aides Rob Porter and Rick Dearborn, not to testify at Tuesday's hearing.Lewandowski, 45, served as campaign manager for Trump's 2016 campaign from Jan 2015 to June 2016. He is mulling a run for the US Senate.

                GM, striking workers resume negotiations
            </a>
            <p>
                The union striking General Motors says the automaker should have made its latest offer sooner, and the walkout by nearly 50,000 workers may have been averted. GM said it had offered to make more than $7 billion in new investments in US plants, add 5,400 jobs and increase pay and benefits. United Automobile Workers Vice-President Terry Dittes said in a letter to GM on Sunday that the union was disappointed that GM waited two hours before the contract expired on Saturday night to make what the union considered "its first serious offer". "If the union received that offer earlier," he added, "it may have been possible for the two to reach a tentative agreement, and the strike may have been avoided." GM and the UAW resumed negotiations Monday to end the strike at factories across the Midwest and South, the first walkout since the automaker emerged from taxpayer-funded bankruptcy a decade ago. US President Donald Trump said Monday that he was "sad" to see the strike and hopes it is "a quick one". "My relationship has been very powerful with the autoworkers, not necessarily the top (UAW) person or two but the people that work doing automobiles," Trump said at the White House, where he was meeting with the crown prince of Bahrain. "Nobody's been better to the autoworkers than me," he said. "I'd like to see it work out, but I don't want General Motors building plants in China and Mexico... I don't want these big massive auto plants built in other countries, and I don't think they'll be doing that anymore." Trump later said that "federal mediation is always possible, if that's what they want". A prolonged strike could disrupt local economies in factory towns in several swing states like Michigan and Ohio, where Trump has promised to increase manufacturing jobs. Democrats seeking their party's presidential nomination, including former vice-president Joe Biden and senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, gave their support to the striking workers. Democrats see recapturing blue-collar votes in the region and the loyalties of union members there as central to winning the White House in 2020. Four US Democratic members of Congress from Michigan also announced on Monday that they supported the union autoworkers. Trump won Michigan, GM's home state, by 10,704 votes in 2016. He carried Wisconsin by 22,748 votes and Pennsylvania by 44,292 votes, promising manufacturing workers he would overhaul trade deals that he said sapped US manufacturing jobs. Those three states were enough to give Trump a victory in the Electoral College against Hillary Clinton, even though she won the popular vote by close to 3 million votes. Meanwhile, the union's bargaining agreement expired on Saturday and the UAW leaders in Detroit voted to strike, which immediately halted production in the United States. The UAW's demands include higher wages, improved healthcare, job security, profit-sharing and the reopening of idled plants. GM wants employees to pay a greater portion of their healthcare costs, and to increase work force productivity and flexibility in factories. A prolonged strike could affect GM's bottom line and thousands of its parts suppliers, as well as Canadian and Mexican operations. The strike hits GM's revenue nearly immediately because GM records wholesales to dealers."We estimate lost daily revenue of $312.6 million," said David Whiston, automotive equity analyst for Morningstar, a financial services firm. Workers would be losing millions in aggregate, too. Union members will receive $250 a week while out of work, but the assistance pay is available after the 15th day of the strike. If GM's North American profits are hit, the company could lower annual profit-sharing checks union members receive each March. Those checks have averaged $11,000 over the last three years. "Workers will feel it immediately because if they move to strike pay, that's miserable," said Kristin Dziczek, vice-president for industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan, told The New York Times. GM made $8.1 billion globally last year but it has idled three plants in the US as sales and overall demand for vehicles weakens. GM operates 12 vehicle assembly factories in the US and 22 parts plants. aiheping@chinadaily.com (China Daily Global 09/18/2019 page3)

                Gun violence costs $229b per year: report
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - Gun violence costs the United States $229 billion annually, amounting to 1.4 percent of its gross domestic product, according to a report released Wednesday.The report, which used data from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the Centers for Disease Control for a state-by-state analysis of gun violence costs, was commissioned by congressional Democrats.Lost income represents the biggest cost to the nation's economy, the report said. Other major expenses include employer costs, police and criminal justice responses, and health care treatment.Rural states, including Mississippi and Alabama, have the highest costs of gun violence measured as a share of their economies.States with high rates of gun ownership such as Alaska and Arkansas have the highest rates of gun suicide. Alaska also has the highest overall gun death rate per capita of all 50 states.The report also found that children and teens were also at a much higher risk of firearm-related injuries and deaths in the United States, compared to other advanced countries."The United States stands alone in this degree of gun violence," Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat told a hearing on Wednesday. "The human costs are beyond our ability to comprehend, it is tragic, it is sickening and it is a crisis."The report came as the White House is reportedly circulating a memo on Capitol Hill detailing a possible proposal to expand background checks for gun sales.The memo proposes expanding background checks to all advertised commercial sales, including sales at gun shows.If someone who attempts to buy a firearm fails a background check, it would be reported to law enforcement officials, according to the memo.In this past summer, several mass shootings claimed scores of lives in the United States, bringing back public attention to the nation's gun violence epidemic.The White House and congressional Democrats, however, remain divided over what actions should be taken.There have been 40,331 gun violence-related incidents in the United States this year as of Wednesday, killing a total of 10,681 people, according to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive.

                Creating a future for the homes of Beijing's past
            </a>
            <p>
                The Neighborhood Warming Initiatives 2019, part of Beijing Design Week, is to focus on the renovation of hutong (alleyway lined with traditional residences in Beijing) and quadrangle courtyards and residents' participation in building management. The event, between Sept 10-20, aims to preserve the local housing in historical and cultural blocks in a way that also satisfies modern lifestyle demands, its organizers said. They added it comprises nearly 100 activities such as exhibitions and forums. The Master Zeng's Time Photo Studio invited 10 couples born in 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded, and took wedding photos for them. The studio activity also showcased designers' work for improving hutong residents' life quality and their emotional connections. The reception room of Baitasi Block co-hosted an activity in cooperation with Beijing Pagoda Light International Youth Hostel, inviting visitors and local residents to interact by preparing Beijing and Western food. The interaction activity can help tourists learn about culture and life in Beijing, an internationally acclaimed tourist destination, and promote neighborly relations in the new era, the organizers said. The Beijing Green Corridors 2020 exhibitions have been held four times since 2016. This year's theme is landscape inside and outside Beijing. The 2019 exhibitions displayed design results of the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway green landscape; the historical Nanluoguxiang neighborhood, a busy south-north commercial area hidden among hutong; and the ancient Changxindian town in Beijing's Fengtai district. Hutong is a cultural symbol of Beijing. There was an exhibition showing the daily life of Bing Yi, a modern artist, in hutong in Dongcheng district. By displaying how life in hutong brought vitality to her life and work, the exhibition aimed to introduce visitors to a new hutong lifestyle and to increase the use and social value of preserved residential blocks. The initiatives are held in different venues in the Baitasi historical and cultural conservation area located in Xicheng district. They can be dated back to the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). The area is home to a white pagoda in Miaoying Temple built in the Yuan Dynasty; a former residence of late renowned writer Lu Xun; a market selling flowers, birds, fish and insects; and quadrangle courtyards in a combination of Chinese and Western architectural art. The area is in an old neighborhood and one of the few existing residential areas featuring low buildings in the ancient capital. It is seeking a new path for urban improvement and community revitalization, local people said. The initiatives are part of the Baitasi Remade Plan to realize Beijing's overall plan for 2016-35. The Baitasi plan aims to explore ways to improve the public environment and help regional revitalization. Its purpose is to maintain the residential role of hutong and traditional quadrangle courtyards. Meanwhile, it is to create new cultural blocks featuring elements such as design, cultural creativity and exhibitions. (China Daily 09/20/2019 page19)
