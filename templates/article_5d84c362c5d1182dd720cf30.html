                The head of Britain's once-powerful trade union movement has called on Parliament to outlaw discrimination against the working class, citing income gaps between people of different social backgrounds.It may be three-quarters of a century since reforming politicians attempted to level the playing field by introducing universal education, free healthcare and other egalitarian measures, but Britain - or more specifically England - continues to be obsessed by the issue of class.Keen-eared, keen-eyed Brits can instantly position their fellow citizens on the social scale by their accent, their table manners or their dress, and they judge them accordingly.What concerns Frances O'Grady, head of the Trades Union Congress, known as the TUC, is that young people from a working class background can still expect to earn less than their counterparts even when they are engaged in the same work."The system is rigged from the start," she told the TUC's annual conference. "Where you come from. What your parents do. Your accent. Which school you went to. If you're from a workingclass family, the odds are stacked against you."She proposed that companies should be forced to report any gaps in pay between workers from different social backgrounds in the same way as they are obliged to report on any wage gaps linked to ethnicity or gender.Among the concerns of labor union officials is that employers interviewing new staff often display a perhaps unconscious bias against applicants from more modest backgrounds.The class issue has inevitably surfaced in the context of Britain's Brexit debate, with supporters of the 2016 referendum vote to quit the European Union interpreting it as a revolt by a marginalized proletariat against an ill-defined ruling elite.Academic research showing that the leave vote was most concentrated among those who would define themselves as middle class has failed to overturn this misconception.Ironically, among the chief defenders of the perceived revolt of the dispossessed are Boris Johnson, the eminently bourgeois prime minister, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, a parliamentarian who never tires of projecting an aristocratic image. Both men went to Eton, the country's premier public school. In the lookingglass world of the English class system, a public school is one that elsewhere in the world would be called a private school.Britain's post-World War II reformers hoped that their policies would make class distinction a thing of the past, as they aimed to introduce equality of opportunity, if not necessarily equality of outcome.Tony Blair, who was leader of a Labour Party government until 2007, sought to establish a meritocracy in which the most able from any social class would rise to the top. The theme was also picked up by Theresa May, one of his Conservative successors as prime minister."I want Britain to be the world's great meritocracy," she said in 2018, "a country where everyone has a fair chance to go as far as their talent and their hard work will allow."She added: "And I want Britain to be a place where advantage is based on merit not privilege; where it's your talent and hard work that matter, not where you were born, who your parents are or what your accent sounds like."The reality, in 21st century Britain, is that it has become more and more difficult for talented youngsters from a working class background to progress toward a better life than their parents enjoyed. Increasingly, economics, not just social snobbery, is holding them back.Outsiders continue to look on Britain's class obsessions with a mixture of fascination and bemusement. In many societies, money, rightly or wrongly, tends to be the measure of people's self-identification in the social order.In Britain, however, a middle class family fallen on hard times will always feel themselves the social superiors of the self-made millionaire who rose from the working classes.These atavistic attitudes will not dissolve overnight. After all, they have survived the legacy of post-war progressive legislation.The fear, however, as expressed by the TUC's O'Grady is that the country is going backwards by entrenching class privileges that many hoped would one day disappear.Changing patterns of work and above all declining job security, once jealously defended by the now-depleted union movement, means many at the lower end of the social scale have fallen into a poverty trap from which they and their children will find it impossible to escape.Education, theoretically free to all, now imposes the burden of high college fees on those who can ill-afford to take on debt. The best jobs go to those whose parents can afford the fees at expensive public – that is, private - schools.If you grew up in the wrong part of town, speak with the wrong accent, went to the wrong school or had the wrong parents, it seems that in contemporary Britain, the odds are still stacked against you.

                Activist should brush up on history
            </a>
            <p>
                With his innocent schoolboy look, student activist Joshua Wong is attempting to woo the world into believing that Hong Kong is a city where the basic rights as stipulated in the Basic Law are eroding as fast as global warming is causing the ice caps to melt.In New York and Washington, he is competing with Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg, who in the same week is trying to get the attention of members of the US Congress. Considering her quick wit, I somehow think she will win the battle for Congress' attention.Prior to his Washington trip, Wong, recently granted bail, flew to Germany to rally support for his tale. He told German media that Hong Kong was "like Berlin in a new Cold War". Clearly history was not his forte at school.Following the end of World War II, Berlin－which had been the capital of the kingdom of Prussia and subsequently of the German Empire－was divided between the different occupying forces. The Battle for Berlin had been won by the Soviet forces, who initially occupied the whole city, but subsequently handed control of zones to their (then) allies France, Britain and the United States. This evolved into the city being divided into East Berlin occupied by the Soviets, and West Berlin by the US, Britain and France, which fused their zones in the whole country to create the Federal Republic of Germany.The changing geopolitical alliances led to the Soviets attempting to regain control of all of Berlin by implementing an economic blockade of West Berlin leading to the famous Air Bridge operation, whereby West Berliners received food through airlifts. The Cold War had begun, and in 1963, US President John F. Kennedy made his landmark speech while visiting the city, with the pronouncement, "Ich bin ein Berliner" (I am a Berliner).Hong Kong has been a Chinese city for centuries, except for the British colonial period, which ended in 1997, after which Hong Kong returned to the motherland. Hong Kong was never the capital of China, was occupied by the Japanese during World War II, was a British colony for over 150 years, and currently has a unique status under the "one country, two systems" policy. How this is comparable to Berlin during the Cold War escapes me.The attempts by protesters to drag the US and UK governments into their orbit is becoming absurd. This must be the only occasion in post-colonial history where, 22 years after the ending of colonial rule, people are waving old colonial flags while demonstrating, and acting as if a return to colonial rule would be in the interest of Hong Kong people.The fact that the demonstrations are possible in Hong Kong, and even tolerated despite protesters having no permit to do so, is ample proof that the rights guaranteed under the Basic Law are being upheld. As for London lending them support for their democratic cause, I rather doubt that the Royal Navy will return to Repulse Bay anytime soon.The reason for the US roadshow that Joshua has embarked on is to attempt to persuade the US Congress to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which aims to amend the existing Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. Of course, any resolution that contains the words human rights and democracy sounds as if it must be reasonable, and who could possibly oppose it? However, the main body of the act seems prompted by the possible consequences of the now withdrawn amendments to Hong Kong's Fugitive Ordinance, so the raison d'etre is considerably weakened.The draft act also stipulates that protesters' visas to enter the US won't be negatively affected by their having participated in "nonviolent protest activities".Sadly, in view of the protesters' relentless campaign of wanton destruction－the vandalizing of subway stations, the gasoline bomb attacks and the assaults on citizens with different viewpoints－this visa issue will obviously become more challenging for the protesters. The foreign governments should ask themselves if they in similar situations would respond with the extraordinarily measured response of the Hong Kong police.Time and time again, the demonstrations veer off into acts of violence, which do not do anyone any good.Sadly, Joshua Wong has not used even a second of his international airtime to condemn the destruction and descent into uncontrollable chaos initiated by his followers. This shouldn't go unnoticed by those he is attempting to woo, especially if they stand on a high moral pedestal.The author is an adviser on China-related matters to both the private and public sectors, and was the first non-Chinese CEO of a Chinese State-owned finance company. The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.

                Only one UK firm in five ready for no-deal Brexit
            </a>
            <p>
                 Four British companies in every five are woefully underprepared for a no-deal Brexit, according to a new survey of supply-chain managers.The Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply's study, which was published on Wednesday, found only 22 percent of United Kingdom companies have completed the four steps it says are needed to continue trading with suppliers in the European Union.The institute, which is also known as Cips, conducted a similar survey in March and found 14 percent of UK enterprises had completed the four steps, meaning there has been a small improvement in the six months since then, but not a significant enough change to avoid queues at borders following a no-deal Brexit.John Glen, an economist at Cips, told the Financial Times the findings show "with the Brexit deadline just weeks away, the government faces an uphill battle to get businesses ready in time".The four steps relate to whether companies have an "EORI" number – which is necessary to interact with EU customs authorities – as well as whether they know how to fill in a customs declaration, whether they have agreed responsibilities with a customs agent or logistics provider, and whether they are familiar with the software needed to submit customs documents.The Cips survey found that many enterprises hope to avoid the worst of any anticipated disruption by importing goods earlier than they would ordinarily have done, something that has had the knock-on effect of snarling up the nation's warehousing space.But Peter Ward, the chief executive of the UK Warehousing Association, told the Financial Times that inquiries from companies seeking additional warehouse space are still only about half the level they were in the weeks leading up to the ultimately abandoned March 2019 Brexit deadline, something he attributes to "Brexit fatigue"."The Oct 31 deadline couldn't have come at a worse time, clashing with peak season in logistics in the run-up to Christmas, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday," he said.The Cips survey quizzed 817 supply-chain managers at companies involved in 11 sectors of the British economy.The government is encouraging businesses to get ready for the Oct 31 Brexit deadline through its recently launched Prepare for Brexit information campaign.Meanwhile, documents prepared by the UK's Department for Transport that were leaked to the Financial Times suggest disruption caused by UK companies not having the correct customs documents would be serious. The papers show the government anticipates EU ports will turn trucks away if drivers do not have the right paperwork, rather than let them queue dockside.Other government documents quoted by the Guardian newspaper show London's own planning for a no-deal Brexit includes the expectation that 85 percent of freight trucks attempting to cross the English Channel may be bumped by French customs authorities.The Guardian newspaper said UK companies are responding by stockpiling beer, wine, and spirits,in a bid to keep the alcohol flowing at Christmas.Glen, the Cips economist, said: "It's particularly wine from the EU. Companies have bought well ahead of Christmas this year, due to potential disruption at the ports and to try and avoid depreciation in the value of sterling against the euro."Britain is France's biggest export market for champagne, quaffing 26 million bottles a year, which is worth billions to the French economy.
