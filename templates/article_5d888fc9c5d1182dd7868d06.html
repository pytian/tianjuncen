                'Color revolution' stands no chance of success in HK
            </p>
            <p>
                In the past two months or so, Hong Kong has witnessed intensifying violence on its busy streets by mindless rioters. They have broken into and ransacked the Legislative Council Complex, besieged the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong SAR, desecrated the national flag and national emblem, and attacked multiple police stations as well as the Hong Kong Police Force headquarters. Their illegal acts have seriously affected people's daily lives with frequent traffic jams and even actions designed to paralyze the operation of Hong Kong International Airport. By harassing tourists and subjecting a reporter from the mainland to illegal detention, unauthorized body searches and even a form of torture, they have also grossly violated the basic human rights of other people while damaging Hong Kong's image in addition to trampling on freedom of the press. These illegal acts indicate that not only has the anti-legislation campaign against the extradition-law amendments gotten out of control, but also has shown signs of terrorism and even a "color revolution".Terrorism must be destroyed by force, and so should a "color revolution". In Western countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom and France, whenever public protests turn violent, the government immediately condemns illegal acts while the police crack down on dissent without hesitation. Riot police are deployed as soon as protesters start attacking government buildings. Although they call their countries "the free world", they definitely do not recognize absolute freedom or anarchy in the name of democracy. As for violence, they show no restraint but respond in a harsh way to protect the safety and interests of the local community. This is a common principle in all nations around the world regardless of their faith or ideology.It is high time the SAR government took effective measures to stop illegal acts. It needs to restore peace and order for the 7 million Hong Kong residents and also for visitors coming to the city. Otherwise, the success of the "one country, two systems" principle will be compromised by a "color revolution" instigated and conducted by Western powers led by the US. Looking back at similar political disasters that struck several governments in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, it is not hard to see that Western powers are trying to launch a similar "color revolution" in Hong Kong, in order to undermine China's stability and prosperity. The reason why the US and UK governments are supporting illegal activities in Hong Kong with such reckless abandon is that they know it is absolutely impossible to subvert the central government directly.Three weeks earlier, on Aug 2, US President Donald Trump called the protests in Hong Kong "riots" and said that it is China's business how it handles the "riots" and therefore there was no need for him to offer any advice. His comments were apparently unfiltered and based on his personal observations. However, on Aug 15, he inadvertently linked his decision to raise tariffs on more imports from China with the political crisis in Hong Kong. This proves that Hong Kong is being used as a bargaining chip against China in bilateral trade negotiations. Despite the declared economic objective, the real purpose of the trade war directed at China is purely political for Trump as well as both the Republican and Democratic parties in the US Congress. The goal is to impede China's peaceful development by interfering in Hong Kong affairs.On June 19, the Speaker of US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, a longtime critic of China's human rights record, called the mass demonstrations in Hong Kong "a beautiful sight to behold", despite the fact that the "beautiful sight" soon turned into a freak show of extreme actions that rocked the global financial hub for the following two months. Then on Aug 6, the radical extremists stepped up their acts of violence in the streets and at Hong Kong International Airport. Consequently, Pelosi said the legislation of the bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act will be enhanced to "reaffirm the US commitment to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law" in Hong Kong. Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying condemned Pelosi's intentions, saying "the US on many occasions denied its involvement in the ongoing violent incidents in Hong Kong. However, the comments from those members of the US Congress have provided the world with new and powerful evidence of the country's involvement".Yet more "powerful evidence" emerged just two days later on Aug 8, when radical protesters brought violence to multiple communities in the New Territories, where they clashed with police officers sent there to maintain public order. A senior diplomat at the US General Consulate went so far as to meet with Hong Kong's leading separatists. This was a clear example of interference in China's internal affairs.That the US is meddling in Hong Kong matters is now a foregone conclusion. The question Washington needs to answer is how it can justify a police crackdown on violent protests at home while encouraging the same illegal behavior and condemning a crackdown by police in Hong Kong. In other words, how does Washington justify its double standards when it comes to street violence in the US and Hong Kong?The UK government has always been poking its nose into Hong Kong affairs. On Aug 9, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab made a phone call to Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to ask her to start an independent investigation into recent events here. The call was seen as a "mistake" because it "grossly intervened in China's internal affairs". Ironically, Hong Kong residents had no freedom to protest under British colonial rule, and the Legislative Council back then was strictly controlled by the colonial governor. Chris Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, was the only one ever allowed to introduce limited democracy in the city. That was three years before the colonial rule ended in 1997. It was done in order to leave an army of loyalists among civil servants as well as the seeds of political unrest after Hong Kong was reunited with China.With all that being said, the central government will give the HKSAR government all the support it needs to end the current political turmoil in Hong Kong. This means the US and the UK governments stand no chance of success in launching a "color revolution" in Hong Kong.The author is a senior research fellow in the Charhar Institute and a guest research fellow in Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, Renmin University of China.

                Johnson plans to suspend Parliament before Brexit
            </a>
            <p>
                The request would limit time for British lawmakers to thwart a no-deal exit British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lock the doors to the Parliament soon after MPs return from their summer vacation on Sept 4 in an apparent attempt to stop opponents blocking his plan to take the United Kingdom out of the European Union on Oct 31, regardless of consequences. Johnson on Wednesday disclosed that he has asked Queen Elizabeth to shut down Parliament, likely between Sept 9 and Oct 14. That means lawmakers would have insufficient time to pass legislation that would prevent the UK from leaving the EU, according to the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. Johnson favors a final exit by Nov 1 even if no details are worked out with the European bloc. Downing Street said Johnson plans to reveal a "very exciting agenda" for the next session of Parliament, which Johnson wants to open on Oct 14. The closure of Parliament, a process known as proroguing, is viewed by many as deeply undemocratic and controversial. Kuenssberg said many senior government ministers were unaware of the plan before it was announced on Wednesday morning. Johnson has repeatedly said he wants the UK to leave the EU on Oct 31, but many opposition MPs and even some fellow Conservative lawmakers say the nation should not leave without a deal that ensures friction-free, tariff-free future trading. Opponents of a so-called no-deal Brexit met on Tuesday and agreed to use parliamentary procedures to block such an exit, a move Johnson now appears to have countered by proroguing Parliament. Conservative Party MP Dominic Grieve, a former attorney general and a prominent critic of a no-deal Brexit said on Wednesday that the prorogation was "an outrageous act" that would lead to a vote of no confidence in Johnson's government. He said: "If the prime minister persists with this and doesn't back off, then I think the chances are that his administration will collapse. There is plenty of time to do that if necessary. I will certainly vote to bring down a Conservative government that persists in a course of action which is so unconstitutional." Tom Watson, deputy leader of the opposition Labour Party, tweeted that the move was an "utterly scandalous affront to our democracy", and Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, called on MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit to meet again to counter Johnson's move or "today will go down in history as a dark one indeed for UK democracy". The Guardian newspaper said leaked emails revealed over the weekend that the prime minister had sought legal advice on a fiveweek prorogation. It said MPs returning in mid-October would have a narrow window of opportunity to vote on any deal Johnson may have worked out with the EU in the interim, ahead of a European Council meeting on Oct 17. In a letter to MPs, Johnson said his decision to prorogue Parliament was not about forcing through a no-deal Brexit. Instead, he said, it was done to allow him to bring forward a "bold and ambitious domestic legislative agenda". The Standard newspaper said more than 200 MPs immediately signed a declaration in Westminster's Church House promising to continue debating issues in an alternative venue if Parliament is suspended. The House of Commons speaker, John Bercow, said he had not been consulted on the move and called it a "constitutional outrage". The Express newspaper quoted Bercow as saying: "However it is dressed up, it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of prorogation now would be to stop Parliament debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country." The Financial Times, meanwhile, reported on Wednesday that Nigel Farage, leader of the Brexit party, is willing to forge a nonaggression pact with Johnson's Conservative Party at the next general election, if both parties campaign to pursue a no-deal Brexit. An unscheduled general election could be held in the fall, either because Johnson's government is toppled by its opponents or because he calls one in the hope of improving his slim parliamentary majority. earle@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily Global 08/29/2019 page6)

                Interpreters preparing for next year's Tokyo Games
            </a>
            <p>
                Small army of interpreters preparing to tell it like it is at next year's Tokyo GamesTOKYO - Alexandre Ponomarev is the chief interpreter for next year's Tokyo's Olympics. He is fluent in Russian, English, Spanish, French, German, Danish and Ukrainian, and he can get by in a handful of others.But at times, even Ponomarev needs an interpreter - for instance, when he's working in Japan."I can't speak all languages, unfortunately," he told Associated Press. "I wish I could."Next year's Olympics will be an interpreter's delight, with more than 10,000 athletes representing about 200 nations and territories - many of which also have minority dialects that are spoken alongside the national language.Stepping into the din are 100 interpreters - 40 from Japan and 60 from elsewhere - handling 11 official languages for Tokyo: English, Chinese, Japanese, French, Spanish, German, Russian, Italian, Arabic, Korean, and Portuguese.It's a team accustomed to interpreting for presidents, prime ministers and monarchs.But the Olympics are different and require fluency in the nuances of judo, the ins-and-outs of archery or the vagaries of modern pentathlon.Then throw in the lingo from new Olympic sports like surfing, skateboarding and sport climbing."They train. They prepare," Ponomarev said. "We have glossaries, we have Olympic terminology and we study different sports."Even that is not always enough.Ponomarev said he was bamboozled when a snowboarder at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics responded in English about a performance."'Oh, totally rad man. Just so bad,'" Ponomarev repeated.Interpretation?"It was a great run.""The surfers, they have their own way of speaking," Ponomarev said. "The same goes for snowboarders at the Winter Olympics. That can be challenging. But we certainly found an equivalent."In Japanese, Arabic, German. Or whatever.Ponomarev's team includes at least one former Olympian, and most have done several Games. He also corrects anyone who confuses interpretation with translation, pointing out that translation refers to the written word.Much of the interpretation service is for athletes after they've won medals. But interpreters also work briefings for the International Olympic Committee, the World Anti-Doping Agenc, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport.In those forums, the focus can be disputes, doping, and other rule-breaking. One poor interpretation can cause confusion, or even legal fallout."They are used to working under pressure," Ponomarev said. "They know that every word they get wrong is going to have repercussions. If you cannot understand what is being said, you do not invent. That is rule No 1."Ponomarev sees the power of artificial intelligence on the horizon, closing in on the professional interpreter's space."AI is not nearly as evolved as one might think to replace humans," he said."I'm not trying to say that I'm not worried about it, because I certainly am to be absolutely honest. Maybe 10 years down the road something will change. Maybe not."He said machines still can't always catch humor, a play on words or intonation. And they "can't see a wink.""It's a similar question. Would you trust your legal affairs to a machine? Would you trust only a machine to fix your teeth or perform surgery on you?" said Ponomarev."It's a common misconception that we interpret words. We don't. We first understand the meaning behind them and then we convey the message."Ponomarev said cultural differences can affect language - and vice versa. He said he might assign a speaker of Brazilian Portuguese to a Brazilian, and a peninsular Portuguese speaker to someone from Portugal. Likewise with Spanish, which is spoken differently across 20 countries."There is a mentality behind every language," he said. "I believe in acquiring a language you also acquire a certain mentality."Tokyo's Olympics will deploy an improved system of interpretation over Rio de Janeiro 2016. Interpreters will work out of the main press center, taking audio and video feeds from the scattered venues. Ponomarev said a recent test of the system was nearly perfect, and could do five media events at once."It worked brilliantly, like a charm," he said.This means nearly every media conference will have simultaneous interpretation, in which the speaker's words are relayed over an earpiece as they are spoken, rather than consecutive interpretation, which is slower and gives an interpretation only after the speaker finishes several sentences.Ponomarev said he worked his first Olympics in 2008 in Beijing, and took over as the chief in Rio. He credits his mother with getting him started, smuggling DVDs of American films into the old Soviet Union.He eventually trained in Moscow and the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California.Under the Soviet system, he was assigned to study Danish, which is not widely spoken but helped with learning German and gave him a conversational understanding of Norwegian and Swedish."Once you acquire one language, you just keep going ... it stacks up," he said.Associated Press

                PM's bid for elections defeated before Parliament shutdown
            </a>
            <p>
                British Prime Minister Boris Johnson suffered another defeat late on Monday before the Parliament shut down for five weeks amid scenes of protests by opposition MPs.MPs for a second time rejected his bid to hold a general election in mid-October.Earlier in the day, with formal assent from the queen, an opposition-supported law went into effect compelling the government to ask the European Union for a three-month extension if no Brexit deal is worked out by Oct 19.That means no poll could be held until the end of November, at the earliest.The parliamentary session ended in acrimony as members held up signs saying "Silenced" and shouted "Shame!" as the shutdown began at about 1:30 am on Tuesday.The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, who earlier on Monday had announced his resignation from the post, was among those to voice his opposition to the lengthy suspension. He tore into the government whip in front of MPs, saying: "It is not standard, it is one of the longest for decades, and it represents, not just in the mind of many colleagues, but huge numbers of people outside, an act of executive fiat."Several MPs were also involved in an altercation near the speaker's chair, as they attempted to prevent Bercow leaving his seat and attending the House of Lords, the next step in the formalities required for the suspension of Parliament.Conservative MPs condemned the behavior as disrespectful. Political party conference season is now approaching and MPs not due back in Parliament until Oct 14, when a queen's speech will spell the start of a new session, but the existing deep divisions will likely still remain.Bercow announced that he will leave his posts as both Commons speaker and an MP within weeks, sparking a race among MPs to take over the crucial position. He told MPs he would stand aside on Oct 31.The Guardian newspaper said the proposed timing for Bercow's departure will be seen as a passing shot at his Brexiteer critics because it could improve the chances of a remain-supporting MP succeeding him.MPs expected to stand for the post include the deputy speakers Lindsay Hoyle and Eleanor Laing, Labour veterans Harriet Harman, Meg Hillier and Chris Bryant, and the Tory MP Henry Bellingham.According to The Telegraph, the Labour Party is considering a plan to vote down the queen's speech when MPs convene again on Oct 21 if no Brexit deal has been found.Opposition MPs would then table a motion of no-confidence, which, if passed, would pave the way for a general election in early December.Meanwhile, in an attempt to outmaneuver Labour, the Liberal Democrats are making moves to cancel Brexit altogether without a second referendum when a general election is held.The party will tell voters that if their MPs win a majority, they would revoke article 50 rather than postpone Brexit again to hold a referendum.The move would effectively sever the chances of an alliance with Labour at a forthcoming general election. "I relish the chance to take the fight to Boris Johnson in an election and I'm confident we'd make significant gains," said Jo Swinson, who was elected as the party's first female leader in July.
