                On Sept 19, the International Bamboo and Rattan Organization (INBAR) and the Dragonfly Design Center co-organized a series of activities at the INBAR pavilion in the International Horticultural Exhibition 2019 in Beijing.Wang Chuncheng, deputy director-general of Beijing International Horticultural Exhibition Coordination Bureau, Zeng Hui, director of Art Design and deputy director of the Organizing Committee of Beijing International Design Week, and Professor Lu Wenming, deputy director-general of INBAR, attended the event.With the theme "A Promising Material," the day-long program, a perfect manifestation of the exhibition's slogan "Live Green, Live Better," explored the various aspects of bamboo, including new material R&D, new design applications and industrial development.As a satellite program of the Beijing Design Week, the exhibition and activities aimed to showcase bamboo as a low-carbon, eco-friendly and future-facing design material that will help us face and tackle the challenges of climate change and environmental pollution, and as a carrier of culture, inspiration and sustainable living, organizers said.September 18 marked the 11th World Bamboo Day, which was founded with hope to raise awareness for environmental protection and the sustainable use of natural resources."A Promising Material" took place on September 19, for the number 919 is a homophone for "to save" and therefore conveys our plea to the planet, organizers said.As the world is faced with the existential threat of global warming and our ecosystem devastated by the increasing amount of non-biodegradable wastes, many countries have taken the action to issue plastic bag bans, implement waste-sorting policies and seek new, eco-friendly materials like bamboo, they said.Known for its biodegradable, non-polluting qualities, bamboo represents the future of green living, and has been gaining favorable attention from designers, manufacturers and policy-makers worldwide.The current lack of new bamboo materials means that the research into the applications of bamboo needs to continue, they added.To this end, Zeng Hui, Professor Fei Benhua, executive deputy-director general, International Center for Bamboo and Rattan, Fu Jinhe, coordinator of INBAR Regional Office in East Africa, Jeff Shi Dayu, founder and creative director of Dragonfly Design Center, Huang Chao, general manager of Hunan Bamboo Sea Carbon Source Biotechnology Co Ltd, gathered together as part of the program, sharing their insights and inspirations while carrying out in-depth discussions on the development, application and design of new bamboo materials.

                How many Americans can say they've shaken hands with President Xi Jinping — and with his father?That was one of the anecdotes offered by the speakers at a Vision China event in New York on Tuesday. The distinguished guests enlightened the 300-strong diverse audience at the Asia Society, who turned out to hear the topics discussed at "China-US Relations: 40 Years & Beyond".Kenneth Quinn, now president of the World Food Prize Foundation in Iowa, joked about a mistake on a graphic posted on the stage's video screen that said in 2012, with the signing of the US-China Strategic Cooperation Agreement in Agriculture, China would buy $3.5 million in Iowa soybeans. The number should have said $3.5 billion."I have to text my special assistant. That's what maybe we get today," Quinn deadpanned, to much audience laughter, referring to the dropoff of soybean exports to China during the current trade dispute.Quinn got to escort Xi Jinping, who was vice-president at the time, to the World Food Prize Hall of Laureates in Des Moines, Iowa, for the agricultural agreement signing. Xi also had been on a "sentimental" return trip to Iowa, which he first visited in 1985."By the way, I just shook your hand, and I'm one of the few Iowans to shake your hand who also shook your father's hand when your father came to Iowa in 1980," Quinn said to Xi through an interpreter."So, Vice-President Xi is walking along. He literally stops in his tracks and he turns and looks at me, and his eyes get big, and a big smile comes across his face and he says, 'You have two interesting stories.'"Quinn then proceeded to tell the first interesting story, when the then-governor of Guangdong province, Xi Zhongxun (father of now President Xi Jinping), arrived in October 1980, where the province and Iowa made a toast to "future trade and friendship". At the time, Iowa had zero agriculture sales to China.After taking the elder Xi to see various sights around Iowa, "We ended up on the second day stopping at the Amana colonies," Quinn said.The colonies were started by German immigrants in the 19th century."It was a total communist society," Quinn said. "It was organized exactly the same as any Chinese village and commune. He (Xi Zhongxun) could not stop asking questions about it."Because in China at that time was this discussion. He was about to start the Shenzhen special zone for manufacturing. Could agriculture be put on a free market basis in China, could it be socialism with Chinese characteristics?" Quinn said."Whatever he took away, they went back, and with Deng Xiaoping, Xi Zhongxun began the incredible transformation of China."The gregarious Quinn also proudly displayed a photo of his 4-year-old granddaughter, who is of Irish and Chinese descent.Other guest speakers included Connie Sweeris, who along with her husband, Dell, played a key role in the "ping-pong diplomacy" of the 1970s between the two nations.In April 1971, she traveled to China just shy of her 24th birthday on a historic trip by a nine-member US table tennis team.There, team members got to meet then-premier Zhou Enlai."What a joy it is to bring friends from afar," Zhou told the team."Every place we went we were served eight-to-10 course banquet meals," Sweeris recounted Tuesday of the hosts' hospitality.Besides the lighter moments, there were some serious ones, such as the current trade standoff between the US and China. (Incidentally, that issue will be addressed once more on Thursday, with a round of talks in Washington, to be followed by high-level talks in October.)Economist Stephen Roach, a leading Wall Street expert on China, explained in simple terms why the current approach to US-China trade disagreements needs to be rethought."I think we need to be much more creative in our negotiating tactics," said Roach, who is senior fellow at the Yale University Jackson Institute of Global Affairs. "I'm looking for macroeconomic adjustments in both countries, where we save more and China saves less."On a video screen behind Roach was a timeline of the various starts and stops to the trade negotiations over the past year and a half, over who wants a deal and who doesn't.Maurice Greenberg, chairman of the Starr Companies, said: "It's time that we have an agreement. I believe it's possible. If both sides can't do it, then both sides will suffer. I'm convinced of that."And the only person on the stage sprinkling in any Mandarin was an American, Max Horne, an avid student of Chinese language and culture. A freshman at Harvard University, Horne was the champion of the 2018 Chinese Bridge Speech Contest for US high school students. He and China Daily's Dong Leshuo cheerfully served as the emcees of the event.

                CHANGSHA - Technicians are busy examining a new magnetic levitation (maglev) train prototype in a factory in Zhuzhou, in Central China's Hunan province.Zhuzhou, a city known as a forerunner of China's rail transit manufacturing industry, is fostering innovation and the production of maglev trains."We have been pursuing independent research of maglev technology and manufacturing maglev trains with our own intellectual property rights," said Zhou Qinghe, president of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co Ltd (ZLCL), a rail transit equipment maker and a subsidiary of China Railway Rolling Stock Corp (CRRC).Shanghai saw China's first commercial maglev system, a 30-km line between the downtown area and the city's Pudong airport. It was put into operation in 2003. The system was based on German maglev technology.Fully supported by its own technology, China's first medium-and-low speed maglev line with a design speed of 100 kilometers per hour began operation in May 2016 in Changsha, Hunan province.At the end of August, the Changsha maglev line had an operational mileage of 3.07 million kms and has transported more than 10 million passengers.Tong Laisheng, head of the maglev research institute of CRRC ZLCL, said that it has been aiming for new breakthroughs and to develop more advanced versions of commercial maglev trains.The 2.0 version of the maglev, with a design speed of 160 kph, is being tested and an advanced driverless maglev train with a top speed of 200 kph is being developed, Tong said."The driverless version can climb to the height of a four-storey building in 100 meters, just like a roller coaster. It will be equipped with a communication-based train control system that combines big-data analysis, realizing real-time diagnosis of trains, maglev tracks and a power supply," Tong said.Liu Youmei, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said China has mastered the core technology for commercial maglev trains and established a system with intellectual property rights, ranging from research, manufacturing, test verification to commercial operation.China has seen the rapid development of rail transit in recent years.Statistics from the China Association of Metros showed that a total of 37 cities on the Chinese mainland had rail transit systems in operation as of June 30, with a total length of 6,126 kms.Some Chinese cities such as Qingyuan in Guangdong province have started maglev line projects, and more cities such as Chengdu in Sichuan province and Jinan in Shandong province are adding maglev lines into their transportation planning to connect city clusters and boost regional integration.Zhou said the fast development of maglev trains is expected to foster a strong industrial chain."More than 90 percent of the 10,000 types of components used in the medium-and-low maglev trains are now purchased in China, which will bring new opportunities for many relevant industries including machinery, electronics and new materials," Zhou said.Apart from commercial operation of medium-and-low speed maglev lines, China is fostering research on variants of maglev trains. A prototype of a high-speed maglev train with a design speed of 600 kph was unveiled in Qingdao, Shandong province, in May. The engineering prototype is scheduled for 2020 and is expected to finish integrated verification in 2021.

                CATL and Daimler strike battery deal Chinese battery cell producer Contemporary Amperex Technology and Daimler reached an agreement to supply the German automaker with batteries for its electric truck fleet starting in 2021, Daimler said on Wednesday. Under the agreement, CATL will provide Daimler with batteries for the Mercedes-Benz eActros, Freightliner eCascadia and Freightliner eM2 models, Daimler said, adding that the Stuttgart-based firm will develop and install the battery systems itself. Earlier this month, German auto supplier Robert Bosch said it was teaming up with CATL to develop high-performance battery cells. Automotive expert impressed with China China will be a key player in designing cars in the coming centuries, a German automotive expert told Xinhua on the sidelines of the 3rd German-Chinese Automobile Congress. "In the future, the Chinese automotive industry will be very important (to the whole industry)," Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, automotive expert at the German CAR Institute, said on Tuesday. "The power train of the future is the electric vehicle. In China, there are some important battery manufacturers, so the country has a big stake in the future vehicles." Dudenhoeffer added he was impressed to observe what is going on in China in the field of artificial intelligence, which he said will help define the car of tomorrow. Tata Motors gets ready to go green Indian automobile manufacturer, Tata Motors, launched its own electric vehicle technology, Ziptron, to power a future range of electric cars, according to a company statement late Thursday. The technology includes an efficient high voltage system, zippy performance, long range, fast charging capability, and a battery with a warranty of eight years, the statement said. The company, which had annual revenue of $45 billion in 2018, is expected to launch an electric car with this technology around January to March next year, the statement said. Speaking at the launch, Guenter Butschek, CEO and managing director of Tata Motors, said, "At the heart of our future EV line-up, this technology will deliver a thrilling driving experience to our customers aspiring to go-green." Car production in South Korea tumbles Automobile production in South Korea posted a double-digit decline last month on fewer business days, a government report showed Wednesday. The number of cars manufactured in local factories totaled 249,390 in August, down 15.9 percent from a year earlier, according to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. It came as the summer vacation for most of workers fell in August. Automotive export diminished 3.4 percent to 164,154 in August on fewer business days that offset solid demand for SUVs and environmentally friendly models. E-vehicle startup gets Amazon boost Electric vehicle startup Rivian Automotive LLC got a big boost from one of its investors on Thursday when Amazon announced it was ordering 100,000 electric delivery vans. Before United States-based Rivian started commercial production at its factory in Normal, Illinois, the Amazon order rocketed it to the forefront of electric vehicle makers. Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in Washington that as part of the online retailer's plan to be carbon neutral by 2040 it would order the electric vans from Rivian, with deliveries starting in 2021. The goal is to deploy all the vehicles by 2024. Rivian, a potential rival to Silicon Valley's Tesla Inc, unveiled its electric R1T pickup and R1S SUV last November, but had piqued Amazon's interest earlier.
