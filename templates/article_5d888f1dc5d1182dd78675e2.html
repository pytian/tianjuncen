                Chinese artists to demonstrate unique aesthetics in US via dance drama
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW YORK - About two weeks away from the US premiere, members of the acclaimed Chinese dance drama Under Siege are busy rehearsing amid the sweltering heat.Combining traditional paper-cutting performances, glamorous Peking Opera costumes, haunting operatic voices, bold martial arts and installation art, Under Siege is a work of contemporary dance based on powerful body language and an authentic Chinese spirit.It retells the story of an epic battle in Chinese history between Chu and Han kingdoms' armies more than 2,000 years ago.The dance theater has been hailed as an aesthetic triumph for its visual splendor since the 2015 debut in China."It is an experimental drama of contemporary dance, highlighting Chinese culture and aesthetics through an international lens," Yang Liping, chief choreographer and director of the show, told Xinhua in an interview over the weekend."We are using modern methods to tell a very well-known historical story," the renowned Chinese dancer said, noting that the themes: strategizing, scheming, laying ambush, crafting a siege...echo throughout the life till this day.Yang said that the integration of various kinds of Chinese cultural elements helps enhance the drama's unique oriental beauty, including the sets of scissors hanging from the ceiling and the red feathers on the ground."The installation art of scissors by American Chinese artist Beili Liu deepens the theme, as the household tool scissor implies danger and fear in Chinese culture," the Chinese dancing master expounding the cultural connotation of the staging with Xinhua.Using motifs such as scissors and red feathers, instead of knives and swords, to portray a key clash in Chinese history, embodies a kind of quite power as well as Chinese philosophy, Yang explained.The theater also features Ambush from Ten Sides, a famous Chinese classical pipa music whose composition describes the very decisive battle of Chu and Han.Yang is a household name in China, making her name back in 1986 with her dance work, Spirit of the Peacock.For decades, she has been dedicated to Chinese folk dance, which usually took inspiration from nature. Under Siege is one of her recent efforts to embark on the timeless themes of siege, ambush and human nature.Yang emphasized that underscoring the unique beauty and national identity of Chinese art forms is essential to the endeavor of going global."This time, from the visual effects to dance to music, it's all purely Chinese," she said, adding that the production is made possible thanks to joint efforts of the entire team."All the dancers are quite talented, trying to portray characters in their own way," said Yang.So far, Under Siege, a China National Arts Fund supported project, has toured across the globe many times and is expected to make its US premiere at New York's Lincoln Center on Aug. 8 and will be staged for three times till Aug. 10.Liu, installation artist and creative consultant of the production, told Xinhua that she expects this well-crafted show would provide US audience with a different perspective toward Chinese culture.Hong Kong-born Tim Yip, who won the 2001 Academy Award for Best Art Direction in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, took the lead in costume and scenic designs for the drama.The US debut comes as a highlight of the ongoing 53rd Mostly Mozart Festival, an annual summer event at the Lincoln Center presenting dozens of concerts, dance dramas, operas and films.

                Motorcyclist races up 999 stone steps in 56 seconds
            </a>
            <p>
                 Chinese motorcyclist Geng Jie on Thursday rode up a 999-step stairway at the Tianmenshan scenic area in Zhangjiajie, Central China's Hunan province.The 33-year-old finished the challenge in 56 seconds.The 218-meter long stairway starts at an altitude of 1,050 meters and reaches a point as high as 1,170 meters."I was attracted to the stairway at Tianmenshan when I first saw it in 2010. With years' efforts practicing, I felt I was ready for conquering this stairway. So here I am," said Geng.The length and the steep drop of the slopes are the two biggest challenges, said Geng, adding that the 41- 39-degree slopes spanning 92 meters in total at the stairway's upper part were extreme tests.Because the stairway is only 1.15 meters wide, he had to keep riding in a straight line all the way to stay safe, said Geng.According to race rules, Geng had to race up the stairway in one go, his feet couldn't touch the ground and his hands couldn't touch the rails.He also couldn't pause for more than three seconds during the race."Even world-class motorcyclists in Spain and Britain won't be totally sure about completing such difficult and risky challenge," said Zhang Rongwei, a motor expert.Born in Qingdao, East China's Shandong province, Geng began biking in 2004 and has won China's national championship for four consecutive years.(Video by Liu Jiang)

                Audience in NYC wowed by Chinese dance drama Under Siege
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW YORK - Marvelous, stunning, gorgeous, breathtaking... Those are the most common words shared by viewers of Under Siege, a Chinese dance theatre piece, after its US debut at New York's Lincoln Center Thursday night."It was so beautiful. The scenery, the performance, the dancing, the costumes, the music... I'm so inspired." A woman who called herself Jacinth told Xinhua after the show.As an experimental stage artwork created by renowned Chinese dancer and choreographer Yang Liping, Under Siege is a fusion of contemporary dance, martial arts, Chinese folk music, Peking Opera, paper-cutting craftsmanship, and installation art, blending traditional Chinese cultural symbols with modern movements.It depicts a legendary war between Chu and Han kingdoms some 2,200 years ago that changed the course of Chinese history. Through unremitting strategizing, scheming, laying ambush, fighting... the drama also reflects the everlasting confrontation of darkness and light in human nature as well as between human beings.Jacinth, who drove all the way from the state of Connecticut to Manhattan for the show, booked her ticket as soon as she saw the advertisement on a social media website because she's been always enchanted by Eastern arts.And Under Siege didn't fail her. Like many other viewers, she was deeply impressed by the final sequence, in which the beaten soldiers of Chu struggle in a thick layer of red feathers that flutter and erupt around them, resembling a sea of blood and the unbearable lightness of life in face of war.Another similarly eye-catching part of the scenic design features thousands of scissors hanging from the ceiling throughout the 2-hour show, which highlight the conflict between the warring factions."The installation art of scissors by Chinese American artist Liu Beili deepens the theme, as the household tool scissor implies danger and fear in Chinese culture," said Yang Liping in an interview with Xinhua weeks ago.Since its debut in 2015 in China, Under Siege has been widely hailed as an aesthetic feast and visual splendor. Hong Kong-born Tim Yip, who won the 2001 Academy Award for Best Art Direction in the feature film "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," took the lead in costume and scenic designs for the dance drama."It is perfect color-matching everywhere," said Enoch Huang, a China-born New Yorker who works as a sales consultant at a luxury store."All those costumes are not only beautifully-looking but designed in accordance with historical facts and each character's distinctive personality," said Huang, who majored in fashion design in college.Every main character in the drama plays a critical role in making the story coherent and convincing. "It's hard to say who is my favorite. The heroes are spectacular, and Han Xin and Yu Ji are really, really good," said Diane Gill, an editor at a publishing house, who added that "it is the best thing I've seen in a long time."It's worth noting that Yu Ji, the beloved concubine of Lord Xiang Yu of Chu and the only female protagonist in the story, is played by a male dancer following a Peking Opera tradition; while Han Xin, a general who contributed greatly to the final victory of Emperor Liu Bang and the establishment of the Han Dynasty, is played by two dancers wearing black and white respectively to depict his perpetual mental struggle between pride and insecurity, ambition and loyalty.Chuck Oliver, a long-time Chinese culture lover, has some knowledge of the historical background of the drama. He thought the production is a very imaginative, modern work and yet very respectful of the original story."It's done in a powerful and gripping fashion," he noted. "Apparently the audience who were not used to this type of drama was very impressed by the action and the emotion that was being expressed.""I hope there's more of this coming from China to the United States, and there are more people who appreciate the value of this," he added.For Huang, the drama's US debut also marked a dream-come-true moment as he finally got the chance to see Yang Liping, who appeared on stage during the curtain call amid a standing ovation from some 2,500 spectators that lasted for nearly 10 minutes."Through the drama I can really see the huge progress of Chinese theatre productions during these years. I've seen several good ones at Lincoln Center already," said Huang, who has settled down here for 10 years. "They are growing so fast. I feel so proud. Just so proud."

                Relocation of rural children gives them a chance to dream
            </a>
            <p>
                Poverty relief policies are helping poor village families find new homes and futuresZhu Yu had an unforgettable summer holiday as one of 12 girls from her community who performed dances in rural parts of Guizhou province in Southwest China.When they performed sign language dances in 22 poverty-stricken villages on Wumeng Mountain, it was the first time most villagers had seen such a performance. Sign language dancing involves moving the fingers of one hand across the flattened palm of the other to mimic dancing legs.Zhu, 11, was born into an impoverished rural village in Bijie, Guizhou. Many impoverished farmers had to leave their hometown due to the lack of arable land in the area. They left to look for better opportunities and higher-paying jobs in prosperous regions.Yang Youyue, a year older than Zhu, remembers her old home in Guda village. "The roof could hardly keep out the wind and rain as the tiles had fallen off," she said.Yang moved with her mother to Zhejiang province to escape poverty and get away from her alcoholic father. Since the age of 5, Zhu has dreamed of becoming a dancer after watching a dance competition involving a Chinese troupe on television.She often imitated dance moves on TV programs, but thanks to poverty alleviation policies, she has been able to pursue her dream.Zhu's family and other Guda villagers were relocated in June last year to a residential community in Hezhang county, Bijie, about 50 kilometers from their hometown.The community, equipped with modern infrastructure and facilities, is now home to more than 9,000 impoverished people from remote villages.
