            <p class="style-content">
                Editor's Note: "As the bright moon shines over the sea; from far away you share this moment with me." Just as poet Zhang Jiuling wrote 1,300 years ago, the glorious full moon evokes strong ethos among Chinese people. It is one of the essential cultural symbols in traditional Chinese culture, connecting the romanticism, homesickness, and transience of human life.From ancient times to the present day, Mid-Autumn Festival, a traditional holiday on the 15th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar with a full moon at night, has kept the tradition of a family get-together. People spend time with their loved ones and enjoy sweet mooncakes while gazing upon the moonlit night sky.With a three-day national holiday, many travel back home and others spend their time in more creative ways. Couples may take a romantic trip to an exotic spot. Families create sweet memories going to a vacationland. In these 12 acclaimed destinations selected by globetrotters, you will certainly find an ideal spot to appreciate the harvest moon.

                    Netanyahu says Israel might launch another strike in Lebanon
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that his country is ready to launch another attack at Hezbollah in Lebanon after fire exchanges broke out along the Lebanese border.Netanyahu said that he had held consultation with the army's command following an anti-tank missile attack launched by Hezbollah earlier in the afternoon."We are prepared for any scenario and will decide how to continue based on further events," he said, warning Hezbollah not to fire more missiles.Shortly after 16:00 p.m. local time (13:00 GMT), Hezbollah fired anti-tank missiles at an Israeli military position near the community of Avivim in northern Israel's upper Galilee near the Lebanese border.Jonathan Conricus, a spokesman with the Israeli military, told reporters that two or three Hezbollah missiles were fired and hit a battalion headquarters and a military ambulance. Both were damaged.There were no injuries among the Israeli forces.Conricus said that in response, the army attacked the Hezbollah squad that fired the missiles with about 100 artillery shells and attack helicopters."This is a scenario that we have been preparing for since Sunday," he said, referring to warnings issued by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who vowed to retaliate against an Israeli drone attack in Beirut last week."Hezbollah executed the attack. However, it failed to cause casualties," he said, adding that the army still "maintains a high level of alert."Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli army confirmed that it sparked fires near the border. According to Hezbollah's al-Manar media outlet, the fires were caused by incendiary materials dropped by Israeli drones.The recent violence was a sharp escalation between Israel and Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed armed group and movement.Israel and Hezbollah, which fought a bloody war in 2006, were on high alert over the past days in the wake of a series of Israeli airstrikes in Syria and Lebanon.

                JERUSALEM - Israel said on Tuesday it was dispatching a team of firefighters to help Brazil with fighting the rampant fires in the Amazon rainforest.The team is comprised of eleven experts in the fields of rescue, intelligence, and forest fires, the Israeli foreign ministry said in a statement.It will provide "assistance and professional know-how to the Brazilian authorities, including the Brazilian government, military and firefighting authorities who are combatting the fires," the statement said.The foreign ministry said the delegation is being dispatched following a phone talk between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.Israel and Brazil have seen strengthening ties since Netanyahu arrived last December in Brazil ahead of Bolsonaro's presidential inauguration ceremony.Later, Bolsonaro paid a visit to Israel in April this year.The fires have been consuming huge parts of the Amazon rainforest, leading to global calls for Brazil to stop the fires.
