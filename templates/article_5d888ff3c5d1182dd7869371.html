                Nadal overcomes Cilic to reach US Open quarters
            </p>
            <p>
                NEW YORK - Three-time champion Rafael Nadal of Spain battled past Marin Cilic of Croatia 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 to reach the quarterfinals of the US Open on Monday."It's so special to see this amazing crowd supporting me. As I said before the tournament started, I've always had a great connection with the crowd here in New York. They are very energetic, very passionate," Nadal said after the match. "I really enjoyed a lot playing in front of the full crowd. Arthur Ashe Stadium here in New York, night session, it's difficult to be better."Nadal looked impatient and lackluster in the second set, but he adjusted well and produced some electrifying moments of brilliance in the third and fourth sets."For some moments in the second set I felt there were too many points in his hands," Nadal said. "He was pushing me back and playing more aggressive than me. I was way back on the return and he was with the right determination to go inside the court.""After the second set I had to make a change or I would be in his hands," Nadal said. "I started to return the second serve inside the court and that gave me a different perspective in points."Nadal will next face Argentine Diego Schwartzman, against whom he has won all seven meetings."Diego is playing unbelievable," the Spaniard said. "I need to play my best in the next round to have a chance to be in the semifinals. But the match of today I think helps."Schwartzman upset sixth seed Alexander Zverev of Germany 3-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 in another fourth round match. It's his second US Open quarterfinal in three years."I had many chances in the first set. So after losing the first set, I was thinking about how to take the chances to be leading in the score in the second set quickly," Schwartzman said. "The second set was important. After that, I think I started to change a little bit my game and I started to think, 'Okay, now this is how I need to play.'"Elsewhere, Gael Monfils of France swept past Pablo Andujar of Spain 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 while Italian player Matteo Berrettini defeated Andrey Rublev of Russia 6-1, 6-4, 7-6(6). Monfils and Berrettini will vie for a spot in the semifinals.

                Serena Williams holds on for US Open win, Wang Qiang through
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW YORK  — Serena Williams was in pain — "acceptable" pain, her coach called it — after rolling her right ankle during the second set of a US Open victory.That was the bad news.The good news for Williams as she pursues a seventh championship at Flushing Meadows and 24th Grand Slam singles title overall is that, while she reached the quarterfinals by beating No 22 seed Petra Martic 6-3, 6-4 despite the ankle issue, No 2 Ash Barty and No 3 Karolina Pliskova both exited her side of the bracket Sunday.Not that Williams seemed to care all that much about being one of only three of the top 12 seeded women who will still be around Monday."I can't afford to look at it that way. Every single match I have played, people come and they play their best. The women that I play are not generally playing at this level against other players in the locker room, so for me, I have to be the greatest, whether it's against the second seed, the No. 1 seed, or the No 80th player in the world," said Williams, who faces No 18 Wang Qiang next. "I have to show up or else I'm going to go home."Williams, who turns 38 this month, appeared to be cruising along to a straightforward victory when she took an awkward step while up at the net for a volley. She tumbled to the ground and sat there, cross-legged, right in the middle of Arthur Ashe Stadium for a few moments.Williams has dealt with various health issues all season, including one that ended her stay at the Australian Open.Might that sort of thing be happening again? Williams immediately asked for a trainer, who added tape to her lower right leg and foot during a medical timeout at the ensuing changeover.Still, Martic thought Williams' play might actually have improved the rest of the way."She started going for even more, I think. She felt like maybe she couldn't move that well anymore," Martic said. "Her shots were really precise. Serve was unbelievable. And when she hits those backhands and those first serves that well, it's not easy to play against her."Williams ended things by raising both arms after smacking an ace at 118 mph, her fastest of the afternoon, punctuating an overpowering performance that included 38 winners to Martic's 11."I didn't know what to expect from her ball. I knew she (hits it) hard," Martic said, "but until you feel it on your own racket, you just don't know what to expect."The scene Sunday brought back memories of Williams' Australian Open quarterfinal in January against Pliskova. Williams was way ahead — holding a match point at 5-1, 40-30 in the third set — when she turned her left ankle awkwardly. From there, Williams was no longer, well, Williams, dropping every point she served the rest of the way.She failed to convert four match points in all that day, ceded six games in a row and lost 7-5 in the third. That time, Williams didn't call for a trainer, which surprised many. Didn't make that mistake this time. And a couple of hours later, she was walking without any apparent hitch in her step. She figured she'd know more about the ankle based on how it responds Monday; she plays Wang on Tuesday.Williams has not managed to complete a non-Slam tournament in 2019, withdrawing from each with one ailment or another, including a viral illness, a hurt left knee and, most recently, back spasms. She hasn't won a title since returning to the tour after having a baby; her daughter, Olympia, was born exactly two years ago Sunday."Best day of my life," Williams called it.Wang, who never had played in the fourth round at a major until Sunday, advanced by surprising French Open champion Barty 6-2, 6-4.Pliskova, the 2016 US Open runner-up, went home with a 6-7 (1), 6-3, 7-5 loss over nearly 2 hours against 16th-seeded Johanna Konta of Britain.This is the only Grand Slam tournament where Konta has yet to reach the semifinals; she'll now meet No. 5 Elina Svitolina of Ukraine, who got past 2017 runner-up Madison Keys of the US 7-5, 6-4 Sunday night.That was followed by defending champion Novak Djokovic against Stan Wawrinka in Sunday's last singles match, with the winner to face Daniil Medvedev. Reprising his trolling role at Louis Armstrong Stadium, the No 5-seeded Russian again begged the crowd to boo him even more after he beat qualifier Dominik Koepfer 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (2)."You give me so much energy to win. Thank you!" he said, similar to his interaction with jeering spectators after his third-round win. "You are the best!"Earlier Sunday, Roger Federer kept up his recent surge, dominating No. 15 seed David Goffin 6-2, 6-2, 6-0 in just 79 minutes. That's one fewer minute than it took him to put together a 6-2, 6-2, 6-1 win against Dan Evans in the previous round."I mean, look, sometimes these scores just happen. You catch a good day, the opponent doesn't, then things happen very quickly," said Federer, who lost in the fourth round a year ago in New York but also earned five of his 20 major championships at this hard-court tournament. "Maybe he struggled a bit early on. But I found my groove after a while and was able to roll, really. Never looked back.""You don't know why you're missing everything, easy balls," Goffin said. "All of a sudden, he's playing well."Federer next takes on Grigor Dimitrov, a two-time major semifinalist who is unseeded at Flushing Meadows.Currently coached by Andre Agassi and Radek Stepanek, Dimitrov eliminated Alex de Minaur 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 to reach his first US Open quarterfinal.Federer is 7-0 against Dimitrov."Given the history of me and Roger, how we've played the past years," Dimitrov said, "nothing (favors) me."AP

                Neymar set to stay at PSG
            </a>
            <p>
                Neymar looks set to stay at Paris Saint-Germain as the clock ticks down on the French league's transfer window, which closes at midnight local time on Monday.Much publicized talks with Barcelona have seemingly led to very little, in what appears to be much ado about nothing.Two years after joining PSG for a world record $242 million, Neymar clearly wanted to leave. But the summer transfer saga between prospective buyer Barcelona and hard-nosed seller PSG turned into a "Will he or won't he?" soap opera in which Barca did most of the talking-with little effect.It was not until Friday night, after PSG won 2-0 at Metz without Neymar, that PSG sporting director Leonardo effectively said a deal would almost certainly not be reached unless a dramatic turnaround happens in the few hours before the window closes."We always said that, if we were happy with an offer, we were ready to let him leave," Leonardo said. "That offer never arrived."There were several reported offers for the Brazil star, including Barcelona sending winger Ousmane Dembele to PSG on loan as part of a cash-plus-players deal with Croatia midfielder Ivan Rakitic also joining PSG along with $143 million).But Leonardo said Barcelona's Dembele offer came far too late on Aug 27, and by Saturday night speculation was winding down amid reports Neymar was resigned to staying.Losing Neymar would have given PSG coach Thomas Tuchel precious little time to recruit a top-level replacement. It has understandably been a frustrating season so far for Tuchel, with Neymar seemingly physically ready to play after two injury-hit seasons yet apparently sidelined in case a move happened."Things in the world of football are crazy, anything can happen," Tuchel said recently with an air of resignation. "The coach doesn't decide everything in a big club with a big-name player like that."It promises to be a difficult month for PSG, which will likely face Real Madrid in the first group game of the Champions League on Sept 18 before traveling to seven-time French champion Lyon four days later.Neymar is available to face Lyon-if he stays-but is suspended for the first three games of the Champions League.Edinson Cavani (hip) and Kylian Mbappe (thigh) are expected to be out for a few weeks and will probably miss both key matches.PSG could find itself facing 13-time champion Madrid with an underwhelming strike force of Eric Maxim Choupou-Moting-who joined last season from Stoke Cityand Jese, who is back at PSG after loans to Las Palmas, Stoke and Real Betis produced just six goals in 43 matches.Jese's appearance as a 90th-minute substitute on Friday against Metz was his first PSG appearance since scoring in a French Cup game in December 2016.The 26-year-old Spaniard arrived from Madrid four years ago amid high expectations, but is effectively now PSG's fifth-choice forward.PSG's injury list also includes defender Thilo Kehrer and midfielder Ander Herrera."I think it will be a difficult season, we have a lot of things to sort out," Leonardo said on Friday. "We're not going to say we're going to win the Champions League. Our ambitions haven't lessened, but we have problems to deal with first."Associated Press

                Defending champ Osaka out of US Open
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW YORK -- Naomi Osaka of Japan ended her title defence at the US Open as the top seed lost to Belinda Bencic of Switzerland 7-5, 6-4 in the fourth round on Monday.The result also means that Osaka will lose the world No 1 ranking after the tournament to Roland Garros champion Ashleigh Barty of Australia."Obviously I always adapt to my opponent, and that's just how I play," Bencic said. "I don't have the biggest power, don't have the most winners or most aces. But I think I can really read the opponent's game well. I definitely try to do that against anyone, not only against her. Just taking the ball early and anticipating her. I think my game probably matches up well against hers."Osaka agreed, saying: "She played pretty clean. I think she had a specific plan she wanted to execute.""Right now I have this feeling of sadness, but I also feel like I have learned so much during this tournament," Osaka said. "Of course I wanted to defend this tournament. So I hope that I can keep growing. I know that if I keep working hard, then of course I'll have better results."A positive for Osaka was that she felt she improved her game over the summer. "I don't feel like I put so much weight on one single match," she explained. "As a whole I want to see that I played better matches through the summer. Because I feel like definitely the tournament that I played here has been the best one over the summer so far."Bencic got off to the faster start, dominating with the early strike, depth and easy redirection on her backhand and breaking in the opening game for a 2-0 lead in the first set.Osaka gathered herself, saving all four break points in the third game and overpowering Bencic with her forehand to break back for 2-2.Bencic then scored another break in the 11th game and took the first set at 7-5.Bencic continued her top form in the second set and took a decisive break in the fifth game before securing the victory in in one hour and 26 minutes.Bencic will in the quarterfinals play against Donna Vekic of Croatia who defeated Julia Goerges from Germany in another fourth round match.

                NEW YORK - Three-time champion Rafael Nadal defeated Argentine Diego Schwartzman 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 in the men's singles quarterfinals of the US Open on Wednesday and will take on Italy's Matteo Berrettini in the semifinals.The No 20 seed Schwartzman put up firm resistance against Nadal and twice fought back from double-break deficits in the first two sets, but the Spaniard found another gear at crucial moments to secure the victory after two hours and 47 minutes' battle."Straight sets but big challenges especially after the first two sets, having 4-0 and 5-1 and losing both breaks in a row, but I know how good he is when he's confident," Nadal said."I'm so happy how I accepted the situation and challenge and kept going, point after point. Here I am in the semifinals. I'm super happy, it means everything."In the semifinals, the Spaniard faces Berrettini, who beat Frenchman Gael Monfils 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 7-6(5) over three hours and 56 minutes in another quarterfinal.On the women's side, Swiss Belinda Bencic reached her maiden semifinals at the majors with a 7-6(5), 6-3 win against Donna Vekic of Croatia.
