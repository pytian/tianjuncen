                Agricultural research and extension investment key for Africa
            </p>
            <p>
                For agriculture to meaningfully contribute to attainment of the aspirations enshrined in Agenda 2063, there is a need for African countries to increase investments in research and development, as well as extension systems, experts say.Such investments would ensure transformed and modernized agriculture, consequently achieving inclusive growth and sustainable development on the continent.Brian Cheboi, farm manager at Integrated Crop Management Solutions, a Kenyan-based agricultural research and consultancy firm, agreed that investing in agricultural research and extension is key for Africa to unlock its agricultural potential.Cheboi said through research, quality seeds suitable for the continent’s climatic conditions will be produced, consequently increasing yields."Through research, farmers will get advice on how to control pests and disease challenges, as well as acquire more ideas and skills on new farming techniques and value addition," he saidCheboi said agricultural extension provides critical support services for rural farmers to overcome the new challenges confronting their production.According to the World Economic Forum, Africa holds about half of the world’s fertile and unused land, yet it spends $25 billion annually to import food.Sikhumbuzo Zondi, a research assistant at the Institute for Global Dialogue associated with the University of South Africa, said most African countries are underinvesting in agricultural research and development, and have limited human resource capacity."Investments in agricultural research need to be significantly increased, along with the effective utilization of such resources to ensure food sustainability and the growth of Africa’s agricultural research output,” he said.He said lesser attention to agricultural research and development in Africa has resulted in a huge domestic resource gap in generating agricultural investments, which in turn weakens the continent's target of reducing the number of under-nourished people by 2030.Additionally, low investment in agriculture has generated weak organization and management of African agricultural institutions and organizations, culminating in their weak capacity."A blend of marginal investment and limited capacity thus hinders their ability to generate the technological innovations needed for agricultural productivity growth," Zondi said.With the help of development partners, he said, continental leaders should reformulate, reconsider and effectively implement their agricultural development strategies.Strategies include: Putting greater emphasis on macroeconomic and sectoral incentives; strengthening institutional capabilities; raising and sustaining productivity and competitiveness; diversifying production and trade; and improving access to foreign markets.Zondi expressed the need for collective effort and synergies of a diverse, multi-agency system in which the private sector, farmer organizations, cooperatives, non-governmental organizations and para-professionals will each contribute according to its own strength and capabilities.This is in addition to small agribusinesses, self-help groups, input dealers and suppliers, electronic and print media and information technology.He called on African countries to strengthen collaborative agricultural research and extension development."The African Union should consider establishing a continental agricultural research and development facility which will lobby foreign investment on behalf of African farmers and producers, and also assist in exploiting and enhancing Africa’s sustainable agricultural potential," he said.He said Zimbabwe, Kenya, Cote d’Ivoire and Mali have increased agricultural productivity, specifically in maize production, horticulture, cocoa and rice, respectively.Similarly, South Africa has invested in innovative mechanisms for extension and research systems, such as accelerating partnerships between the public and the private sector, including a portion of civil society.John Kibet, food technologist at the University of Kabianga, said rapid agricultural growth occurs when the bulk of small-scale commercial farmers and large scale farmers apply a steady stream of science-based innovations."Profitable science-oriented innovations are largely generated in public agricultural research institutions and their public sector extension programs connect farmers with the research results, solving some of the major agricultural challenges," he said.Kibet said Africa is yet to unlock its agricultural potential due to a lack of new farming practices, technological advancement for production and investment in value addition.He said Ethiopia has done a commendable job by investing heavily in reforms to employ professionalism and adequate budget allocations to meet changing consumption patterns, technological progress and increased technical skills.

                Discovering more of China and world while traveling
            </a>
            <p>
                I noticed at the end of June how Beijing South Railway Station had suddenly become much busier than usual. That trend has continued right through the summer period for the school holidays are upon us and people are traveling in larger numbers than ever before. Indeed in recent years, the travel scene in China has changed considerably. Families increasingly taking weekend breaks while the days set around events such as Qingming Festival, Labor Day and more have resulted in a surge of demand at hotels and resorts that lie within reasonable travel time from main urban centers.Having traveled through much of China, usually by train, over the last 30 years I now try to plan my journeys outside those peak dates. With increased mobility and greater disposable income more distant areas of natural beauty and ethnic culture have witnessed steadily increasing popularity.The growth of social media with images postings online encourages others to head toward "must-see" locations followed by "been-there" selfies on popular sites such as WeChat and Weibo.Today I am seeing a growing desire among people across China to see so much of the world. That wish previously was partly satisfied by visiting places such as the "World Park" in Beijing or "Window of the World" in Shenzhen. Increasingly people now want the real thing, a trend being a major boost for local economies but also creating both environmental and logistical challenges. Many European destinations are small in size with infrastructure and facilities finding difficulties in coping with the sudden growing numbers. Indeed we can see this in China itself with the Great Wall at times crowded. This of course has led to alternative sections of The Wall opening to absorb some of the demand or cities limiting visitor numbers to prime sites. Although tourist numbers are valued for local economic growth, if visitor numbers become unsustainable then the attraction that initially encouraged visiting will diminish.However, with a bit of planning combined with some local knowledge it is still possible to beat the crowds. Take Beijing’s Forbidden City, always busy with many thousands of visitors passing south to north through its many courtyards. Yet, from outside the Tiananmen Gate by walking a short distance east along Chang’an Avenue there is the entrance to a park, The Working People’s Cultural Palace. Inside is the extensive Tai Miao or Imperial Ancestral Temple, dating from the Ming Dynasty and a place where the visitor can actually discover almost solitude and certainly peace right in the heart of the city.What are holidays for, when did they start to emerge? With China this has been a recent phenomenon. Indeed when I first started coming to China, holidays were limited mainly to the Spring Festival week with the often extremely challenging "long journey home" for millions of migrant workers. People worked six-day weeks but I remember Golden Weeks starting in October 1999 resulting in a sudden surge of visitors to Yunnan, where I was then. Factories and institutions had previously organized stays for workers and their families to company-owned facilities at coastal or upland locations.1993 I would see domestic tour groups, often distinguished by colored caps, visiting Guilin, for example. Interestingly foreign independent travelers would stay lengthy periods at nearby Yangshuo, which at that time saw few domestic visitors. By 1999 I was noticing individual Chinese tourists having beach holidays, for example at Guangxi’s Beihai. Today, of course, road trips, adventure vacations, sea cruises are on the rise.Back in Europe, where the idea of holidays really emerged in the mid-19th century it was the rich, indeed often the very rich who could afford such luxury of holidays. They would head to the Alpine lakes of Switzerland and Italy or the French Mediterranean Riviera, staying in the grand hotels or villas of that time, often for lengthy periods. The mass transportation systems of today did not exist, journeys were done by horse-drawn carriages and coaches. However the coming of the railways, particularly from the mid-19th century helped promote a growth in travel. However, for most working people there was no paid holiday time, it was mostly working long days with maybe a Sunday break.Within Europe, including Britain, there had long been a concept of the therapeutic effects of natural spring water enriched with minerals and particularly if warm. The city of Bath in the west of England had its waters renown even during the Roman Empire period. It was the building of railways, for example in the UK, that took initially mostly wealthy guests north to spa towns of Yorkshire such as Harrogate. The railways helped introduced another travel concept, luxury train journeys such as the Orient Express across Europe to Istanbul and a stunning gateway to Asia across the Bosphorous. Literally opulent hotels on wheels they became the inspiration for many books, songs and movies.While railways were opening up North America they also spurred tourism such as to Banff in the Canadian Rockies. Indeed in the US, the railroads became the ‘stuff of legends", featuring again in Hollywood movies or in song, "gonna take a sentimental journey..." People headed to the Pacific coast of California, at times in luxury trains. The 1930’s Santa Fe Railroad’s "Chief" became famous as a luxury "rolling boudoir" bringing movie stars and Hollywood executives from Chicago to the elegant Spanish-style Union Station of Los Angeles.Back in the UK it was partly an expanding railway network that led to the country’s rapid growth of tourism and consequently the emergence of coastal holiday resorts. In the earlier 19th century most British people had probably never travelled more than 30 kilometers beyond their home town. The railways made travel faster, cheaper and more comfortable than before. They made it possible for many less wealthy people to travel from the first time. Many people had tedious, often monotonous lives working in giant cotton mills and steel works of northern England’s Yorkshire and Lancashire. For maybe one or two weeks they had often unpaid holidays from the factories. Although salaries (called "wages") were low, people saved what they could. The railways built to serve the needs of factories and coal mines also connected to the coasts of England and parts of Scotland. Workers often on group travel, crowded onto the trains for summer breaks known as "Wakes" or "Fairs". They headed toward coastal Blackpool, Morecambe, Scarborough and many more for that much loved holiday. Indeed romance would blossom on such vacations, becoming a part of Britain’s social history along with songs featuring "Oh I do like to be beside the seaside, I do like to be beside the sea....." or in France the more evocative "La Mer" conjuring up images of the sea. Just like more affluent went to the spas to "take the waters" so the working population headed to the coasts to "take in the airs".Today in China railways have played their part in tourism development. Indeed I came first to China on a railway holiday following a passion for train travel. Having lengthy summer holidays from my teaching job I would head off on extensive railway journeys initially throughout Scotland and Europe before crisscrossing North America several times by train. Indeed in 1987, for me the "ultimate dream" of rail travel was to spend my summer holiday heading overland by train from Glasgow to Scotland to China, reaching Hong Kong before flying back to the UK. It was the railway that initially opened up China for me. While living in Guangzhou during the early 1990s I would board the steam-hauled San-Mao Railway to spend time in the beautiful Guangdong city of overlooking Guangdong’s West River. It was by rail I reached Yunnan, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Dongbei and so much more but not yet Tibet by rail. I flew there in 2000.Such was my passion for rail travel that in June 2018 I was filmed by a team for BBC Scotland on the high-speed train between Beijing and Tianjin. In China I have witnessed how important the country’s rail system has been for not only the massive Spring Festival movement of people but also the growing nationwide tourism boom. Indeed had China not invested so heavily in high-speed rail and modern stations the system could not have coped. The older trains were already often working at maximum capacity, airlines even with rapidly increasing numbers of aircraft could never have handled the numbers of people now travelling today in China. Such railways have brought major benefit to the tourism sector. Within a few hours between large cities and holiday spots, both coastal and inland, the trains can carry thousands of people effortlessly. Cities such as Qingdao and Yantai have both grown through tourism. Similarly Yunnan’s once remoter northwestern locations such as Dali and Lijiang are served by expressway, air and rail. Lijiang, where I reached in 1995 after a lengthy bus journey from Kunming, is today connected across China bringing in substantial numbers of visitors daily. Similarly Sanya in southern Hainan, during Spring Festival 1993 I was often the only person on Dadonghai’s long sandy beach. Now it is one of China’s premier resorts, changing dramatically the place I had found then so tranquil.The concept and perception of travel has changed so much with time. Me, a geographer and photographer, actually sought solitude. Back in Scotland I would head off on my own with my tent and camp by a lonely mountain river or sail to remote islands, simply to sit watching and listening to the natural beauty of the land around me. Often there were no other people, just me alone and far from any road. At that time there were no mobile phones or digital navigational technology, survival depended on skills carefully learned and acquired, indeed without understanding the exactness of using a manual compass or the subtleties of detailed topographic maps that were a life-saver it would have been sheer folly to have ventured from the public roads onto some of Scotland’s wildest mountains but those were some of my greatest summer moments, a sense of achievement accomplished during my pre-China days.In China I had my solitude moments, but always carefully assessed any risks, whether walking across silent, empty desert terrain in Gansu or following unmarked trails through dense sub-tropical forest on Hainan. Then I was really alone for the not exactly precise locations our smartphones give us did not exist, nor did detailed maps. Those were adventurous times which rank high among my China moments. Today popular areas have developed carefully managed tourist trails where navigational skills are not so required. Although often lacking the excitement and challenges of solo exploration they do provide a much safer environment for the many now visiting.What does travel give us? Hopefully a greater understanding of different societies and of each other. I had no concept of China before 1987 except that gained from local Chinese restaurants. Here I am now living and working in China, something I would not be doing had I not been an adventurous traveler!

                Maoming on verge of transforming and upgrading its economy
            </a>
            <p>
                Maoming in western Guangdong province is on the cusp of transforming and upgrading its economy by boosting its new energy industry, extending the industrial chain of its petrochemical sector and tapping the potential of its coastlines.Dubbed the "southern oil city," Maoming was built on oil shale discovered here in the 1950s, with oil refining and its petrochemical industries accounting for the lion's share of the local economy.Negotiations are now going ahead for a massive propane dehydrogenation project in the city to create a gas chemical cluster in the port-side of the Binhai New Area, Xu Zhihui, Party secretary of Maoming, said in an interview with China Daily."Compared with petrochemical and coal-chemical, it is cleaner and more efficient and signifies our industrial transformation," Xu said.Chemicals such as polypropylene and carbon can be used in 3D printing and carbon fiber production. The hydrogen can also be used to feed a hydrogen-fueled cell manufacturing project.A hydrogen fuel cell project with an intended investment of 1 billion yuan ($141 million) is expected to start operation on a trial basis in the High-Tech Industrial Development Zone next June, said Yang Xi, deputy director of the city's commerce bureau.The investment will mainly come from Shanghai-based energy service provider Sinomec Group. Other bodies involved are the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp's Academy of Aerospace Solid Propulsion Technology and Tsinghua University's Institute of Nuclear And New Energy Technology. The cells can be used in cars, drones and backup power units.The pillars of the city's economy will therefore include not only the petrochemical and primary raw material industries, but also high-end new materials and possibly the hydrogen energy-based industry which takes its inspiration from future industrial trends, Xu said.The operation of the Maoming branch of Sinopec, the country's top oil and gas company, represented about 56 percent of the city's industrial added value and some 13 percent of the city's GDP last year."When the key projects are implemented, we will sustain our competitive edge," Xu said.Petrochemical equipment manufacturing is also a key part of the city's industrial chain. Challenge Petrochemical Machinery Corp of Maoming, which was founded in 1958 and focuses on innovation in niche products, exports fire heaters and polyolefin reactors.The company has a major share in the domestic market for those products as well as for quenching heat exchangers, said Deputy General Manager Huang Siluo.The local authorities have set a goal of turning Maoming into a modern coastal city with powerful industrial strength, Xu said.Though blessed with 220 kilometers of coastline, Maoming has yet to fully tap the potential its coast has to offer. The city has embarked on major investment in its Bohe New Port to strengthen its shipping capacity, port logistics and seaside industries.Two general berths jointly developed by Maoming Port Group Co and Guangzhou Port Group went into operation in March. Two more berths are being constructed.An application has been submitted for a 300,000-metric-ton crude oil dock and the construction of a 100,000-ton refined oil dock is expected to begin next month. Maoming Port Group Co and Sinopec are joint investors in those projects.Three docks for chemical products and chemical warehousing facilities will also be built, said Liu Naiying, chairman of Maoming Port Group Co.The port has also been designated as a liquefied natural gas terminal for western Guangdong.Singaporean agribusiness giant Wilmar International is building a 1.35 billion yuan soybean, wheat, peanut and edible oil processing plant in the port. Daodaoquan Grain and Oil Co from Yueyang, Hunan province, will also set up a 1 billion yuan edible oil processing plant in the same port.Maoming is the largest grain, vegetable and meat producer in Guangdong, the top fruit and cash forest grower in the country, and the No 1 lychee and tilapia producer globally. Xu said more is being done to boost the agricultural sector.Capitalizing on the fine sand and extensive beaches of the area, the Shenzhen-based OTC Group and Singapore's Perennial Real Estate Holdings plan to develop large tourism and healthcare resorts in the region.The coastal economic belt development plan of Guangdong province should help bring the coastline and the port into full play, Xu said. The plan is aimed at promoting coordinated development among the regions in the province.Maoming is attempting to integrate into the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.This would include improvements in the transport network of highways, high-speed railways and a new airport being built for western Guangdong cities, Xu said.The Greater Bay Area includes nine cities in Guangdong province and the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions. The outline development plan was released in February.Maoming is also aligning its steps with the nearby free trade zone in Hainan province as well as the Beibu Gulf city cluster, Xu said.

                Hong Kong remains unique and continues to offer a future
            </a>
            <p>
                Recent unprecedented waves of protests in Hong Kong raise a key question: Why? Are these Hong Kong protests about a tabled extradition bill, people's rights, economics or foreign intervention?The proposed extradition bill has been suspended due to protest opposition. However, is this enough to spark riots and violence? Is intentional sabotage of Hong Kong's, and in turn China's, financial system at the source?Hong Kong Stock Exchange Chairman Li Xiaojia has observed and commented, "Voices against one nation belong to discordant noise and not the mainstream view." However he added, "You should allow Hong Kong to deal with these discordant noises in its own way."The outcome of earlier protests at the airport resulted in re-routing flights to Shenzhen. Is this good for the long-term prosperity of Hong Kong? Anxiety and anticipation can drive financial decisions. Money is shifting elsewhere out from Hong Kong. But can anywhere really replace Hong Kong?"Hong Kong people at the same time should be confident that Chinese mainland mainstream has never had the intention to ruin the two-systems, because to maintain the two systems is in the basic interest of China's development," Li also observed."Hong Kong's position is unique. There is no other city like it in China or Southeast Asia. Hong Kong is the third-busiest airport in the world. It is also one of the world's most efficient, handling over 75 million people each year and serving as a major transport hub for global shipping. The protestors have interrupted that. Will it serve their long-term interest as Hong Kongers or serve the interest of certain American political think tanks and politicians that are funding them? How much is Hong Kong's recent social turbulence been a purely Hong Kong issue, or an extension of the trade war pressures being overheated?Hong Kong has served as the financing center for China's massive Belt and Road program. This could all evaporate under continued protests shifting the financing function to other cities in the Chinese mainland and even other Asian countries as well. The Belt and Road is about infrastructure investment and shared economic development. The financing has and will continue be driven from Hong Kong. Key currency swap agreements between China and Belt and Road partner countries for the use of yuan currency in settlement and exchange are positioning the yuan to become a second reserve currency, at least for the region. Hong Kong's role as the key financing center for the Belt and Road remains critical.Hong Kong is positioned to lead as the financing center for enormous AI development in the region, as well offering enormous potential opportunity for youth. The entire vision of the Greater Bay region between Shenzhen and Hong Kong becoming an AI center will depend on Hong Kong for financing. The future opportunities for technology development, program design, AI and the financing that is so essential to all of it, lies in Hong Kong. With the Greater Bay area expanding the potential of China's technology, the prosperity of Hong Kong, Shenzhen and the coastal cities are integrated. The symbiosis of economics and opportunity should out-shadow the doubts that many have over Hong Kong's future.One of the reasons that Hong Kong has always stood out as the financing center of Asia and the third largest financing center in the world, is its incredible resilience and ability to bounce back from whatever global or regional turbulence over time. That is what makes Hong Kong unique and gives the world confidence in Hong Kong and its people.So the question is, who is benefitting from the protests, Hong Kong business, finance, technology, youth? Or the Washington D.C. political right-wing, anti-China establishment that does not want to see China's economic rise, which is integrated with Hong Kong and its own future? For them, Hong Kong and its youth are expendable.Laurence Brahm is the founding director of the Himalayan Consensus and a senior international fellow at the Center for China and Globalization.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                Overseas media applaud rural development, anti-terrorism efforts
            </a>
            <p>
                After visiting the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, media professionals from 16 countries have praised the rural development, anti-terrorism and deradicalization efforts made in the region.A seminar for media executives from countries along the Silk Road Economic Belt, hosted by the State Council Information Office, was held from Aug 17 to 23 in Xinjiang, which lies in Northwest China.It hosted 20 media representatives from 16 countries, including Afghanistan, India, Japan, Russia and Turkey. In addition to attending lectures and seminars, the guests conducted in-depth interviews in the Changji Hui autonomous prefecture, and Kashgar and Aksu prefectures.Progress More than three decades ago, Kekeya in Aksu prefecture, on the northwestern edge of the Taklimakan Desert, was a massive sand dune with only sparse vegetation.In 1986, the Aksu government launched an afforestation project in Kekeya to help restore the local ecosystem. More than 13 million trees were planted, resulting in the forest coverage rate rising to 6.8 percent. Moreover, local fruit production has greatly improved farmers' incomes.The media executives were deeply impressed by the rural development and effective environmental preservation in Xinjiang.Akram A. R. Abu Al Hannoud, director of the foreign affairs department of Al Bayan newspaper in the United Arab Emirates, described the project's success in turning the desert into an oasis as "very impressive"."I have seen the great efforts and the efforts of the local government to raise incomes. It's a very good example of how human development can be realized while the ecological environment is restored," Akram A. R. Abu Al Hannoud said.Kazhyken Saltanat, deputy editor-in-chief of Tenge Observer, a newspaper in Kazakhstan, said: "Thanks to the improved environment, farmers have increased their incomes. Aksu produces such good apples, and there is a good chance that the region's apples will be sold in winter markets in Kazakhstan."According to Yokoshima Daisuke, director of the China bureau of the Nippon Television Network from Japan, China has done a good job of building a more eco-friendly economy and protecting its environment.The group also visited the Old Town in Kashgar, a key tourist site with renovated houses and shops that have maintained their distinctive ethnic style thanks to extensive government investment.The supportive and protective measures taken by the central government are of great importance to improving the living conditions of the local people, according to Mansoor Faizy, editor-in-chief of the Afghan Times. The measures include the development of tourism and the renovation of rural residents' homes, along with the protection of ethnic culture.H. M. Mostofa Kamal, executive editor-in-chief of the Daily Kaler Kantho in Bangladesh, said, "It really is a good initiative because the rural people and poor people can develop their lifestyles and improve their lives."The visitors said that the Chinese government's successful experience in maintaining Xinjiang's stability should be applauded.Deradicalization efforts The seminar arranged for the journalists to visit the Exhibition on Cases of Major Terrorist Attacks and Violent Crimes in Xinjiang."The government and the public have worked together to reduce the occurrence of extremism and similar incidents, which has been very effective," said Naveed Aman Khan, a columnist from Pakistan.The media group visited two vocational education and training centers. At the vocational training center in Wensu county, which is equipped with a psychological consulting room, along with a movie theater, a painting room, a reading room and other places for recreational pursuits, the colorful extracurricular activities of the students attracted the visitors' attention."The students at the center can choose different curriculums on all kinds of vocational skills. Through these courses, I believe they will live better in the future," Khan said.Saeed Ahmad S. A. Al-Kuwari, news editor at the Qatar State News Agency, said it was a positive step for the Chinese government to set up this kind of school to eradicate extremist thoughts.Dmitry Kosyrev, a political commentator and China expert from Russia Today International News Agency, said that he decided to see the centers for himself after learning about the so-called concentration camps, as claimed by some Western media."I've come here and seen that this is just a school, a model for counter-terrorism," he said. "Today, Russia is also combating terrorism, and we have something to learn from China. We need to cooperate with each other and face up to it together and fight against terrorism through deradicalization. This education model in China could also be an example for other countries to learn from in the future," he added.Akram A. R. Abu Al Hannoud said, "After visiting Xinjiang, we have seen and discovered a lot of facts that we had not known before."Xinhua

                Nation now major engine for global economic growth Editor's note: In "Footprint", a series of stories recalling important examples of China interacting with the rest of the world, we follow the path the country has taken in the past seven decades. This story is the first in the series. When China joined the World Trade Organization in December 2001, then-premier Zhu Rongji said the 15 years of negotiations had caused "black hair to turn gray". China submitted its application to join on July 10, 1986, seeking to resume its "contracting party status" at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the WTO's predecessor. This move later turned to talk of joining the WTO after the new global trade body was formed in 1995 to replace GATT. On Nov 15, 1999, Zhu was instrumental in concluding the most-crucial Sino-US talks on China's WTO accession, when both sides made concessions on seven deadlocked issues that had prevented a deal, according to China's chief WTO negotiator at the time, Long Yongtu. Charlene Barshefsky, the US trade representative at the talks, was none too optimistic until Zhu intervened that morning to agree on three Chinese concessions. Exhausted but excited, Barshefsky and Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council, called then-US president Bill Clinton from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (now the Ministry of Commerce) in Beijing to tell him the good news. Barshefsky recalled that they made the call from a toilet because it was the only quiet place they could find at the time for such an important call. Clinton, who was on a trip to Ankara, the Turkish capital, was in the middle of a shower, but was told by his aide to take the phone call, as it was news of a breakthrough in the negotiations with China, which he considered a momentous issue. China became the WTO's 143rd member on Dec 11, 2001, an event that has brought great changes to the country and the world. Pascal Lamy, WTO director-general from 2005 to 2013, said that with its accession China became a major player in international trade. The country benefits from free trade with the rest of the world, and the rest of the world benefits from free trade with China, so it was a win-win situation, he said. In a recent interview with China Daily in Brussels, Lamy dismissed some opinions voiced in the US that it was a bad idea to let China join the WTO. "Of course it was a good idea - a good idea and it has worked extremely well," said Lamy, a French national who has also served as European commissioner for trade. Before China joined the WTO, the country's trade surplus was 8 to 10 percent of gross national product, but this has since fallen to almost zero, literally meaning that its imports have increased more than its exports. "So overall, it was a good day for the rest of the world," Lamy said. He said joining the WTO had provided China - which was developing an export-driven economy at the time - with insurance against protectionism. That was why Beijing accepted specific conditions that were more demanding than for comparable developing countries at the time, such as India and South Africa. Barshefsky agreed. In an interview with Chinese financial news outlet Yicai in March last year, she said she did not regret China joining the WTO. "There are some in the United States that do. I don't," she said. "I can't imagine how you look at one-fifth of the world and say, 'No thanks. Not interested.' It's not a rational position in my view." She described China's WTO accession as "historic for both the country and the world". "I think geopolitically, it signaled China's return to the global stage, and in a very important, positive and productive way." Barshefsky said she never doubted that China would take off "pretty rapidly" to become an Asian hub once it began to implement significant reform measures, but she was still surprised at the country's fast growth. Since joining the WTO, China's GDP has grown nearly 10-fold, from $1.34 trillion in 2001 to $13.28 trillion last year. The country has become the world's second-largest economy in nominal GDP, trailing only the US. The International Monetary Fund estimates that, based on purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy has exceeded that of the US since 2013. China also became the world's largest trading nation in 2013. Last year, its trade in goods reached $4.62 trillion, compared with $509.8 billion in 2001. In July, its foreign currency reserves stood at $3.1 trillion, up from $200 billion in 2001. International practice Tu Xinquan, president of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, described the country's WTO accession as a "very important step" since the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949. He told China Daily that the reform and opening-up policy, introduced before China joined the WTO, was "very much experimental". Citing late leader Deng Xiaoping, he compared it to "wading the river by groping for stones". "After joining the WTO, China conducted reform and opening-up by following an existing set of rules and conforming to international norms and orders," Tu said, adding that it was a critical move for the country to integrate itself into the international economic system. The white paper China and the World Trade Organization, released by the State Council Information Office on June 28 last year, said the country had continued efforts to improve its socialist market economy system, further align its policies with multilateral trade rules in all areas, honor its commitments on opening trade in goods and services, and strengthen intellectual property rights protection. "Remarkable improvements have been made in enhancing the stability, transparency and predictability of its opening-up policies. China has contributed significantly to the effective operation of the multilateral trading system," the white paper said. After joining the WTO, the country reviewed and revised 2,300 laws, regulations and departmental rules at central government level and 190,000 policies and regulations at sub-central government level, covering trade, investment and IPR protection. By 2010, China had fulfilled all its tariff reduction commitments, cutting the average level from 15.3 percent in 2001 to 9.8 percent. It lowered the average tariff level for manufactured goods from 14.8 to 8.9 percent, and the corresponding rate for agricultural produce from 23.2 to 15.2 percent - about a quarter of the global average and far lower than the 56 percent imposed by WTO developing members and the 39 percent by developed members. The country has taken major steps to lower nontariff barriers. These included eliminating import quotas, import licenses, specific import tendering requirements and other nontariff measures in 2005 for 424 items such as cars, machinery and electronic products, and natural rubber. The domestic services market has also been opened up, with the white paper stating, "By 2007, China had honored all of its commitments on trade in services." The country has also lowered the threshold for foreign investment in services. In 2010, foreign direct investment in China's services industry exceeded that in the manufacturing industry for the first time. In 2017, FDI in the services industry accounted for 73 percent of all such investment in China. The white paper listed major efforts made by the country to strengthen IPR protection through formulating laws and regulations and improving their enforcement. By May last year, 16 free trade agreements had been signed by China with 24 countries and regions. The country is also negotiating the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a free trade agreement between the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. Lamy, the former WTO director-general, said China has lived up to its commitments to the organization. He said that when the country had violated these commitments, it was taken to the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism, and when Beijing lost a case, it complied with the decision. The white paper said that by April last year, China had brought 17 disputes to the WTO, of which eight had been concluded. The country had also been the subject of complaints in 27 disputes, of which 23 had been concluded. "China actively defended the cases against it, respected the WTO rulings and made adjustments ... according to WTO rules. Up to now, none of the complainants has requested retaliation against China," the white paper said. David Dollar, a senior fellow at US think tank the Brookings Institution, said, "China has largely honored its WTO commitments", but added that it has fallen short in its pledges to open up banking, credit cards and government procurement. Global engine Dollar, a former World Bank chief in China and US Treasury Department emissary in Beijing, stressed that China's opening-up to foreign trade and investment since it joined the WTO had significantly increased growth and reduced poverty. Since 1978, the country has lifted more than 700 million people out of poverty, including many since its WTO accession. "Exports mostly come from the private sector, so opening to trade enabled the private sector to expand, creating tens of millions of jobs for people coming from the countryside to the cities. That was a key driver of poverty reduction," said Dollar, who traveled the country extensively during his time with the World Bank in China from 2004 to 2009. "China has become the largest trading nation, so it provides trading opportunities to rich and poor countries, leading to faster growth for them and for the world economy," he said. According to the white paper, China has become a major engine for global economic growth, and since 2002, its contribution to such expansion has been nearly 30 percent on average. Meanwhile, the country's FDI has grown from $46.88 billion in 2001 to $135 billion last year. According to the 2019 China Business Climate Survey Report by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, the nation continues to be a priority for all sectors in terms of their near-term global investment plans. Half of the companies surveyed are optimistic that markets will open further for foreign companies in China - the highest rate of confidence since 2016. Many observers have also voiced optimism for business opportunities arising from domestic consumption. In January, New York research company eMarketer forecast that China's retail sales would exceed $5.63 trillion this year, topping those of the US by more than $100 billion. In recent years, China has also become the world's largest source of outbound tourists. Han Lu, a young Shanghai woman who traveled with her mother and 6-year-old son to Switzerland and several other European countries last month, said she goes abroad with her son for leisure every year. "It's relaxing and eye-opening," said Han, who runs a small refrigeration sales and service business. China has also become the largest source of international students. The Ministry of Education said some 608,000 Chinese students were studying abroad in 2017, and according to the Institute of International Education in New York, 360,000 of them attended US universities and colleges during the 2017-18 academic year. Long, China's former chief WTO negotiator, believes that the country's accession to the organization has produced "more than a boom" in foreign trade and economic development. In a conversation with Caijing magazine editor Wang Boming last year, Long said it had changed mindsets in seeking win-win cooperation, rather than a zero-sum game. The road ahead While China's rapid advances have drawn global attention, the country has also been delivering "public goods" for the world, especially developing nations. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Belt and Road Initiative, both initiated by China, have expanded rapidly in funding and building connectivity from Asia to Europe and Africa. In an article on Aug 10, Xinhua News Agency quoted WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo as saying, "China is playing a more positive role in the multilateral trading system, taking globalization toward the direction of more inclusiveness and benefit for all." Tu, the China Institute for WTO Studies president, said China has been generally good in honoring its WTO commitments, and he would give the country 80 marks out of 100 in this regard. He believes China has done a great job in reducing tariffs and nontariff barriers, but has room to improve in further increasing the degree of marketization and reducing subsidies in the economy. He said China is now open to such discussions in its proposal for WTO reform. Late last year, the country published a position paper on WTO reform. In its proposal submitted to the organization in May, China said it has been an active participant, staunch supporter and major contributor to the multilateral trading system. It supports necessary reform of the WTO to enable the organization to "overcome its existential crisis". Lamy said part of the problem is that WTO rules are relatively weak in some areas and must be strengthened. He also believes the WTO reform agenda must first focus on subsidies and resolving the issue of the appellate body. He was not only referring to subsidies to State-owned enterprises, but also US agricultural subsidies. The US has been blocking the appointment and reappointment of judges to the WTO appellate body, threatening the function of the dispute settlement mechanism. To tackle this, last month the European Union and Canada proposed an interim appeal arbitration arrangement based on existing WTO rules. Lamy said he is concerned that US President Donald Trump has damaged the multilateral system and the global economy. But he said the European Union's strategy is to "keep the US in the tent and bring China more into the tent". chenweihua@chinadaily.com.cn  Top: Workers greet the arrival in Tianjin on Aug 7, 1993, of 1,985 cars produced in the United States by Chevrolet.

                BRI makes investment ties stronger than ever
            </a>
            <p>
                Entrepreneur calls China the gateway of international trade for KazahkstanAs China and Kazakhstan are closely linked with the Belt and Road Initiative, businesses from both sides have deepened their two-way trade and investment activities in recent years.According to Chinese Customs, trade between China and the Central Asian country reached $11.42 billion during the first seven months of this year, growing 8.7 percent year-on-year.Kazakhstan's exports to China increased 17.4 percent to reach $5.19 billion in the same period. The substantial growth resulted in a more balanced trade, as China's surplus decreased 48.8 percent to $630 million.China's investment in Kazakhstan also saw a steady growth last year. According to the Foreign Ministry of Kazakhstan, Chinese investment amounted to $1.5 billion in 2018, representing an increase of 6.1 percent year-on-year.As the country highlights foreign investment in its economic growth, many entities in Kazakhstan are in close contact with Chinese investors.According to a Xinhua New Agency report, the Astana International Financial Centre - Kazakhstan's regional financial services hub - said it is keen to attract Chinese investment in BRI projects and medium-sized enterprises in central Eurasia countries.During a June 18 presentation in Shanghai for Chinese investment companies, AIFC Governor Kairat Kelimbetov said the AIFC and its stock exchange, the Astana International Exchange, aim to "connect investors with promising projects that require financing to realize their full potential".Kelimbetov said BRI projects in the region are "a clear and important priority"."Another equally promising opportunity lies with mid-cap companies in Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Georgia and other countries in the region that are eager to engage with Chinese investors," he said. "We are helping to bring them together."Earlier that month, China's Silk Road Fund signed a memorandum of understanding on a strategic partnership with the AIFC and a framework agreement with Astana International Exchange to subscribe for a portion of common shares through the China-Kazakhstan Production Capacity Cooperation Fund, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Silk Road Fund, according to earlier reports in China Daily.The cooperation is expected to help better align the BRI with Kazakhstan's new economic policy Nurly Zhol ("bright path" in English), strengthen China-Kazakhstan bilateral ties in key areas, advance Kazakhstan's financial reforms and the development of its capital market, and provide an incentive for Kazakhstan's social and economic progress, according to a fund spokesman.It will also allow Silk Road Fund to leverage its financial expertise to boost the two countries' cooperation in production capacity through financial partnerships, the spokesman said.The deepening partnership under the BRI framework has resulted in enhanced presence of Chinese companies in Kazakhstan.According to a Xinhua report, the first phase of the Shelek 60-megawatt wind power project in Kazakhstan began construction on June 27, 2018.It was built by China's power development company PowerChina and is invested in by PowerChina and Samruk-Energy Company, Kazakhstan's largest State-owned energy development company.The project is located in the Ili River Valley, in the west extension of the Tianshan Mountains in Kazakhstan. It is about 150 kilometers from Almaty and 210 km from the Khorgos Land Port in China.After its completion, the project is expected to greatly alleviate the power shortage in southern Kazakhstan, a PowerChina representative said.While more Chinese investments are flowing to Kazakhstan, businesses from the Central Asian country have strengthened their presence in China.Kazakhstan's Continental Bridge Supply Chain signed an agreement with the Jiaozhou city government in February to build a farming products processing and commodities trade center in Jiaozhou, according to reports on the official website of the Qingdao city government.Jiaozhou is a part of the coastal metropolis of Qingdao in Shandong province.The project will demand a total investment of $100 million and will cover a land area of 50,000 square meters.It is designed to process high-quality wheat from Central Asia and Russia, producing flour targeting the Chinese and overseas markets.The project will also include a cross-border trading center for bulk cargo made in China, such as textiles and household appliances.As the inland country of Kazakhstan stands at the center of the Eurasia Continental Bridge that connects the eastern coasts of China and western coasts of Europe, many businesses in this country view China as the gateway for their international trade.Alexander Machkevitch, chairman of Eurasian Resources Group, said: "When Kazakhstan became independent, many people predicted it would find trouble because it was a landlocked country. People always recognize a coastal country has better conditions to develop its economy."However, the fact is that we don't need sea, because China is the seaward gateway for Kazakhstan."ERG now runs a cooperative project, Kazakhstan Aluminum Smelter, with China Nonferrous Metal Industry's Foreign Engineering and Construction.China accounts for 20-30 percent of ERG's total sales. It is a key sales destination for its high-carbon ferrochrome, cobalt and copper, according to the company.
