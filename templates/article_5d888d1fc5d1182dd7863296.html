                Tunisia extends state of emergency for another month
            </a>
            <p>
                TUNIS - Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi decided to extend the state of emergency for another month starting Friday.According to a statement issued by the Tunisian presidency earlier in the day, the decision was made after consultations with Tunisian Prime Minister Youssef Chahed and President of People's Representatives Assembly Mohamed Ennaceur.The state of emergency in Tunisia was first declared on Nov 24, 2015, following a bloody bomb attack on a bus of the presidential guard, killing 12 agents.Tunisian emergency law allows the authorities exceptional powers, including carrying out home arrests, banning official meetings, imposing curfews, monitoring media and press, prohibiting assemblies and media censorship without prior permission from the judiciary.

                Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi dies at 92
            </a>
            <p>
                Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi died on Thursday aged 92, according to a statement from the presidency.Essebsi, the North African country's first democratically elected leader, died at the military hospital in the country's capital, Tunis.He was first been admitted to hospital on June 27 with what authorities said was a severe medical crisis.He was readmitted to the intensive care unit on Thursday before passing away in the early hours.Essebsi was elected president in 2014 in the country's first free presidential election, following a revolution that ousted autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben A in 2011.According to Tunisia's constitution adopted in 2014, the country's prime minister can take over presidential responsibilities for a maximum of 60 days.Alternatively the parliament speaker can take the role for up to 90 days, if a longer term is required. However the overall decision lies with the constitutional court.The country's presidential elections are scheduled for November 17, 2019, with a second round on November 24 if no candidate is elected in the first round.

                A group of undergraduates from Duke Kunshan design campaigns to promote mental well-being at the Student Leader Global Summit in South AfricaSeven students from Duke Kunshan University, including four from China, joined peers from around the globe at a major conference in South Africa this summer to exchange ideas on wellness and mental health on campus.The group was among 55 participants from 16 countries invited to attend the 2019 Student Leader Global Summit hosted by Stellenbosch University, near Cape Town.Organized by the nonprofit International Association of Student Affairs and Services, the annual summit aims to prepare future world leaders, with the focus this year on encouraging "campus change-makers" to consider the behaviors, skills and campaigns that can improve and support mental well-being among classmates."It was both wonderful and memorable. We interacted with one another, shared experiences and ideas, and helped create micro campaigns to promote mental health on campus," says Milica Jordanov, an undergraduate student from Serbia.Jordanov made the journey from Duke Kunshan in East China's Jiangsu province to South Africa with classmates Wei Yi, Tang Lan, Hu Yutong and Guan Shuyi from China, Paula Gonzalez of Peru, and Moroccan-Tunisian student Nour Cherradi El Fadili.With students often experiencing high pressure, universities around the world are paying closer attention to mental health on campus.

                FIBA World Cup: Six teams reach last 16, hosts China suffer overtime loss
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING -- Serbia, Italy, Argentina, Poland, Spain and Russia have reached the last 16 after snatching their respective second straight wins on Monday at the 2019 FIBA World Cup in China.Serbia, one of the title favorites, trounced the Philippines 126-67 to advance with one game remaining, along with Italy in Group D. Nemanja Bjelica led seven Serbian players who scored in double figures, while the Philippine star Andray Blatche did not have his night, finishing just 5 points before fouling out.Suffering a slow start, the Serbs were tied at 7-all with six minutes left in the opening quarter before Nikola Jokic's substitution helped his team reclaim the lead.The runner-up of the 2014 FIBA World Championship never look back as Bogdan Bogdanovic, playing for the Sacramento Kings, continued Serbia's firepower."Players delivered and did their job well. All players are in good physical shape, and it's a good sign for us," Serbian head coach Sasha Djordjevic said.Another Group D team Italy also secured a last 16 berth after claiming a convincing 92-61 win over Angola. Marco Belinelli posted the game-high 17 points. Yanick Moreira of Angola battled with 15 points but could not avoid his team's second straight defeat."Everybody was aggressive in offense and defense. We played two good quarters, but in the third and fourth quarters we could do much better. But what's important for us is to win the game and be ready for the next one," Belinelli said.The Italians rode on a 12-2 spurt midway through the first period to pull into a double-digit lead. Going 59-28 up with 5:13 remaining in the third period, Italy were well beyond the striking distance for their African opponents.China suffered from early foul trouble and made key-time errors, losing to Poland 79-76 after overtime and sending the rival side to top Group A.Yi Jianlian had the team-high 24 points for China. Wang Zhelin and Zhou Qi added 10 points each. Poland's Mateusz Ponitka scored the game-high 25 points.The host looked poised to win the tight game, up by one point with the ball and 4.2 seconds left. But Zhou Qi's inbounds pass turned out to be a turnover and gave the Polish side chance to go to overtime with free throws.With 9.8 seconds left in the overtime thriller, China's Zhao Jiwei was unable to inbounds the ball for a five-second violation and Ponitka split two more free throws to decide the game."It's a tough game and our players did their best," said Li Nan, head coach of China.Venezuela bounced back and took its first victory, winning 87-71 over Cote d'Ivoire in Group A. The Venezuela sharpshooter Heissler Guillent was 6 of 9 from 3-point range, pouring in the game-high 31 points.Spain emerged as the sole secured side from Group C after a 12-0 spurt in the third quarter gifted the European powerhouse a 73-63 win over Puerto Rico.In the group's other game on Monday, Tunisia toppled Iran 79-67 to keep their hope alive. Salah Mejri scored the game-high 22 points and grabbed 15 rebounds, while Michael Roll added 18 points for Tunisia.Hamed Haddadi and Behnam Yakhchalidehkordi inspired Iran to cut deficit in the second half but their hope dimmed as the Tunisian side kept scoring.In Group B's play, Argentina cruise past Nigeria 94-81 and Russia beat South Korea 87-73. Both sides claimed two wins from as many games and locked the top two spots of the group with one game in hand.
