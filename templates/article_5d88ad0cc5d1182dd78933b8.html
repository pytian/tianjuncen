                China invites others for its moon missions

            <p class="style-content">
                In 1969, when US astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon, the astronomical body was just something at which Chinese people gazed and mused. Fifty years later, China became the first country ever to land a robotic spacecraft on the far side of the moon.As the world celebrates the historic moon landing on July 20 half a century ago, Chinese lunar explorers said China's moon exploration program, which includes a goal of a robotic lunar research station prototype by 2030 to prepare for manned missions, is open to international cooperation.With more lunar scientific exploration and verifying technology, the lunar research station will become a base for astronauts to visit briefly, and ultimately for long-term stays, Li Chunlai, director of the Ground Research and Application System of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Project, and three of his colleagues wrote on Friday."International cooperation is an important element in China's strategy of lunar and deep space exploration," they said in an article published in the special issue of the US journal Science to mark the July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 moon landing.China unveiled a robotic lunar exploration program in 2004, consisting of three phases — orbiting, landing and returning — and named the program the "Chang'e Project" after the Chinese goddess of the moon.Four missions already have been conducted between 2007 and 2019, with the Chang'e-4 deploying a lander and Yutu-2 rover on the surface of the far side of the moon in early January. The fifth mission, scheduled for early next year, is designed to return rocks to Earth from a lunar area as yet unsampled, according to the authors.After 2030, China's lunar exploration program will continue to develop capabilities in both robotic and human exploration, with robot exploration the primary development direction of subsequent lunar exploration missions, they said.Interestingly, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) named its new moon program Artemis, after the twin sister of Greek mythology's Apollo.The US space agency hoped to put Americans on the moon again by 2024. Congress had provided it $21.5 billion in fiscal year 2019, which, adjusting for inflation, is NASA's best budget in a decade, according to Casey Dreier, chief advocate and senior space policy adviser at the Planetary Society in California.In the Science article, titled "China's present and future lunar exploration program", Li and his colleagues said China's exploration plan is "flexible and iterative", with an emphasis on international cooperation.It said China is open to cooperation with NASA on lunar exploration."Both sides can start cooperating on aspects such as exchange of scientific data and space situational awareness information," the article said. "China also looks forward to exploring more opportunities to cooperate with NASA to preserve the space environment for generations to come."Already, China's latest lunar mission Chang'e-4 has carried experiments from Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands.In April, the China National Space Administration announced cooperation opportunities for China's sixth lunar mission and its asteroid exploration mission. It also signed lunar exploration cooperation agreements with the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), Turkey, Ethiopia and Pakistan.James W. Head, a professor of geological science and planetology at Brown University who had participated in all the Apollo missions in the 1960s and '70s, said the 50th anniversary of the moon landing "makes us realize that when the astronauts looked back from the moon, they saw no national boundaries, but simply what Carl Sagan called a 'pale blue dot' that was their Home Planet"."The ability of many countries to undertake robotic, and soon human exploration is a wonderful, peaceful way to demonstrate their technical capability and develop space technology that can be used to better conditions in their own countries as well as the Earth as a planet," he told China Daily in an email. "International cooperation is already well underway on all of these missions."In an earlier interview with China Daily, Head said that the moon is a big place with "lots of exciting questions" to pursue, and there is lots of room for individual countries to have specific national lunar exploration programs."But it would be in no one's interest if we all duplicated each other's work. Coordination, collaboration and cooperation are among the many ways that we can work to optimize the scientific and fiscal outcomes," he said.In 1963, President John F. Kennedy asked, "Why should the United States and the Soviet Union, in preparing for such expeditions, become involved in immense duplications of research, construction and expenditure?"Asked to comment on the former president's remarks, David A. Mindell, professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Kennedy "certainly had some desire" for more collaboration there, and at the same time, projects that compete with each other tend to be very innovative."If you look at the United States and Russia right now, the closest links between the governments are in the space program, and that's a good thing, given whatever else happens around there," he told China Daily in an interview in Washington.Asked about the feasibility of space cooperation between China and the US, Mindell said, "I would hope there would be. Actually, I think the politics have made it hard, as much on the US side — probably more on the US side than on China's part."

                    50 years on, Apollo dream still inspiring

                CANBERRA-The Honeysuckle Creek is normally a quiet place nestling in the mountains in the south of Australian capital Canberra, but the name of a road leading to the site betrayed its importance in history: Apollo.Fifty years ago, when Apollo 11 first landed humans on the moon, Honeysuckle Creek was one of three main tracking stations that made live broadcast of the event possible, receiving and transmitting the image and sound of Neil Armstrong as he stepped onto the surface of the moon.Fifty years later, the Australians took pride in their role for the event, which was deemed one of the most important in the 20th century."If not for Australia, 600 million people would not have seen the iconic image. And if not for Australia, nor would they have heard Neil Armstrong's iconic words," says Arthur B. Culvahouse, the US ambassador to Australia, recently.July 20 marks the 50th anniversary of moon landing by humans, one day after China's first space lab Tiangong-II ended its mission and re-entered the Earth's atmosphere under control.Excitement and inspirationThe Honeysuckle dish was moved to another site, but a sculpture was unveiled on July 20 by Culvahouse and Mick Gentleman, minister for the Environment and Heritage of the Australian Capital Territory government. It bore the words "one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind".Many former employees of the station also returned to share their memories.Trevor Gray, 77, helped with TV signal for the broadcast 50 years ago. "I remember using various equipment. Something didn't fit and I … made it fit. I didn't realize that later televisions around the world were going through that," he recalls.When the astronauts landed on moon, he was at Honeysuckle, watching television. "It was very exciting," he says repeatedly.Andy Thomas, the first Australia-born professional astronaut to enter space, was an 18-year-old student at the University of Adelaide in his first year of mechanical engineering at that time. He was inspired by Apollo 11."It was just amazing to see those images come from the moon, through the tracking station here, onto our television sets. It was a defining event of the 20th century," he told Xinhua in an interview.The event was inspirational to him. He later joined the aerospace industry in the United States. "I dreamed of being an astronaut when I saw what the space program was doing, but I didn't consider it a very realistic prospect," he recalls. "It wasn't until later in life after I had been working in the US aerospace industry for some time that I realized I could put together an application to become an astronaut."The astronaut has spent 177 days in the space.Looking into the future, he says that he wishes to see humans returning to the moon and landing on Mars. "That will be a defining event for the 21st century."He also talked about the progress China has made in space industry. "I have to say China's to be congratulated for landing the rover on the dark side or the far side of the moon," he says. "That was a very impressive technical undertaking, very impressive indeed."From legend to realityAlthough a legend in China about palace and fairy on the moon could be dated back to hundreds, or perhaps thousands of years. In 1969 there were not many Chinese families that had televisions.After the reform and opening-up in 1979, China has been developing rapidly.In 1992, China started the manned space program with a three-step strategy. The first step, to send an astronaut into space and return safely, was fulfilled by Yang Liwei in the Shenzhou-V mission in 2003. So far, the country has launched 11 manned spaceships, sending 11 astronauts into space.It launched the first moon rover in December 2013 and plans to launch the Mars probe in 2020. The success of the Tiangong-II mission has ushered in the era of building China's space station, which is expected to be completed around 2022.Thomas says he hopes that in years to come there will be more collaboration between China and other space agencies throughout the world, "so that when we do go to Mars, it will be truly for all humankind, not just for one country."He remembered that when he had training in a space station in Moscow in 1997, there were two Chinese."They were the first ones sent to Russia in preparation for the Chinese human space flight and they were nice guys," he recalled.Talking about China's space dream, Trevor Gray also hailed the country's big progress."I didn't think of flying around the world (in my childhood), which I have done," he says. "A lot of things happened. I have seen many changes. We now have a lot of made-in-China, which I do appreciate. Anything could happen."
