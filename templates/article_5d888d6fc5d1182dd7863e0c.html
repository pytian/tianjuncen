                Rioters should be held accountable to restore order in Hong Kong
            </p>

                International conventions such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights explain what a "democratic society" is or should be. In general, a democratic society should be pluralistic and inclusive, and have space for different points of view, which should be expressed in a peaceful manner.Since Hong Kong's return to China in 1997, the "one country, two systems" principle has helped yield universally acknowledged positive results. "One country, two systems" allows Hong Kong people to govern the special administrative region and enjoy a high degree of autonomy. Which makes the SAR a democratic and rule-based society.However, the demonstrations that started in opposition to a bill to amend the SAR's extradition law soon became violent, taking a heavy toll on the city. It transformed into a seesaw battle between the police and the violent demonstrators, who resorted to gasoline petrol bombs and attacking police officers, undermining the rule of law in the city.The demonstrators even tried to break into the SAR Legislative Council building, wantonly damaging LegCo facilities. Worse, they defiled the national emblem and national flag..The insurrectionists even blocked Hong Kong International Airport, the city's subway and main traffic hubs, and vandalized public property, paralyzing normal activities. In other words, they held the city to ransom to fulfill their narrow political goals.Yet their criminal acts, which tantamount to terrorism, have been ignored by some Western media outlets and governments. Some in the West have even called the insurrectionists "pro-democracy fighters" when the truth is that the demonstrators have tarnished Hong Kong's image as "Asia's world city" and an international finance and logistics hub.It is ironical that the "pro-democracy" demonstrators claim to be protecting universal values despite doing exactly the opposite: violating the law, and trampling democracy, human rights and freedom.Claiming to be fighting for freedom of speech and human rights, the rioters have tried to stifle sane voices because they do not care for other people's human rights, especially if those people do not support their "cause of rioting".Some Western politicians and media outlets have been making irresponsible remarks glorifying the insurrectionists and supporting the violence in an attempt to whitewash the crimes of the violent demonstrators — and to further incite youths and heighten tensions. The real intention of these Western hypocrites is to cause chaos in the city and exploit the situation to check China's rise.Some Western politicians and media outlets have pointed an accusing the finger at the Hong Kong police, claiming they have abused their power. But their evil designs will never succeed, because there is a consensus among sensible people across the world that the Hong Kong police have exercised considerable restraint, which have even made them vulnerable to attacks.The situation in Hong Kong is serious, as some radical demonstrators have crossed the bottom line of the "one country, two systems" principle, which will have dire consequences.Rational, law-abiding Hong Kong residents have organized many rallies to oppose the violence. And it is such law-abiding residents that represent the public opinion in the SAR. The Hong Kong police and judiciary should not only be supported but also encouraged to take resolute measures and hold the rioters accountable so as to restore public order in the city.There are many lessons to be learned from the chaos in Hong Kong. But first, the SAR authorities have to put an end to the violence, which is necessary to build a platform for dialogue and implement institutional reforms to help the city recover and return to track of development.The author is a professor with the Institute for Human Rights at China University of Political Science and Law.

                137 people arrested as 'Yellow Vest' renews in Paris
            </a>
            <p>
                PARIS - French police had arrested 137 individuals in Paris by 16:00 local time (1400 GMT), as "Yellow Vest" protests against President Emmanuel Macron's fiscal policy hit streets again on Saturday.Citing the Paris police department, BFMTV news channel said 48 of the 137 individuals detained remained under police custody.They were suspected of committing violent acts in the fringe of the fresh rally. Police found in their bags materials that could be used as projectiles, including stones, slings and hammers, the report added.French authorities have banned rallies in the landmarked Champs Elysees Avenue and the Arc de Triomphe monument, which often became flashpoint of clashes between the police and protestors in recent protests.Some 30 metro stations were closed and many of shops were barricaded.In Paris, 7,500 police officers have been poured in and armored vehicles were deployed to handle more threats of rioting that, according to the government, risks to taint the social movement's 45th weekend of action, which coincided with a march for the climate and union-led demonstration against the pension reform.After a relatively calm debut, a brief standoff erupted early Saturday morning when anti-riot police fired tear gas to prevent some demonstrators from cruising to adjacent streets.Violence flared up after 1,000 anarchists, known as Black Blocs, infiltrated a march for climate.TV footages showed hooded men wearing in black are smashing a bank's window in the capital's fifth district. A motorcycle and bins were torched, forcing firefighters to intervene.More standoffs were reported as police officers, pelted with projectiles, fired tear gas to disperse the protestors."Yellow Vest" movement, which got its name from the high-visibility vests drivers required to have in their cars, was created on social media November last year to protest against a rise in carbon tax, which Macron said was necessary to combat climate change.It has since turned into a bigger uprising denouncing the president's fiscal and economic policy which protestors say favors the rich. Some of them asked Macron to step down.As the social action has posed a serious challenge to his leadership, the head of state had offered a series of concessions that began with a drop of a planned high fuel tax, which inspired the nationwide uprising. Among other sweeteners, he proposed "an economic and social emergency plan," worth 10 billion euros (11.02 billion U.S. dollars) to boost purchasing power.
