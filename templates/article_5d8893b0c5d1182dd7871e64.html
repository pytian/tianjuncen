                BRI paves the way for China and Germany to cooperate through goods, infrastructure and 5G technologyGermany and China - two strong supporters of economic globalization and multilateralism - will continue to diversify economic cooperation and build stronger trade ties in 2019. Their products are complementary and they have reached many consensuses on the development of the Belt and Road Initiative, said officials and business leaders.For many Chinese consumers, "made in Germany" means products such as automobiles, machinery and beer. Now there is an appetite in China for German goods including sensors, semiconductors, new materials and healthcare products sold in direct-mail shops.China has remained Germany's top trading partner since it took the title from the United States and France in 2016.Bilateral trade volume between China and Germany amounted to $106.93 billion in the first seven months of this year. This is up 2.4 percent on a year-on-year basis, data from the General Administration of Customs show."The future of Chinese-German business ties will be based on the trade of high-end products and consumption goods; investment in the fields of infrastructure and service projects; manufacturing; pharmaceutical business and multimodal logistics," said Zhang Yunling. He is the director of international studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences based in Beijing.Even though both the Chinese and German economies have been affected by weak global demand, as well as the challenges of unilateralism and trade protectionism, the degree of interdependence between the two countries remains stable in bilateral cross-industry trade, he said."China will continue to export consumer goods in exchange for Germany's high-tech products, such as electronic and chemical products; construction machinery; vehicles and parts; medical equipment; and pharmaceutical products," said Yu Jianlong, secretary-general of the China Chamber of International Commerce. "Most of their imports are complementary. Therefore, it isn't direct competition," he added.China exports mostly raw materials; computers; transport equipment; plastic and rubber products; textiles; garments; and household appliances to Germany.Many Chinese companies are casting off their dependence on service trade with the US. They are conducting more international collaboration in research and development with countries including Germany, France, Russia and South Korea. Yu said it would be beneficial for China and Germany to deepen cooperation in the service trade, high-tech areas and infrastructure development in their domestic and global markets.Feng Yaoxiang is director of the investment promotion division at the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. He said the tangible development of the BRI also comes with opportunities for German companies.Chances exist in various infrastructure projects for suppliers in the machinery and mechanical engineering industry, in technical fields, engineering and quality management services, he said.Siemens Mobility, the transport unit of German industrial conglomerate Siemens, plans to build a 5G network innovation center for studies in road traffic in China. It aims to provide digital transportation solutions using 5G technology."The future technologies of mobility, such as autonomous driving and traffic management, require 5G. China has taken a leading position in the development of 5G globally," said Juergen Model, CEO of Siemens Mobility for China.The company said it believes the future of transport will be seen in China and its deployment of 5G will be realized soon.Siemens Mobility said it is critical to establish an R&D center in the country. It hopes to play a leading role in R&D in this area.Li Jin, chief researcher at the China Enterprise Research Institute in Beijing, said China has significant market growth potential for its 5G network.He predicted that in 2019, 5G will cover 50 cities in China. About 300 cities will get 5G connections in 2020. In the year after that, the connection is likely to be available nationwide."Besides, China has the largest high-speed train network globally and the largest number of customers. The country will be able to provide a good market, technology support and testing sites to set up a potential innovation center on the future of transportation," he said.Though the location of the innovation center is still under discussion, the company has established its first mass-transit signaling innovation R&D center in Fuzhou, Fujian province. It is the first masstransit R&D center in Asia.zhongnan@chinadaily.com.cnThe direct cargo train between Yantai in Shandong province and Duisburg in Germany is launched on July 26.Tang Ke/for China Daily(China Daily 09/07/2019 page9)

                DJI, the world's leading consumer drone maker, has established a reputation for its technology and products among individual and industry users in the West and is now gaining popularity in Russia.Several major infrastructure operators in Russia have become users of DJI drones over the past two years and have benefitted extensively from the deployment of the Chinese flying gadgets, according to Luo Zhenhua, president of DJI."Russia has the largest population in Europe and is one of the major industrial and energy powers in the world, so there are many businesses in this country that can make use of unmanned aircraft," Luo said last week in Russia as he attended the International Aviation and Space Salon 2019 in Zhukovsky, near Moscow.The Chinese drone maker brought a number of its drones to the Russian air show that concluded on Sunday, saying they are capable of servicing a wide range of industries such as electric power, infrastructure operation, construction, oil prospecting and agriculture.Moscow United Electric Grid, Russia's biggest electric power transmission and distribution company, has been adopting DJI drones carrying thermal imagers and cameras in key areas such as Moscow and Yekaterinburg to conduct intensive patrols and inspections of grid facilities, according to DJI.DJI quoted Moscow United Electric Grid as saying in a news release that the Chinese drones enable engineers at the Russian company to detect unnoticeable hazards in a timely and accurate manner. In addition, small drones from DJI like Mavic 2 are pocket-size, so patrol workers are able to carry and use them whenever they want to, the company said.Russian Railways, a state-owned giant that operates the world's third-largest rail network, has also begun using more than 50 aerial photography drones to perform rail line examination and accident mapping for 29 key hubs, which had been carried out by workers driving cars. Now inspectors at those hubs can check railway conditions and locate safety hazards in real time thanks to DJI's airborne solution that boasts a high efficiency three times faster than before.In addition, Transneft, the state-owned transport monopoly and the world's largest oil pipeline company, has introduced several models of DJI drones to monitor and track damages or emergencies on its pipelines.Meanwhile, Russian Highways, commonly known as Avtodor, has been using DJI drones to execute road surveys and mapping, especially in rough terrain or bad weather, according to DJI.Founded in 2006, DJI is the world's largest commercial drone manufacturer by market share, with global operations spanning the Americas, Europe and Asia.
