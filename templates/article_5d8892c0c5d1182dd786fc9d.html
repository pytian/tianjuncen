                Global air delivery titan FedEx sees the Asia Pacific as the global center of e-commerce trade. Regional president Karen Reddington tells Edith Lu the group aims to give enterprises a competitive edge with shorter transit time for their goods.Sitting in a region spearheading a solid recovery in the air-cargo market, driven by a healthcare services boom and robust international e-commerce, express delivery giant FedEx Express is staying the course as it continues to lift capacity to keep up with growing demand.The United States-based airfreight carrier, which already operates two regional hubs on the Chinese mainland, sees "thousands of miles" in global e-commerce and giving its strengths full play in "sewing up" a worldwide infrastructure link."The Asia Pacific is one of the world's fastest-growing regions. We're seeing rising demand for air-cargo transport, partially boosted by the growth in healthcare services and products," says Karen Reddington, president of FedEx Express Asia Pacific — a subsidiary of the New York-listed FedEx Corp.She keeps an eye on the industry as healthcare logistics plays an increasingly prominent role in the booming market, especially on the Chinese mainland.According to healthcare information company IQVIA, the Chinese mainland took its place as the world's second-largest pharmaceutical market last year, worth $122.6 billion. It's also the biggest emerging market for pharmaceuticals with growth tipped to reach $175 billion by 2022.Responding to the market changes, the purple-tailed fleet of FedEx has invested heavily in the healthcare portfolio of solutions.Corresponding services, specifically for the Asia Pacific, include specialized packaging, temperature-controlled shipping, as well as advanced monitoring and visibility solutions. The company's SenseAware service could record and monitor a shipment's temperature, location, light exposure, humidity, shock and barometric pressure with multiple sensors.FedEx's international express and cargo hub, located at Shanghai's Pudong International Airport, opened early this year as the second global hub on the mainland. It features a cold chain center to support healthcare logistics. Equipped with temperature-controlled storage ranging from -22 to 25 degrees Celsius, the facility offers a full suite of cold chain logistics solutions tailored to different healthcare products.These healthcare products also need to be delivered by dedicated freighters that could provide cold chain solutions, such as Boeing 767 and 777 aircrafts, says Reddington.The express delivery titan ordered 12 of Boeing's medium-sized 767 cargo aircrafts and 12 larger 777 airfreighters in June, worth $6.6 billion, making FedEx the biggest customer for both aircraft models. The purchase showed the company has placed its confidence in the wings of the Boeing 767 and 777, as well as the future air-cargo market."These aircrafts will be used globally," says Reddington. "We continue to invest in ever more efficient freighters after seeing efficiency having improved about 30 percent with the introduction of the 767 and 777 freighters."Online market boomThe Boeing 777 aircraft, the world's biggest twinjet, is particularly suitable for intercontinental deliveries. As the company is focusing on connecting Asia with the US and Asia with Europe, she believes the 777 freighters will play a major role as these routes keep growing.Besides healthcare logistics, the industry is counting on e-commerce continuing to soar, as well with more people buying products online for quick delivery. According to New York-based research firm eMarketer, global online purchases reached $2.304 trillion last year — a 24.8-percent surge over the previous year.The growth was largely driven by the Asia Pacific, where 14.6 percent of overall retail expenditure went to e-commerce.Compared with the Chinese mainland's local express delivery companies, the rate of FedEx's mainland domestic delivery services is higher on average.Reddington explains they put greater emphasis on international business-to-business customers primarily, as they also demand mainland domestic delivery services. For these customers, large sorting facilities and connectivity with these facilities are more critical than rates."People often talk about the first mile and the last mile in e-commerce. But, when you're talking about international cross-border e-commerce, there're thousands of miles. What they need is a globally connected infrastructure," Reddington says. "And that's where FedEx really has a lot of strengths."At present, FedEx operates about 260 flights weekly on the mainland through four key airports — Beijing Capital International Airport, Shanghai Pudong International Airport, Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport and Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport.The group recently launched two new routes — one linking its regional hub in Guangzhou with its world center in Memphis, and another connecting Guangzhou and Vietnam's capital Hanoi. The former uses a Boeing 777 freighter.Reddington expects these routes to benefit importers and exporters around the world for their Asia-Pacific operations, as they could obtain a stronger competitive advantage with less transit time.Shipments within Asia are expected to be delivered in one business day, while those from Europe and North America would arrive in no more than three business days.Most positive growthThe international air transportation industry showed the most positive growth last year in recent years. Airfreight demand — measured in freight ton kilometers — more than doubled to 9 percent, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).The association was upbeat about the outlook at the beginning of this year. However, the rapid growth seen in 2017 is now over, with demand growing at a significantly slower pace this year.Global freight capacity, measured in available freight ton kilometers, grew by 6.2 percent year-on-year in May, while airfreight demand saw an increase of 4.2 percent. It was the fourth consecutive month that capacity growth had surpassed growth in demand.IATA considered rising trade tensions as one of the main reasons. "Headwinds are strengthening with growing friction among governments in trade. We still expect demand to grow, but those expectations are dampened with each new tariff introduced. Experience tells us that trade wars, in the long run, only produce losers," said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA's director-general and chief executive.Reddington is unwilling to speculate on the impact brought by the Sino-US trade standoff as FedEx is looking at the long term. But, she deems traders the lifeblood of global growth and that's why they keep investing in infrastructure and in markets like Vietnam."For FedEx, trade is really our business," she says.Contact the writer at edithlu@chinadailyhk.com.

                Patients with rare diseases seek cost-effective treatments
            </a>
            <p>
                Patients with rare diseases have trouble getting effective and sustainable treatment in China, despite recent efforts to expedite drug approval and expand tax breaks, said a report released on Thursday.The last day of February is recognized as Rare Disease Day by countries around the world.China launched its first medical catalog on rare diseases in May last year, covering 121 conditions that afflict about 3 million people in the country.About 160 drugs targeting 74 rare diseases have been developed overseas, and 83 have gained market approval in China, according to the report, which was published in Beijing on Thursday.However, it noted that roughly one-third of the drugs cleared for the Chinese market are not adequately prescribed to patients in need because they are not officially designated medications."Doctors might refrain from issuing these de facto effective and safe drugs if official designations are not in place," said Huang Rufang, director of the Chinese Organization for Rare Disorders.The report was issued by the organization and IQVIA, a health data research company.Financial burdens can also pile up during long-term treatments. Under the current national medical insurance system, only 29 rare disease drugs are eligible for national reimbursement.Diagnosis and treatment of the 7,000 known rare diseases is a thorny issue around the globe. Effective therapy options are available for less than 10 percent of these conditions, the report said.It suggested a host of measures to help advance access to rare disease drugs in China, including setting up a new office to manage related funds, updating rare disease catalogs, supporting domestic drug development and capping payments by an individual patient at 80,000 yuan ($12,000) annually."We call for the establishment of a national action plan dedicated solely to addressing issues confronting patients with rare diseases," Huang said.At least seven countries, including France, India, Brazil and Australia, have rolled out similar large-scale plans that offer incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop new drugs and stronger safety nets for patients.In recent years, China has stepped up its efforts to improve the well-being of patients with rare and neglected ailments.The National Medical Products Administration has been streamlining and accelerating market approval procedures for overseas drugs, including some for rare diseases, in a bid to introduce effective treatments more quickly and at lower cost.Earlier this month, a statement from the State Council said the value-added tax on 21 drugs for rare conditions will be cut to 3 percent. The tax break took effect on Friday.The first guidebook on the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases in China was released on Wednesday. Led by Peking Union Medical College Hospital, a top hospital in China, the guide covers all 121 rare diseases specified in the catalog, Huang said.Zhang Zongjiu, chief of medical administration and supervision at the National Health Commission, said the guide will be of great significance to help medical staff better identify, diagnose and treat rare diseases.He said that despite the lower incidence of rare diseases compared with commonly seen ones, the total number of people with such diseases is still large simply because of China's large population. However, such patients in China face many difficulties in getting accurate diagnoses and treatments, because of a lack of ability and experience at many medical institutions and a lack of available drugs.According to Zhang Shuyang, vice-president of the China Alliance of Rare Diseases and vice-president of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, "Every patient will cause a direct impact to at least six or seven other family members. So in total one-10th or even more people may be affected by rare diseases in China," she said.Wang Yi'ou, founder of China-Dolls Center for Rare Disorders, a Beijing-based NGO that advocates for the rights of patients with rare diseases, said many such people in China want to see more policies implemented to help them relieve the financial burden of medical expenses.For example, nearly 60 percent of patients with Gaucher disease, a rare genetic disorder that results in serious bone damage and even death, have been misdiagnosed, and they face heavy financial pressure in treating the disease, according to a report released by Chinese University of Hong Kong on Sunday.Zou Zhengtao, a 31-year-old who was diagnosed with Gaucher disease when he was 2 years old, said he's had to rely on cerezyme, an injected drug developed by French pharmaceutical company Sanofi, to remain in stable condition.However, he was luckier than many other patients with the disease, as he was covered by a charity program from China Charity Federation and is subsidized by the company, so he gets free drugs for life."Otherwise it would be impossible for me to afford the drug, as it costs more than a million yuan a year," he said. "The drug has not been included in basic medical insurance programs in most places in China."

                Novartis to team up with Chinese tech giants
            </a>
            <p>
                Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis AG is looking to further tap into China's healthcare market by bringing more innovative drugs, while enhancing collaborations with local biotech and technology companies to further digital transformation of healthcare, a top company official said.Vas Narasimhan, CEO of Novartis, said he expects China to "become one of the top three markets for Novartis by sales in the coming years". The company is ready to bring more than 10 innovative medicines to China over the coming years, thanks to the country's commitment to further reform and opening-up, and its ongoing efforts to speed up new drug approvals, he said."Over the last 20 years China has been able to evolve from a country that was primarily focused on generic medicines and vaccines to now being able to bring the latest innovations," he said."China's strategy of opening-up to our industry and opening-up to innovation will benefit Chinese patients and also enable companies like us to keep investing in China."In recent years, especially from five years ago, Chinese regulators have been streamlining and accelerating new drug approvals, with efforts such as increasing the head count of staff for new drug reviews and speeding up approvals for drugs in urgent clinical need or for treating rare diseases.At the recently closed China Development Forum 2019, Wang Ping, director general of the department of drug registration under the National Medical Products Administration, revealed that China approved 48 new medicines in 2018, and reduced the approval period by a year."Now China's regulatory timelines are at the same level of what we see in the United States or in Europe," Narasimhan said, adding that Novartis got nine new medicines approved in China in the past two years alone, at a pace faster than ever.Novartis, which spends more than $9 billion on research and development every year, runs an innovation hub in Shanghai, with an investment of $1 billion. The campus, with more than 700 scientists focusing mainly on research of cancer and liver diseases prevalent in Asia and China, is now playing an increasingly important role in new drug development."I think our investment in innovation is bringing a number of new launches to China in our portfolio over the next three years," Narasimhan said.China is now the world's second-largest market for pharmaceuticals, second only to the United States. Iqvia, a healthcare information company, earlier said China's pharmaceutical market will reach $145 billion to $175 billion by 2022, compared with $122.6 billion in 2017.The CEO said Novartis is also engaging with Chinese regulators and local partners to bring cell and gene therapies to China, which have been heralded as a breakthrough in treating many intractable illnesses.Last September, Novartis announced a deal with Shanghai-based biotech company Cellular Biomedicine Group, for manufacturing Kymriah, a CAR-T cell therapy, or chimeric antigen receptor cell therapy, treatment for cancer. Kymriah has already been approved in Europe, Canada, and Australia and Novartis is looking to bring the same to China soon."I believe our collaboration with Chinese partners can help China become the leader among the emerging markets in bringing cell and gene therapies to countries," said Narasimhan, who presented a policy paper at the CDF 2019 with a wide range of recommendations to the Chinese government, including the regulatory framework, requirements for the research and applications, as well as the establishment of flexible payment mechanisms and alternative funding models.Narasimhan said that digital technologies have been a major driver fueling the company's business expansion in China.In addition to 40 biotech companies that Novartis currently has partnerships with, the company is also planning partnerships with technology companies in China.On March 22, the company signed a global strategic partnership deal with Chinese tech giant Tencent to apply integrated big data, artificial intelligence and social media technologies for better patient outcomes on chronic diseases.The CEO took the helm at Novartis last year and has envisioned a focused medicines company that's powered by data sciences and digital technologies and has launched a number of initiatives to transform Novartis while reshaping the healthcare sector using digital technologies."We began the partnership with Tencent in cardiovascular diseases to help identify patients who need care and help patients stay on the right medicine," said Narasimhan."Now we are expanding the collaboration to cover all the chronic diseases. This is one of our most advanced partnerships in the world and a model for the rest. Our strategy in China is about growth, innovation, and digital technologies."

                IQVIA fights cancer with charity run
            </a>
            <p>
                "Through joint efforts, we hope someday cancer will be viewed as curable as a bad cold," said Brian Mi, president of IQVIA China, at the launch ceremony of the 3rd IQVIA "Joy Run" activity held in the riverside area of the World Expo Park in Shanghai on May 17.Nearly 300 running enthusiasts from Shanghai competed in either the 5km or 10km race in the afternoon. Notably, among them were 26 members of the Shanghai Cancer Recovery Club, an NGO that consists of thousands of Shanghai residents who are suffering from cancer or have recovered from the serious disease. Every one of these club members successfully completed the race.IQVIA, formerly Quintiles and IMS Health, is an American multinational that provides biopharmaceutical development and commercial outsourcing services. One of the world’s largest contract research organizations (CRO), IQVIA was ranked 305th on the 2017 Fortune 500 list. IQVIA opened its Chinese subsidiary that conducts clinical trials for healthcare companies back in 1997.It was the third year for IQVIA China to host the "Joy Run" activity. The previous venue was Olympic Forest Park in Beijing. The charity run is aimed at promoting a healthy lifestyle and a positive mindset for cancer prevention and treatment.This year, IQVIA partnered with the Shanghai Cancer Recovery Club to organize the event. The staff of IQVIA also sold their personal belongings on site and donated the sales revenue to the club.According to the latest statistics from the National Center for Cancer Registration (NCCR), during 2015, the total cancer morbidity in China was 3.92 million cases and the death toll was 2.33 million, which means that each minute 7.5 Chinese citizens were diagnosed with cancer and 4.4 died from the illness. The city of Shanghai alone witnesses more than 100 deaths from cancer every day, as the data from the Shanghai Anticancer Association shows."Specializing in clinical-trials services that take a new medicine from its conception to receiving marketing approval, IQVIA China has been accelerating the entry of cancer drugs into the Chinese market," Mi said."In the past, it often took seven years to introduce a foreign medicine into China. In view of the recent progress of drug reviews in China, I am confident that the one-year review period will become a new normal in the near future," Mi added.

                Antipodean academics look to China to establish R & D centers
            </a>
            <p>
                As more educational and scientific institutions look to forge bonds with China, Shenzhen in Guangdong province is preparing to welcome the Monash Technology Transformation Institute.The unique venture is thought to be one of the biggest commercialization agreements of its kind, whereby the Monash University, the Chinese government and commercial partners are dedicated to carrying out "research and development to bring targeted intellectual property to an investible stage".Monash University's deputy vice-chancellor (enterprise) Ken Sloan, who is responsible for providing leadership and strategic support for the university's industry partnerships, says the deal announced recently will "increase the range, reach and commercialization potential" of the university's research.He adds that the establishment of MTTI will further solidify the university as a "significant player" in the translation and commercialization of medical devices, materials and engineering inventions relating to medicine, including electronics and software developed by its researchers.The MTTI partners Monash University with the Shenzhen State High-Tech Industrial Innovation Center, the Pingshan District People's Government, the Shenzhen Junye Yungu Investment Development Co Ltd, and Changjun Capital Investment Management (Shenzhen) Co Ltd.Yungu Investment was established by Tianan Junye to partner the MTTI initiative as part of Pingshan district's move to position itself as a major biotech and medical research center for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area."With the focus on medical devices and related discoveries, we have an incredible opportunity to produce medical products, not just for the domestic Chinese market, but the world," Sloan says.Monash is one of Australia's leading universities with a campus in Malaysia and a research and teaching center in Prato, Italy.It also has a research center in Mumbai, India, in partnership with the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.In 2012, the university was given a license to develop a joint graduate school with Southeast University in the Suzhou Industrial Park in Jiangsu province. The Southeast University-Monash University Joint Graduate School is the first Australian graduate school, to win a license to operate in China.China is the biggest emerging pharmaceutical market in the world, worth over $137 billion last year, according to IQVIA, a healthcare information company, and it is expected to reach between $140 billion and $170 billion by 2023.The global market for medical devices is growing at an equally impressive rate and is expected to reach $400 billion by 2023, according to data from Lucintel, a global management consulting and market research firm.Sloan says the first projects are now being assessed and MTTI is expected to make an announcement in the coming months.He says MTTI complements Bio-Curate, a joint company which Monash University and the University of Melbourne founded to incubate therapeutic and related discoveries in Australia.While the investment, reported to be in excess of A$100 million ($70.3 million), will come from Chinese venture capital, the research and development work will come from Monash University."Shenzhen sits in the Greater Bay Area, which has a population in excess of 70 million people. As China continues to grow, health and wellbeing will become ever more important," Sloan says.The Greater Bay Area comprises nine cities in Guangdong province (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Dongguan, Foshan, Huizhou, Jiangmen, Zhaoqing, Zhongshan, and Zhuhai) and the two special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macao.Monash University is not alone in seeking out investment potential in China for its research.The University of New South Wales, in Sydney, has a pipeline of investment with more than 30 Chinese industry partners valued at over A$180 million."The majority of the funds are invested in contract research as part of the Torch Innovation Precinct," a spokesperson for the university says."The precinct is a great example of bilateral cooperation where research and education are the catalyst for economic and social impact via the translation of new technologies into production."The UNSW Torch Innovation Precinct was launched in August 2016, opening unprecedented collaboration between UNSW-led Australian research teams and major Chinese companies.The Torch precinct at UNSW was the first to be established outside of China, modeled on China's successful Torch program that promotes the co-location of businesses, universities and research organizations within dedicated science and technology parks to drive innovation.Since 1988, China has developed 150 Torch precincts throughout the country that generate 7 percent of GDP, 10 percent of industrial output and 16 percent of export value.Deloitte Access Economics has estimated the Torch precinct at UNSW could boost Australian GDP by A$1.1 billion in its first decade alone.On April 16, the University of Melbourne announced it received funding for a Joint Research Centre with the Chongqing Institute of Green and Intelligent Technology, under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, to develop flexible graphene electronics.Graphene, a single layer of hybridized carbon atoms, was first isolated from graphite in 2004, and it is the thinnest material known, but is exceedingly strong, light and flexible.This unique combination of properties makes graphene an ideal platform for flexible electronics.The joint center will enable Chinese and Australian scientists to work together on the development of flexible electronics applications including low-cost flexible solar cells for portable power generation, low-cost perovskite solar cells for the Australian market and new near-infrared technologies including photodetectors and nighttime imaging systems, the university says.Others involved in the project are Wuhan University of Technology, Nanjing University, Monash University, and industrial partners GreatCell Solar, Agilent Technologies and Chongqing Moxi Technology Co Ltd.karlwilson@chinadailyapac.com    (China Daily 05/22/2019 page20)
