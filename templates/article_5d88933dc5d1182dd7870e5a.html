                China imposes duties on phenol imports
            </p>
            <p>
                China will impose anti-dumping duties on phenol imported from the United States, the European Union, South Korea, Japan and Thailand starting on Sept 6, the Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday.Phenols are widely used in household products and as intermediates for industrial synthesis to produce plastics and related materials.In a statement, the ministry said that those countries and regions' dumping of phenols caused "substantial damage" to China's domestic industry. The tariffs, ranging from 10.6 percent to 287.2 percent, will last for five years, according to the statement.For instance, a majority of US companies in the sector, such as INEOS Americas LLC, will face anti-dumping duties of up to 287.2 percent. Anti-dumping duties of up to 23.7 percent were imposed on South Korea, and 28.6 percent on Thailand.The US was China's second-biggest source of phenol imports in 2018, and South Korea was the top contributor to China's phenol import volumes, according to ICIS, a petrochemical market information provider.Last year, the ministry decided to initiate anti-dumping investigations against imported phenol originating in these economies, in response to the domestic phenol industry's request.The investigations were in strict accordance with related Chinese laws, regulations and World Trade Organization rules, the ministry said.

                Russia, US trade barbs over INF collapse, China says no interest in trilateral treaty
            </a>
            <p>
                UNITED NATIONS - Russia and the United States on Thursday blamed each other for the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, while China said it has no interest in trilateral arms control talks that Washington wants.At a United Nations Security Council meeting, Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia's acting permanent representative to the UN, said the United States "consistently and deliberately violated" the Treaty for some time.He recalled the US deployment of missile launchers in eastern Europe, the first one in Romania, which he said could be easily re-equipped to launch missiles banned by the treaty.The US missile test, conducted soon after its formal departure from the treaty on Aug 2, proved its intended breach.Jonathan Cohen, US acting permanent representative to the UN, accused Russia of violating the 1987 arms control deal, saying the United States will not remain a party to an agreement not complied with by the other signatory.He noted that the United States has the full support of its NATO allies in its exit, accusing Russia had "materially breached" the treaty.Meanwhile, Cohen claimed that China "threatens to target US allies that host any US missiles," and reiterated the US interest in arms control that includes both Russia and China, signaling proposal of trilateral talks to that end.In response, Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations Zhang Jun said "China has repeatedly stated its position on the so-called arms control negotiation with the United States and Russia. China has no interest and will not be part of it".Zhang stressed that, for any arms control negotiation, it is imperative to fully consider the overall military capabilities of countries and follow the principle of "undiminished security for all", a basic principle of international arms control.In addition, he said it is unacceptable to use China as an excuse for the United States to leave the INF Treaty."China unswervingly pursues a national defense policy that is defensive in nature," he said. "China's nuclear strategy for self-defense is completely transparent and its nuclear policy is highly responsible.""China's nuclear arsenal is extremely limited in scale, and poses no threat to international peace and security," he noted.In response to the US criticism of China's development of intermediate-range missiles, Zhang stressed that the US withdrawal from the INF Treaty is yet "another act of unilateralism and escape from international obligations by the United States"."It is aimed at relieving restrictions and seeking absolute military advantage," the envoy noted."China firmly opposes US deployment of intermediate-range missiles in the Asia-Pacific and looks to the United States to be cool-headed and exercise restraint," said Zhang.At the meeting, Russia's Polyanskiy also appealed to his "European colleagues" to heed the US withdrawal from the INF treaty, and warned of a possible new arms race as a result.He called on the Europeans to act to prevent the deployment of US intermediate-range missiles on their continent.Recalling a failed push by Russia at the UN to support the INF Treaty last year, Polyanskiy warned that the demise of the INF Treaty would not only undermine parts of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, but also would lead to a new arms race.He told his European peers that, because of the US geopolitical ambitions, "we are all one step from an arms race that could not be controlled or regulated in any way."Nonetheless, the Russian ambassador voiced hope that "common sense and an instinct of self-defense" can "win out among our Western partners"."what's at stake here is the very existence of humanity," he said.Thursday's meeting focused on the intermediate-range cruise missile test conducted by the United States. The meeting was requested by China and Russia, citing the destabilizing effects of the test.The US Department of Defense confirmed on Monday that it had conducted a flight test of a ground-launched cruise missile, which hit its intended target after traveling more than 500 km.It was the first time the United States had conducted an intermediate-range cruise missile test since formally withdrawing from the INF Treaty.The United States and former Soviet Union signed the INF Treaty in 1987 and ratified it the following year. The treaty prohibited possessing, development and testing of ground-launched missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 km.Moscow and Washington had accused each other of violating the agreement in recent years amid increasing tensions.In early February, the United States announced that it would suspend its treaty obligations and withdraw from the INF Treaty in six months if Russia failed to adhere to treaty provisions.In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to suspend Moscow's participation in the INF Treaty in February.At the beginning of the meeting, UN Under-secretary-General of Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu said: "The recent collapse of the INF Treaty removed one of the few constraints on the development and deployment of a destabilizing and dangerous classes of missiles."Nakamitsu echoed United Nations Security-General Antonio Guterres' call for all states to urgently seek agreement on a new common path for international arms control.

                'Unacceptable' for US to cite China in leaving missile treaty
            </a>
            <p>
                China's envoy to the United Nations reiterated his country's position Thursday on the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, saying it is "unacceptable to use China as an excuse for leaving the treaty, and China rejects the baseless accusation by the United States".Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the UN, said that prior to its official withdrawal from the INF treaty, the US already announced its plan to accelerate the development and deployment of intermediate-range missiles. Lately, it conducted a test launch of a land-based cruise missile."China strongly urges the relevant country to take a highly responsible attitude, exercise restraint and earnestly preserve the existing arms-control regime in an effort to safeguard global strategic balance and stability and international and regional peace and security," Zhang said at an emergency meeting of the Security Council on Thursday at UN headquarters in New York.The meeting was convened at the request of Russia with the support of China, citing the effects of the US cruise missile test on Sunday, according to the Security Council report.The US Department of Defense confirmed on Monday that it had conducted a flight test of a ground-launched cruise missile that hit its intended target after traveling for more than 500 kilometers (311 miles).This marks the first time the US has conducted an intermediate-range cruise missile test after it formally withdrew from the INF Treaty on Aug 2, according to Xinhua.Deputy Russian Ambassador to the UN Dmitry Polyanskiy told the meeting that Washington's testing of a ground-launched missile showed "America is ready for an arms race".Polyanskiy said that Russia was ready for "serious dialogue" over arms control, accusing European countries of tolerating the US' actions.Zhang said that the INF treaty is important to arms control and disarmament. The unilateral withdrawal of the US from the treaty led to "the demise of the treaty", which will have a "far-reaching negative impact on global strategic balance and stability, regional security in Europe and Asia, as well as the international arms control regime".In response to the US' criticism of China's development of intermediate-range missiles, Zhang emphasized that US withdrawal from the INF is another act of unilateralism and avoidance of international obligations by the US."It is aimed at relieving restrictions and seeking absolute military advantage," he said.He stressed that China "unswervingly" pursues a national defense policy that is defensive in nature."China's nuclear strategy for self-defense is completely transparent, and its nuclear policy is highly responsible," he said. "China's nuclear arsenal is extremely limited in scale and poses no threat to international peace and security."He told the meeting that for decades, China has actively participated in arms-control consultations and negotiations under multilateral mechanisms and frameworks, including those of the United Nations and the Conference on Disarmament."China opposes an arms race and works to safeguard global strategic balance and stability. Moving forward, China will continue to firmly uphold multilateralism and actively participate in multilateral arms control processes to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security," he said.Regarding the US claim that China should join the United States and Russia in arms- control negotiations, Zhang stressed that for any such negotiations, it is imperative to fully consider the overall military capabilities of countries and follow the principle of "undiminished security for all", a basic principle of international arms control.

                Trade deals and reform of WTO are better than trade wars -- EU's Tusk
            </a>
            <p>
                BIARRITZ -- Trade deals and the reform of WTO are better than trade wars. Trade wars will lead to recession, while trade deals will boost economy, said Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, on Saturday. He called for putting a stop to trade wars."Trade wars among G7 members will lead to eroding the already weakened trust among us," he said during a press conference prior to the G7 summit.US President Donald Trump tweeted Friday that the US will raise existing duties on 250 billion dollar of Chinese products from 25 percent to 30 percent beginning on Oct 1, and another 300 billion dollar worth of Chinese imports will see tariff rise from 10 percent to 15 percent on Sept 1.If Trump uses tariffs for political reasons it would be risky to the whole world, including the European Union, Tusk told reporters.China is firmly opposed to the US announcement that it will further raise the tariffs on about $550 billion of Chinese imports, said a spokesperson of the Ministry of Commerce Saturday."Such unilateral and bullying acts of trade protectionism and extreme pressure run counter to the consensus of the heads of state of China and the United States, and run counter to the principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit," the spokesperson said."China strongly urges the United States not to misjudge the situation, or underestimate the determination of the Chinese people. It must immediately stop its erroneous practices, or bear all the consequences," the spokesperson said.Besides China, the US is currently at loggerheads with many countries, including G7 alliance from trade to security. Threatening Germany with car tariffs, Trump vowed to tax French wines if Paris levies digital tax on big US technology companies; Casting Canada as a trade villain who "robs US blindly", he also sniffed at the European integration by encouraging Brexit with a "great trade deal" with London; Withdrawal from the Paris climate accord and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty one after another, he even showed his willingness to pull out some American forces in Germany unless Berlin increases defense spending to the 2-percent GDP threshold.
