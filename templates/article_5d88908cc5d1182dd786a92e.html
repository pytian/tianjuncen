                MANCHESTER, England - Manchester United succeeded in offloading striker Romelu Lukaku to Inter Milan on a transfer deadline day which saw plenty of business but few jaw-dropping deals from Premier League clubs.Belgian Lukaku, who spent two years with United after 75 million-pound ($91 million) move from Everton, joined Inter for a fee reported to be around 80 million euros.United had been keen to move on the forward who disappointed last season and whose style of play did not suit the approach being taken by Norwegian manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.With United unable to sign a replacement, the pressure will be on 21-year-old England forward Marcus Rashford to deliver the goals in a more central role than he has previously operated in.United had already invested heavily to bring in center-back Harry Maguire from Leicester City for 80 million pounds, making him the most expensive defender in the world.Solskjaer has also added right back Aaron Wan-Bissaka and winger Dan James, while some fringe players may yet move out as the European transfer window remains open until Sept 2.Tottenham Hotspur famously spent nothing in the window a year ago before reaching the Champions League final but tied up two deals for manager Mauricio Pochettino on deadline day.Argentina midfielder Giovani Lo Celso joined from Spanish side Real Betis on a season-long loan with an option for a permanent switch.Highly-rated 19-year-old Ryan Sessegnon was bought from Fulham for a reported initial fee of 25 million pounds -- the left wing-back signing a five-year deal.ARSENAL ACTIVETottenham's north London rivals Arsenal were also active, spending a reported 25 million pounds on Celtic's Scotland left back Kieran Tierney.Unai Emery's side also brought in Brazilian defender David Luiz from Chelsea for about eight million pounds but forward Alex Iwobi joined Everton in a deal reportedly worth 28 million pounds.Former England striker Andy Carroll has rejoined his boyhood club Newcastle United, 8-1/2 years after leaving them to join Liverpool in a then British record transfer.The injury-plagued 30-year-old was a free agent after being released by West Ham United at the end of last season.Watford signed Senegal winger Ismaila Sarr from French club Rennes on a five-year deal for a club-record fee.Watford did not disclose the cost but French media reported it was in the region of 32 million pounds, eclipsing the 18.5 million pounds the Hornets paid for forward Andre Gray in 2017.Chelsea midfielder Danny Drinkwater, who has struggled to get game time in the two years at Stamford Bridge since his move from Leicester, joined Burnley on a six-month loan deal.Australia midfielder Aaron Mooy moved from second-tier Huddersfield Town, who were relegated from the top flight last season, to Brighton & Hove Albion on a season-long loan.Reuters

                    G20 can be booster for African economy
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China can lead way for group of leading economies to support the continent's industrialization There is still one area that cries out for greater G20 coordination. Trade. Global trade has evolved significantly in the past few decades, in particular, since the launch of China's opening-up and reform process more than 40 years ago. But the future of global trade is not China. It's Africa. The African continent today has the same conditions China did 40 years ago - a large, 1.2 billion strong population - many of whom are young and hungry for jobs, small-holder farmers trying to move up the value chain, and abundant land. Africans are also increasingly technology savvy and urban, which can propel the process. In addition, African governments are taking four huge steps to accelerate this vision, just as China did. From those in smaller countries such as Rwanda and Senegal to larger countries such as Nigeria and Egypt - the governments of African countries are creating industrial parks and special economic zones. They are taking up loans and creating public private partnerships to upgrade their infrastructure - new roads, rail, airports, and ports - many of which are aiming to be "green" in order to avoid the same kinds of pollution problems that China has suffered. They are also competing fiercely to climb up the World Bank's "Ease of Doing Business Index", by reducing their taxes and bureaucracy in the hope of attracting new foreign investors. And last but not least, African leaders have boldly come together to create the world's largest Free Trade Area, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which came into force in May 2019. The general agreement has been signed by 54 of the African Union's 55 members. They are thus doing a great deal to ensure the future of global trade is in Africa. Yet, on the other hand, exclusive data released this week by my firm, Development Reimagined, reveals that the G20 is not yet creating an enabling environment for African trade. But the 55 African countries together account for only 3 percent of the G20's imports. Of this 3 percent total, 29 countries account for less than 1 percent each. These 29 countries, include countries such as Rwanda and Senegal, which are investing millions to get ahead in trade and investment competitiveness. Even Ethiopia, the African country that Chinese factories tend to know best, only exports 2 percent of the overall 3 percent going to the G20. Indeed, it is countries extractive, natural resources, such as Nigeria and Angola, that dominate imports to the G20. Indeed, for every $1 of goods the G20 countries purchase from Africa, they sell and export $1.4 of goods back to African countries. Even Japan, the G20 host this year, exports more to 37 African countries than it imports from them. However, this relationship is improving, albeit slowly and not consistently. Back in 2000, the G20 sold 39 times more products to Africa than it received back from Africa. Now, the G20 sells 36 times more. Egypt - a relatively more developed, manufacturing country - has the continent's largest trade deficit with the G20. These patterns suggest that without further support from the outside - to complement the internal African efforts I have outlined above - the vision will not become a reality. Trade is - by its very nature - a two-way process. Given their economic influence, there is a very strong case for the G20 to do more to disrupt these patterns, and an even stronger case for China to lead this effort. Why China? Since 2008, China has been Africa's No 1 bilateral trade partner. However, like many other G20 countries, over 70 percent of African countries have trade deficits with China, and this affects investment prospects for African countries. In addition, in the context of the US-China trade war, an agenda to diversify away from imports from the United States or China makes a great deal of sense, and African countries can benefit. Further, if Africa is going to trade more and better, the world's current manufacturing hub needs to shift to the future manufacturing hub. In other words, it is primarily the thousands of Chinese factories producing for the world's consumer markets and the Chinese market that need to shift to African countries. China could itself promote exports from Africa to China. For instance, the first China Africa Trade Expo was recently held in Changsha, and China has also recently opened up the market for cut and frozen avocados from Kenya; beef from Namibia and Botswana; citrus fruit from South Africa, and more. This can and should continue, but China should also focus on opening up markets for finished and value-added products, as a means to support Africa to innovate, attract investment and effective technology transfer. But China doing this on its own will not be enough. The rest of the G20 also need to act, for instance with three complementary actions. First, the G20 should accelerate the landmark agreement made in Kenya in 2018 to reduce domestic agricultural subsidies in favor of poorer countries. This will help to generate incentives to improve agricultural yields, which will drive incomes up to invest in education and health - all necessary requirements for development, as China experienced. Second, the G20 should use their aid, other cooperation tools like training and marketing in innovative ways to create incentives to actively shift global supply chains toward the African continent in a green and sustainable manner. And third, the G20 could itself explore a G20-wide Africa preferential trade agreement that recognizes the AfCFTA. African countries are working hard to get a larger piece of the trade pie. It is in the world's interest that they do, and China is getting on board. The question is how and when other large, powerful countries will also do the same. G20 - the time is now.

                Many of the nation's top basketball players used the 2015 Chinese National Youth Games in Fuzhou as a springboard to professional careers. Here's an update on three of them:1. Shen's World Cup shotSix-foot-nine forward Shen Zijie became a huge fan favorite en route to winning a gold medal at the Fuzhou Games. He entered the CBA as a bench player with the Shenzhen Leopards but saw only limited action during his first few pro seasons.In 2018-19 Shen had a breakout year, averaging 11.7 points and 7.1 rebounds. The 21-year-old joined China's national team in 2019, lining up alongside the likes of Zhou Qi and Wang Zhelin.Although the FIBA World Cup tournament starts next month, Team China head coach Li Nan has yet to announce the host's final squad-but Shen is certainly in the mix to make the cut.

                    Business continues to boom in central province
                </p>
            </a>

                To maintain the sustainable development of the economy and society, Hunan province has further facilitated high-level opening-up in recent years by luring more investments and boosting cooperation, local officials said. The province is an investment destination for more than one-third of Fortune Global 500 companies from more than 200 countries and regions, ranking first in Central China. The foreign investments in Hunan mainly concentrate on the secondary and tertiary industries such as manufacturing, service, architecture and high-tech businesses. In 2018, the total contractual amount of foreign investment in Hunan surged 177.6 percent year-on-year. The foreign investment actually utilized in the province amounted to $16.19 billion, up 11.9 percent year-on-year. Statistics from the Department of Commerce of Hunan province show that in the first quarter of this year, the business investment actually in place recorded 198.5 billion yuan ($27.76 billion), up 17.2 percent year-on-year. The province has set up 74 new foreign enterprises, up 57.5 percent year-on-year and attracted 30 big projects with the amount of each reaching more than 200 million yuan. This year, Hunan held a series of global events including the 2019 Changsha International Construction Equipment Exhibition in May, a gathering of the world's leading construction machinery companies and the first China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo in June attended by 53 African countries and more than 10 international institutes. A total of 81 cooperative agreements were signed during the trade expo and the total business volume amounted to more than $20 billion. Enterprises in Hunan will further expand cooperation with countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative. In the first half of this year, Hunan's combined amount of new contracts of overseas construction projects and foreign labor cooperation reached $5.4 billion. Over half of the foreign construction projects' contract value, $870 million, was completed in the countries and regions involved in the BRI. During the same period, 31 of 43 new overseas businesses funded by Hunan companies were set up in BRI-involved countries. Their combined investments worth $496 million accounted for more than 90 percent of the total investment value, according to commerce department statistics. By the end of June, the number of overseas enterprises involving investments from Hunan reached 1,570. Their contract investment value had surpassed $23.38 billion, covering 93 countries and regions around the globe. Strategic zones As a transition zone between China's eastern coastal and western areas, Hunan province is a key point along the Yangtze River Economic Belt. The geographic advantages have helped create a business-friendly environment for the province and brought in assets, technologies and professionals from the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta. Changsha, capital of Hunan province, has established direct high-speed trains linking to Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai as well as 12 provincial capitals since 2009 when the Wuhan-Guangzhou line began operation along the Beijing-Guangzhou high-speed railway. Hunan is home to four strategic development zones: a planned zone for the development and poverty alleviation in the Wuling Mountains area, a demonstration zone for industrial transfer in southern and western Hunan, an economic and ecological zone around the Dongting Lake area and the Xiangjiang River area. The planned zone in the Wuling Mountains area consists of old revolutionary base areas, places for ethnic groups and poverty-stricken villages. The local government will build the zone into a demonstration area for poverty relief, cultural tourism and environmental protection. The demonstration zone for industrial transfer is expected to be a pilot area for opening-up and cooperation as a key national center for advanced manufacturing. The southern Hunan plays a vital role in promoting the industrial transfer and economic cooperation between central and western China and eastern costal regions, especially the Pearl River Delta region. The economic and ecological zone around the Dongting Lake area consists of cities including Yueyang, Changde, Yiyang in Hunan and Jingzhou in Hubei province. The area is rich in mineral resources such as rock phosphate and oulopholite. In April 2015, the Xiangjiang New Area was approved by the State Council to become a national-level economic and development zone, the first State-level new area in Central China. The area covers three national industrial parks in Changsha and Ningxiang. Italian Stefano Bottiglieri started his career at the Changsha Economic and Technological Development Zone as CEO of an aircraft manufacturer in 2014. "The local government has created a very good business environment in Changsha and helps us a lot in handling administrative registration and other procedures," Bottiglieri said. "The infrastructure is advanced here such as the high-speed railway and airport, and it is very convenient for us to do business." The Changsha Economic and Technological Development Zone ranks No 8 for its business environment among national-level economic and development zones in China, according to a report by a Chinese research center. Changsha ranks second for soft power and ninth for business environment among 35 cities across the nation, according to a report by the Academy of Greater Bay Area Studies. The efforts made by the province's Hengyang and Ningxiang cities in optimizing the business environment have been praised by the State Council. This year, Hunan will launch a series of activities and build innovative pilot areas aimed at creating a first-class business environment for enterprises. The province intends to simplify administrative procedures, improve government efficiency, regulate supervision and offer the best services.  From left: The 2019 Changsha International Construction Equipment Exhibition attracts throngs of participants from China and abroad in May.
