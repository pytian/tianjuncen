                             Speaking at a regional economic forum after talks with Abe, Putin said he sees many challenges before signing a peace treaty, including Japan's security alliance with the United States.

                             Given this scenario, while respecting the leading position of ASEAN countries in the RCEP, China should continue to use its influence to push forward RCEP negotiations. Third, China should carry out more exchanges with RCEP countries to build support for free trade. In the new era of globalization, the RCEP can be a way for developing countries to reach a higher degree of free trade and decrease the gap with developed countries

Thus, China's position to what is happening in Hong Kong is deeply steeped in historical context and China's role in promoting sovereignty of nations, free of foreign interference.China's recent history and policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries make foreign meddling in Hong Kong affairs extremely unpalatable The protests in Hong Kong, now in their third month, must be an encouraging index of sovereign ambitions to China's detractors and competitors
