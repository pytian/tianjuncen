                My first Mid-Autumn Festival in China
            </p>
            <p>
                I just marked my first Mid-Autumn Festival celebration in China. Exactly a week after arriving for my graduate studies, I was kind of nostalgic- memories of past experiences back in Kenya with family and friends swapping scenes in my mind. In the morning of Friday 13, the atmosphere on the Central China Normal University (CCNU) grounds was very upbeat. Chinese students explained to us the importance of the day as gifts of mooncakes and osmanthus wine were exchanged.Then came the night. The full moon dangled precariously in the sky. Like it was about to fall; as millions of eyes looked at it with reverence. Unlike previous nights, a cool breeze swept through the campus; and for the first time, I felt this liberating spirit. With African music playing on my headphones, a danced my way, floating in the wind, and forgetting myself for a moment.The feeling was so wonderful. Perfectly aligned with nature while tapping into the human exuberance around me.As I settled back into my hostel room, I was intrigued by the festival's idea. My curious mind nudged me online where I stumbled upon the poem Prelude to Water Melody, by the renowned Chinese writer Su Dongpo.This poem succinctly captured what I was going through. The message and the tone both resonated with my feelings. Writing to his family, Su wondered what time it was back at home. Given the time differences between China and Kenya, I was constantly trying to figure out what time it was back at home.Riding the wind, there I would fly, goes a line in the poem. I too remembered how, with arms wind open, I chided the Wuhan breeze to lift me off the ground.Finally, Su asks his family to join him in celebrating the timeless perfection of a full moon in a cloudless night. What a way to finish. I, too, was hoping that all was well with my family. That despite the distance and anxiety that comes with not seeing or hearing from a loved one; we were all flourishing under the watch of the full moon.There was more. The poem speaks to the singularity of humanity. That geography is no barrier to shared destiny. Human experiences; though expressed in symbolic languages of the world converge where it matters the most.And while we may go away from home, as happens from time to time; the family remains the most important unit to our productive existence. As the Chinese used the holiday to reunite with the loved ones, the Kenyan community in CCNU also got together, shared a meal and walked the streets of Wuhan under the neon lights.As I write this, a day after the Festival, I cannot help but look forward to the next. Thanks to the Chinese friends whose generosity and candor played out to make me and a horde of other foreign students experience unforgettable 2019 Mid-Autumn Festival.The Writer is a PhD Student of International Relations at Central China Normal University. The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                What they say at Vision China
            </a>
            <p>
                The 8th Vision China talks was held in New York Tuesday. Diplomats, business leaders, economists and other witnesses to the relationship shared their vision on the past and future of the 40-year relationship at the event hosted by China Daily and Bank of China at Asia Society.Here are some highlights of comments from the audience.Nicholas Platt, accompanied President Richard Nixon on his historic trip to Beijing in 1972, and was responsible for organizing a China tour for the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1973."I don't agree with people in Washington who think that China is our adversary. China is too big to contain, and the relationship between China and the United States too complicated to take apart. … That relationship is like an iceberg: one sees the sharp-edged part that's above the water, but there's a big lump underneath, below the water line, that provides the stability."

                An event highlights Zhang Ziyi's films over the past 20 years, Wang Ru reports.Meng Xiaoqiang, the publisher of the Chinese magazine Movie View, says he was impressed by leading actress Zhang Ziyi's "perfectionism" when he was a film reporter 20 years ago."One day after I interviewed her at her home, she called to request another interview since she thought she had not answered well enough the first time. Of all the stars I have interviewed, she is the only one who has made such a request," Meng said at the opening ceremony of a screening event of Zhang's films held in Beijing on Sept 10.Zhang also attended the ceremony to talk about her work and the development of Chinese cinema.Organized by the China Film Archive and Movie View, the event, Zhang Ziyi and Her Film Career: A 20-Year Retrospective, ran until Sept 14.Zhang started her career in 1999 by playing the role of Zhaodi in The Road Home, and has taken part in over 30 films, mostly as the female lead, since then.

                China's Xu Xi dances into spotlight
            </a>
            <p>
                Chinese dancer lines up on top British TV showDancer Xu Xi says she hopes to become a role model and fly the flag for Chinese dancers overseas when she joins the cast for the latest season of the hugely popular BBC primetime entertainment show Strictly Come Dancing this weekend.This year's staging of the series which inspired the international hit Dancing with the Stars will be the 17th, and in an interview with China Daily, the 28-year-old from Huaihua in Hunan Province said she feels a sense of responsibility as the show's first Chinese dancer."I am very proud to be Chinese," said Xu. "With this opportunity, I hope to be a role model, I want to present an accurate image of Chinese dancers. I hope to prove that I did not get to where I am due to luck, but due to my devotion to this profession, and my hard work."Xu - who goes by the name of Nancy Xu in the United Kingdom - said it was a "dream come true" when she was officially announced as a cast member on the show, known to fans as Strictly, in August.The show sees professional dancers paired with celebrities, who compete in a series of televised dance contests in front of a panel of judges. It is consistently one of the best-performing series on British television, averaging around 9.5 million viewers per episode.Strictly is also notorious for placing pressure on cast members, who contend with an unforgiving schedule and intense media scrutiny. Several previous contestants have experienced relationship troubles during filming.But Xu says her boyfriend - Italian singer and dancer Mikee Introna Michele -- has been nothing but supportive since she was selected for the show."I'm not concerned about all that other stuff," Xu said. "I'm just focused and I want to do my best. It's the best stage in the whole world. And it's the same with all the other performers, we want to show the world that we belong there."Xu will not be paired with a celebrity partner in her debut season, and will instead take part in the group performances of each episode. She said she hopes to prove herself and earn a shot at couples dancing in future series."I just have to stay ready - you never know when it will come," she said.Xu says she takes motivation from knowing her parents will be cheering her on from China this weekend."When I told my mom that I got the show she started crying," said Xu. "She told me, 'you left home at a very young age and each step has been challenging. You only share your good news, never your difficulties. Finally, your dreams have come true! I am so happy for you'."Xu said she rarely battles with nerves before a performance, and attributes the majority of her success to hard work rather than innate talent. She started dancing at the age of eight, and quickly showed promise, gaining entry to Guangdong Dance School in Guangzhou three years later."I have always had a passion for dancing since I was little, but I never really made the decision to do it professionally, it just came to me," she said.Xu racked up some solid results at international competitions in her teens and early 20s, reaching the finals of four major Latin dance championships between 2010 and 2013, but she said performing on stage in front of an audience, rather in competitions, brings out the best in her."It's the live band, the music, the audience, everything - I love it all," she said.Xu broke into showbusiness in China in 2014, when she competed on two televised shows similar to Strictly. In 2015, Xu's talents took her to Broadway in New York and London's West End in live dance show Burn the Floor.Xu said she has not set goals beyond Strictly, believing instead that new opportunities will present themselves if she keeps applying herself."I don't have any particular things in mind for the future," Xu said. "I am ambitious, of course, but I believe if you work hard you get the luck you deserve."

                The history of Miao bench dance
            </a>
            <p>
                The bench dance of Southwest China’s Guizhou province is an improvisational dance performed by women of the Miao ethnic group after drinking. It is mainly popular in Kaili, Huangping, Taijiang, Shibing and other Miao villages in Guizhou.The dance has a long history. It is said that long ago, the Dragon Prince of Qingshui River was killed by an old man in Wangpo, resulting in a drought that killed herbs and grain.Local people invited three noble old men to the riverside. They offered 12 eggs, 12 incense sticks and 12 pieces rice cakes to the gods and the Dragon King to make amends for their sins and asked for rain on earth.People prayed in groups along the riverside. Jiang Yang in the sky heard these prayers and asked for rain from Lei Gong（Thunder God).But the Thunder God ignored and then scolded Jiang instead. In order to relieve the suffering of the people, Jiang chopped bamboo to play beautiful music.The Thunder God became very happy after listening to it. He picked up two small benches, danced and jumped happily.
