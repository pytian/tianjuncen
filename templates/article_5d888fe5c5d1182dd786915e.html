                Host's hoopsters raring to do nation proud as World Cup readies for tip-offWith just five days to go until the FIBA World Cup tips off, anticipation and excitement levels have reached fever pitch for Team China's young hoopsters.The eight host cities are abuzz, the venues are sold out and the stars are lacing up as the squad enters its final tune-up for the 32-nation tournament, formerly the world championships, which will run from Aug 31-Spet 15.Inspired by their predecessors' eighth-place finish at the 2008 Olympics, China's current crop is aiming to channel the spirit of that memorable run at the Beijing Games."Those highlights are so adrenaline-pumping that we just can't wait to make our own history at the World Cup," guard Guo Ailun said after watching a video of China's greatest moments on court at a mobilization ceremony last week."Who wouldn't want to play on the biggest stage of the game on home soil and try to make your fellow compatriots proud? It's an opportunity that comes once in a lifetime so we are going to make it count," said the 25-year-old, who made his international debut at 16 at the 2010 world championships in Turkey.Joining Guo at the event, organized by sponsor TCL Corp, in Guangzhou last week were former NBA players Yi Jianlian, Zhou Qi and 2016 NBA draftee Wang Zhelin (the Memphis Grizzlies' 57th pick).The trio has been dubbed a modern version of the "Walking Great Wall", a term used to describe the legendary Yao Ming and his peers in the early 2000s.As the only member of the 2008 team on the current roster, Yi will be China's main pillar around the basket, while rangy young center Zhou offers solid rim protection. Wang, for his part, has improved his post play enough to make a significant impact on both ends of the floor.It's Guo, though, that has emerged as the team's beating heart this summer.Relying heavily on perimeter offense, he produced another explosive performance in the 90-84 loss to Brazil in Guangzhou on Friday, shooting a team-high 22 points, including three 3-pointers.During China's NBA Summer League stint in Las Vegas, Guo averaged 15.7 points and 3.7 assists in five games against NBA rookies and G-League veterans. His highlights included a crossover dribble that sent the Charlotte Hornets' Cody Martin sprawling in China's only win (84-80) of the offseason series.The 6-foot-2 guard has served notice to the world that the host shouldn't be underestimated, according to Brazil coach Aleksandar Petrovic."He did an impressive job to break down our defense like all the world's top guards could do," said Petrovic, a former Croatian player and older brother of the late NBA legend Drazen Petrovic (1991-93 New Jersey Nets)."From what I saw today, China has a much better chance than its group rivals to reach the last eight. I can tell you because I know what all the teams are capable of and China is good enough to pass the first round and possibly the second round."Drawn in Group A at west Beijing's Wukesong Arena, where the 2008 Olympic tournament was staged, China will start its campaign against Cote d'Ivoire on Aug 31 before facing Poland and Venezuela.Qualifying for next year's Tokyo Olympics as the best Asian performer at the World Cup and trying to equal or even better the nation's best eighth-place finish are the goals for the host.Li Nan, head coach of China and a sharpshooter on the 2008 Olympics squad, said his young players gained plenty of confidence from the brave fight against Brazil, but still need to toughen up for the Cup challenge."The way we hung in there facing such an aggressive, fast and athletic opponent like Brazil was pretty pleasing," said Li. "We didn't manage to maintain the energy and focus throughout the four periods and this is where we need to improve."I feel like we have the confidence and strength to dare to win against some higher-ranked rivals."It was China's closest loss to Brazil, a sixth-place finisher at the 2014 worlds in Spain, in 25 years.According to FIBA's latest Cup power ranking, 14th seed China is predicted to top Group A by winning all three first-round games.The top two teams in each group will then be drawn into four new groups to fight for the quarterfinal berths.However, a left ankle sprain sustained by Zhou against Brazil on Friday has cast a shadow on the host's prospects, even though an initial examination determined the injury is not serious.Zhou, who has returned to the CBA's Xinjiang Flying Tigers after being waived by the Houston Rockets in December, averaged 11.3 points, 10.8 rebounds and 2.3 blocks in four NBA Summer League games.TCL commitmentAs Team China prepares for the Cup challenge, fans and sponsors are also doing their part to rally the players. TCL, a Guangdong-based home appliance manufacturer, organized a mobilization ceremony for the host on Thursday in Guangzhou, where fans and its business partners interacted with the players, including Guo, Yi and Zhou.The company, a sponsor of China's national basketball program since 2009 and a FIBA partner, sent the team a scroll of Chinese calligraphy, which read, "Basketball enters China time", as a gift, and unveiled the "General Cup", the trophy TCL designed for the Player of the Game award at the tournament.To enhance consumers' game-watching experience, the brand has also launched a series of Cupthemed products featuring artificial intelligence, QLED technology and large-sized screens.

                    Chinese police to join Croatia tourist patrol
                </p>
            </a>

                Officers' visit strengthens ties between countries, supports visitors from homeChinese tourists in Croatia could be in for a surprise when they see police from their homeland patrolling the streets this summer.For the second year running, Chinese police officers will be joining their fellow professionals in the popular southern European tourist destination, on the streets of the capital Zagreb, the historic walled city of Dubrovnik, tourist resort Zadar, and Croatia's biggest county, Lika-Senj.Croatia has been running the Safe Tourism Season project since 2006, when officers from Hungary became the first overseas law enforcement officials invited to take part, and since then more than 800 officers from 19 countries have come to assist their Croatian counterparts at the height of the tourist season, undergoing special localized training before starting patrols.In addition to the helpful presence of familiar officers on the streets, Chinese tourists will also be able to benefit from special telephone support lines set up in the regions where Chinese police are deployed, with them answering the calls.In 2018, there were six officers from China and this year there will be eight among a record 804 officers from 19 countries.Croatia, which was part of the former Yugoslavia and is situated in southeastern Europe, on the Adriatic Sea, is proving an increasingly popular destination for Chinese visitors.Already in the first half of the year, there has been a 53 percent rise in the number of Chinese visitors to the ancient Roman port of Split, and a 20 percent increase in numbers going to Zagreb."Chinese tourists are mostly interested in historical and cultural monuments and sightseeing of the Upper Town," said Zagreb Tourist Board spokeswoman Darja Dragoje.International police organization Interpol has praised the Safe Tourism Season initiative as an example of the best international police practice, and China's ambassador in Zagreb, Xu Erwen, said the inclusion of Chinese police in the project confirmed traditional friendship and cooperation.A generation on from the brutal war that broke out in the aftermath of the collapse of the former Yugoslavia, the countries of the Balkan region are proving to be of increasing interest to China, in a variety of ways.Chinese tourists can travel visa-free to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and have become an important part of the country's tourism industry. In 2018, official statistics revealed a 118.7 percent increase in the number of Chinese visitors to the capital city, Sarajevo, and a rise of 114.5 percent in overnight stays on the previous year. Earlier this year, a museum and walking tour dedicated to the 1972 film Valter brani Sarajevo (Walter Defends Sarajevo), which is hugely popular in China, were opened.A similar visa-free arrangement between China and another of the former Yugoslav states, Serbia, has seen a steep increase in the number of Chinese students choosing to study in the country's universities.Croatia and Slovenia are the only parts of the former Yugoslavia that are currently members of the European Union, but the wider Balkan region is of increasing interest to China economically because of the Belt and Road Initiative, and its proximity to the frontier between Europe and Asia.Over the past two and a half years, China's Premier Li Keqiang has had five meetings with Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic, most recently in April when he attended a meeting of the heads of state or government of Central and Eastern European Counties in Dubrovnik.

                Popular TV drama The Longest Day in Chang'an, which was shot in the ancient Chinese city of Xi'an in Shaanxi province, has made the city a tourist hot spot.Thousands of tourists have been thronging this city to experience the magnificence and grandeur of its scenic spots that have been portrayed in a fascinating manner in the TV serial.In the first week of this month, online enquiries about flight ticket bookings to Xi'an recorded a 130-percent year-on-year spike, said Ctrip, China's largest online travel agency."Xi'an had been a hot tourist destination ever since the TV drama became popular. The serial portrays the prosperity of the Tang dynasty (618-907) of Xi'an. This has made the city even more popular. The media exposure makes those sites compelling choices for vacations," said Shao Jihong, senior director of flight ticketing operations at Ctrip.It's not just Xi'an that is reaping the benefits of exposure via mass media content.Suzhou, Chongqing and Bayanbulak Grassland have also become go-to destinations for domestic tourists as films such as Pegasus and TV dramas such as All Is Well were set or shot there.This trend of Chinese tourists thronging places featured in entertainment is extending to even destinations abroad.For instance, Japanese animation fantasy Spirited Away has led many viewers in China to visit Japan.Southeastern European country Croatia has benefited from the popular Game of Thrones series. In fact, the "Game of Thrones effect" on Croatian tourism and the nation's economy has been significant, following the screening of the drama over the past eight years.

                    Real Madrid cancel Gareth Bale's transfer to China
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                British soccer superstar Gareth Bale's mooted transfer to Chinese side Jiangsu Suning has been cancelled, after the player's current club Real Madrid reportedly called off the mega-money move.Over the weekend Bale looked set to become arguably the most high-profile foreign player to move to China, but issues over money and timing are believed to have stalled the deal.Jiangsu Suning was reportedly reluctant to offer in excess of $60 million for the player, meaning Real Madrid would have suffered a heavy loss on the world-record 100.8 million-euro ($112.1 million) fee the club paid for Bale in 2013. The rapidly narrowing Chinese Super League transfer window, which closes on Wednesday, is also thought to have been an issue.On Monday morning, Jiangsu Suning announced the purchase of Croatian striker Ivan Santini from Dutch club Anderlecht, pouring cold water on any chance of a resurrection of the Bale deal. The signing means the club has now registered six foreign players over the course of the season, which is the limit under Chinese Super League, or CSL, regulations.Several clubs in Europe are thought to have expressed interest in Bale, but his high wage bill has been a sticking point, with few teams on the continent willing to equal or better his 600,000 pound ($739,000) weekly salary. Jiangsu Suning emerged as a front-runner to secure the Welshman's services last week and was reportedly prepared to offer him a staggering 1 million pound-weekly wage, before the deal fell apart.Viewed as one of the best attacking players of his generation, 30-year-old Bale would have been a massive attraction in the CSL. In the past the league acted as a destination for international players in the twilight of their careers, though in recent years several foreign footballers in their prime have made the move to the CSL, including 27-year-old Brazilian midfielder Oscar, who transferred to Shanghai SIPG from Chelsea in 2016.Several decorated foreign managers have also opted for moves to the CSL, including ex-Liverpool and Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez, who has overseen four wins, one draw and one loss since joining CSL side Dalian Yifang in early July.Bale has accrued an impressive collection of honors since moving to Spain from English Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur six years ago, including four Champions League medals, a La Liga title, and a Copa Del Rey medal. Bale has scored three times from open play in Champions League finals for Real Madrid, including two strikes in the 2018 tournament final that helped secure a record 13th title in the competition for the Spanish club.But the player has suffered several injuries and missed more than 100 games during the last six years. Bale has also been forced to play out of his favored position due to the club's preferred formation and the presence of prodigious Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who played for Madrid throughout Bale's tenure before moving to Juventus last season.Despite the crucial role Bale has played in securing trophies for the club, he has struggled to win over fans, who have grown frustrated with his injuries and perceived slow progress in assimilating to Spanish culture. Bale has also fallen out of favor with Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane, who said this month that it will be "best for everyone" if the player leaves the club."The club is looking to sell him," Zidane said two weeks ago. "I hope it's done soon, for his sake too. We are talking with another club where he could play and that's the situation we are in right now."

                    Suning's Santini signing extinguishes buzz over Bale
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Welsh superstar's proposed Jiangsu move is off as agent blames MadridThe arrival of any foreign player to the Chinese Super League can usually be guaranteed to generate varying degrees of fanfare and excitement from media and fans alike.Monday's announcement that journeyman Croatian striker Ivan Santini had joined Jiangsu Suning, however, elicited only disappointment and a sense of anti-climax.With Santini's capture filling Suning's foreign-player quota, the signing signaled the end of the Nanjing-based club's highly publicized pursuit of Welsh superstar Gareth Bale.Eagerly anticipated as a massive coup for Suning and the CSL, the deal reportedly would have netted Bale an eye-popping weekly salary of $1.25 million and shifted global glare onto the league like never before.Instead, Suning has made do with the little-known Santini from Belgian club Anderlecht. Both he and Bale are 30 years old, but there the similarities end－and the gulf in class and star power could hardly be greater.On Monday, Bale's agent, Jonathan Barnett, attempted to exonerate his client from any blame for the collapse of the deal."Stories suggesting that Gareth or his family were the reason the deal did not take place are completely false," Barnett told Sky Sports, responding to Spanish reports that Bale's wife was not so keen on relocating to China.It is widely believed Madrid president Florentino Perez was the real reason the move collapsed. Perez reportedly would not agree to Bale, who is contracted at the Bernabeu until 2022, leaving for free or for a relatively nominal fee.The transfer fee or lack of it had been key to the move, given that Suning would have to pay a 100 percent tax in line with CSL rules on imports.The abrupt end to Bale's proposed move was all the more surprising given Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane had left it in no doubt he wanted the Welsh winger gone, saying before a preseason match last week that Bale's departure "would be best for everyone".Zidane's very public disdain for Bale drew fresh criticism from Barnett on Monday."It's simple, Zidane doesn't like Gareth. There's no relationship between them. There never has been," the agent said."Zidane is a disgrace; he shows no respect for a player that has done so much for Real Madrid."Barnett is not the only one somewhat perplexed at Bale's treatment at Madrid. Since signing from Tottenham for a then world-record fee of around $105 million in 2013, Bale has won four Champions League titles, scoring in two finals－most memorably when his spectacular overhead kick floored Liverpool in the 2018 decider.Still, Bale remains ostracized by Madrid fans and Zidane, and has now been omitted from the Real squad for Tuesday's preseason match against Spurs in Munich.The Spanish giant said on its website that Bale would instead train with injured teammate Luka Jovic.Speculation over Bale's future will now inevitably rumble on, but finding a club willing to match his $800,000 weekly salary could be a major stumbling block.At the time of the writing, rumors continued to swirl that another CSL club, Beijing Guo'an, might still swoop for Bale before the Chinese transfer window shuts on Wednesday.Bayern Munich, Spurs, Manchester United and Liverpool have all been linked with Bale in recent months, although Anfield manager Jurgen Klopp all but ruled out a Reds move last week, telling Sky Sports: "Bale is a Real Madrid player; if he leaves he will be outstandingly expensive, with big wages."It's not just about him. You have to create a team. A team is not a collection of individuals. We are not going for these single players and hoping they will solve the future for us."A more probable destination would be Paris Saint-Germain, especially if Neymar gets his way and returns to Barcelona.Meanwhile, back at Suning, coach Cosmin Olaroiu will hope that despite his low profile, Santini can hit the ground running to boost the fifth-placed team's chances for a top-four finish and possible qualification for the Asian Champions League.The 6-foot-2 forward, who has five Croatian caps, netted 16 times for Anderlecht last term and has also been prolific in recent seasons for Belgian clubs Standard Liege and Kortrijk, as well as Caen in France.With Argentine Gabriel Paletta expected to leave Suning, Santini completes the team's four-man overseas player quota, along with fellow new arrival Miranda, Alex Teixeira (both Brazilians) and Italian Eder.

                ZHENGZHOU, China - No.1 seed Karolina Pliskova beat Croatian Petra Martic 6-3, 6-2 to win the women's singles title of Zhengzhou Open on Sunday, claiming a Tour-leading fourth title of the year.The final of the Premier event delayed by about 6 hours because of rain, which perhaps put off Pliskova, and she lost the first two games. The third game was stopped by rain, which was a turning point of the match, and Pliskova won the 12 of next 15 games."I think not really good start for me, so I was just struggling a little bit.

But somehow I managed, even the break which we had when it was 2-0 I think it helped me just to stay calm," Pliskova said."Of course the weather you cannot really change, so that was I think the biggest trouble of this week. But otherwise, I won, so I'm not going to complain about anything here," she added."I think I was since I came back, I was just improving with every season and this one has been the best so far and the most consistent. I think my level, my game is raising and my fitness level is also getting better, so I can keep it up for longer without big drops. So I think this was the key for me to kind of keep playing consistently," Martic said.Zhengzhou Open is the only Premier event of WTA in China with a total prize of 1.5 million dollars.
