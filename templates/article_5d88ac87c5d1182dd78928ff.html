                Global concern over Amazon fires escalates
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Brazil reports record number of wildfires in first 8 months of this yearBRASILIA, Brazil - Record-breaking forest fires in Brazil's Amazon rainforest are dealing a heavy blow to Brazil and have evolved into a crisis arousing international attention.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on social media about the devastating fires that have devoured swathes of forests in the Amazon: "In the midst of the global climate crisis, we cannot afford more damage to a major source of oxygen and biodiversity. The Amazon must be protected."Earlier this month, Brazil declared a state of emergency over the rising number of fires in the region.The number of forest fires in Brazil increased by 82 percent from January to August in 2019 compared to the same period last year, the country's National Institute for Space Research, or Inpe, said on Monday.According to Inpe, 71,497 forest fires were registered in the country in the first eight months of 2019, up from 39,194 in the same period in 2018.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Wednesday blamed nongovernmental organizations for increasing wildfires in the Amazon rainforest in the country's north, but his claim was refuted by environmentalists, who argued that the surge of fires was a result of increasing deforestation and burning fueled by the government's anti-environmental policy.This was echoed by Inpe researcher Alberto Setzer, who told local news site G1 that all the fires are the result of human activities, while some were accidental and others were intentional.Calling the fires an international emergency, French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday expressed his concern over the rampant fires and called for a discussion of the issue at the upcoming G7 summit."Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rainforest - the lungs which produces 20 percent of our planet's oxygen - is on fire," Macron said on social media.Amid growing international criticism over the alarming wildfires in the Amazon, a vital bulwark against climate change, Brazilian President Bolsonaro on Thursday admitted farmers could be illegally setting the rainforest ablaze but told Western powers not to interfere.Bolsonaro said on social media: "I regret that Macron seeks to make personal political gains in an internal matter for Brazil and other Amazonian countries. The sensationalist tone he used does nothing to solve the problem."Bolsonaro also accused media organizations of exploiting the fires to undermine his government."Most of the media wants Brazil to end up like Venezuela," he said, referring to political and economic turbulence in the neighboring South American country.Problems 'exaggerated' Onyx Lorenzoni, the president's chief of staff, earlier in the day accused European countries of exaggerating environmental problems in Brazil in order to disrupt its commercial interests."There is deforestation in Brazil, yes, but not at the rate and level that they say," said Lorenzoni, Brazilian news website globo.com reported.His allegation came after Germany and Norway, citing Brazil's apparent lack of commitment to fighting deforestation, decided to withhold more than $60 million in funds earmarked for sustainability projects in Brazilian forests.Satellite images showed smoke from the Amazon reaching across the Latin American continent to the Atlantic coast and Sao Paulo, Brazil's biggest city, according to the World Meteorological Organization.Federal prosecutors in Brazil's Amazon region had launched investigations of increasing deforestation, according to local media. Prosecutors said they plan to probe possible negligence by the national government in the enforcement of environmental codes.The emergency has now transcended Brazil's borders, reaching Peruvian, Paraguayan and Bolivian regions.The Chilean government on Thursday offered support for Brazil in the battle against the Amazon forest fires that set in more than two weeks ago. "We have the experience, we have very good technicians, professionals and forest guards, and we have to be very supportive with a country that is going through a bad moment," Chilean Minister of Agriculture Antonio Walker said.Xinhua - Agencies

                    Paraguay president offers resignation to become senator

            <p class="style-content">
                 ASUNCION -- Paraguay's outgoing President Horacio Cartes offered his resignation on Monday so that he can take office as a senator on July 1.In his resignation letter presented to the president of the national congress, Cartes reiterated his aim to serve Paraguay and its people with dignity and patriotism as senator."I have taken this decision to fulfill the democratic decision of the Paraguayan people expressed at the ballot box on April 22, when they elected me to the rank of senator...for 2018-2023," he wrote.Cartes also announced his decision on Twitter. "I have presented my resignation of the position of President of the Republic of Paraguay in order to continue serving my country from the Senate."Cartes has been president since August 2013. However, his election to the rank of senator has been contested by the opposition as violating the Constitution, where Article 189 mandates that former presidents can only be inactive senators, namely able to speak in Congress but unable to vote.Now, the Senate will analyze Cartes' letter and decide whether to accept his resignation or not. Should they accept it, Cartes would become senator on July 1.His vice-president, Alicia Pucheta, would become the first female president of Paraguay until August 15, when president-elect, Mario Abdo Benitez, takes over.If the resignation is rejected, Cartes will remain in office until August 15 and his political future will be in the hands of the next Congress.

                    Chinese enterprises reaffirm long-term commitment in Brazil

            <p class="style-content">
                SAO PAULO - Chinese enterprises investing in Brazil reaffirmed on Wednesday their long-term commitment during a panel discussion on China-Brazil business cooperation under the Brazil 2018 Investment Forum held here.Business representatives from both sides praised the rapidly increasing Chinese investment in the South American country while discussing ways to deepen cooperation during the event sponsored by the Brazil-China Business Council.Chang Yunbo, vice-president of the China Communications Construction Company Ltd (CCCC) South America, called on Brazilian businesses to plan for long-term bilateral cooperation as their Chinese partners do, and to deal in the Brazilian and Chinese currencies instead of the US dollar, which he believes increases operational costs.Qu Yang, vice-president of the Brazilian branch of China's State Grid, stressed the need for the Brazilian government to integrate the country's renewable energy generating capacity into transmission lines.He said Brazil's wind and solar power generation capacity amount to that of two or three Brazilian-Paraguayan Itaipu dam hydroelectric plants combined, adding that the different ways of production are complementary in Brazil's power supply.Speaking at the panel, Carlos Zanvettor, CEO of Rio Bravo of China's Fosun Group, briefed on his company's business expansion strategy, noting a service focus on Brazil's middle income groups.Jorge Arbache, secretary for international affairs at the Brazilian Ministry of Planning, Development and Management, commended the bilateral Brazil-China Fund, which provides $20 billion for cooperation projects, as a new cooperation model.Santiago Mourao, secretary-general for international cooperation and promotion at the Foreign Ministry, expressed hope for new partnerships and more opportunities stemming from a long-term commitment by Chinese enterprises in Brazil.

                    Egypt ask for investigation into referee in Russia defeat
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                MOSCOW - The Egyptian Football Association confirmed on Friday that they will launch a formal protest against the work of Paraguayan referee, Enrique Caceres and his team of assistants during their game against Russia in Saint Petersburg on Tuesday.The 3-1 defeat to the Russians means the Egyptians were knocked out of the World Cup and that their final Group A match against Saudi Arabia on June 25th has nothing to play for."We want an investigation into the performance of the whole refereeing team," Egyptian Football Association president Hany Abo Rida commented in the media.Rida said he felt defender Ahmed Fathi was pushed when he put the ball into the own net to open the scoring at the first half and that Egypt should have been given a second penalty in the game when striker Marwan Moshen went down in the Russia area in the 78th minute with score 3-1."The referee should have used VAR (the Video Assistant Referee system) to check and award the penalty. They should have also seen that Fathi had been pushed,' said Rida, who added it was Egypt's "right," to ask for an investigation.Rida also asked Egyptian supporters for understanding after their World Cup, where they were without the injured Mohamed Salah for their opening game against Uruguay, in a match where they played well only to lose to a last-minute Jose Gimenez header.They also performed well in the first 45 minutes against the Russians before Fathi's own goal undid their good work and put the hosts on their way to victory."I know people in Egypt are not happy with our results, but it is our first tournament in 28 years and we lacked experience,' he explained.

                    De Boer finds Southern comfort
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Hard-luck coach takes reins of MLS champion AtlantaMARIETTA, Georgia - Frank de Boer was fired by Inter Milan after less than three months on the job.He lasted just four Premier League games at Crystal Palace.Now, after two short-lived coaching stints, de Boer has a chance to revive his career in the Deep South with the champion of Major League Soccer.The longtime stalwart of the Dutch national team has taken over at Atlanta United, which won the MLS Cup in just its second season in the league.De Boer said it is a shot at redemption, while also stressing that his chances of success are much greater in North America."Of course, you have to learn from your mistakes, but also about organizations that aren't good and organized and structured like Atlanta United," he said at a Monday media conference at the team's suburban training facility.De Boer spoke disparagingly of his two previous employers, Inter and Palace, adding: "There was no cohesion between all the departments. Everything was separate. Now, we have a feeling, 'OK, I don't have to look around for the dead body in the closet or behind the closet.' Everything is very clear and structured."The former Barcelona and Ajax defender represented his country 112 times on the field, memorably delivering a sublime 60-yard pass to set up Dennis Bergkamp's winner against Argentina in the closing minutes of a 1998 World Cup quarterfinal.He moved into coaching after his playing career ended, leading Amsterdam giant Ajax to a record four straight Dutch top-flight titles.Taking over at Inter Milan in 2016, de Boer failed to match the success he had in his native country. The Italian club struggled in Serie A and the Europa League, leading to his firing on Nov 1 with the club mired in 12th place.His tenure lasted just 85 days.The following summer, de Boer was hired by Crystal Palace. Despite modest expectations - the south London team avoided relegation by just five points the previous season - he was quickly fired again after the Eagles became the first team in 93 years to lose its first four matches in the top flight without scoring.Atlanta United is in a much different position, having quickly become MLS' flagship franchise on and off the field.The team has a clear power structure led by owner Arthur Blank, team president Darren Eales and technical director Carlos Bocanegra - a setup that was appealing to de Boer."For me, that is so much easier," he said. "The five and a half seasons that I was working for Ajax as a head coach it cost me less energy than the eight months at Inter and Crystal Palace. I was already starting to get gray hairs."De Boer certainly has some big shoes to fill.In two years as United's coach, Tata Martino instilled an attacking style of play that was a big hit with the fans and hugely successful on the field.The club averaged more than 53,000 per game this season, easily eclipsing its own record, and thrilled the city by capturing the MLS Cup championship in December.Martino stepped down to take over as Mexico's national coach.The expectations remain the same."Everybody expects a lot from Atlanta United," de Boer said. "That's normal when you're a champion."De Boer's team is still a work in progress. MVP runner-up Miguel Almiron was expected to transfer to English Premier League struggler Newcastle during the January window, but no deal has been reached. The 24-year-old Paraguayan reported for the start of Atlanta's training camp on Monday.River Plate star Pity Martinez announced last month he had a deal to come to Atlanta, supposedly as Almiron's replacement in midfield, but that's on hold for the moment.United already has three designated players who are exempt from the salary cap: Almiron, record-setting scorer and league MVP Josef Martinez and 19-year-old Ezequiel Barco.Less than six weeks removed from its MLS Cup triumph, Atlanta reported for camp to begin preparing for its first appearance in the CONCACAF Champions League.The team opens with a home-and-home series against Costa Rican club Herediano late next month, just ahead of the MLS season opener.Atlanta is eager to become the first MLS club to win the continental championship since the league format began in 2008. Mexican teams have won 10 straight titles, including Chivas' thrilling victory over Toronto FC last year that came down to penalty kicks."We need to have an MLS club win it," Eales said. "It would be great if that could be Atlanta United."But pulling off a CONCACAF title, while also maintaining domestic success, presents a daunting challenge for the new coach. Toronto put its emphasis on winning the Champions League and wound up missing the MLS playoffs."We're not naive. We saw what happened to Toronto," Eales said. "It's going to be tough."Associated Press

                    Targeting Latin America
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                A major push is now on to take contemporary Chinese literature to an untapped audience, Yang Yang reports.On July 10, 2017, around 300 locals gathered at Medellin Public Library, the venue for the Medellin International Festival of Poetry in Colombia, to listen to recitations by many poets.After Chinese poet Zhou Sese read her poem Zuihou De Tiwen (The Last Body Temperature), Leo Munoz, a Colombian poet, started reading the Spanish version that was translated by Sun Xintang, deputy director of the Confucius Institute Latin American Regional Center.In the packed hall, 41-year-old Sun stood beside Zhou and Munoz.It was a poem Zhou had dedicated to her mother who died a year earlier. It started with "Mom's body is still warm/Only if my mom's body/Is warm/I still have mom".As Munoz read on, Sun raised his head to look at the audience, and found tears running down Paraguayan poet Shirley Villalba's face. She was in the first row, and behind her, some other members of the audience were also wiping their eyes.After the recitation, applause broke out, and people, young and old, men and women, came to hug Zhou."I was deeply touched by the scene. The empathy, which transcended geographical boundaries, cultural differences and language, was established through the poem, and with my translation," says Sun, recounting his participation in the poetry festival.He started working for the Confucius Institute in Latin America six years ago.Sun says there is a big "trade deficit" of literature between China and Spanish- or Portuguese-speaking Latin American countries.

                    EU strikes free trade pact with Mercosur bloc

            <p class="style-content">
                The deal will save European companies over $4.52 billion in tariffs at the border European Union leaders hailed their "historic" free trade agreement with a South American trade bloc Mercosur, reached on Friday after 20 years of talks, despite strong opposition from some in the farm sector and environment groups.The agreement covers a population of 780 million and will save European companies more than 4 billion euros ($4.52 billion) in tariffs at the border, four times as much as EU-Japan free trade agreement that went into force on Feb 1, according to an announcement by the European Commission.Mercosur includes four countries: Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. It has a population of 264 million with a GDP about one-eighth that of the EU.The four Mercosur governments, the 28 EU national governments and the European Parliament must ratify the deal before it takes effect."I measure my words carefully when I say that this is a historical moment," European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said."Today's agreement brings Europe and South America closer together in a spirit of cooperation and openness," said European Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmstrom.Under the deal, EU exports will enjoy sharp tariff reductions on goods such as cars, wine and other industrial goods, as Mercosur is committing to withdraw current high tariffs on cars (35 percent), machinery (up to 20 percent) and chemicals (up to 18 percent).Mercosur, established in 1991 and headquartered in Montevideo, Uruguay, aims to increase exports of farm products. The four countries will get a new total 99,000-ton quota of beef at a 7.5 percent tariff, phased in over five years, along with tariff-free 180,000 ton quotas each for sugar and poultry exports.The EU is among Mercosur's top trade and investment partners and the first major partner to ink a trade deal.Mercosur leaders praised the deal. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said on Twitter that the deal was historic and one of the most important trade agreements of all time. Argentine President Mauricio Macri said that it would "contribute enormous benefits to Argentine workers and companies". Paraguayan President Mario Abdo and the Uruguayan government also welcomed the deal.However, farmers in France and some other EU member states have expressed concern about the possible negative impact of a sharp rise in beef and sugar imports from the Mercosur countries.Copa-Cogeca, a union representing farmers at EU level, criticized the deal on Twitter. "The imports of #Mercosur's agricultural goods will de facto establish double standards and unfair competition for some key European production sectors, putting their viability at stake," it said.EU Agricultural Commissioner Phil Hogan said that he recognized the concerns of farmers, including from his country of Ireland, but he expressed that the agreement as a whole was opening markets for EU farmers.The EU and Mercosur launched their negotiations 20 years ago. They stepped up their efforts to strike a deal after US President Donald Trump's presidential victory prompted the EU to freeze talks with the US on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership trade pact and look for other global trading allies.Since 2014, the EU has concluded trade agreements with 15 countries, including Japan and Canada. "This agreement adds four more countries to our impressive roster of trade allies," said Malmstrom.Euronews and Politico.eu contributed to the story.

                    Paraguayan FM, ambassador resign over secret deal with Brazil

            <p class="style-content">
                ASUNCION - Paraguay's Foreign Minister Luis Alberto Castiglioni, and its ambassador to Brazil Hugo Saguier Caballero resigned on Monday in the wake of the fallout from a secret energy deal with Brazil.Paraguay's President Mario Abdo Benitez accepted their resignation amid public outcries over the bilateral agreement that was reached in May but only made public recently, after parts of the deal were leaked last week.The energy purchase agreement centered on the Itaipu hydroelectric plant which straddles the two countries, and had been criticized as harmful and costly for Paraguay.Two other officials -- the Paraguayan Director of Itaipu Binacional Jose Alberto Alderete and President of the National Electricity Administration (ANDE) Alcides Jimenez -- have also resigned. Jimenez was just recently appointed to the job.ANDE's former President Pedro Ferreira had quit in protest of the agreement.The bilateral accord, which established Paraguay's purchasing timeline from Itaipu through 2022, was signed on May 24 and never officially made public.Following the scandal, Castiglioni said on Sunday that the government would ask Brazil to nullify the agreement."I regret that this misunderstanding has led to such a state of discontent. Everything we did was transparent and for the benefit of the country," Castiglioni said via Twitter.He and the others who resigned said they would appear before the congress to explain their actions.Government spokesman Hernan Huttemann said the president will announce his new appointments later in the week.
