                No move on Chinese monetary policy after Fed rate cut
            </a>
            <p>
                China did not immediately use the latest United States interest rate cut as an opportunity to ease domestic monetary policy as the current rate level is adequate and liquidity ample following a recent injection of funds, analysts said. But they expect the People's Bank of China, the central bank, to support the market in other ways by possibly lowering the base interest rate of banks' new loans soon to reduce costs for corporate clients. "For China, prudent monetary policy is basically appropriate at present as indicated by major financial data in August, such as improved aggregate social financing and the growth rate of the broad money supply," said Sheng Songcheng, former head of the PBOC statistics and analysis department.
