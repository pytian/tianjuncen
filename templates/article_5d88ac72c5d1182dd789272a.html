                THE DOCUMENTARY AMERICAN FACTORY shows cooperation and communication can overcome various contradictions and divergences in business operations to achieve a win-win result in the era of globalization. China Youth Daily comments:The documentary recently went viral on the internet in China, sparking much discussion. It focuses on the flagship overseas factory of Fuyao Glass in the United States, and shows real scenes in the factory that highlight many profound issues related to the cultural differences between China and the US.When the founder of Fuyao Glass, Cao Dewang, decided to invest in the US, it drew a lot of attention. Under the framework of the international division of labor in the past few decades, seldom have enterprises of developing countries set up factories in developed countries. That is because the costs, especially labor costs in developed countries such as the US, are much higher than those in developing countries such as China.Because of this, it seemed a strange choice for a labor-intensive enterprise such as Fuyao Glass to build a factory in the US. But for Cao, the US has cost advantages in tax and logistics despite its higher labor costs, which made it worthwhile building a factory in the US.The documentary has recorded the entire process of the factory being built and how the factory operates. More important, it reflects how operators and workers with different cultural backgrounds are exploring a path of international cooperation.Frictions and contradictions can be seen everywhere in the documentary due to cultural differences. The US employees are not familiar with the collective model that is very common in Chinese factories, such as shouting out slogans and singing the theme song of the enterprise. The Chinese managers are not satisfied with the US workers' low efficiency compared with the Chinese workers.More important, whether the factory should establish a US-style labor union and how to balance workers' welfare and the enterprise's goal of reducing costs and improving efficiency are direct conflicts between the two parties.Despite all the frictions and conflicts, the factory has proved to be a success. It is not only profitable but also helps the local community solve its employment issue. The documentary demonstrates that cooperation and communication can achieve mutually beneficial results despite cultural differences.

                    Fuyao Glass helps bring back small city in Ohio
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                In December 2008, amid the financial crisis that swept the globe, General Motors abandoned a manufacturing plant in Moraine, Ohio, where the automobile giant and its subsidiary Frigidaire had been producing vehicles and appliances for almost six decades. The shuttering left a huge void in the small Rust Belt city's labor market, as GM laid off about 1,000 workers.A decade later, a Chinese company has helped revive that local job market, bringing back more than 2,400 jobs and investing hundreds of millions of dollars.In 2014, Fuyao, the world's leading supplier of automotive glass, purchased part of GM's original plant in a roughly $450 million deal.The business did not start out particularly well, as the American plant posted a loss in 2016, its first year of operations. But the investment soon started to produce results, as the company has seen two consecutive years of profits, which increased 30 percent in 2018."We all thank the chairman for taking this business risk that has obviously paid off," said Niraj Antani, who represents the 42nd District in the Ohio House of Representatives, where Fuyao Glass America Inc is located, during a visit to Fuyao's plant on Wednesday."This plant stood empty for eight years before Fuyao came in," said Antani. GM had more than 4,000 workers at its peak."We are very happy Fuyao is doing so well. The story of this building is very important to the Dayton community. So the fact that Fuyao is coming in now and is very successful is great," he said. Moraine is located 6 miles south of Dayton, the big city in the region.In 2018, Fuyao posted a profit of more than $24 million.Jeff Liu, Fuyao Glass America's president and CEO, told China Daily that he expects that figure to double in 2019.The company also has continued to invest in the Ohio plant. Besides an initial $600 million to establish the plant, the company invests $30 million to $40 million each year, focusing primarily on innovation, renovation and increasing productivity.More recently, after winning the auto glass business for Fiat-Chrysler SUVs, Fuyao invested $3 million in its Moraine plant.Products from that plant also can be found in a variety of automakers' vehicles, such as the Ford F-150, the BMW X-series, the Toyota RAV 4 and many others produced domestically.The Moraine plant has an annual capacity for 4 million original equipment manufacturer (OEM) glass sets a year and 0.5 million more units of aftermarket glass sets, according to Liu.Aside from the 2,400 jobs Fuyao America has directly created, Liu said the supply chain is generating thousands of additional jobs in the region, bringing the total number of jobs associated with Fuyao up to 6,000."The hiring they've done in the local community is also very important for our region," said Antani, adding that the factory's jobs support 2,400 families."From the government perspective, that's also 2,400 new taxpayers, who are contributing to the city of Moraine that struggled after GM left," he said. Antani said that the city is now seeing a boon from taxes paid by Fuyao employees.In a broader sense, Montgomery County, where Moraine is situated, and the state of Ohio also are benefiting in various ways from the thousands of additional jobs, including sales-tax revenue, as the families spend their money, according to Antani, who called it a "win-win" situation for workers, Fuyao, China and the US."Economically, it really helped our community," said Jamie Hoskins, operation shift manager at Fuyao America.As a local resident who formerly worked at a steel plant, Hoskins said he had heard great things about the company, saw the good management there, and is also enjoying better pay and a safe working environment."I feel like a part of the family already," said Hoskins, who joined the company about a month ago and saw most of the employees were from the local community."Couldn't be happier," Hoskins said.Chuck Marr, 63, who has worked at Fuyao for more than three years and used to own a business serving the former GM plant, has gotten several promotions and is now a supervisor for an aftermarket glass-production group.He especially likes the company's performance-based evaluation system that differs from other companies like GM."The harder you work, the more you can learn, the better you can advance," he said, observing that the growth potential is making Fuyao attractive to younger generations.Such promotion and talent-cultivation is a way for Fuyao to attract employees and reduce turnover, which Liu identified as the biggest challenge facing the booming plant.The company has organized team-building events and offers benefits, such as awarding outstanding employees a chance to visit China.It also has established training and incentive programs to decrease turnover and increase competitiveness. Those include the master training program, a one-on-one process that could lead to skill-based promotions, and the continuous improvement program, which awards individuals up to $3,000 if they make major contributions to the company.The local government also has offered help in providing workers. Relationships have been established between Fuyao and a local community college, with the participation of government agencies."Our interest is in job creation, is in supporting the companies," Antani said.Lawmakers in Ohio recently approved a 4 percent across-the-board personal income-tax cut and eliminated the bottom two tax brackets as part of the state budget. Antani said workers from Fuyao "will see that very soon"."One of our commitments as a community is how can we mitigate the risks to make it easier for them to do business," said Erik Collins, director of community and economic development for Montgomery County."Fuyao took a big risk in coming to the Dayton market" on the scale as it did, he said, and the region is dedicated to helping companies reduce risks and making itself business-friendly.JobsOhio, a local nonprofit organization dedicated to facilitating local economic development, singled out foreign direct investment (FDI) as a priority in 2018."We want more Fuyaos; we also want Fuyao to be able to do more," said Antani. "At the end of the day, what we want is for Fuyao to be able to have an environment in Ohio to grow, and also for other Chinese companies to be able to invest here."Antani identified automobiles, general manufacturing and agricultural manufacturing as industries that "do very well" in the Midwestern state. And he suggested Chinese companies follow Fuyao's lead and invest in the US.Antani and other local political leaders are extending invitations to Chinese companies despite the yearlong trade tensions between China and the US on the national level, which have just shown signs of relenting as a US trade delegation is in Shanghai for talks."Obviously our federal government and the Chinese government are going to work those issues out — I think it's important they do that," said Antani, who stressed that the local business bonds remain strong bilaterally."We know that we are a good market for Chinese products, but we are glad that the economics are changing in your country, so that you become an even better marketplace for us," said Phillip Parker, president and CEO of the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce, who looks to help more US companies expand their businesses in China, a country with an increasingly robust middle class.Parker said there also are major import and export opportunities.Ohio got more of its imports from China than any other country in 2018, and China was the state's third-largest export destination, according to the US Census Bureau."It's the relationship that will show both of our national leaders what these relationships can do between our countries," Antani said. "And as we know, trade brings good relationships. If we are trading with each other, our economies depend on each other, relationships will improve."

                A documentary about a Chinese-run factory in Ohio, backed by Barack and Michelle Obama's Netflix production company, is drawing praise for its realistic depiction of what happens when two different cultures meet in the workplace.The film American Factory, which debuted Wednesday, tells the story about Fuyao Glass' plant in Dayton, Ohio.In 2015, Fuyao moved into a shuttered General Motors plant and established its first manufacturing plant in the United States. It has become the world's largest auto-glass manufacturing site, with 2,000 local blue collar workers hired.The story unfolds with the integration and conflicts between Chinese management and technicians and American workers at the company, providing a window on the impact of globalization in the workplace.Directors Steven Bognar and Julia Reichert, a couple living in the Dayton area, filmed 1,200 hours of video over three years."People, like the people I grew up with, were not really seen in films, documentaries, on news. In the Midwest, in the heartland of America, you didn't hear from those folks," Reichert said."We want to give voice to people who don't appear on screen: working people, their stories, their struggles, their hopes. That should be on screen. Those (stories) should be out in the world, because that's as equally compelling as superheroes," said Bognar.The film premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. It was later acquired from Participant Media by Higher Ground Productions, the Obamas' Netflix production company, becoming the first release by the former first couple as producers.In a 10-minute conversation, the Obamas talked with the directors about the documentary and the importance of storytelling."One of the many things I love about this project that you two did together is that you let people tell their own story," the former first lady said in a video American Factory: A Conversation with the Obamas released on Netflix with the film Wednesday."The American Factory doesn't come in with a perspective. It's not an editorial. You truly let people speak for themselves. And that is a powerful thing that you don't always see happen," she praised."What I was struck by was they (workers) exhibited a lot more trust than I would've expected. I think one of the things that makes the movie powerful is the fact that it's not all black-and-white. There's a bunch of gray," said former US president Barack Obama.In the opening scenes of the film, genuine attempts by Chinese and American employees to build teamwork appear to bear some fruits.Local residents in the post-Industrial Era expressed their gratitude about an opportunity to get a job with a decent paycheck and have a chance to learn the latest glass-production technology.The workers appear to grow closer via teaching and learning, fishing, horseback riding and celebrating Thanksgiving together.But as the company grew alarmed by heavy financial losses, management switched to a more market-oriented strategy, with a more efficient working mechanism, which led to a difference of opinions at the factory."I never thought a documentary on an American manufacturing plant would be so interesting," said one commenter on the film's IMDB page. "Extremely interesting insight into the world of manufacturing in small-town USA as well as the cultural differences between the USA and China. The whole trip to the China factory seems surreal."The Chinese in the film, who go by a creed of diligence and simplicity, appear willing to sacrifice rest time for better work results.Many American workers, however, who believe in individualism, consider work-life balance to be paramount, viewing time on the job as a way to make money to enjoy life more."Admittedly, in the early days, it was exciting, these cultures coming together. And you see that in the film," Bognar said. "There's a lot of optimism. And we were there. And as things got hard, we were still there. We were lucky, people trusted us with their story, and we tried to represent them, and that's a huge responsibility.""The documentary is informative, and I can tell that the whole shooting process was really transparent," said Leo Chan, executive director of the Midwest USA Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Cincinnati, Ohio, who attended a screening ceremony on Tuesday.Chan said he could see how the fast-changing external environment, such as a profit-driven market and automation replacing manpower, put pressure on interpersonal relationships at the company."No one can judge it clearly," he told China Daily.Chan said the film is a good example of the Sino-American cooperation process, "from the contact and blending of cultures between the two sides at the beginning, to conflict and friction. It is typical, and is a microcosm of Sino-US cooperation."In April, the film won the Best Documentary Feature Award at the RiverRun International Film Festival in North Carolina.And because American Factory also debuted in a few select theaters this week, it will be eligible for an Academy Award nomination next year, Fast Company reported.
