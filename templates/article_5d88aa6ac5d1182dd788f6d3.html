                UN envoys pay visit to Xinjiang to realize region's achievements
            </p>
            <p>
                URUMQI - A delegation of UN envoys from eight countries has visited the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region to gain a better understanding of the region's achievements, from de-radicalization to poverty eradication.The diplomats, who hailed from Yemen, Equatorial Guinea, Mozambique, Zambia, Cote d'Ivoire, South Africa, Ethiopia and Zimbabwe, visited Xinjiang between Aug 28 and Sept 1 upon the invitation of China's foreign ministry.The five-day tour brought them to the regional capital, Urumqi, as well as Hotan and Kashgar in southern Xinjiang, where they visited factories, bazaars, communities, mosques and vocational training centers.After landing at the Urumqi airport, the delegation took the subway to arrive at the city proper, where they visited a jade and jewelry industrial park that combines ancient craftsmanship and 3D printing, and a company that produces degradable packaging film.Lazaro Ekua Avomo, permanent representative of Equatorial Guinea to the United Nations Office at Geneva, was impressed by the urban and economic development of Urumqi."When I studied at Renmin University of China in Beijing from 1992 to 1998, I only knew Xinjiang was a remote, underdeveloped place. Now Urumqi strikes me as being no different from other big cities in China," Avomo said.In Hotan and Kashgar, the diplomats were introduced to a local campaign to reduce poverty with mushroom farming and several village-run garment factories. Amadeu Paulo Samuel da Conceicao, permanent representative of Mozambique to the UNOG, expressed hopes that Xinjiang's poverty relief model could be introduced to Africa.At the vocational education and training centers in Hotan and Kashgar, the envoys had face-to-face talks with students and teachers. They also visited one graduate's family and learned how the center helped an unemployed youngster brainwashed by religious extremism find a new job and build a happy family.Ali Mohamed Saeed Majawar, Yemen's permanent representative to the UNOG, praised the tour for giving them a better understanding of China's anti-terrorism measures."Poverty and terror are closely related, and there is no way for people to lead a prosperous and peaceful life in a place plagued by violence and terrorism," Majawar said. "It is therefore necessary to combat terrorism with education and vocational training."Da Conceicao called for anti-terrorism cooperation between China and Mozambique. He also advised Western countries that disagree with China's anti-terrorism efforts to come to see with their own eyes what China has achieved.Xinhua

                Rescue teams rise to the challenge
            </a>
            <p>
                Civilian groups play key role during emergenciesAfter a deadly earthquake struck Sichuan province last month, an emergency response system was quickly activated and work teams were sent to provide guidance in rescue and disaster relief as well as conduct safety inspections.The Ministry of Emergency Management acted promptly after the magnitude 6 quake hit Changning county, Yibin, on the night of June 17, killing 13 people and leaving 220 injured.Along with more than 500 firefighters sent by the government, hundreds of volunteers from civilian rescue teams joined the race against time to find survivors.Blue Sky Rescue, a nongovernmental humanitarian organization founded in Beijing in 2007, responded to the alert immediately and set up its own coordination center.Zhang Yong, captain and head of BSR, said experts from the center used an assessment process to gather data and deliver a general report on the quake within half an hour, including the possible damage and losses.At the same time, a local "information detection" team left for the disaster area to gain firsthand knowledge of the situation, Zhang said.The team arrived at the quake epicenter in Changning county to check conditions and gain a rough idea of casualties and property damage."We then relayed the information back to government departments as well as our own coordination center for further analysis and decisions," Zhang said. "If the situation were worse than we first thought, the advance team could also turn into a separate rescue squad to provide emergency assistance."Sometimes, the detection team may be the only source of information, especially when roads to a disaster area are blocked and communication signals are interrupted.After assessing the situation following last month's quake, BSR sent in teams that arrived on the scene within two to three hours. There was no urgent need for additional volunteers.Zhang said that after the devastating magnitude 8 earthquake in Wenchuan, Sichuan province in 2008, which killed nearly 70,000 people, the quality of housing construction in the province was strengthened and the emergency response mechanism further developed.At the time, the nation's volunteer rescue force began to grow rapidly, and according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, there are now more than 1,200 civilian rescue teams in China.

                Overfishing, climate sap Lake Malawi
            </a>
            <p>
                The African nation's fishing economy sharply vulnerable to climatic eventsSENGA BAY, Malawi - On the shores of Lake Malawi, a crowd eagerly awaits the arrival of a white and yellow cedarwood boat carrying its haul.The crew of six deliver a single net of chambo, sardine and tiny usipa fish from the boat, just one of 72 vessels that land their catch every day on the beach at Senga Bay.But overfishing and climate change have taken their toll.Hundreds of local traders gather each morning and afternoon at Senga only to find that fish populations are falling in Lake Malawi, Africa's third largest body of freshwater."We were hoping to catch a half-boat full or maybe a quarter-boat, ... but I'm afraid the fish are dwindling in numbers," port manager Alfred Banda said, staring wearily at the small catch as it was dragged onto the sand."Before, we used to catch a full boat but now we are struggling," he said, adding that a full boat would earn a team of between six and 12 fishermen about $300.Bordering three countries - Malawi, Tanzania and Mozambique - Lake Malawi stretches across more than 29,000 square kilometers with over 1,000 species of fish.The 14,000 people living at Senga Bay depend on the lake for food and for their livelihood."Seven years ago, there was lots more fish than today. In 2019 it is different, there's no fish in the water," said trader Katrina Male, a 40-year-old mother of six, as she stalked the nets of newly brought in fish seeking the best deal."The fish nowadays are more expensive, because they are becoming scarce," Male said. "Some children have stopped going to school because their parents can't find the money."'No alternative'For both locals and climate experts, declining fish numbers reflect a combination of environmental change and overfishing that augurs ill for the future.The World Bank ranks Malawi among the top 10 at-risk countries in Africa for climate change, with cyclones and floods among the major threats.Senga community leader John White Said said increasing gale force winds and torrential rains have made it harder for fishermen on the lake."Our men can't catch fish because of wind, which is much stronger than before," he said, adding that the rains are increasingly unpredictable on the lake."The rain before would not destroy houses and nature but now it comes with full power, destroying everything and that affects the water as well."According to USAID, the number of rainfall incidents in the aid-dependant country is likely to decrease - but each rainfall will be more intense, leading to droughts and floods.The threat was highlighted in March when Malawi was hit by torrential rains from Cyclone Idai, killing 59 people. The storm also cut a swathe through Mozambique and Zimbabwe, leaving nearly 1,000 dead.On top of the environmental impact, the number of fishermen in Senga has doubled in the last 10 years due to the lack of other jobs, Said said."There is no alternative to fishing."One of the few to benefit is 38-year-old boat owner Salim Jackson, who rents out his two vessels."I got into fishing 13 years ago because I had no other option, I never went to school. But it has brought me good money," he said.'Unsustainable practices'By sunset, the balls of fishing net lay stretched out on the beach and both buyers and fishermen negotiated prices.Traders take their purchases in buckets to makeshift reed tables to be dried, smoked, fried or boiled in preparation for the market."Declining fish catches are mainly due to unsustainable fishing practices," said Sosten Chiotha, a Malawian environmental science professor. "Overfishing is a challenge in Lake Malawi, but there are efforts on co-management and closed seasons to ensure that the fishery recovers."Chiotha added that climate change was hitting Malawi with "increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in the major ecosystems including lakes".That leaves Malawi's agriculture-based economy sharply vulnerable to climatic events and entrenched poverty heightens pressure on the environment.Wearing a black silk thawb robe and white kufi cap, Said stands tall on Senga beach, surveying the scene around him."I'm worried," he said. "In Malawi most people depend on fishing financially and as a cheap food source."The men have to cast their nets further and further away from the beach."Agence France-Presse

                Chinese-built bridge, roads in Mozambique boost local tourism
            </a>
            <p>
                A local district in the Mozambican province of Maputo has witnessed a tourism boom and the related income doubling, due to the easier access to its major resorts brought by the cross-sea suspension bridge and its link roads built and financed by China, district authorities said on Tuesday.Joao Tembe, head of a local administration of the district of Matutuine, told Radio of Mozambique that the increased number of tourists in the first six months of 2019 has allowed the government to collect over 1 million U.S. dollars revenue, compared to the half million in the same period of last year.The administrator said the increase in the tourists flow is a direct benefit brought by the Maputo-Katembe bridge and the 187 kilometers of road inaugurated in November."In the first half of this year we have 162,000 tourists, with the majority of them being South Africans, but there is also an increase in the number of domestic tourists," said Tembe.He said that this number is equivalent to an increase of 37.4 percent, and authorities have met more than half of the goal for tax collection."We have achieved more than half of our target, (at this pace) we might even go beyond it," Tembe told the national radio.Bordering the south with South Africa and the west with Eswatini (the former Swaziland), Matutuine is the southernmost district of Maputo Province, which is known for its major tourist attractions including Bela Vista, Elephant Reserve and Ponta d'Ouro.

                Chinese satellites help record global disasters
            </a>
            <p>
                Clear pictures of 24 catastrophic events shared with other countries and regionsChina has deployed its satellites to monitor more than 30 major natural disasters around the world since the start of last year, offering help to affected nations and regions, according to a key figure in the project.Guo Chaohui, a senior engineer at the China Center for Resources Satellite Data and Application, said on Sunday that the center arranged for Chinese satellites to take pictures and collect data from places that suffered from disasters upon receiving notification from the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters system and then provided the images to related nations and regions.Chinese satellites took clear pictures in 24 of the disasters, including an earthquake in Indonesia last year and a cyclone that ravaged South Africa and Mozambique in April. In the other cases, the satellites failed to generate images due to natural interference such as thick clouds, he said."Currently, there are five Chinese satellites－the Gaofen 1, 2, 3 and 4 high-resolution Earth-observation satellites as well as the weather satellite Fengyun 3C－that are available for duties under the charter," Guo said.Over the past two weeks, China's satellites took photographs of flood-stricken regions in India. China provided those images, together with previously taken pictures of the same places, to the Indian Space Research Organization to assist with the neighboring nation's recent flood relief efforts.Vivek Singh, a spokesman for the space research group, told Xinhua on Thursday that India appreciated China's help in the disaster-relief efforts and that such mutual assistance was a good example of international cooperation.As of Sunday, the death toll in India's flood-hit states had risen to more than 200. At least 11 million people have been directly affected.The International Charter on Space and Major Disasters is a worldwide collaboration platform, through which satellite data are made available for the benefit of disaster management. It has 61 contributing satellites operated by 17 charter members, including the European Space Agency and United States Geological Survey.China signed the charter in May 2007 and first called for assistance under the charter in July of that year when devastating floods ravaged central and eastern parts of the country, according to the China National Space Administration.To date, China has invoked the charter 24 times and obtained a significant amount of satellite data for post-disaster relief efforts, according to information published on the charter's website.The most recent time China activated the charter was in June last year when it asked for assistance to monitor a serious forest fire in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region.For its part, China has offered satellite images that have helped in many natural disasters, such as the forest fires in southeast Australia in 2009, floods afflicting Pakistan in 2010 and the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in 2011. The nation also assisted multinational efforts to search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in 2014, the Chinese space administration said.

                AU calls for more efforts on climate
            </a>
            <p>
                UN: Africa may be severely struck by the impacts, worsening povertyThe African Union has urged its member states to reinforce measures to address effects of climate change, environmental degradation and natural disasters, particularly in conflict-affected areas of the continent.The AU Peace and Security Council noted that natural disasters and climate change contribute to the tensions among communities, threaten access to vital resources and, disproportionately affect the most vulnerable.This call was made by the AU Peace and Security Council in a statement issued on Monday, following the council's recent session at the AU headquarters in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa.According to the United Nations, Africa is at the risk of being severely struck by the effects of climate change, due to its limited capacity to adapt, resulting from both its geography and widespread poverty.By 2020, between 75 million and 250 million people on the continent are projected to face water stress due to climate change. In the same year in some countries yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50 percent.Global warming of 2 C would put more than 50 percent of the continent's population at risk of undernourishment, the UN said. Climate change could lead to an annual loss of from 2 percent to 4 percent in GDP in the continent by 2040.Assuming international efforts keep global warming below an increase of 2 C, the UN states that the continent could face climate change adaptation costs of $50 billion per year by 2050.The AU council called on African countries to accelerate the implementation of the international agreements to lessen the effects of climate change.These agreements include the Paris Agreement, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.The AU particularly recommended the establishment of a 24-hour center to provide early warnings of impending natural disasters, with a view to further enhancing preparedness and responses.Jessica Gimo from Beira, Mozambique, noted at a recent meeting at the UN Environment Programme headquarters in Nairobi that catastrophes would be mitigated with information beforehand.Gimo was recounting her experience of Cyclone Idai which caused catastrophic damage when it battered parts of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi in March."In my view, the lack of information made the damage worse, because if the information had been passed in time, if they had informed us of the magnitude of the Cyclone, we would have made plans to move to safe cities. I believe that the situation would be different and maybe the damage would be minor," she said.The AU also emphasized the need for coordinated effort at national, regional and continental level in planning for natural disasters in Africa, in close coordination with the Regional Economic Communities or Regional Mechanisms.The AU Commission urged a close partnership with such UN agencies as the UN-Habitat, UN Environment Programme, the Africa Risk Capacity (ARC), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) was also highlighted.African countries should also draw lessons from Asian countries, including scientific and technical approaches to generate early warnings.
