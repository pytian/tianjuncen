                EAC states to harmonize vehicle emission standards
            </p>
            <p>
                Member states of the East African Community, or EAC, have agreed to harmonize vehicle emission standards to promote clean energy use.The agreement was reached at a recent EAC workshop at the United Nations offices in Nairobi, Kenya, which was attended by 40 representatives from government, oil and vehicle industry, academia, international development agencies, media and nongovernmental organizations. They came from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi.Better data collection and analysis of vehicle emissions profiles, health impact assessments, and economic implications of various technology are needed, participants concluded. Consumers also need to be encouraged to shift toward cleaner alternatives.For a start, annual vehicle inspection and testing of vehicles should be mandatory and standardized and government monitoring systems should be implemented.Participants agreed that the region should follow Euro 5 equivalent fuel standards and scrutiny of fuel emissions widened from lead and sulfur to include benzene, olefins and aromatics.Mikael Schuer, product manager at Scania, proposed a regional legislated emission level of Euro 3 as an absolute minimum demand."Euro 5 standard is our recommended alternative for all urban transports. It is a very robust technology and cost efficient, with very low-cost increase for the technology compared to Euro 3 standard. It can also cope with high sulfur levels without damaging the engine," he said.Schuer said the region should also demand all imported vehicles, new and used, be supplied with a certificate from the manufacturer."Organizations and international companies operating in the region should have a clear sustainability agenda by only purchasing transports from operators using vehicles fulfilling minimum Euro 3 standard," he said.Tanzania is spearheading the formulation and harmonization of standards on vehicular exhaust emission limits among other East Africa Standards.Philipo Makaro, an officer at Tanzania Bureau of Standards, said the working draft for the vehicle emissions has already been circulated to partner states and various comments have been collated to advance from working draft to committee draft."Kenya and Uganda have already provided their comments while Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan are yet to. Since all the EAC countries are in the process of revising their vehicle emission standards, it's important to harmonize them," he said.The draft covers all types of vehicles including passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, heavy-duty vehicles, and two-and four-stroke motorcycles and scooters."It's our hope that the harmonization process will incorporate all the requirements and limits acceptable to all partner states and act as the widely accepted regional standard," he said.

                Nairobi pledges to assist Chinese investors to set up base in Kenya
            </a>
            <p>
                NAIROBI -- Kenya on Tuesday pledged to assist Chinese investors from China's Zhejiang Province to set up base in the country.Betty Maina, principal secretary of Kenya's Ministry of Industry, Trade and Cooperatives said at a trade forum here that Kenya has identified Chinese investors as key partners in the country's journey to achieve economic development."The Kenya government commits to support investors from China's Zhejiang Province to establish their investments in Kenya," Maina said during the China's Zhejiang-Kenya trade and investment symposium that brought together the private sectors of Zhejiang Province and Kenya.A delegation of over 50 Chinese firms from Zhejiang Province are in Kenya to scout for investment and trade deals in the area of food processing, textiles and clothing, leather sector, construction, automobile, electrical and shipping industry.Maina said that the China-Kenya relationship spans 55 years and the Zhejiang-Kenya trade forum is important as it brings together the private sector of the two countries in an arrangement of signing a Memorandum of Understanding.She said that Chinese investors could play an instrumental role in implementing President Uhuru Kenyatta's Big Four Agenda of food security, affordable housing, universal healthcare and manufacturing and hence provide a win-win arrangement within the Belt and Road Initiative.Maina said that the business forum is intended to begin a new and long relationship and partnership between China's Zhejiang Province and Kenya.She observed that Kenya has one of the best investment destinations given its expansive market access.She noted that Kenya has preferential market access at the East Africa Community (EAC), Common Market for East and Southern Africa (COMESA), the United States as well as the European Union which Chinese investors can sell to after setting up factories in Kenya.She added that the Kenyan government considers the private sector as the engine of economic growth with the role of government to facilitate the growth of the private sector.Wang Xuezheng, counselor at the Chinese Embassy in Kenya said that Beijing and Nairobi have enjoyed excellent relations which has laid a strong foundation for growing cooperation in bilateral trade and investment.Anne Kirima, chairperson of Kenya Investment Authority said that Kenya considers the China-Kenya relations as very important and it is for this reason that this year alone Kenyatta traveled to China twice during the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) and the China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai.Kirima said that in both occasions Kenya's president held talks with the president of China in further strengthening the cooperation.She added that currently, China is Kenya's largest trading partner and the largest official development assistance (ODA) donor.According to Kirima, China is also the largest contractor having contributed significantly to the current improved infrastructure that has gone a long way in enhancing the competitiveness of the private sector.Kirima urged Chinese investors to transfer their knowledge and technology to Kenyan firms so that Kenya can improve the competitiveness of its industrial sector.

                China, Kenya discuss strengthening business relations
            </a>
            <p>
                Chinese enterprises operating in Kenya must abide by laws while the Kenyan side should protect the Chinese companies and their staff members' legitimate rights and interests, said Wang Xuezheng, counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Kenya, at a symposium in Nairobi, Kenya's capital, on Tuesday.The China Zhejiang-Kenya Trade and Investment Symposium was organized by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) Zhejiang Committee, the Kenya Ministry of Industry, Trade and Cooperatives as well as the Kenya Investment Authority, with the aim of further promoting business and economic engagement between Zhejiang province and Kenya.In his opening remarks, Wang said overseas Chinese enterprises are the spokespersons of China. The operational activity of the Chinese enterprises in Kenya is related to China's image and the friendship between the two countries. Therefore, all Chinese enterprises, including Zhejiang enterprises, should operate legally and comply with local laws and regulations, respect local customs and habits, protect the legal rights of local employees, fulfill corporate social responsibility, contribute to the local community's development, and try to be the messenger of the friendship between China and Kenya.The diplomat also expressed his hope that the Kenya Ministry of Industry, Trade and Cooperation of Kenya, the Kenya Investment Authority and other government departments and agencies can continue to optimize the investment and business environment, formulate preferential investment policies, protect the Chinese enterprises and theirs staff members' legitimate rights and interests, support the Chinese enterprises development and expansion in Kenya, and created a better environment for China-Kenya economic and trade cooperation."The Chinese Embassy in Kenya will continue to play the role of a bridge in providing information consulting and rights protection services for the Chinese enterprises operating in Kenya," said Wang.CCPIT Zhejiang Committee mobilized nearly 100 entrepreneurs from more than 50 large-scale enterprises in Zhejiang to attend the business-to-business meeting. As the team leader, Zhang Qingshan, vice-chairman of the CCPIT Zhejiang Committee, said that the economic and trade exchanges between Zhejiang and Kenya are fruitful.According to Zhang, the bilateral trade volume reached $1.14 billion in 2017, an increase of 6.97 percent year-on-year, among which Zhejiang exported $1.14 billion to Kenya, a rise of 6.64 percent over 2016. Although Zhejiang imported goods worth $50,000 from Kenya, it marks an increase of 306.25 percent year–on-year.Zhang said Zhejiang and Kenya are complementary in terms of the advantageous industries and there is great potential for future cooperation. By the end of June this year, Kenya has set up 21 enterprises in Zhejiang, with a total value of $8.25 million while Zhejiang has set up 11 enterprises in Kenya, with an amount of $9.635 million."I hope that under the framework of China-Africa cooperation, Zhejiang and Kenya can deepen pragmatic cooperation in various fields and achieve win-win development," said the vice-chairman.

                Integration is critical for the development of EAC
            </a>
            <p>
                For the East African Community (EAC) to overcome the current challenges, realize its objectives, and unlock the untapped potentials, business should take the center stage in the regional integration, according to private sector leaders.Despite being hailed as one of the most integrated regional economic blocks on the continent, EAC, which is composed of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda, has been grappling with several challenges undermining its integration process.Some of the key problems include lack of sound legal and institutional framework, budgetary constraints, inadequate institutional capacities at national and regional level to domesticate regional policies, and lack of coherency in legal and regulatory frameworks.This is in addition to mismatch between regional development planning and partner states' individual development planning, low levels of economic and social infrastructure development and fear of loss of sovereignty.Despite the challenges, the private sector players are optimistic about the future of the regional integration and are set to actively participate in process.Ali Mufuruki, the founder and CEO of Infotech Investment Group, said the future of EAC integration is bright and that the private sector should work in partnership with the public sector to drive the EAC integration.He is of the view that the regional integration should start from the products level, through exporting products as a region rather than a single country in order to meet the demand and remain globally competitive."EAC can form one company that will export East African coffee. This way, the region could become the biggest supplier of coffee to China for instance. It doesn't make sense for coffee suppliers in East Africa to compete with each other," he said.This, he said, can be applicable to products that have deep value chain, and can be sourced from across the region, for every member state to benefit."We can build a coffee airbus, textile airbus or a tourism airbus. East Africa has great sceneries. We can consider marketing the region as a tourist destination," he said.Peter Mathuki, the executive director of East Africa Business Council, said the idea of business taking the center stage in regional integration is timely.He said the private sector should call the government to the negotiation table and discuss on what should be done to drive the regional integration process, instead of waiting to be invited by the government."The treaty that established EAC is private sector led. It's a challenge we need to take upon ourselves and be at the center on the table but not waiting to be invited by the government," he said.Joshua Oigara, the CEO of Kenya Commercial Bank Group, said the private sector should be in the forefront in riding the agenda for regional transformation."We have been using the East Africa Business Council, but perhaps we need to push more as private sector leaders and CEOs to make our conversation well known," he said.Oigara said there is need to invest strongly in connecting infrastructure. "Transporting goods from Mombasa port, Kenya to Rwanda takes longer than shipping from Brazil to China and the cost is high as well," he said.Dennis Karera, the vice-chairman of the East African Business Council, said the private sector needs to be focused and know what it needs from each other."There are significant products in the region and the population is growing, so what we need is a thorough systematic movement of goods, services and labor. We should then do the advocacy job by advising the governments on what our right is appropriate," Karera said.Karera said the issue of non-tariff barriers (NTBs) will always be there. "We have advocated for removal of over 70 percent of the NTBs. However, we still have about 30 percent NTBs," he said."As we do more business something new comes up, so what is needed is to take on the challenge and take it to the necessary office to handle it," he said.Karera said the route taken for the EAC integration is perfect. "We are on the right track. We should stay put and focused," he said.The main objective of the EAC is to introduce policies and programs to promote cooperation among its member states for their mutual benefit in political, economic, social, and cultural affairs, research and technology, defense, security, and legal and judicial affairs.

                For the East African Community to overcome is current challenges, realize its objectives, and unlock untapped potential, business should take center stage in regional integration, according to private sector leaders.Despite being hailed as one of the most integrated regional economic blocks on the continent, the EAC, which is composed of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda, has been grappling with several challenges undermining its integration process.Some of the key problems include the lack of a sound legal and institutional framework, budgetary constraints, inadequate institutional capacities at national and regional level to domesticate regional policies, and a lack of coherency in legal and regulatory frameworks.This is in addition to the mismatch between regional development planning and partner states' individual development planning, low levels of economic and social infrastructure development and fears over the loss of sovereignty.Despite the challenges, private sector players are optimistic about the future of regional integration and are set to actively participate in the process.Ali Mufuruki, the founder and CEO of Infotech Investment Group, said the future of EAC integration is bright and that the private sector should work in partnership with the public sector to drive EAC integration.He is of the view that regional integration should start from the product level, through exporting products as a region rather than a single country in order to meet demand and remain globally competitive."The EAC can form one company that will export East African coffee. This way, the region could become the biggest supplier of coffee to China for instance. It doesn't make sense for coffee suppliers in East Africa to compete with each other," he said.Deep value chain This, he said, can be applicable to products that have a deep value chain, and can be sourced from across the region, for every member state to benefit."We can build a coffee airbus, a textile airbus or a tourism airbus. East Africa has great scenery. We can consider marketing the region as a tourist destination," he said.Peter Mathuki, executive director of the East Africa Business Council, said the idea of business taking center stage in regional integration is timely.He said the private sector should call governments to the negotiation table and discuss what should be done to drive the regional integration process, instead of waiting to be invited by the government.Joshua Oigara, CEO of Kenya Commercial Bank Group, said the private sector should be in the forefront in setting the agenda for regional transformation."We have been using the East Africa Business Council, but perhaps we need to push more as private sector leaders and CEOs to make our conversation well known," he said.

                Vigilance as deadly Ebola rages in DR Congo
            </a>
            <p>
                Improved security and access to medical personnel have slowed the transmission of the Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo after months of a raging epidemic, according to the World Health Organization.WHO said a total of 88 confirmed cases were reported each of the past two epidemiological weeks, down from a peak of 126 cases per week observed in April. Decline in the incidence of new cases has been most apparent in hot spots such as Katwa, Mandima and Beni health zones.According to WHO, 1,357 people have died of the disease since the first infections were detected in August 2018 up until June 4. There has been 1,931 confirmed DR Congo cases and 94 probable cases. In light of rising concerns that the epidemic may cross over to neighboring countries, the east African region is ramping up public health measures.Meanwhile, one out of four Ebola infections may be going undetected, according to the Al Jazeera TV network. CNN said the outbreak could take up to two years to contain.Transmission rates continue to be high in affected communities, and there may be further waves of the outbreak, WHO said. An increase in new cases has been reported in the Mabalako Health Zone in recent weeks, and high infection rates continue in Butembo metropolitan area."Times between detecting, reporting and admission of cases at Ebola treatment/transit centers remains too long－an average of six days in the past three weeks, with about a third of cases dying outside the centers during this time. Collectively, these indicators highlight that the risks associated with this outbreak remain very high," said WHO.Among the infected, women account for 58 percent of confirmed and probable cases; 29 percent have been children aged younger than 18 years old. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 110, or 5 percent of the total cases.The East African Community has announced plans to hold a cross-border disease preparedness exercise at a border town between Kenya and Uganda from Tuesday to Friday.In the past two years, the region has experienced outbreaks of Ebola, Rift Valley, Marburg and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fevers, cholera, and the plague. The EAC's secretariat has noted that the DR Congo epidemic "presents a major challenge to the health and socioeconomic wellbeing of the people of East Africa. The pathogens that cause these diseases occur naturally in the region and can put the lives and livelihoods of the people in the EAC at risk."
