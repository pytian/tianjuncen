                Funding announced for projects addressing world issuesNine countries including the United Kingdom and China have announced more than 100 million pounds ($121 million) in new funding for projects that tackle major social issues including ageing populations, climate change and infectious diseases such as Ebola and Zika.Over a four-year period, the UK will contribute 60 million pounds to 13 new projects, which will be matched with at least 45 million pounds from partners in China, Israel, the United States, India, Canada, Japan, Australia and Singapore.The investment is the second wave of funding from the British government's Fund for International Collaboration, which is overseen by the agency UK Research and Innovation, or UKRI."These ground-breaking initiatives will not only help tackle major issues, including the spread of infectious diseases, they will create jobs and drive economic growth across the UK," said UK Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom.In one of the projects, the UKRI and the National Natural Sciences Foundation China will commission scientists to research the biological, medical and social implications of ageing populations.Prospective candidates must submit proposals, and each successful applicant will receive between 625,000 pounds and 1 million pounds in UK funding and 2.5 million yuan ($354,000) in Chinese investment.Aging poses a major research challenge for both the UK and China. In Britain, the birth rate hit a record low last year, and over the last two decades the average age has risen by two years to reach 40. In China, the National Committee on Aging estimates that the proportion of the population in China aged 60 or above will rise from 17.9 percent today to 34.9 percent by 2053.The need to provide for elderly relatives places particular strain on families in China, where the burden of caring for aging parents is most often placed upon single children and not shared among siblings.The UK-China collaboration will also focus on improving healthcare solutions for the elderly. Last week, the UK Office for National Statistics confirmed that Alzheimer's disease and dementia are now the leading cause of death in England and Wales, while in China 180 million elderly people suffer from chronic diseases, according to China's National Health Commission.The UKRI is also committing 8.3 million pounds to a joint project with the US, Israel and China that will examine infectious disease.The National Natural Science Foundation of China will coordinate Chinese efforts to research the interaction between humans, livestock, crops, wild animals and plants that can lead to the spread of pathogens. Diseases that cross species barriers include serious illnesses such as Zika, Ebola, African Swine Fever and Anthrax."The partnerships announced today underline the critical role that international collaboration will play in addressing pressing global challenges, from climate change to deadly diseases such as Ebola and Zika," said UKRI Chief Executive Mark Walport. "The Fund for International Collaboration demonstrates that the UK's research and innovation community will be at the forefront of efforts to tackle these problems, delivering benefits that will be felt here in the UK and throughout the world."Further international collaborations to receive funding include a UK-US investigation into the relationship between ocean currents in the North Atlantic and world climate, a joint project with Canadian medical experts aimed at improving diabetes treatments, and a link-up with Japanese scientists to explore how artificial intelligence digital technologies can help societies evolve.

                Japanese woman cleared of Ebola
            </a>
            <p>
                A Japanese woman suspected of having Ebola after returning from the Democratic Republic of the Congo had turned out to be a false alarm, the nation's health ministry said on Sunday.The Saitama woman, who is in her 70s, had tested negative for the infectious and deadly Ebola virus, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said in a statement, but she will continue to be hospitalized for doctors to monitor her condition as a precaution, it added.According to an earlier statement by the ministry, the woman, who was not been identified, lives in the Greater Tokyo region. She returned to Japan from the DR Congo on July 31.She had a fever of 38.2 C at 5 am on Saturday. It rose to 38.5 C at 5:50 pm and 39.2 C at 7 pm the same day, raising suspicions of a possible Ebola infection.After she was hospitalized by Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases, the woman was tested positive for type A influenza and negative for malaria.The Ebola alarm set off a panic in the country as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made quick instructions to treat the patient and prevent secondary infection, because millions commute every day from Saitama to Tokyo.When waiting for the result of the patient on Sunday, Abe's office tweeted several posts on Twitter to ease the panic, with one saying: "It is said that the disease is contagious only when the symptoms become evident. It is therefore highly unlikely that the passengers who were on board the same airplane with the patient face the risk of infection."The woman was based in the DR Congo for work for at least six months, local media said, without specifying her occupation.Japan's health ministry said since the woman's return to Japan, her temperature had been taken twice a day at a health quarantine station.Ebola victims will show symptoms after an incubation period of anywhere from two to 21 days. Symptoms include sudden fever, migraines, muscle pain then followed by vomiting, diarrhea or unexplained bleeding or bruising.The Ebola virus cannot be transmitted by air or by mosquitoes but can be spread by direct contact with blood or body fluids.This month marks one year since WHO declared an outbreak of the Ebola virus in the DR Congo, which left more than 2,600 people infected and 1,800 killed.

                Possible Ebola case in Rotterdam hospital false alarm
            </a>
            <p>
                THE HAGUE -- Emergency services in Rotterdam took an immediate action on Wednesday evening due to a possible case of Ebola, but investigation showed it was a false alarm.A woman came to the first aid post of the Maasstad hospital with signs of the highly contagious disease, fever and vomiting. A coordinated deployment of the emergency services was initiated afterwards by the Safety Region Rotterdam-Rijnmond.The woman with the symptoms of the disease came from DR Congo, but not from an area where the disease currently prevails. The Maasstad hospital initiated the Ebola protocol on the basis of the disease symptoms of the patient and the fact that she came from Congo.During the investigation people were not allowed to leave the hospital and no one was allowed to enter. Some visitors to the first aid post, where the woman had reported herself, were temporarily quarantined. The woman was treated in a special air filtered space. Just after midnight the Safety Region Rotterdam-Rijnmond announced she did not have Ebola.The Rotterdam hospital has a Ebola protocol since 2014, when there was an outbreak of the disease in West Africa. Since August 2018 a new Ebola outbreak occurred in the North East of Congo.

                Scientists identify effective Ebola drugs
            </a>
            <p>
                Scientists have found new treatments for the Ebola disease that has so far killed more than 1,800 people and infected more than 2,700 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the past year.Carrying out a trial in the midst of the major outbreak in the DR Congo, the scientists discovered that two of the five investigational drugs significantly reduced deaths.The independent data and safety monitoring board that meets periodically to review treatment data on Aug 9 recommended the drugs REGN-EB3 and mAb114.Begun last November, the study trial with 499 participants so far indicates that patients that received REGN-EB3 or mAb114 had a greater chance of survival compared to participants treated with three other drugs.In addition to mAb114 and REGN-EB3, since last November the trial, called Pamoja Tulinde Maisha ("Together Save Lives"), had tested ZMapp, remdesivir, and monoclonal antibody 1 to treat patients at centers in four DR Congo communities.Starting in August 2018 the Ebola outbreak has spread through north Kivu and Ituri provinces of DR Congo.Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the US National Institutes of Health, said the overall mortality of those given ZMapp at the four centers was 49 percent while that of remdesivir was 53 percent.REGN-EB3, developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, had the lowest overall death rate, at 29 percent, while mAb114, developed by Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, had a mortality rate of 34 percent.ZMapp had shown some efficacy during the massive 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.Christos Kyratsous, vice president of research, infectious diseases and viral vector technologies at Regeneron, said REGN-EB3 is a three-antibody cocktail designed with the goal of enhancing efficacy, reducing the development of viral sequences that lead to resistance, and increasing potential utility in future outbreaks as viruses continually evolveWendy Holman, CEO and co-founder of Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, said her company is focused on further developing mAb114.MAb114 was initially developed by the US National Institutes of Health, but Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP obtained licensing for it from the US Food and Drug Administration in the fourth quarter of 2018.Nancy Sullivan, chief of the Biodefense Research Section in Vaccine Research Center and her team discovered that the survivors retained antibodies against Ebola 11 years after infection.Researchers isolated the antibodies and tested the most favorable ones in the laboratory and nonhuman primate studies, and selected mAb114 as the most promising.Holman said the news from the Pamoja Tulinde Maisha trial helps to reinvigorate and keep them fixated on their mission.

                DR Congo's South Kivu province reports first confirmed Ebola cases
            </a>
            <p>
                BUKAVU, DR Congo -- Health authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) on Friday confirmed the first two cases of Ebola in the Mwenga Health Zone in Bukavu city, South Kivu province, which borders Rwanda and Burundi.According to a statement from the nation's coordination team in charge of Ebola response, the two cases were a 24-year-old woman and her seven-month-old baby, who resided in a host family in the Beni Health Zone, Mabolio.The woman had been listed earlier as a high-risk contact of a family member who was confirmed to be an Ebola case last month in Beni.The statement added that more than 120 contacts are already listed and the on-site response team's mission is supporting the Mwenga Health Zone in search of other contacts in the coming week."We want to reassure the population that the response teams are hard at work to carry out all public health actions around the case, and urge it to collaborate fully with our teams," said Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe, director of the National Institute for Biomedical Research, in a statement."We reassure neighboring countries that all steps are being taken to strengthen surveillance at points of entry and health control," he added.Since the beginning of the Ebola outbreak one year ago, the cumulative number of cases is 2,852, of which 2,758 are confirmed and 94 probable. In total there were 1,913 deaths of which 1,819 were confirmed. There are also 848 people healed, according to the latest report from the country's health ministry.

                China vows continued aid to Africa for Ebola
            </a>
            <p>
                China will continue to provide aid to African countries to battle Ebola, and hopes the international community will take more effective measures to help these countries overcome the epidemic.Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang made the remark in a daily news conference on Thursday, after China announced it will provide emergency aid to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and several other African countries, and work with the World Health Organization and the African Union to fight the disease.China has always followed closely the development of Ebola in Africa and has actively lent support in tackling it, Geng said, adding that China was among the first to provide aid since the epidemic broke out in West Africa in 2014.China's assistance to Africa is an important part of the healthcare initiative, one of the eight initiatives China proposed at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in September 2018, Geng said.China and Africa have always been a community with a shared future, and it's the duty of China, a major developing country and a sincere friend of Africa, to support African countries in fighting Ebola, the spokesman said.Currently 46 Chinese medical teams consisting of about 1,000 people are working in 45 African countries.

                Ebola death toll in east Congo outbreak climbs above 2,000
            </a>
            <p>
                GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo - The death toll from Democratic Republic of Congo's year-long Ebola outbreak has climbed above 2,000, government data showed on Friday, as responders battle to overcome community mistrust and widespread security problems.The government team overseeing the response said the number of confirmed and probable cases had also hit a milestone of more than 3,000 in what has become the second-worst epidemic of the virus on record.Despite the development of an effective vaccine and treatments, health workers have struggled to control the spread of the disease in remote and conflict-hit areas of eastern Congo, where many locals are wary of the response effort."For the treatments to work, people need to trust them and the medical staff who administer them. This will take time, resources and a lot of hard work," the International Federation of the Red Cross said in a statement.This is Congo's 10th Ebola outbreak, but it is the first in the densely forested hillside provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, where militia-led violence and ethnic killing have undermined security in certain areas for decades.The government data released on Friday showed Ebola deaths reaching 2,006 and cases at 3,004.Only the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa has been deadlier. More than 11,300 people died then out of 28,000 who were infected. Reuters

                US tariff wars penalize Chinese development and African futures
            </a>
            <p>
                In the coming months, some of the worst collateral damage of US tariff wars will occur in sub-Saharan Africa. The adverse impact is likely to be aggravated by US protectionism, which shuns economic integration in Africa.After US tariff wars undermined the global recovery momentum in 2018, the World Bank projected in June that the world economy would only expand by 2.6 percent. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has affirmed the trade wars could wipe $455 billion off global GDP in 2020.The adverse impact on sub-Saharan Africa is reflected by downgraded projections. In April, the World Bank cut the 2019 growth forecast for the region to 2.8 percent from 3.3 percent.Until the commodity price slump of 2015, Africa enjoyed a decade of rapid growth. The recovery of those growth levels could take long, due to the decline in industrial production and particularly as the US-Sino trade war is taking its toll.Indeed, the collateral damage in Africa is about to begin.Trade wars' impact on AfricaRecently, Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank (AfDB) warned that the US-China trade war and uncertainty over Brexit pose risks to Africa's economic prospects that are "increasing by the day."Such prospects are also fueled by a recession in Germany.Indirectly, the diminished prospects are reflected by three major economies - Nigeria, South Africa and Angola - that make up about 60% of sub-Saharan Africa's annual economic output. At the moment, all are coping with various challenges, curbing their contribution to the growth momentum.Although Africa is not the direct target of the US-Sino trade war, US tariffs have typically heralded plunging commodity prices, local currencies and major equity exchanges. Earlier in the year, AfDB warned that the trade conflicts could result in a 2.5 percent reduction in the GDP of resource-intensive African countries and 1.0 percent reduction for oil exporters in the next two years.As US tariffs and diminishing global prospects slow down Chinese production and thus reduce Beijing's demand for raw materials from Africa, the prospect of slowing Chinese demand could further reduce annual exports from Africa.The largest regional exporters to China - South Africa and Angola, but also the Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana and Gabon, and Nigeria which rely on China's need for resources for a significant chunk of their exports - are said to be vulnerable. And so are other African countries with more than 40 percent of their exports going to China, such as South Sudan, Eritrea, Gambia, Guinea and Zimbadwe. Conversely, Africa's biggest exporters to the US - particularly Angola and South Africa, the Republic of Congo and Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon and Ghana, Guinea and Nigeria which are dependent on US absorption capacity - remain particularly vulnerable.Recently, international spotlight has lingered on those African countries that rely on Chinese trade and investment. The highlight should be extended to those countries that depend on US trade and investment, due to the dramatic shifts in US economic presence in Africa in the past two to three decades.Disruptive changes in US and Chinese trade and FDISince December 2018, the Trump administration's new "Africa strategy" has stressed three priorities: advancing US trade across the region, combating terrorism and aid reduction in the name of efficiency. The first tenet is reflected by the 'Prosper Africa' initiative, whose stated goal is to substantially increase trade and investment between the US and Africa.Yet, to understand the real economic role of the United States and China in Africa, it is instructive to take a long view. Let's start with trade. Between the end of the Cold War and the onset of the Bush era, US exports to and imports from Africa were less than $1 billion annually. Africa was non-existent to Washington. In the same time period, Chinese exports to Africa more than quintupled to $6 billion, whereas imports from Africa increased even faster, almost 10-fold to over $4 billion.Prior to global crisis, US trade soared to $100 billion, falling only $2 billion behind that of China. While Chinese trade with Africa was balanced, US trade wasn't. America imported 2.5 times more from Africa than it exported to Africa.Until the end of the commodity super-cycle and the collapse of energy prices, Chinese trade soared to more than $200 billion in 2015. After the subsequent plunge, it returned to $155 billion in 2017. Meanwhile, US trade plunged to $50 billion and remains only $55 billion annually. China's trade surplus with Africa is about $35 billion, whereas US trade deficit with Africa is almost $13 billion. The former has led to some discontent in Africa; the latter is unacceptable to Trump's trade hawks. What about the foreign direct investment (FDI) flows? US FDI into Africa peaked at more than $9 billion in 2009. At the same time, Chinese FDI into Africa soared from less than $0.1 billion to $5.5 billion annually. Following the global crisis, the Obama administration pledged greater investments in Africa. In reality, the era saw a dramatic fall of US FDI into Africa, as it plunged to a negative of $2 billion in 2016. Concurrently, Chinese investment in Africa took a hit as well, decreasing to $2.5 billion in 2012. In 2017, US investment rose to only $0.3 billion; while Chinese FDI exceeded $4.1 billion annually.In the 2018 Forum on China Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), President Xi Jinping pledged $60 billion to the continent in loans, grants, and development financing. That's when the Trump administration developed its "new Africa strategy," which is constrained by trade protectionism and longer-standing US geopolitical goals.Differences of US and Chinese presence in AfricaInitially, the Bush administration did push for Africa's economic self-reliance, but its "war on terror" offset that goal.The Obama administration's rhetoric failed to disguise the dramatic collapse of US trade and investment in Africa in the mid-2010s.In 2014, the US pledged to invest $14 billion in Africa over the next decade. With the most protectionist administration since the 1930s, this may prove unlikely. The Trump administration's penchant for trade wars shuns efforts to contain collateral damage in Africa. Remedies simply aren't viable as long as protectionism remains the White House's primary weapon.Moreover, the $252 million funding cuts to Ebola response efforts in early 2018 illustrate the gap between the stated goals and effective actions. Finally, expectations should also be cautioned by the Trump administration's racial bias.For all practical purposes, the US Africa strategy is largely dictated by the concern that China has become Africa's largest economic partner. That's why Washington misrepresents China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Africa and elsewhere.In the postwar era, US-led globalization did not occur without significant mistakes. In the early 21st century, the BRI is going through its own birth pains. But unlike past globalization, the BRI seeks to boost industrialization in emerging and developing countries - that is, countries that have been largely ignored by the advanced West.In the final analysis, economic development is a win-win game; geopolitics isn't. Africa is a case in point.Dan Steinbock is the founder of Difference Group and has served at the India, China and America Institute (US), Shanghai Institute for International Studies (China) and the EU Center (Singapore).This commentary was originally published by China-US Focus on August 29, 2019.

                The future of US-China ties continues to intrigue, as it is still not clear if the two will cooperate in producing global public goods Some people believe China and the United States will fall into a "Thucydides Trap" of devastating war, but I do not agree. Thucydides attributed the Peloponnesian war to two causes: the rise of a new power and the fear that created in an established power. Most people focus on the first half of his statement, but the second is equally important. Both countries can avoid exaggerated fears that could create a new cold or hot war. In 1914, a rising Germany created fear in Britain, but Germany had already overtaken Britain by 1900. Even if China someday overtakes the US in total economic size, that will just be part of the equation. China is well behind the US on military and soft power indices. As China's power grows, many worry we are destined for war, but few consider an opposite danger. Rather than acting like a revolutionary power in the international order, China might decide to be a "free rider" like the US was in the 1930s. China may act too weakly rather than too strongly and refuse to contribute to an international order that it did not create. China has benefited from the post-1945 international order. In the United Nations Security Council, China is one of the five countries with a veto power. China is now the second-largest contributer of UN peacekeeping forces and participated in UN programs related to Ebola and climate change. China has also benefited greatly from economic institutions like the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund. China has started its own Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and a Belt and Road Initiative of international infrastructure projects that some see as an alternative to the World Bank, but AIIB adheres to international rules and cooperates with the World Bank. In 2015, China helped develop new norms to deal with climate change. On the other hand, China has not practiced full reciprocity as a market economy, and China's rejection of a 2016 Hague tribunal ruling regarding the South China Sea raised questions about whether China would treat its legal obligations a la carte (as the US has sometimes done). Overall, China has not tried to overthrow but rather to increase its influence within the world order from which it benefits. It is not interested in kicking over the card table but in claiming a larger share of the winnings on the table. At the same time, China's growing economic power will create problems for the US and the international order, and friction is likely over market access, forced technology transfer, State-directed industrial policies to support national champions, overcapacity, and coerced transfer of intellectual property. As Chinese power grows, the US "liberal international order" will have to adapt. China has little interest in liberalism or US domination. Analysts would be wise to discard the terms "liberal" and "American" and think in terms of an "open and rules-based" world order with institutional cooperation. As China, India and other economies grow, the US share of the world economy will be less than it was at the beginning of this century, and the rise of other countries will make it more difficult to organize collective action to promote global public goods. But no other country - including China - is about to replace the US in terms of overall power resources in the next few decades. Russia is in demographic decline and heavily dependent on energy rather than technology exports; India and Brazil (each with a $2 trillion economy) remain developing countries. Despite their alliance of convenience against the US, a real alliance similar to the Sino-Soviet alliance of the 1950s is unlikely. Since Nixon, China and the US have cooperated despite ideological differences, but cyber conflict and the interference in internal processes adds new burdens. Rapid Asian economic growth has encouraged a horizontal power shift to the region, but Asia has its own internal balance of power. Chinese power is balanced by Japan, India, and Australia among others, and the US will remain crucial to that Asian balance of power. The US should reduce its fears that China can drive the US from the Western Pacific, much less dominate the world. The more relevant question for both countries will be whether the US and China will develop attitudes that allow them to cooperate in producing global public goods, and that is far from clear. Yan Xuetong, a distinguished professor at Tsinghua University, has written that with the end of unipolarity and American hegemony, China will carefully avoid war and a "bipolar US-Chinese order will be shaped by fluid issue-specific alliances rather than rigid opposing blocs ... [and] most states will adopt a two-track approach siding with the United States on some issues and China on others". But such a future assumes careful management on both sides and no miscalculations. That will take skilled leadership on both sides. The author is a professor at Harvard and author of the forthcoming book Do Morals Matter? Presidents and Foreign Policy from FDR to Trump.
