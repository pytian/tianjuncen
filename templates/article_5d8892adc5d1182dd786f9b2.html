                Police seize weapons including chemical spray, knives, shields and a stun gunSix people were injured and at least 13 were arrested after far-right protesters and opposing demonstrators clashed on Saturday in the largest city of Oregon in the western United States.There were approximately 1,200 demonstrators in downtown Portland at the peak of the protests. The city called in its entire force of 1,000 police officers in response to what the Portland Police Bureau called "civil disturbance", which has attracted national attention.Video footage posted on social media shows that protesters with red "Make America Great Again" caps and counterprotesters in black fighting with each other, and police in riot gear trying to keep the two sides of demonstrators from separate.Over the course of the daylong demonstration, police seized weapons including chemical spray, metal and wooden poles, knives, shields and a stun gun, Portland Police Chief Danielle Outlaw told reporters on Saturday evening.The protests clogged the streets of Portland and disrupted public transit. The arrested individuals face a range of charges, including disorderly conduct, interfering with police, resisting arrest and unlawful use of a weapon, said Outlaw.The rally was organized by the Proud Boys, a US-based all-male far-right group, founded in 2016, which promotes white nationalism, gun rights and "Western Chauvinism" on its website. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which advocates against bigotry, has designated the Proud Boys as a hate group.The Proud Boys said the goal of the rally was to oppose anti-fascist demonstrators, collectively called "Antifa" and known for wearing masks and all-black clothing. They want Antifa to be declared a domestic terrorist organization.New battlegroundBefore the demonstration started, US President Donald Trump tweeted that "Major consideration is being given to naming ANTIFA an 'ORGANIZATION OF TERROR.' Portland is being watched very closely. Hopefully the Mayor will be able to properly do his job!"In response to Trump's tweet, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler told CNN that the president was not "helpful" in addressing a "potentially dangerous and volatile situation". "Adding to that noise doesn't do anything to support or help the efforts that are going on here in Portland," he said.Portland has become a new battleground for far-right and far-left extremists. Almost two months ago, clashes between another far-right group, Patriot Prayer, and counterprotesters led to four arrests and four injuries, according to Portland Police Bureau.In 2017, thousands of people skirmished in fights between pro-Trump groups and counterprotesters at a rally in Portland, following a stabbing on public transit train after a man reportedly harassed a woman wearing a hijab.The debate on white supremacy has recently been fueled in the US after a shooter killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas, early this month. Before going on the killing spree, the suspect posted a manifesto online, which is filled with white supremacist language and racist hatred aimed at immigrants.Clint Watts, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and a former FBI counterterrorism expert, has said that the country doesn't take white nationalism seriously enough and suggested legislation to designate white supremacy as domestic terrorism.On the other hand, Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Bill Cassidy have introduced a congressional resolution calling for anti-fascists to be declared domestic terrorists.But experts said it's difficult to determine whether Antifa is a terrorist group. "Antifa is not a highly organized entity and has not persisted over time," said Gary LaFree, chair of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Maryland, in an article for the NBC News website on Saturday."Terrorism is a method, not a group or an individual" and "measuring the motives of individuals is complicated", he said.

                The police chief of the US city of Portland, Oregon, is calling for legislation banning masks worn by demonstrators after violent clashes broke out between rival protesters over the weekend."In other states, you will see that it's illegal to wear a mask during the commission of a crime," Portland Police Bureau Chief Danielle Outlaw said, according to CNN.Outlaw was referring to violent demonstrations that erupted on Saturday, when, she said, masks worn by some protesters hindered officers' ability to identify suspects.Clashing protesters included anti-fascists – or Antifa – demonstrators and members of right-wing groups, such as Proud Boys, according to CNN."If you knew that you can be easily identified, do you think you would be as inclined to commit that act of violence or commit that crime?" Outlaw asked. "A lot of people are emboldened because they know they can't be identified."Antifa members say dressing completely in black, sometimes with faces covered by masks, aims to unify demonstrators' efforts and hide their identities for their protection."People put on the masks so that we can all become anonymous, right? And then we are all able to move freely and do what we need to do, whether it is illegal or not," Scott Crow, a former Antifa activist, told CNN.

                Far-right, far-left groups clash again in streets of Portland, Oregon; 13 arrestedThe controversial tactic of wearing masks at public protest events is being hotly debated in the US, as recent clashes between far-right and far-left groups have captured national attention.Portland, Oregon, a frequent battleground for right-wing demonstrators and their left-wing counterparts, such as Antifa (short for anti-fascist) in recent years, is considering banning the wearing of a mask to evade identification in criminal activity in the city. City police attempted to break up skirmishes between the two rival groups on Saturday, leading to 13 arrests and six injuries. Eight people were injured and four arrested in similar clashes in June.Portland Police Chief Danielle Outlaw called for an anti-mask law following June's clashes."Masks worn by some protesters hindered officers' ability to identify suspects,'' Outlaw said at a news conference last month. "A lot of people are emboldened because they know they can't be identified."Members of Antifa usually dress in black, sometimes with their faces covered by masks. They say they do so to unify demonstrators' efforts and hide their identities for their own protection.They are a loose coalition of individuals with left-leaning political views, generally opposing the inequality of wealth by corporations and discrimination against marginalized communities.Antifa has received widespread attention in recent years, especially after clashing with white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, where a white supremacist drove a car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one demonstrator.Last month, Portland-based conservative blogger Andy Ngo was beaten up by some black-clad people, whom he believed to be members of Antifa."The masks are an insult to the rest of us progressives. They endanger us by associating us with threatening violence. It is a cowardly, selfish act that makes us look like fools," said Malheur Sam, in a comment posted on news website The Oregonian last month following the June clashes.Antifa's tactics also have prompted a call for federal legislation from Republican Congressman Dan Donovan of New York, who introduced a bill in 2018 to target masked activists.The bill would punish anyone wearing a mask or disguise who "injures, oppresses, threatens, or intimidates" someone else exercising a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Rose City Antifa, named for its home city of Portland and known as the oldest active Antifa group in the US, argues that wearing a mask in public is protected by the First Amendment."We believe that masks, as an item of clothing, are protected by this amendment. These anti-mask laws are intended to make demonstrators afraid of surveillance and possible repression," the group said in an email to China Daily.The bill also has drawn concerns from critics who are afraid that it could embolden the far-right demonstrators.About 15 states and some local jurisdictions have adopted some type of anti-mask laws, and many of them were passed in the mid-20th century to prevent the Ku Klux Klan from organizing in public.In Georgia, wearing masks can be considered an act of intimidation and threat of violence.In New York, it's illegal to congregate in public with two or more people while each is wearing a mask or any face covering that disguises identity.California also prohibits the wearing of a mask in the act of committing a crime."Craft the law so that wearing a mask while having intent to, or while committing a crime, is illegal," said a user under the name of Baccus in a comment on The Oregonian's website. "Then we can all still enjoy Halloween."

                City police call for ban on wearing of coverings to evade identification The controversial tactic of wearing masks at public protest events is being hotly debated in the United States, as recent clashes between far-right and far-left groups have captured national attention. Portland, Oregon, a frequent battleground for right-wing demonstrators and their left-wing counterparts dubbed Antifa (short for anti-fascist) in recent years, is considering banning the wearing of a mask to evade identification in criminal activity in the city. City police attempted to break up skirmishes between the rival groups on Saturday, leading to 13 arrests and six injuries. Eight people were injured and four arrested in similar clashes in June. Portland Police Chief Danielle Outlaw called for an anti-mask law following June's clashes. "Masks worn by some protesters hindered officers' ability to identify suspects," Outlaw said at a news conference last month. "A lot of people are emboldened because they know they can't be identified." Antifa demonstrators usually dress in black, sometimes with their faces covered by masks. They say they do so to unify demonstrators' efforts and hide their identities for their own protection. They are a loose coalition of individuals with left-leaning political views, generally opposing the inequality of wealth by corporations and discrimination against marginalized communities. Antifa has received widespread attention in recent years, especially after clashing with white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, where a white supremacist drove a car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one demonstrator.

                    Jet-car speed racer Jessi Combs dies trying to break record

                PORTLAND, Ore - Jet-car speed racer Jessi Combs, known by fans as the "fastest woman on four wheels," has died in a crash in Oregon's Alvord Desert while trying to break a speed record, local authorities said Wednesday.Combs, 39, died Tuesday afternoon while racing in a dry lake bed in a desert in remote Harney County, sheriff's Lt. Brian Needham said in a statement. The cause is under investigation.Terry Madden, Combs' teammate on the North American Eagle racing team, said in an Instagram post Wednesday that he was heartbroken and added a video collage of photos and video clips of Combs with various team members."She was the most amazing spirit that I have ever or will ever know," Madden wrote. "Unfortunately we lost her yesterday in a horrific accident, I was the first one there and trust me we did everything humanly possible to save her!!"Combs was widely known in the niche sport of jet-car racing and was attempting to break the Women's Land Speed Record of 512 mph (823 kph) set in 1976 by Kitty O'Neil when she died. Jet cars are race cars propelled by jet engines.She currently held the record as the fastest woman on four wheels — O'Neil piloted a three-wheeled vehicle — for a 398 mph performance in 2013 and had driven even faster in follow-up runs, but mechanical problems prevented those from making the record books.In an Instagram post on Sunday, Combs indicated that she hoped to break O'Neil's record in the Oregon desert.She wrote, "People say I'm crazy. I say, 'thank you.'"In a statement, Combs' family said her "most notable dream was being the fastest woman on Earth."Combs, who was born in Rapid City, South Dakota and lived in Long Beach, California, dabbled in snowboarding earlier in life and was also an accomplished artist and craftswoman, according to a biography on North American Eagle, her racing team.The Alvord Desert is an extremely remote and sparsely populated region in southeastern Oregon, about 400 miles (643 kilometers) southeast of Portland.AP

                    Vaping-related illnesses in US increase

            <p class="style-content">
                The number of people in the US sickened with a severe lung illness linked to vaping has more than doubled to 450 possible cases in 33 states, including three deaths and a possible fourth, according to health officials.On Friday, Indiana health officials confirmed the state's first death from a vaping-related respiratory illness, bringing the national toll to three, after two such deaths in Illinois and in Oregon. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also said that it's investigating a fourth death but declined to say where.Neither federal nor state health investigators have been able to pinpoint a brand, ingredient or substance causing the illnesses, but some suspect oils in vapes may play a role."While this investigation is ongoing, people should consider not using e-cigarette products. People who do use e-cigarette products should monitor themselves for symptoms," the CDC said in a news release.The person who died in Indiana was an adult, but officials gave no other details, citing privacy laws. There's also no indication of what the person may have been vaping.Public health officials in Oregon said the person who died there had used an electronic cigarette containing marijuana oil from a legal dispensary, the first death linked to a vaping product bought at a pot shop.Officials have not determined what sickened the middle-aged adult, whether the product was contaminated or whether they may have added something to the liquid in the device after buying it, said Dr Ann Thomas with the Oregon Health Authority.Reuters contributed to this report.
