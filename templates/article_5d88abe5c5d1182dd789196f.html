                Two West African countries have big elections this weekend
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                This coming weekend is one West Africans are eagerly looking forward to. Two countries in the region are set to elect new presidents to steer the countries' economic growth over the next four and five years.Nigeria, the second biggest economy in Africa and the continent's most populous country with 190 million people, will hold its presidential elections on Saturday after the postponement of the ballot on February 16.On the other hand, Senegal, the most stable democracy in West Africa with a population of 15 million people, is set to hold its presidential election on Sunday.In Nigeria, 70 candidates are competing for the top job while Senegal has five people in the running.In both cases, the outgoing presidents are seeking re-election and have a good chance to win. But in Nigeria, the contest is a bit tougher. President Muhammadu Buhari is up against former vice president Atiku Abubakar and a third candidate, Oby Ezekwesili, the activist who leads the #BringBackOurGirls social media campaign.Buhari, who is running under the All Progressives Congress, has promised to move the country to the next level as a prosperous, strong and stable country.He is also promising to create 500,000 jobs and train 200,000 others for outsourcing markets in technology, services and entertainment. This is in addition to creating several million jobs through agriculture.Atiku Abubakar of the People's Democratic Party promises to revive the country's economy by attracting investment and supporting state-managed enterprises, doubling the GDP to $900 billion by 2025, creating a minimum of 2.5 million jobs annually and lifting at least 50 million people from poverty in the first two years.Gerishon Ikiara, International Economics Lecturer at the University of Nairobi, says whoever wins the election will be faced with the challenge of curbing corruption, eradicating poverty and uniting the country.Ikiara said despite being the leading African producer of oil, the effects have yet to trickle down to the common person, as a majority are unemployed.According to the International Labour Organization, the official unemployment rate for the working age population is 7.5 percent, while 43.3 percent of the youth (15-24 years) is either unemployed or underemployed.Nigeria has the second-largest HIV epidemic in the world, with 4 percent prevalence and human trafficking remaining major problems according to the ILO.Extremist group Boko Haram continues to cause strife in northern Nigeria. Other security issues include conflicts between herders and farmers and the Niger Delta issue, characterized by illegal oil trade.Senegal President Macky Sall is campaigning on economic growth. Sall promises to put in place phase two of his program that involves transforming key sectors — including healthcare, agriculture, education and public administration — by 2035.Sall is expected to win the election following the barring of two of his strong opponents, Khalifa Sall and Karim Wade, from participating in elections because of corruption allegations.However Ousmane Sonko, the youngest among the contestants, is likely to cause an impact, as 60 percent of the Senegalese population is under 25 years old. They are anxious for change and likely to vote for a young leader.Unlike most African countries, Senegal has had peaceful elections and transitions since its independence from France in 1960.However, despite significant economic growth and decades of political stability, Senegal still faces serious development challenges according to the World Food Program. More than one-third of the country's population lives below the poverty line, and 75 percent of families suffer from chronic poverty.

                DAKAR - China is willing to work closely with Senegal to promote bilateral ties and China-Africa comprehensive strategic partnership, said visiting Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sunday.During the meeting with his Senegalese counterpart Sidiki Kaba, Wang lauded Senegal for consistently supporting China's legitimate stance on issues concerning its core interests and said China will continue to firmly support Senegal in taking its own development path and safeguarding its legitimate rights.Senegal has taken the lead in West Africa in signing cooperation documents with China under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and its role as co-chair of Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) has opened up new scope for bilateral ties, Wang said.China is willing to facilitate the construction of agreed infrastructure projects and expand cooperation with Senegal in emerging fields such as industrial parks in accordance with its needs, Wang added.Noting that China has achieved fast development and made great contributions to world peace and development over the 40 years of reform and opening-up, Wang said China will have more capabilities and resources to support other developing countries as it grows stronger.The Chinese foreign minister said China and Africa shall enhance their sense of a community with a shared future for mankind and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries amid rising challenges against multilateralism.For his part, Kaba said that China is an important strategic partner of Senegal and a friend who cares indeed about Senegal's development. He lauded China's great achievements in lifting over 700 million people out of poverty and promoting world peace and stability.The Senegalese foreign minister said the BRI and the eight major initiatives in collaboration with Africa proposed by President Xi Jinping dovetail highly with the Agenda 2063 of the African Union and the Emerging Senegal Plan proposed by President Macky Sall, which will bring mutual benefits and win-win results for China and Africa.Senegal will play an active role in China-Africa comprehensive strategic partnership and work closely with China to jointly perform the duties of co-chairs of FOCAC, promote the construction of its mechanism, and put the results of its Beijing summit into action, Kaba said.

            <p class="style-content">
                DAKAR - Macky Sall has been reelected as Senegal's president, Prime Minister Mahammed Boun Abdallah Dionne announced early Monday, citing preliminary results.According to the Senegalese prime minister, who is also the outgoing president's representative, Macky Sall obtained 57 percent of the vote and won the whole presidential election.In a statement to the press at the headquarters of the candidate Macky Sall, Dionne said that, based on the results compiled by their teammates throughout the territory, their candidate Macky Sall took a clear lead.Dionne said the incumbent president has a comfortable lead in 13 of Senegal's 14 electoral regions.However, the results cited by the prime minister are the first trends of voting circulating in local media without the verification of electoral authorities.About an hour earlier, opposition candidates Idrissa Seck and Ousmane Sonko held a press conference, denouncing the voting tendencies circulated in local media, which gave Macky Sall the electoral victory.The candidate Ousmane Sonko has also denounced the publication of the first tendencies by the press.The Commission of Census of Votes in Senegal will publish the official provisional results before Wednesday as these results will be confirmed by the Constitutional Council.

                Macky Sall won a second term as the president of Senegal in the first round of voting, election officials announced on Thursday.Sall, the incumbent president, received 58 percent of the votes cast on Sunday while Idrissa Seck, the opposition candidate and the former prime minister, received 21 percent. Ousmane Sonko, the third candidate, received 16 percent.The opposition candidates rejected Sall's outright victory. They, however, said they won't challenge the results. Election observers reported finding no major irregularities during the presidential vote.Senegal's electoral procedures consist of an initial ballot. If a single candidate fails to garner more than 50 percent of the votes cast, a second round takes place, between the candidates with the two largest proportions of the vote.Cavince Adhere, an analyst in Nairobi, Kenya, said the decision by the opposition not to challenge the election results is a good indication that the national interest has prevailed."As a sign of good faith, President Sall should ride on the wave of resulting legitimacy and bring all Senegalese together in a new spirit of developing the country," Adhere said."Elections should not degenerate into lawlessness including violence. Senegal is setting a good example that should be emulated by other African countries," he said.Strong economic growthSall sought re-election on the basis of strong economic growth in his first term. Since his election as president in 2012, Senegal's economic growth rate has grown to more than 6 percent, one of Africa's fastest.The national overall electricity access rate is 64 percent, one of the highest in sub-Saharan Africa, according to Sustainable Energy For All.Senegal has long been known for its peaceful transfers of power in West Africa, a region with a history of leaders clinging to power and new governments taking power through coups.In addition to enjoying strong economic growth, the Muslim-majority country has largely escaped the jihadist attacks that have destabilized neighboring countries such as Mali.Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, who was also confirmed the winner of his country's 2019 presidential election on Wednesday, congratulated Sall for winning a second term."I congratulate President Macky Sall on his re-election for a second term. There is no doubt at all that democracy has come to stay in West Africa. I wish the people of Senegal peace, stability and progress, and look forward to continuing cooperation with President Sall," Buhari said.edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily 03/02/2019 page8)

                 OSAKA - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday put forward a three-point proposal on building a closer community with a shared future between China and African countries.On the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in the Japanese city of Osaka, Xi chaired a China-Africa leaders' meeting, which was attended by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, also former African co-chair of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC); Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, also rotating chair of the African Union (AU); Senegalese President Macky Sall, current African co-chair of the FOCAC; and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.The leaders compared notes and reached a broad consensus on major issues such as deepening China-Africa cooperation, supporting the development of Africa and the work of the United Nations, and safeguarding multilateralism.Xi pointed out that the FOCAC Beijing summit held in September last year ushered in a new era of China-Africa relations.China cherishes its traditional friendship with Africa, Xi said, adding that no matter how the international situation changes and despite the interference of certain powers, the original aspirations of China and Africa for win-win cooperation and common development will stay unchanged and the resolve to jointly build a closer community with a shared future will not waver.At the China-Africa leaders' meeting, Xi put forward a three-point proposal.First, Xi called on the countries to be pioneers for win-win development so that the fruits of cooperation will benefit more Chinese and African people.The countries, he said, should align the construction of the Belt and Road with the AU's Agenda 2063, the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the development strategies of African countries, and bring more visible and tangible benefits to the peoples of China and Africa through the implementation of the outcomes of the FOCAC Beijing summit.Xi pledged that China will stay committed to the principles of sincerity, real results, affinity and good faith and the approach of pursuing the greater good and shared interests, honor its commitments to Africa to the letter, persistently support Africa's development, and make greater contributions to Africa's development and rejuvenation and African countries' joint efforts to become stronger.

                DAKAR - The market around Colobane Square in central Dakar has been a hive of activity since dawn as hundreds of buyers and sellers haggle over the latest imports from Europe.Piles of designer jackets, shirts and stonewashed jeans vie with skirts and T-shirts - all of them pre-worn.Sales of secondhand clothing, "feugue-diaye" in the Wolof language, is a vibrant business in Senegal.Each year, thousands of tons of garments tossed out by wealthier Europeans find a new home in West Africa, helping people to look good and businesses to make money."If you want cheap brand-name clothes, this is the place to come to," says Mamadou Sarr, a 23-year-old wholesaler, pointing to the bales of jeans on his stall."All these have come from England."Binta, a 29-year-old habitue of the market, says the bargains can be extraordinary."You can buy dresses, jeans, T-shirts for a low price, designer gear," she says.She contends that secondhand clothes sent from Europe are "harder-wearing" than new garments exported to Senegal from China.Retailers rummaging through the garments always have an eye out for a particular jewel: a soccer jersey, which is much prized by young Senegalese.Sarr and his older brother buy the clothing consignments for between 35,000 and 70,000 CFA francs ($60-$121), which they then sell off in 45-kilogram batches to retailers.After paying intermediaries, customs duties and transport costs, the brothers can clear as much as 450,000 CFA francs ($780) in a good month - roughly eight times the minimum monthly salary in Senegal.Senegal is just part of a global industry in recycled clothes, whose biggest exporter is the United States, with 756,000 tons yearly.Many wholesalers in Senegal get their clothes from Le Relais, a French cooperative that collects used clothing in France, the former colonial power.Le Relais sends Dakar around 500 tons of presorted used clothing per year and has a warehouse in Diamniadio, about 30 kilometers from Dakar, where its 51 employees sort another 200-250 tonnes.The garments are sifted according to category - dresses, shirts, etc. - then sorted again, graded according to their quality and state of wear."There are some goods which aren't worth anything, but the main thing which we have been trying to do is create jobs," says Virginie Vyvermans, Le Relais' deputy chief in Senegal.Profits from sale of the clothes go into local development projects and into paying the salaries of the employees, most of whom are women. All are on permanent contracts - not temporary or daily work.One of them, Marie-Helene Marome, spoke highly of her job: "I've been able to enroll my children in a private school and buy some land for a home," she says.One Le Relais wholesale customer, Aliou Diallo, 34, explained how he decided to quit his job as a grocer after the warehouse opened up."I saw a chance," says Diallo. He has seven shops and warehouses around Senegal that employ 30 people.According to Sarr, retailers often double the markup on clothing they buy from wholesalers."A trader who buys a T-shirt from me for 300 CFA francs can sell it in his shop up the road for 500, 700, 800," he says.Agence France-presse

                Benin platform makes patient histories readily accessible, KEA founder saysThree years ago, a patient died following an allergic reaction from antibiotics administered by a 25-year old Beninese doctor, Arielle Ahouansou. It then dawned on Ahouansou that knowing the patient's medical history might have improved the outcome and informed her decision. She decided to develop a solution that would make critical medical information readily accessible to doctors.With a seed capital of $1,000, in 2017 she founded KEA Medicals, a platform where a patient's medical data is interfaced with hospitals' systems using a digital identification code. Patients create a personal identity using their mobile phones and doctors can then input information about pertaining to a patient's allergies, chronic diseases, blood type and contact person during hospital visits.This was among inventions by young people that were showcased during the first Africa Business: Health Forum, held at the sidelines of Africa Union Summit in Ethiopia early this year. The event brought together government leaders, entrepreneurs and international health organizations to discuss how technology can lower costs as universal healthcare is scaled up in Africa.Africa has a health financing gap of $66 billion per annum and accounts for less than 2 percent of the nearly $9.7 trillion spent globally, according to World Health Organization. The continent accounts for 16 percent of the global population and 26 percent of the disease burden.Following underinvestment in the sector occasioned by competing priorities and donor fatigue, millions of Africans are inadvertently pushed into poverty by high medical bills. Africans pay about 36 percent of total healthcare expenditure from their pockets, according to the UN Economic Commission of Africa, or UNECA.African governments are betting on technology to accelerate equitable access to quality healthcare while addressing costs. By embracing the KEA Medical platform, Benin has driven the uptake. Eight months since its launch, more than 72,000 people and 10 hospitals in the country are using the platform, said KEA founder Ahouansou.She explained that by registering in the platform, a universal medical identity in the form of a QR code is generated, which is then imprinted in bracelets, or patches that cost $4 and $2, respectively. Doctors can then scan and access patient's medical history.The solution saves 40 percent of doctors' time, safeguards patients' healthcare, makes hospitals 40 percent more efficient and cuts down 20 percent of insurance costs, she said."It provides a low-cost solution for Africa to cut down on healthcare costs while enhancing quality of healthcare," Ahouansou said. "It can be used anywhere and so we are looking at reaching Cote d'Ivoire and Senegalese markets."The health forum in Ethiopia sought to promote public-private partnerships. With a booming population growth, Africa's health market is estimated to be $259 billion. It will be the second largest after the United States in 2030, estimates UNECA.Adama Kane, founder of JokkoSante, a Senegalese tech company, has developed a solution that would enable people to return unused medicines and help them purchase urgently needed drugs at a subsidized rate.Underpinned by the slogan, "One man's trash is another man's treasure", the platform enables people to earn points from returned drugs, which they can redeem in their next purchase of drugs. It has netted pharmacists, international organizations and the community to make medicine affordable and accessible."About 80 percent of Senegalese do not have health insurance. The situation is compounded by having some medicine not being used and ultimately expired. This is expensive for low-income families," said Kane.Success at home has fueled the desire for JokkoSante to reach 40 African countries by 2030 and manage 15 percent of health payments in pharmacies. "The pilot project is already tried and tested. It is ready for launch," Kane added.
