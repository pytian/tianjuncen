                LOS ANGELES - Chinese box-office juggernaut Ne Zha, the highest-grossing animated film ever by China, brought in more than $363,000 in its third weekend in North America, pushing its North American collections to $3.3 million.According to Box Office tracker Box Office Mojo, the film, adapted from an ancient Chinese myth, grossed $363,432 from 126 locations in the United States through Sunday with a modest $2,884 per-theater average, ranking the 23rd on the weekend box-office chart.Well Go USA Entertainment released the Mandarin-language film with English and Chinese subtitles in select 3D IMAX theaters across the United States and Canada on Aug 29, followed by other theaters on Sept 6.The film collected $1.49 million from 66 locations with a strong $22,528 per-theater average in its North American debut weekend.Jason Pfardrescher, executive vice-president of Well Go USA, told Xinhua News Agency earlier that the company had lofty expectations for the North American release of Ne Zha, adding that the film had the potential to reach $10 million at the box office in North America.Movie analyst Paul Dergarabedian at Comscore said that the success of the film in strategically planned limited release in its opening weekend was encouraging. He added that it would be hard to predict whether the film could win the hearts of nationwide audiences if expanded onto a significant number of screens.Earlier this year, Chinese homegrown science fiction blockbuster The Wandering Earth grossed $5.87 million in North America, the highest-grossing Chinese film in the region for the past five years.Ne Zha rose to No 2 in the box office earlier this month for all films ever screened on the Chinese mainland, second only to Wolf Warrior 2. Data from China's movie-ticketing platform Maoyan showed that Ne Zha grossed around 4.9 billion yuan ($691 million) to date since its July 26 debut on the Chinese mainland.Directed and written by Yang Yu (stage name Jiao Zi) in his feature film directorial debut, this homegrown animation features a popular young hero from ancient Chinese legends and classics such as Journey to the West.In the story, Ne Zha, born with unique powers, finds himself an outcast who is hated and feared; destined by prophecy to devastate the world, the boy must choose between good and evil to break the shackles of fate and become the hero he wants to be.In a video clip tweeted by Well Go USA, Jiao Zi shared his excitement with American moviegoers about the film's release in the United States."A hero from the East has come across the ocean," he said, encouraging animation fans to go and see the film.Reviews from a few local critics were quite positive. Michael Rechtshaffen, a film critic for the Los Angeles Times, wrote that the film brought "an empowering message to America"."Grafting familiar Disney and DreamWorks tropes onto a tapestry of traditional Chinese legend and lore, the adventure entertains with a title character who could be the spawn of Chucky and Stitch, from Lilo& Stitch," he added."Ne Zha leads up to a soaring finale, both with glorious large-scale action that may remind you of The Matrix Revolutions and with an emotional 'oomph' that makes sure that the fireworks matter. The whole thing is a visual spectacular (the dragons are amazing), with glorious imagery that popped on the IMAX 3D screen," commented film critic Scott Mendelson for Forbes.On the US review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Ne Zha held an approval rating of 82 percent and an audience score of 98 percent as of Tuesday.Liu Yukun contributed to this story.

                OTTAWA - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized on Wednesday for wearing brown face make-up in 2001 after an embarrassing picture emerged less than five weeks before an election in which he faces a tough fight.The image of a 29-year-old Trudeau with his face in dark make-up is a major challenge for a leader who often speaks about the need to fight racial discrimination and who has three prominent ministers of Indian descent in his cabinet."I should have known better then, but I didn't and I did it and I'm deeply sorry," Trudeau, 47, told reporters on his campaign plane in Halifax, Nova Scotia, after Time magazine published the image.Time said the image was provided by Vancouver businessman Michael Adamson earlier this month. Adamson was part of the West Point Grey Academy community where Trudeau, then 29, worked at the time, the magazine said. The picture was in the Vancouver private school's yearbook."I dressed up in an Aladdin costume and put make-up on. I shouldn't have done it," Trudeau said in comments carried live on Canadian television.The picture shows him wearing a turban and a white robe, with his face covered in dark makeup.Trudeau, questioned by reporters, also admitted he had dressed up in make-up when at high school and performed "Day O", a traditional Jamaican song about people loading bananas onto boats.Trudeau is locked in a tight battle with Conservative leader Andrew Scheer ahead of the Oct 21 federal election.Scheer said he was "extremely shocked and disappointed" by the photo."Wearing brown face is an act of open mockery and racism. What Canadians saw this evening is someone with a complete lack of judgment and integrity and someone who's not fit to govern this country," he told reporters in Quebec.Trudeau has seen his once sky-high popularity hurt by a series of missteps, including a ruling last month by a top watchdog that he had breached ethics rules by pressuring the former justice minister to ensure a major construction firm avoid a corruption trial. Reuters

                Zhuge Academy, one of the major Chinese education brands owned by Lanxum Inc, will quicken its overseas expansion to meet the rapidly growing demand for better Chinese education."We will consider entering the Asian and Middle Eastern markets after opening campuses in Canada and the US," said Shang Mei, head of international business for Zhuge Academy.The academy just opened a campus in Silicon Valley on Sept 8 (US time), its second one overseas after establishing the first in Canada in 2018. "Our quick overseas expansion is in line with the fast-growing demand for quality Chinese education overseas," Shang added.US demographic data as of 2018 shows that California is now home to a Chinese population of more than 1.8 million, of which 200,000 live in the San Francisco Bay Area.Many Chinese parents want to see their children gain proficiency in Chinese language and become acquainted with the great works of Chinese literature.Lanxum was the first Chinese learning organization to teach literary history to adolescents. And Zhuge Academy is Lanxum's overseas platform for its proprietary Mega Chinese study program. The approach for Mega Chinese is based on reforms in China's educational system, which has taken a much more holistic approach to how Chinese is taught in the country's schools."We are contacting partners in Singapore and Australia for possible cooperation but there are no specific details to disclose so far," said Zhu.The brand will provide professional and engaging Chinese education products to school-age children. In June 2018, the company announced a plan to set up an overseas subsidiary, Lanxum (USA) Limited, with operating capital of $10 million. Lanxum plans to focus on building its education portfolio around the Mega Chinese model, while continuing its exploration and development of additional markets throughout the world.Wang Jiaqi contributed to this story.
