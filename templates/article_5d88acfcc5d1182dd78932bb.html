                Xu, Meng facing big challenges
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Two of China's top ring generals are primed to expand their respective commands in a couple of boxing's most competitive divisions.First up is WBA featherweight champ Xu Can (16-2, 2 KOs), who is making his first title defense on Sunday in his hometown of Fuzhou, Jiangxi province, taking on Japanese challenger and former WBA super bantamweight titleholder Shun Kubo (13-1, 9 KOs).Then on June 1, unbeaten southpaw light heavyweight Meng "Cold Blood" Fanlong from Chifeng, Inner Mongolia (14-0, 9 KOs), will face Germany's Adam Deines (17-0, 8 KOs) in an IBF world title mandatory elimination bout in Macao.Xu became the third Chinese boxer after retired Xiong Chaozhong (WBC strawweight) and two-time Olympic gold medalist Zou Shiming (WBO flyweight) to win a major world title when he outpointed Puerto Rico's Jesus Rojas by scores of 118-110, 117-111 and 116-112 on Jan 26 in Houston, Texas.The 24-year-old, who trains at Beijing's M23 Boxing Club, dominated Rojas with a two-fisted attack highlighted by lightning four-and five-punch combinations.Along with superb lateral movement, the sheer volume of Xu's punches kept the shorter Rojas at long range for most of the fight, and the Puerto Rican was punished with uppercuts on the rare occasions he bulled his way inside.It will be difficult for Xu to replicate a similar fight plan against southpaw Kubo, who at 5-foot-9 is as tall and rangy as the champion."I am Can, so I can. This is a great chance for me to defend the world title in my hometown," Xu said when the fight was signed last month. "Shun Kubo is a good opponent and a tough boxer, but I am determined to keep the golden belt in China,"The 29-year-old Kubo took the WBA super bantamweight crown from Venezuela's Nehomar Cermeno in Tokyo on April 9, 2017, then lost it five months later when he was stopped by American Daniel Roman in his first defense.Kubo moved up to featherweight last year, and in his first test at 126 pounds he beat compatriot and current No 1 contender Hiroshige Osawa.Sunday's co-main event will feature Japan's Sho Kimura (18-2-2, 11 KOs) challenging WBA light flyweight world champion Carlos Canizales (21-0-1, 17 KOs) of Venezuela.Meanwhile, June 1 looms as the most significant fight to date for Meng, who represented China at the 2012 London Olympics. A victory over Deines would make him the No 1 mandatory challenger for the IBF world title held by Russia's Artur Beterbiev (14-0, 14 KOs)."I'm beyond excited to be fighting for the IBF Intercontinental title in Macao against a very tough opponent and, most importantly, for the IBF world title eliminator," the 31-year-old Meng said when the fight was announced."If I win, I become the top challenger to the current world titleholder. But I am not looking past Deines. He is a very strong opponent and I give him a lot of respect for taking this fight. I will do my thing one step at a time."My training camp has been fantastic. I'm in great shape and skill level. I can't wait for June 1 so everyone can see me shine once again."The bout will be Meng's first since he stopped Britain's Frank Buglioni to capture the IBF Intercontinental belt last November."I'm elated that Meng is getting a chance to prove he is an elite light heavyweight, which is one of the hottest divisions in boxing," said Roc Nation promoter Dino Duva."I've been working with Meng since I first met him on the Chinese national team over 10 years ago. He has a very tough opponent in Deines, but he has worked very hard and I'm confident we will prevail."I want to thank the IBF, IBF China and Longjoy Sports for staging this great event and giving us this chance. It's going to be a great night of boxing."

                    Xu lands 'dream' world title as dedication, diet bear fruit

                Who knew that fruit salad was the real breakfast of champions?Xu Can did.The fleet-footed featherweight from Suzhou, Jiangsu province, became the third Chinese boxer to win a professional world title by wresting the WBA crown from Puerto Rico's Jesus Rojas on Saturday night at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas.Xu, who arrived in the US on Jan 11 and trained on a fruit salad-heavy diet under coach Pedro Diaz to remain at the 126-pound limit, won a 12-round unanimous decision by scores of 118-110, 117-111 and 116-112. There were no knockdowns, and neither fighter was staggered.China Daily's scorecard had Xu winning 118-111.En route to improving to 16-2, the 24-year-old from Beijing's M23 Boxing Club dominated Rojas (26-3-2) with a two-fisted attack that saw him repeatedly land four-and five-punch combinations on the frustrated Puerto Rican, who was making his second title defense.Combined with superb lateral movement, the sheer volume of Xu's punches kept the shorter Rojas at long range for most of the fight, and on the rare occasions the Puerto Rican was able to bull his way inside, Xu punished him with vicious uppercuts.With the victory, Xu joins Xiong Chaozhong (former WBC strawweight champ) and two-time Olympic gold medalist Zou Shiming (former WBO flyweight champ) as the only Chinese boxers to win professional world titles."I was a bit slow to warm up, but I stuck with the fight plan my coaches came up with," said Xu. "They wanted me to protect my chin and keep moving right to left to stay away from Rojas' power, and that's what I did."Fighting in the same arena where Yao Ming starred for so many years with the NBA's Houston Rockets was another incentive."Yao fought on this court, so I think this is a blessed place for Chinese," said Xu. "I heard people shouting my name in Chinese to encourage me."I was so excited when the judges announced I was the winner. I have been practicing boxing since the age of 16 and have long dreamed of winning the golden belt. Today, my dream has finally come true."Zheng Lu, a member of China's national women's boxing team, is currently training in Houston. She and a few team members were part of the sold-out crowd."I'm so glad to have the opportunity to watch Xu fight for the title in the US. I'm very happy that China is also on the world stage of boxing. As a boxer myself, I'm very proud of Xu. I am learning from him by watching him fight. In my eyes he is like a warrior."Xu trained with Filipino boxing legend Genesis Servania at M23 for more than two months before traveling to the US, and the advance preparation was evident from the opening bell as Xu quickly set the pace."We did a lot preparation for this fight," said Liu Gang, a former boxer turned promoter who works with Xu in China. "Xu's coach, Pedro Diaz, has trained more than 20 world and Olympic champions. Together they did a thorough study of Rojas' style and they were fully prepared."The mission at M23 is to produce at least five more Chinese champions by the year 2023. We will work more with the international community and bring more Chinese fighters to the US because this is the world's largest boxing market."Xu said he will now concentrate on improving his strength."This is another starting point for me because there are more powerful opponents waiting," said the new world champion."I hope that when the opportunities come, I can fight the champions of the other sanctioning bodies and even challenge the WBA super champion."

                    Trump ignites Twitter war after telling minority lawmakers to 'go back' to their countries
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON -- US President Donald Trump on Sunday ignited a Twitter war with several minority Democratic lawmakers, telling them to "go back" to the "places from which they came"."Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came," Trump said in a series of tweets targeting at four Democratic lawmakers who were ethnic minorities.The members of the House of Representatives were Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley.Omar was born in Somalia and later moved to Minnesota, the other three were born in the United States, with Ocasio-Cortez of Puerto Rican descent, Tlaib born to Palestinian parents, and Pressley being an African American.Trump's tweets were immediately slammed as racism from the Democrats."This is what racism looks like. We are what democracy looks like," said Pressley. "And we're not going anywhere."House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is often at odds with the attacked congresswomen, defended her colleagues."When @realDonaldTrump tells four American Congresswomen to go back to their countries, he reaffirms his plan to 'Make America Great Again' has always been about making America white again," Pelosi said.The group of four lawmakers, sometimes known as "the squad" among peers, were often attacked by Trump for their progressive positions.According to the Pew Research Center, there are currently 52 voting members in the House and 16 members in the Senate who are immigrants or children of immigrants, and most of them are Democrats.

                    Tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans demand governor resign
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Waving flags, chanting and banging pots and pans, tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans jammed a highway Monday to demand the resignation of Gov. Ricardo Rosselló in a crisis triggered by the leak of offensive, obscenity-laden chat messages between him and his advisers.The demonstration appeared to the biggest protest on the island in nearly two decades."Finally, the government's mask has fallen," said Jannice Rivera, a 43-year-old mechanical engineer who lives in Houston but was born and raised in Puerto Rico and flew in solely to join the protest.The protest came 10 days after the leak of 889 pages of online chats in which Rosselló and some of his close aides insulted women and mocked constituents, including victims of Hurricane Maria.The leak has intensified long-smoldering anger in the US territory over persistent corruption and mismanagement by the island's two main political parties, a severe debt crisis, a sickly economy and a slow recovery from Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in September 2017."The people have awakened after so much outrage," said 69-year-old retired nurse Benedicta Villegas. "There are still people without roofs and highways without lights. The chat was the tip of the iceberg."The crowd surged along the American Expressway despite the punishing heat — toddlers, teenagers, professionals and the elderly, all dripping in sweat and smiling as they waved Puerto Rico flags large and small and hoisted signs.One group dragged a portable karaoke machine and chanted, "Ricky, resign!""This is to show that the people respect themselves," said Ana Carrasquillo, 26. "We've put up with corruption for so many years."Rosselló, a Democrat, announced Sunday evening that he would not quit, but sought to calm the unrest by promising not to seek re-election in 2020 or continue as head of his pro-statehood political party. That only further angered his critics, who have mounted street demonstrations for more than a week."The people are not going to go away," said Johanna Soto, of the city of Carolina. "That's what he's hoping for, but we outnumber him."The territory's largest newspaper, El Nuevo Dia, added to the pressure with the front-page headline: "Governor, it's time to listen to the people: You have to resign."Rosselló's secretary of public affairs, Anthony Maceira, said Monday morning he didn't knew Rosselló's whereabouts. Asked who was advising Rosselló on staying in office, Maceira said the governor was speaking with his family, and "that carries a great weight." Rosselló's father, Pedro, was governor from 1993 to 2001.Asked whether the governor should step down, President Donald Trump said that Rosselló is a "terrible" governor and that hurricane relief money sent to Puerto Rico has been "squandered, wasted and stolen" and the island's top leadership is "totally, grossly incompetent."Organizers labeled the planned road shutdown "660,510 + 1" — which represents the number of people who voted for Rosselló plus one more — to reject his argument that he is not resigning because he was chosen by the people.In a video posted Sunday night on Facebook, Rosselló said he welcomed people's freedom to express themselves. He also said he is looking forward to defending himself as Puerto Rico's legislature begins exploring impeachment."I hear you," he said. "I have made mistakes and I have apologized."The demonstrations in this territory of more than 3 million American citizens represent the biggest protest movement on the island since Puerto Ricans rallied to put an end to US Navy training on the island of Vieques more than 15 years ago.Monday was the 10th consecutive day of protests, and more are being called for later in the week. The island's largest mall, Plaza de las Américas, closed ahead of the protest, as did dozens of other businesses. The upheaval also prompted at least four cruise ships to cancel visits to Puerto Rico, and many officials worry about the effect a resignation would have on the already fragile economy.Puerto Rico is struggling to restructure part of its $70 billion in debt under federal supervision and deal with a 13-year recession through school closings, cutbacks in infrastructure maintenance and other austerity measures.At the same time, the island is trying to rebuild from Maria, which caused more than $100 billion in damage, threw Puerto Rico into a year-long blackout and left thousands dead, most of them succumbing during the sweltering aftermath.Also, the island has seen a recent string of arrests of Puerto Rico officials on corruption charges. Those arrested included the former education secretary.AP

                    Woman set to replace Puerto Rico's governor doesn't want job
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — The woman who is supposed to replace Puerto Rico's embattled governor announced Sunday that she doesn't want the job as the US territory reels from political crisis.Justice Secretary Wanda Vázquez said in a Twitter post that she hopes Ricardo Rosselló will appoint a secretary of state before resigning Aug 2 as planned.Former Secretary of State Luis Rivera Marín would have been next in line as governor, according to the US territory's constitution. But he is one of more than a dozen officials who have resigned in recent weeks since someone leaked an obscenity-laced chat in which Rosselló and close advisers insulted people including women and victims of Hurricane Maria.Rosselló on Wednesday announced that he would step down following nearly two weeks of massive protests amid anger over the chat, corruption charges against several former government officials and a 13-year recession. In the chat, the 40-year-old Democrat and son of a governor called a female politician a "whore," referred to another as a "daughter of a bitch," and made fun of an obese man with whom he posed in a photo.Rosselló became the first governor to resign in the modern history of Puerto Rico, a US territory of 3.2 million American citizens. He is more than halfway through his four-year term.Marín's resignation had left Vázquez as next in line to be governor. But she said she has already told Rosselló about her wishes not to get the job, creating a chaotic scenario about who will be Puerto Rico's next leader.If Rosselló choice for a secretary of state is not approved by the island's House and Senate, Puerto Rico's law dictates the treasury secretary would be next in line if the justice secretary doesn't become governor.But current Treasury Secretary Francisco Parés is too young at 31 years old. The constitution dictates the person would have to be at least 35, so that would leave interim Education Secretary Eligio Hernández next in line. He replaced former education secretary Julia Keleher, who resigned in April and was arrested July 10 on federal corruption charges. She has pleaded not guilty."This is crazy," political expert Mario Negrón Portillo said in a phone interview on Sunday. "We have no idea what's even going to happen tomorrow. Societies cannot live with this type of uncertainty."Vázquez's comments came less than an hour after Public Affairs Secretary Anthony Maceira resigned."There were many challenges that we had to face together as Puerto Ricans, although sometimes we differed," he said. "The work of each one of us must continue with the welfare of our island and its people as its north."The announcement comes a day before Puerto Ricans planned another march, this time against Vázquez, who is accused of not ordering an investigation into the alleged mismanagement of supplies for hurricane victims, among other things.Vázquez said on Friday that there is a lot of misinformation but that she cannot speak publicly about certain cases."The vicious attacks on my personal and professional integrity continue," she said. "The desire and agenda of some to try to undermine my credibility at this moment of transcendental importance to Puerto Rico and to destabilize the governmental order is evident."A spokeswoman for Vázquez did not immediately return a message for comment on Sunday.Aimara Pérez, a 32-year-old drafter who participated in some of the most recent marches, said she did not want Vázquez as governor."We're going to keep protesting," she said. "It's not going to stop. If there is evidence of corruption, the people are going to push ahead without fear, and we're going to get rid of them all."AP
