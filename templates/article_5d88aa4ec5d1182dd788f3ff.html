                    State-owned enterprises construct infrastructure to improve local lives

                Cooperation between China and Africa has become deeper as State-owned enterprises continue to bring Chinese technologies, capital and management experiences to Africa, experts said. Over the last several decades, China's State-owned companies have developed well in the African continent. Their revenue has grown gradually, which in turn helps increase the income of local people and the country's GDP. Their business scope has expanded to a larger scope - from infrastructural construction to energy, industrial manufacturing, transportation and finance, according to Liu Xingguo, a researcher from the China Enterprise Confederation, who made the comments to Xinhua News Agency. China Railway Construction Corp, for example, has operated in Africa for about 50 years. It built railways up to 11,000 kilometers in Nigeria, Angola and Ethiopia, as well as 4,800-km-long highways, including one expressway in Algeria. The company also built residential houses, ports and hospitals there, according to Zhuang Shangbiao, president of the company, adding that the proportion of local workers in African projects remains at 90 percent. The railway that connects Mombasa with Nairobi in Kenya is another major China-invested project. CRRC Corp not only constructed but also provided management methods to the railway. China Railway Signal and Communication Corp built its communications, signal and information parts. China Communications Construction provided operation and maintenance services. Shu Yinbiao, former chairman of State Grid Corp of China, once said that the company has 120 projects in Africa and joined energy infrastructural construction in 25 African countries, with a total contract amount up to $4.5 billion, according to a Xinhua report in September. He added Africa has advantages in developing solar power, wind power and hydropower. "After the improvement of power grids, the clean energy can meet the demand for electricity across the continent." In the past, State-owned enterprises mainly invested in infrastructural projects in Africa. Now, they transform from merely investing to helping in the sustainable development of the economy in African countries. The trend also conforms to the significant progress of the development of local technologies and economy, according to Liu. Hunan Construction Engineering Group built the first modern wrestling arena in Senegal, with an area of 18,000 square meters and can host an audience of 20,000. It also built a hydropower station in Sierra Leone and a rural primary school in Liberia. Ye Xinping, Party secretary and chairman of the company, said the economic benefit of overseas programs should go hand in hand with social benefit. The company provided one-on-one guidance to African technicians and workers. It also donated living materials and cash to families in economic difficulty.  The wrestling arena in Senegal built by the Hunan Construction Engineering Group can host an audience of 20,000.

                Private companies in China are focusing more on cooperation with Africa and hope to achieve win-win results, experts said. Their role in promoting African development and Sino-African friendships has grown in recent years and can be seen in diverse fields. Huajian Group, based in South China's Guangdong province, has built nine modern shoemaking production lines in Ethiopia that can make and export 3 million pairs of women's shoes annually. Huajian's branch in the country has created 7,500 jobs locally. King Deer, which processes cashmere, from the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, has set up five factories in Madagascar and invested $35 million. It employs nearly 6,300 local people. In the financial cooperation field, the China-Africa Development Fund based in Beijing has invested more than $4 billion in Africa and promoted Chinese companies and banks to invest and loan $17 billion. They have invested in 88 projects in 37 African countries, involving fields such as infrastructure, processing and manufacturing, benefited more than 1 million local people. The fund has promoted Chinese well-developed industries such as automobiles, electric appliances, machinery and cement to invest in Africa. Backed by the fund, about 11,000 medium and heavy trucks, 300,000 air conditioners, 450,000 refrigerators, 560,000 televisions and 1.6 million metric tons of cement produced by Chinese companies enter the African market annually. As for trade and investment help, Qingjian Group based in Qingdao in East China has established exhibition and sales centers for Chinese commodities in countries such as Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire. It wants to develop Qingdao's overseas merchandising flagship stores and has signed cooperation agreements with companies including Tsingtao Brewery. The private companies' development in Africa has promoted industrialization and urbanization and helped local young people to improve their skills, insiders said. Companies in Hunan have also played a role. Among them is Broad Homes Industrial International, based in Changsha. It is promoting construction of a real estate project in Rwanda with local governments, construction and development companies as well as thirdparty financial institutions. Rwanda became a main destination for Broad Homes to enter the African market and take part in the Belt and Road Initiative. Based on local needs, the company formulated an integrated solution involving finance, design, construction, production, development and sales for the real estate project. Liu Dong, director of operations at Broad Homes, said fabrication technologies and products are an innovation for the design standards and even the whole construction industry in Africa. He added it can not only reduce the construction duration, but also solve the problem of lack in labor. Contact the writers at songmengxing@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily 06/28/2019 page24)

                    Ebola death toll in DRC reaches 1,705
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                 The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed 1,705 people between April and July 18, according to the latest figures provided by the DRC's Ministry of Health.So far, 2,532 Ebola virus cases have been reported in the outbreak that is centered in the northeastern part of the country.According to the Doctors Without Borders, an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organization, the epidemic is by far the country's largest-ever Ebola outbreak.It's also the second biggest Ebola epidemic ever recorded, behind the West Africa outbreak of 2014-2016, where a total of 28,616 cases and 11,310 deaths were reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.An additional 36 cases and 15 deaths were reported after the disease spread to Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States.The African Union has announced that it will deploy more experts in response to the Ebola crisis.In a press conference at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Friday, John Nkengasong, the director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said they will reactivate the African Voluntary Health Corps and deploy them not just in DRC but also in other countries within the region.The health corps is a team of 800 epidemiologists, anthropologists as well as communication, laboratory and logistics experts from different African countries who are on standby for emergency deployment."The corps were very effective in response to the 2014 outbreak in West Africa. We hope they will also be very useful in the current outbreak," Nkengasong said.Nkengasong said the decision to deploy the corps was dictated by the World Health Organization's declaration, categorizing the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern."This is a declaration that is issued when an event is extraordinary, serious and has a potential to cross beyond the country where it is, and have a regional or international effect from the public health perspective," he said.Nkengasong termed insecurity and attacks on health centers and health providers as a major challenge in the affected provinces.He said the AU will be engaging the United Nations security system to improve security for experts and facilities. They will also engage the AU Peace and Security Council."We will be working with the government of the DRC very closely to better coordinate our efforts with other partners like the WHO," he added.The Doctors Without Borders has recommended that the Ebola-related activities be integrated into the existing healthcare system in order to improve proximity of the services to the community and ensure it remains functional during the outbreak.To further strengthen response to the Ebola outbreak, the AU plans to procure and provide additional equipment and supplies, strengthen cross-border surveillance and laboratory systems, and come up with a new approach to raising awareness at the community level.Investigations point to a possible start of the outbreak back in May 2018. However, the delay in the alert and subsequent response can be attributed to several factors, including a breakdown of the surveillance system, and a strike by health workers of the area, which began in May, due to the non-payment of salaries.Surveillance measures at the borders of Rwanda and Uganda have been tightened to prevent spread of the virus.The Botswana's Ministry of Health on Friday announced that it will continue to monitor the situation in the DRC as well as the entire region in consultation with the WHO's country office.However, there are concerns that the situation might get difficult if the disease spreads to South Sudan, whose health system has been weakened by the prolonged civil war.The country has sent a health team to strengthen surveillance at one of the busiest border posts, Kayain Central Equatorial state, where one case was confirmed, as reported by the Associated Press.
