                            The future of US-China ties continues to intrigue, as it is still not clear if the two will cooperate in producing global public goods Some people believe China and the United States will fall into a "Thucydides Trap" of devastating war, but I do not agree. At the same time, China's growing economic power will create problems for the US and the international order, and friction is likely over market access, forced technology transfer, State-directed industrial policies to support national champions, overcapacity, and coerced transfer of intellectual property. But no other country - including China - is about to replace the US in terms of overall power resources in the next few decades

With Chongqing municipality serving as one of its transportation hubs, the corridor uses ports in Guangxi's Beibu Gulf coasts to provide access to Singapore and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations members by sea, and links with China-Europe freight trains coming from many western Chinese cities before heading to Central Asia, South Asia and Europe. The land-sea corridor can greatly shorten the travel distance of seaward exports from China's western and even central region, according to Guangxi's officials

                             While well-intended, the focus on just reducing emissions from companies and countries is an approach we must move beyond in order to ensure a solution agenda for climate change in the future. So, when companies, cities and financial institutions attend the UN climate action summit and talk about their contributions, they will focus on their own reductions and how big emitters can reduce their emissions within existing business models, rather than how innovative new products and services lead to reductions in society. It is time to move beyond a business-as-usual approach where companies and countries only focus on reducing their existing emissions

                            The pronouncement of International Trade Secretary Liam Fox that Britain's post-Brexit free-trade deal with the EU would be the "easiest in human history" has proved to be anything but, and given the uncertainty over what divorce terms Britain will manage to secure, many international companies seem to be erring on the side of caution and drawing up plans to relocate from the UK to mainland Europe.He said that, despite the challenges posed by the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, London has always held a special allure for Chinese individuals and companies, and he expects this relationship to flourish in the years to come. His successor, Theresa May, who as home secretary had made a speech in April 2016 in which she said "remaining inside the European Union does make us more secure, it does make us more prosperous, and it does make us more influential beyond our shores", had inherited the task of overseeing Britain's departure from the EU, which is scheduled for the end of March 2019

And quoting US President Donald Trump's remark that Johnson was "Britain's Trump", Corbyn said that the failure to "take back control" ("Vote Leave" slogan during the Brexit referendum) could make the United Kingdom "a vassal state of Trump's America". "In the 98 days that remain to us, we must turbo-charge our preparations to make sure there is as little disruption as possible to our national life," Johnson said, referring to the Brexit deadline of Oct 31

                            Three weeks earlier, on Aug 2, US President Donald Trump called the protests in Hong Kong "riots" and said that it is China's business how it handles the "riots" and therefore there was no need for him to offer any advice. In other words, how does Washington justify its double standards when it comes to street violence in the US and Hong Kong?The UK government has always been poking its nose into Hong Kong affairs.On June 19, the Speaker of US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, a longtime critic of China's human rights record, called the mass demonstrations in Hong Kong "a beautiful sight to behold", despite the fact that the "beautiful sight" soon turned into a freak show of extreme actions that rocked the global financial hub for the following two months

The incidents, along with the violent robbery of a German tourist two days earlier, prompted Barcelona's deputy mayor, Albert Batlle, to describe the situation as "a crime crisis". Britain's Sun newspaper said the city had 115,014 reported crimes between January and June, including murders, sex attacks, gang fights, and a spree of thefts on the metro transportation system

The bill-signing prompted a round of applause from first responders in the Rose Garden as well as Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who was mayor of New York City during the attacks and was widely praised for his leadership in the aftermath of the World Trade Center collapse

Given its advantage in national strength, India should adopt a strategy of restraint while trying to better understand Pakistan's complex political landscape and security situation.
