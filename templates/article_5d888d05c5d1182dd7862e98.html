                Sharapova will miss China dates
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Maria Sharapova is shutting down her season and will withdraw from the three tournaments in which she was set to compete later this year, including two in China.The Russian star is looking to get some rest and will not participate in Beijing's China Open, the Tianjin Open or the VTB Kremlin Cup in Moscow.Sharapova reportedly plans to start her 2019 campaign at the season-opening Shenzhen Open－the same event where she began this season and put together one of her best runs of the year to reach the semifinals.The 31-year-old had a mixed bag of results at Grand Slams in 2018.She reached the quarterfinals at the French Open, the last 16 at the US Open, the last 32 at the Australian Open and was bounced in the opening round at Wimbledon.Shamil Tarpishchev, president of the Russian Tennis Federation, on Monday confirmed earlier media reports that Sharapova has decided to close the season and pull out of her scheduled tournaments.Asked whether this information was true, Tarpishchev said it was "a 50-50 situation regarding Sharapova, but after consulting with doctors she decided to close the season ahead of time and to concentrate on her health"."She made the decision to start the next season in her optimal physical condition," he added."However, it is still possible that she would simply come to Moscow (for the Kremlin Cup) as she had planned to do, but in the capacity of an honorary guest."Two weeks ago, Sharapova was knocked out of the US Open after a straight-sets defeat to Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro.Sharapova had won 23 consecutive matches under the lights, including her previous three contests this year, but Suarez Navarro, on her 30th birthday, clinched a 6-4, 6-3 victory.Sharapova's next scheduled tournament was expected to be the Kremlin Cup from Oct 11-21.TASS

                    Alibaba payment company forms alliance with Russia's VTB bank
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Russia's leading bank, VTB is now the foreign exchange provider for e-commerce transactions carried out in Russia on the Alibaba business-to-consumer website Aliexpress.com. The strategic partnership between the two parties was signed on Thursday during the World Economic Forum in Davos. Riccardo Orcel, deputy CEO of VTB Group, said that VTB formed a strategic alliance with Ant Financial Services Group for the Russian market, and both companies will work closely on payment and banking services in Russia, to provide a comprehensive and reliable shopping experience for Russian consumers. However, there are more potential opportunities in emerging economies for cooperation in the future between the two companies.   The ceremony was attended by VTB Group President and Chairman Andrey Kostin, Founder and Executive Chairman of Alibaba Group, Jack Ma and Chief Executive Officer of Ant Financial Services Group, Lucy Peng. Ant Financial is a New York Stock Exchange listed company, and was founded as the financial service provider of Alibaba. "Alibaba is not just an e-commerce company, they have impressive financial services technology that they are already deploying, with recent investments in The Post Office of Singapore for example. And they are of course a leader in e-commerce, supported by their significant logistics network that delivers products to their growing client base," Orcel said.  Orcel explained that it is not only through competitive pricing that e-commerce gaining ground against competitors, but also through providing a high quality, broad product base and ensuring reliable and speedy delivery. Alibaba has a demonstrated track record and this is ensuring quick success in Russia. VTB is partnering with China's largest e-commerce company and the landmark agreement will help to ensure that Ant Financial's and Alibaba's business potential is maximized by providing best price of the transactions, settlement services and best choice of financial instruments.  Orcel said he is impressed with Alibaba's growth in Russia through its business-to-consumer platform Aliexpress.com. Although the platform is only two years old in Russia, it is one of the fastest growing e-commerce platforms in the country, and ranks around seventh in terms of the number of website visitors. "Alibaba is number one in the world, and Russian consumers will benefit from the company's growth plans in the country. E-commerce continues to grow and this is a secular trend that goes beyond economic cycles,” Orcel said. His team is also looking for opportunities to work with Ant Financial in other countries, using VTB's international operations and experience to help Ant Financial with commercial, corporate and investment banking services.VTB Group's investment banking operations for China operate from Hong Kong, and the bank has a fully licensed branch in Shanghai. It is the only Russian bank on the Chinese mainland and represents a priority for VTB's international growth plans.Orcel said, he believes Russia-China trade and investment relationships have great potential to grow, and VTB hopes to play a significant role in financing these opportunities.He said key sectors for cooperation include energy, power, and infrastructure, where Chinese investors are keen to invest in Russian projects with good returns. Russian companies are turning towards Chinese products in several sectors including for example technology and telephone equipment provided by global leaders in the sector such as Huawei.

                    Russia expects a surge in Asian investment
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Russia's "pivot to East" continues, which will make Russia-China ties even more dynamic through bilateral trade, cross-border initiatives and corporate deals. Russia's economic recovery, along with Asian institutional and private investors' decision to venture overseas, is creating a positive trade and investment environment.The International Monetary Fund predicts strong near-term Asian outlook. Despite potential tighter monetary policy and curbs on domestic asset prices, China's GDP is still expected to grow 6.5 percent a year and the country is expected to be a leading cross-border investor by 2020, with global offshore assets tripling to nearly $20 trillion. And China's global stock of outbound foreign direct investment, including investment in corporate mergers and acquisitions, and startups, may increase to about $2 trillion by 2020.There is also a rapidly growing pool of Asian capital that must be invested. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, assets under management in the Asia-Pacific region will increase from $7.7 trillion in 2012 to $16.2 trillion by 2020. Pension fund assets alone will grow by 9.5 percent a year to $6.5 trillion by 2020.

                Chinese mobile payment service Alipay is now available in two large Russian shopping malls in the wake of a rapid increase in Chinese tourists. According to Russian newspaper Vedomosti, Moscow Central Shopping Mall, Tsum, and St. Petersburg Leningrad Shopping Mall, DLT, have already provided QR codes at cashier desks, and consumers are able to pay by scanning through the Alipay smartphone app. Statistics from Mercury Group, which runs both malls, show that in the past half-year, Tsum and DLT saw three times the number of foreign customers, 90 percent of them from China. "As we know, Alipay is quite a popular payment service in China. Therefore, we decided to cooperate with them and started this new payment service for our Chinese customers," says Pavlov Alexandra, chief executive officer of Tsum. The director of Alipay in Russia and other parts of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Bogdan Zadorozhny, says more than 1.5 million Chinese tourists visited Russia in 2016, each spending an average $4,000. Zadorozhny says the payment service in the malls is only available for Chinese citizens in Russia, because Alipay has cross-border business cooperation links with Russian banks. "In the future, we will apply for the formal registration to the Russian financial authority so that the payment option will be open to Russian buyers," Zadorozhny says. Zadorozhny does not reveal much about the plan, but says Russian VTB Bank may be interested in joining. Pavlov says cooperation with Alipay will make the shopping malls more attractive to Chinese tourists. The two malls have accepted UnionPay since 2015 to meet the needs of an increasing number of Chinese customers. And they are not the first Russian companies to have introduced new policies to attract Chinese tourists. Aeroflot, the largest airline in Russia, also started accepting Alipay payments on its website this month. Igor Temelkin, a partner at Doloitte Consulting, says Russian businesses are increasingly catering to the interests of Chinese buyers. He says it is becoming more common to see Chinese advertisements in Moscow and more Chinese-speaking Russians working as guides in Russia. It is therefore logical that the Chinese payment service should be adopted by more Russian stores, he adds. "Chinese are the most active luxury consumers in the world, and the devaluation of the Russian rouble seemed like good news for them. There has been a 50 percent devaluation of the rouble against the renminbi since 2014, so luxury goods are much cheaper here to Chinese tourists compared to other European countries," he says. Now the Chinese payment service is in negotiation with more Russian shopping malls to spread Alipay throughout Russia within months. "We are also talking with Moscow public transportation authorities, and maybe in the near future tourists will be able to use mobile payment to buy bus or metro tickets," Zadorozhny says. Meanwhile, Alipay has been available in two German-speaking countries - Austria and Switzerland - since June after entering the German market last year. Concardis, a German payment service and Alipay's partner in these countries, helped Alipay become available in the 20 stores belonging to Goessl, a traditional clothing brand in Austria. Furthermore, the mobile payment service from China will be officially launched in Switzerland in October, according to Liu Yiu, the director of Alipay for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. renqi@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 07/21/2017 page24)

                    Big Four banks more influential than BRICS' peers

                An employee counts yuan banknotes at a bank in Huaibei, Anhui province, June 22, 2010. [Photo/Agencies]Based on the new index in the report, titled East or West, Home is Best? — Are banks becoming more global or local?, the Standard Bank of South Africa took the second spot, India's Bank of Baroda the third, VTB Bank of Russia the 4th and Bank Bradesco of Brazil the 16th rank.The report said the four big State-owned banks, BOC, China Construction Bank (CCB), Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) have proven to be more influential and better recognized globally than their peers from developing economies. The ICBC occupied the fifth spot, the report said."2016 has witnessed the sluggish recovery of the world economy and increasing policy uncertainty risks across the globe. China's economy maintained a slower but stable performance. With the supply-side structural reform pushing forward domestically, the Belt and Road Initiative, and cooperation with the BRICS economies were also strengthened," said Professor Ben Shenglin, dean of AIF. Within the BRICS, India and South Africa each had three banks in the top 10; while both China and Russia had two banks. But the disparity is less obvious among the developing economies with BRICS economies receiving a mean BII value of 10.38, according to the report.Three indicators: stock of overseas assets; performance of overseas operations; and global market layout were studied in the BII. The banks included not only multinational banks with a large number of overseas assets, but also medium- and small-sized shareholding commercial banks just starting to expand overseas. The report drew from a diverse data set including 49 international banks in Europe, America, Asia and Africa.The dynamics of BII index can be "a good reflection of the development of bank internationalization over the past decade,” Ben said.The BII index has been fluctuating within a 23-26 range over the past decade, trending downward in the aftermath of the financial crisis around 2009 but started picking up in 2013, followed by a slowdown in 2015 due to the sluggish global economy, according to the report.Banks from developed economies have maintained a stable and high level of internationalization, the report said. However, as developing economies have been catching up with remarkable achievements, the gap has been narrowing gradually year-on-year.

                    Kremlin slams reported UK plans to ban Russian Eurobond sales as 'damaging
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                British Foreign Affairs Select Committee Chairman Tom Tugendhat has claimed that a bevy of Russian banks which are currently affected by sanctions use loopholes in the legislation of EU and UK countries in order to act as organizers of Russian bond issuance.The possible ban on sales of Russian Eurobonds on the London stock market will damage UK reputation among investors, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday."Of course, this is a very important issue which is related to the reputation of countries as stable economic partners."When asked if Russia plans to react to the UK suggestions, circulating in the media, to limit the investors’ access to the Russian sovereign debt through international clearing systems, Peskov noted that "it is difficult for us to suppose what other options could be considered [by London in relation to Russian sovereign debt], what they could be based upon and what can serve as a disguise for them."The statement followed a report by The Guardian, saying that UK Prime Minister Theresa May plans to consider the proposal to prohibit the sale of Russian bonds through the City of London's clearing houses, which help finance Russia's sovereign debt.The move was earlier initiated by Foreign Affairs Select Committee Chairman Tom Tugendhat, who pointed the finger at several sanctioned Russian banks, including VTB, which he claimed are behind the issue of Russian bonds due to UK and EU legislation.Calling for the loopholes to be scrapped, Tugendhat also warned that Russian bond sales should not be placed at major western clearing houses Euroclear and Clearstream, a proposal that was supported by UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.Critics cast doubt on the possible clampdown, suggesting that Moscow may urge China to help it deal with Russia's reported 122-billion dollar domestic debt plus 38 billion dollars more in Eurobonds.Earlier, Sergei Strigo, head of emerging market debt and currencies at Amundi Asset Management, told Bloomberg that they "still like Russia as an investment opportunity" and that he he "doesn't see any reason" for the current political tensions to change his stance on Russia as a target for investments.Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May reacts as the leader of the Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn responds to her address to the House of Commons on her government's reaction to the poisoning of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, in London, March 14, 2018The remarks came after Theresa May commented on the expulsion of Russian diplomats from about 20 European countries as well the US and Canada after the Salisbury incident.May added that in connection with the expulsions, the UK Interior Ministry is reviewing tier one (entrepreneur) visas, which were issued to roughly 700 Russians in 2008-2015.Moscow vehemently rejects London's accusations of Russia's alleged involvement in the poisoning of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Britain's Salisbury on March 4.

                The coming meeting between Premier Li Keqiang and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev will enable deeper cooperation in various areas between China and Russia, said Andrey Kostin, CEO of VTB Bank, Russia's largest financial group.Kostin said he is glad to see that the two countries are natural economic partners with good prospects ahead.China is Russia's largest foreign trade partner, and the bilateral trade volume, which last year increased by 25 percent to reach $110 billion, has been growing steadily, Kostin told China Daily.Li and Medvedev's meeting will help further bolster cooperation in such areas as energy, agriculture, innovations and finance, Kostin said."We also see immense potential for our countries in docking major projects within the Belt and Road Initiative and those within the Eurasian Economic Union to promote regional economic integration," he said.Russia supports the BRI, proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said it is timely, promising and in line with the goals of Russia's Eurasian Economic Union.
