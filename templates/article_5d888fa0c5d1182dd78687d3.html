                New AI-planned bus route launched in Shanghai
            </p>
            <p>
                The first bus route planned through artificial intelligence technology in Shanghai began operation on Monday, bringing commuters a better riding experience with lower charges and less time spent on the road.Based on traffic data collected from a variety of ways such as scanning QR codes to pay fares and using digital maps, the AI algorithm found a suitable line to set up operation for the public buses between Songjiang district and Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park about 50 kilometers away, where many people shuttle back and forth every day.Featuring no bus stop en route, the customized Songjiang-Zhangjiang No 9 route offers nonstop bus trip between the dwelling districts and the office buildings, which saves commuting time for office workers.Passengers can book bus tickets in advance on Alipay, China's leading mobile and online payment service, and can make sure they have a seat on bus.One commuter surnamed Dai used to take the metro to travel between the two districts, and it took her almost two hours each way. While pregnant, she had to commute by taxi where a single trip cost around 150 yuan ($21).With the new route, she can now arrive half an hour earlier at work from home compared with using the metro with a single fare of only 18 yuan."It's very cost-effective," said Dai."I no longer need to feel like a sardine packed in among so many passengers on the metro. Everyone has a seat on the bus and I can even take a nap on the way," she added.

                Making the vital difference in everyday life

                Electronic options to send and receive money are putting more Chinese businesses on the path of sustainable developmentEditor's note: China has made commendable progress in various business and industry sectors in the 70 years since the founding of the PRC. China Daily is publishing a series of articles to highlight the giant strides. E-payment is considered one of the four major great inventions in modern China. The following articles trace the evolution of payment and how it has made a significant difference to people's lifestyle and the international community.Laurent Francois, a 38-year-old Swiss traveler and Mandarin learner, was stumped when a waitress at the Starbucks shop in downtown Shanghai's West Nanjing Road asked him Weixin, or WeChat Pay.Francois had expected the question to be "cash or credit card" even as he handed out a 100 yuan ($14.1) note to pay for an iced latte. "Every other customer is using his/her phones for payment and I feel like an outsider."The fact that China is "light years "ahead of other countries in mobile payments has been somewhat commonplace, thanks to massive media coverage, more foreigners flocking to the country and a growing number of outbound travelers taking the mobile payment culture overseas.A closer look at the various payment paths that China has taken in the past few decades indicates that the country is fast becoming a post-money society.Before the 1990s, or roughly the period known as the planned economy era, when manufacturing and distribution of products were decided purely by government, there was no such thing as "spending at one's disposal". Purchases of goods were mainly based on a variety of ration coupons, limited in quantity and issued by authorities for rice, flour, oil, clothes, electronic appliances, among others."The ration coupons, issued starting from the 1950s when food and other commodities were scarce, helped us understand the real life of Chinese at that time," said Zhang Letian, a sociologist at Fudan University.As China finally introduced the policy of reform and opening-up and abolished the coupon system, more Chinese had the financial leeway to buy goods as they wished on the back of an increasingly open market. Since the 1990s, cash has dominated the payment scene for a substantial span of time.While bank cards, especially credit cards, were being introduced to the market, unlike the West, China still lacked an entrenched credit card culture. The cash-based society is largely resilient despite occasional malaises such as banknote forgery.The recent game-changer emerged in the early 2000s, when an epidemic known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome swept much of China and forced people to stay at home. Such incidents unexpectedly boosted the development of e-commerce, and with the precarious jump in online sales, calls for secure, carefree, no-face-to-face transaction became imminent.Launched in 2004 initially as an online payment and escrow service, Alipay addressed the payment dilemma encountered by Alibaba's online marketplace, Taobao."At the turn of the 21st century, China had no deep-rooted credit card culture. Smaller online businesses with relatively low sales volumes were unable or unwilling to accept credit card payments due to high transaction fees, and it was too costly to build their own e-commerce checkout systems with sufficient fraud protection," said Li Chao, an analyst at consultancy iResearch.So Alipay's early mission was to create an encrypted digital wallet that stored and safeguarded bank cards and enabled customers to make payments via their accounts. Besides, the money would not reach the sellers until customers had confirmed they had received the goods, therefore addressing the trust issue commonly faced by merchants and buyers who haven't met in real life.One could argue that it was Taobao, the online marketplace, that gave birth to Alipay. Yet the payment service did not stand still but chose to ride the two critical commercial trends: the mobile payment boom and the online-to-offline wave.The early adoption of the mobile wallet has given Alipay an early advantage as faster internet connection populated smartphones and made the gadget a ubiquitous avenue for everyday life. An accompanying development is the design of Quick Response code payment, which allowed offline partnering stores to accept payment in real time by scanning the code and make the transaction.It's fair to say the market would not have exploded to its current scale were it not for rivals challenging the status quo. WeChat Pay, a once obscure arm of messaging app WeChat, arrived on the mobile payment scene as a latecomer, but quickly populated the mobile payment habit banking on traditions derived from the Chinese Lunar New Year greetings－giving and receiving "red packets" containing real money as a way to show blessings and appreciation.The campaign to replace real red envelopes containing cash with virtual envelopes has not only helped many install WeChat, but more importantly, bound their bank accounts to WeChat's virtual wallet that they can later use to pay utilities, order taxis, book the doctor's appointment and even get marriage licenses."These payment services in particular helped encourage adoption by running cash prize promotions and other discounts tied to the Lunar New Year holiday," said Rahul Chadha, senior analyst at consultancy eMarketer. "Mobile payment use has also been hastened by the widespread adoption of QR codes in China, which lower the cost barrier for merchants and make processing transactions dead simple for shoppers."

                Preview of
            </a>
            <p>
                In a hall of Peking University, more than 2,000 students became the first batch of Chinese to have a sneak preview of Me and My Motherland, an anthology feature co-directed by seven renowned auteurs.With Chen Kaige as the chief director and Huang Jianxin as head of producers, the movie consists of seven short tales, respectively directed by Chen, Ning Hao, Xu Zheng, Guan Hu, Xue Xiaolu, Zhang Yibai and Wen Muye, all credited for award-winning classics or box office hits.The feature screened at Peking University is titled Hello, Beijing, about a taxi driver who gets a ticket of the opening ceremony of 2008 Beijing Olympics. Though he planned to give it as a birthday gift to his son, who had been estranged from him for a long time, the good-hearted man gives the ticket to another child.Ge You, one of the best actors in his era, plays the driver, in his first work with director Ning, known for noir comedies.The story set in August 2008 features a touch of nostalgia. Ge uses his sense of humor to vividly interpret a streetwise Beijing native.Director Xu's story looks back at the moment when China women's volleyball national team defeated the United States to win the Los Angeles Olympic Games gold in 1984. The tale is told through the perspective of a group of ordinary Shanghai residents, who gathered in an alley to watch the live broadcast on a TV set.The triumph marked the first Olympic gold for China women's volleyball team and their feats, after that, winning the World Cup in 1981 and the World Volleyball Championships in 1982.A few days after the Peking University event, the seven directors and some of their cast members appeared in seven cities simultaneously on Sept 13 to promote the movie, a tribute to the 70th anniversary of New China.
