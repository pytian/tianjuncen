                Defeating malaria in Comoros
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Eradicating the once prevalent disease in the African country is one of the 60 cooperative projects with China that have helped bolster ties Comoros, an African country located in the southwest Indian Ocean, is known as the Islands of the Moon. It is a mysterious country with beautiful natural scenery, where kind and hospitable people have created a profound culture. But malaria was a major public health problem in Comoros, causing huge losses and hindering local economic and social development. However, the Chinese government, a good friend of Comoros, has provided assistance to improve public health in this country, and combating malaria is one of the 60 cooperation projects that the Chinese government has launched and supported in the country over the past 44 years. China was the first country to recognize the independence of the Union of the Comoros, as the country is officially called. Since diplomatic ties were established on November 13, 1975, bilateral relations have developed smoothly, with expanding exchanges and increasing cooperation. The malaria project is a good example of this. In Comoros, malaria was regarded as a demon bringing pain and torment. Fonad Muheji, former vice-president of Comoros, once mentioned that three members in his family suffered from malaria and had to go to hospital each month. Two to four people in every family were found infected with malaria. In 2006, malaria was detected in 108,000 of the 800,000 people in the country. In other words, 142 out of every 1,000 people had malaria. In hospitals, malaria patients accounted for over 38 percent of outpatients and 60 percent of inpatients. Since 2004, anti-malaria experts from China have analyzed the previous anti-malaria efforts and innovated concepts and methods based on the actual situation in the islands, such as serious infection areas, and the life cycle and transmission characteristics of mosquitoes. The experts then launched the anti-malaria project with medication combining artemisinin and piperaquine, which can flush out parasites and block the source of infection. Initially, the Chinese experts encountered many difficulties, namely a lack of cooperation from the authorities and of understanding among residents. However, they did not flinch. The experts visited local governments to win their support, and put great effort into training and educating the population about malaria prevention and nationwide medication, using the media as a channel of communication. Posters and banners about malaria prevention can now be seen across the nation. This has helped generate a good atmosphere while motivating all parties. "We conducted field research day and night, going to each household to publicize the knowledge about malaria prevention," said Deng Changsheng, one of the Chinese experts. "We also helped to set up special teams composed of local people to visit villages and persuade prestigious elders to support our work. Taking the Island of Moheli as an example, we visited its 27 villages, some of which even the president has perhaps not visited." These efforts have won the support of the relevant authorities and people's trust in Comoros. It also dispelled doubts and worries of primary medical institutions. In November 2007, after more than two years of preparation, the anti-malaria project was introduced into the Island of Moheli. The then president of Comoros gave a speech and took the drug as a demonstration to others. Such efforts were also promoted in the other islands, Anjouan and Grande Comore, in 2012 and 2013, respectively, achieving huge success. The infection of malaria was eliminated in Anjouan and the basic control has been realized in Grande Comore. According to statistics, the antimalarial team has sent 200 people to Comoros, trained 236 personnel for malaria prevention and control and nearly 4,000 anti-malaria workers at village-level. By 2014, the country finally achieved zero deaths from malaria, with the number of people infected declining 98 percent and the new infection rate 0.28 percent. "ZERO PALU, JE M'ENGAGE! (ZERO MALARIA, START FROM ME!)" This slogan has appeared frequently in the major news media and is popular among the public now. The Chinese team is preparing for another round of island wide medication in Grande Comore from September to October. The anti-malaria campaign has lasted 12 years, proof that the Chinese plan finally won acceptance with its excellent results. The anti-malaria project has grown into a highlight of cooperation between Comoros and China. Reported by the international media, its experience and approach have caught the attention of the world. The fruits of the project were reported by Clinical Infectious Diseases, a leading international journal of infectious diseases. The nationwide medication of artemisinin combined with piperaquine was recorded by the World Health Organization. At present, the experience has been promoted in Sao Tome and Principe, Papua New Guinea, Kenya, Togo and Gambia. In 2018, in order to help Comoros clear the remaining malaria sources on Grande Comore and fulfill the commitment of zero malaria to the Comoros government by 2021, the Chinese government again offered help by setting up an expert team for the project. It has been strongly supported by the Comoros government, which equipped it with local technical strength. The government also took the initiative to mobilize the public and enhanced exchanges with local residents. The project was also supported by the World Health Organization, which actively participated in the assessment at all stages during implementation, together with urging Comoros to establish and maintain an effective anti-malarial system. Through the joint efforts of China, Comoros and international organizations, it is believed that zero malaria can become a reality in Comoros. And once the country shakes off the stigma of malaria, it can once again showcase its unique charms to the world. The author is the Chinese ambassador to Comoros.

                On a sunny day in Guinea-Bissau, Gao Chao gorged on fresh oysters alone while his family celebrated Spring Festival thousands of kilometers away in Chongqing, southwestern China.The West African country was the 32-year-old's 150th destination in a globe-trotting lifestyle that has seen him spend most of his life on the road since 2014.On Feb 5, the first day of the Lunar New Year, he uploaded a short video of a Bissau-Guinean man saying "Hello, happy new year" in Chinese on his WeChat and Douyin accounts."I seem addicted to life on the road and I just can't stop traveling," Gao said.He first traveled overseas when he went to the United Kingdom in 2008 to pursue a postgraduate degree in geological engineering at the University of Birmingham.In order to travel as much as possible, he has been freelancing since graduation."I don't like being confined to one place," he said. "I want to be around to see the world."He decided to start his globe-trotting in 2014, using savings from part-time jobs.Like most travelers, Gao first focused on visiting famous natural landscapes and scenic spots. However, he soon found the local cultures and everyday life in foreign countries more interesting."Now, I like to visit local farmers markets and meet people on the streets," he said.To communicate with and get close to local people, Gao has been an active member of Couchsurfing, a hospitality and social networking platform that helps travelers find free accommodation and meet new people of all races. He estimates that he has slept on over 200 couches in about 80 countries and regions."Almost all the Couchsurfing hosts can speak some English, so I can learn about the local culture and history from them," he said.Gao cooks Chinese cuisine for the host families in their homes, especially the specialty hotpot from his hometown."Traveling is not just about what you see but the people you meet," he said, adding that he loves continent hopping to avoid "aesthetic fatigue"."I will travel in Europe for two months, for instance," he said. "Then, I will go to Africa for a change."On his latest adventure, Gao left Chongqing in mid-October after a short break at home, bound for the Philippines. He then passed through the Middle East and Europe on his way to his main destination－West Africa.So far, he has visited Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Guinea."I want to get to know the real Africa through my own eyes," he said. "I don't believe in stereotypes."He said that although life in West Africa was difficult, people were generally happy and polite, and the land and sea yielded a rich array of produce.His five years on the road have cost him about 500,000 yuan ($73,770) as he has worked on perfecting the art of budget travel.Gao said he plans to continue traveling, with the aim of visiting as many places as possible."The world is so big and different," he said. "Traveling teaches me to keep an open mind."

                    Africa's free trade area comes into force as Gambia ratification
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The much awaited Africa Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA), which is expected to scale up intra-trade, will finally come into force after The Gambia ratified it on Tuesday.It is the 22nd country to so. The agreement, enacted one year ago by 44 African heads of state and governments in Kigali, Rwanda, needed a minimum of 22 countries to ratify for it to come into effect.The CFTA seeks to create the largest trade zone in the world. According to UN Economic Commission of Africa (UNECA), it is expected to increase intra-African trade by 52 percent by the year 2022 and remove tariffs on 90 percent of goods.Lamin Jobe, Gambia's trade Minister, while presenting the motion before lawmakers said it will address the country's international trade difficulties."This document will definitely serve as a take-off point to enhance the free movement of people, good and services. By using this there is a lot of advantages that we can gain from the implementation of this agreement," he said.Celebrating the occasion, Vera Songwe, the executive director of UNECA called it a golden moment, on her twitter handle. "Breaking geographic, logistic & regulatory barriers #theafricawewant @ECA_OFFICIAL @_AfricanUnion @AUTradeIndustry @ATPC Impossible until it is done" N. Mandela'."Albert Muchanga, the commissioner for Trade and Industry at the Africa Union also took to his twitter account. "Good news! The Parliament of The Gambia has APPROVED ratification of #AfCFTA Agreement making us meet the minimum threshold. The AfCFTA market is being born and is one step ready for launch of its operational phase in July this year."The CFTA is expected to remove trade barriers, increase investments in industrialization and infrastructure expansion and consequently create jobs for the world's fastest growing labor force.

                    Gambia ratifies African trade zone treaty

            <p class="style-content">
                Infrastructure helps make East Africa most integrated region in the continentThe recent ratification by Gambia's legislature of the Continental Free Trade Area agreement, or the CFTA, means the ambitious initiative has entered the implementation phase.The agreement, signed by 49 out of the 55 members of the African Union, needed legislative ratifications by at least 22 countries for the treaty to enter into force.As experts celebrated the milestone across the continent, member states now face the arduous task of deciding how to further open their borders to neighboring countries.The CFTA seeks to create the largest trade zone in the world. According to the United Nations Economic Commission of Africa, the zone is expected to increase intra-African trade to 25 percent from the current level of 15 percent to 18 percent and to remove tariffs on 90 percent of goods.Latest data from the 2019 African Regional Integration Index still shows suppressed levels of intratrade. The report, published by the UN commission, reveals that three-quarters of intra-African exports are concentrated in just 13 countries. South Africa captures 45 percent of that share.The report also shows that the Southern African Development Community has recorded the highest intra-trade in Africa, with South Africa being the most integrated country on the continent. The East African Community continues to be the most integrated region supported by enhanced infrastructure network.Meanwhile, integration in services, contributed more than 53 percent to the continent's GDP, but ratification of the protocol on the free movement of people has been slow, despite the 2016 launch of the Common Electronic Biometric African Passport, and the Africa Union's Protocol on Free Movement of Persons.Leila Mokadem, country manager and resident representative in Morocco for the African Development Bank, said that despite the "tremendous" political support for the agreement, major challenges lay ahead. This is in terms of implementation and pushing the agenda forward to meet the goal of increasing intra-African trade.Challenges such as weak productive capacity, high production costs, large infrastructure deficits and other challenges that affected Africa's competitiveness abound. This is compounded by the number of small markets and 16 landlocked countries."We cannot gloss over the challenges, but it is important to underscore the fact that it cannot be business as usual if Africa is to progress," she said.Stephen Karingi, director of regional integration at the Economic Commission of Africa, said his agency together with the African Union have developed guidelines of the implementation of the CFTA according to individual countries' national strategies."We are assisting 15 countries to draw up their implementation strategies. This has been developed based on the macro of the economy, the economic profile and its comparative advantages. So that when a country does its scheduling on the areas it wants to open to the other economies, it understands its needs."Karingi said that the landlocked countries depend heavily on trade to accelerate economic growth. African countries make up 33 of the 47 listed in the Vienna Protocol for landlocked countries, and also 50 percent of the land locked developing countries globally. "These countries need capacity development and access to markets to meet their development goals," he said.He recommended the implementation of e-commerce as a way to overcome some trade-related barriers such as distances. This would need several other obstacles to be tackled such as lack of postal services and logistics services, lack of credible means of payment and low rates of computer and internet literacy.The CFTA is expected to remove trade barriers, increase investments in industrialization and infrastructure expansion and consequently create jobs for the world's fastest growing labor force.

We also welcome the participation of Secretary-General António Guterres of the United Nations and Managing Director Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund. The Leaders' Roundtable was chaired by President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China.2. We met at a time when the world economy is facing both expanding opportunities and rising challenges, complicated by profound and rapid changes in the world. We reaffirm that strengthening multilateralism remains essential in addressing global challenges. We also believe that an open, inclusive, interconnected, sustainable and people-centered world economy can contribute to prosperity for all.3. Recalling the Joint Communique of the Leaders' Roundtable of the 1st Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, including the cooperation objectives, principles and measures contained therein, and reaffirming our commitment to the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we reiterate that promoting peace, development and human rights, mutually-beneficial cooperation, and honoring the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and international law are our common responsibilities; achieving strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth and improving people's quality of life are our common goals; creating a prosperous and peaceful world with shared future is our common aspiration.4. The ancient Silk Road contributed to the strengthening of the connectivity and the expansion of the world economy in the spirit of promoting peace and cooperation, openness, inclusiveness, equality, mutual learning and mutual benefit. We look forward to restoring and rejuvenating such spirit, through the Belt and Road Initiative and other cooperation frameworks and initiatives.5. As cooperation partners, we appreciate the progress already made and important opportunities created in the Belt and Road cooperation, especially the outcomes in areas such as development policy synergy, increased infrastructure investment, economic corridors, economic and trade cooperation zones, industrial parks, finance and trade cooperation, innovation and technology, maritime cooperation, business-to-business ties, people-to-people and cultural exchange. Such cooperation explores new sources of growth and offers potential for economic and social development, and contributes to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.6. Looking into the future, we envisage high-quality Belt and Road cooperation in enhancing connectivity by promoting development policy synergy, infrastructure development, unimpeded trade, financial cooperation and people-to-people bond, thereby enhancing practical cooperation for the well-being of our peoples. In this context, we look forward to more efforts by cooperation partners.・ Such cooperation will be based on extensive consultation, joint efforts, shared and mutual benefits. We emphasize the importance of the rule of law and equal opportunities for all. We endeavor to move on with policy and project cooperation through voluntary participation and consensus-building, based on common responsibility and outcomes. All states are equal partners for cooperation that respects openness, transparency, inclusiveness and level playing field. We respect sovereignty and territorial integrity of each other and affirm that each country has the right and primary responsibility to define its development strategies in accordance with its national priorities and legislation.・ Such cooperation will be open, green and clean. We embrace open economy and inclusive, non-discriminatory global market. All interested countries are welcome to join in such cooperation. We underline the importance of promoting green development and addressing the challenges of environmental protection and climate change including by enhancing our cooperation to implement the Paris Agreement. We encourage more efforts in building a culture of integrity and combating corruption.・ Such cooperation will pursue high standard, people-centered and sustainable development. We will work together in line with our national legislation, regulatory frameworks, international obligations, applicable international norms and standards. We believe that relevant cooperation should be people-centered and conducive to inclusive quality economic growth and broad-based improvement of people's livelihood. We are committed to promoting sustainability in all its dimensions.7. We start from the conviction that connectivity contributes to boosting growth, economic and social development, trade in goods and services, as well as investment and creating employment opportunities and better communication and exchanges among peoples. In this regard, promoting global partnership on connectivity, based on transparency, openness and inclusiveness, provides an opportunity for all. Today, through such partnership including the Belt and Road Initiative and other cooperation strategies, we resolve to promote international cooperation, at sub-regional, regional and global levels aiming at a brighter shared future and common prosperity. We support a universal, rules-based, open, transparent and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system with WTO at its core.Strengthening Development Policy Synergy8. To sustain common development, we welcome sound macroeconomic policies, encourage discussions with regard to Sustainable Development Agenda and will work together to enhance macroeconomic policy dialogue at the UN and other multilateral fora, and promote synergies among related development plans and connectivity initiatives based on the progress already made.9. In this regard, we also emphasize the opportunities arising from the initiatives and cooperation frameworks, including, inter alia, the ACMECS Master Plan (2019-2023), the African Union including Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA), APEC Connectivity Blueprint, the Arab League, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) including Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025, ASEAN Smart Cities Network and ASEAN Initiative on Connecting the Connectivities, ASEM Pathfinder Group on Connectivity, BIMP-East ASEAN Growth Area, Central Asian Connectivity, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), the Dubai Silk Road Strategy, EU strategy on connecting Europe and Asia, EU-China Connectivity Platform, EU Eastern Partnership, Eurasian Economic Union, Eurasian partnership, Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), Global Infrastructure Connectivity Alliance, International G-Global Project, Lancang-Mekong Cooperation, Organization of American States, Pacific Alliance, Pacific Islands Forum, Union for the Mediterranean and those sub-regional and regional cooperation initiatives between all partners.10. Determined to pursue trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, we aspire to further open our markets, reject protectionism, unilateralism and other measures that are incompatible with WTO rules. We highlight the importance of special and differential treatment in accordance with WTO agreements.11. We recognize the importance of improving customs facilitation including by encouraging better cooperation and coordination of relevant agencies involved in border clearance, mutual assistance, information sharing and cooperation, streamlining customs and transit procedures. We encourage such facilitation to be consistent with the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement and accompanied by efficient and effective controls to, inter alia, prevent illicit trade and fight fraud.12. We call for strengthened cooperation on foreign direct investment and joint ventures in the context of our national laws and international commitments, and encourage an enabling and predictable environment for the promotion of investment and new business opportunities.13. We intend to enhance cooperation in tax matters, encourage more agreements on avoidance of double taxation, and promote growth-friendly tax policies. To achieve these goals, we aim to work within existing international taxation cooperation frameworks.14.
