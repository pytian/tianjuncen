As a result, the island's economic performance has continued to weaken, in part due to falling revenue from tourism which thrived for eight years before Tsai assumed office in 2016 thanks to record numbers of visitors from the Chinese mainland.Unless Tsai and her DPP acknowledge this essential fact, the island's economy will continue to suffer, partly because of the strained relations across the Straits, and the Taiwan administration will continue to be isolated, because the developments of the past years suggest Kiribati's decision could trigger a domino effect

Indeed, as President Xi stated in May 2017, at China’s first Belt and Road Summit hosted in Beijing, the BRI is for everyone regardless of geographical location, as any interested country is welcome to join in the investment in the project and supply their expertise.Of course, the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 has both a land and a maritime element, and it not just about reach but also about depth, improving infrastructure in key cities and areas in the many countries to be linked by the project

                            TOKYO - Fukushima's operator on Tuesday started freezing the last section of a $320 million ice wall designed to combat widespread water contamination at the site of the worst nuclear accident in a generation. "When the ice wall is completed, we estimate that the amount of underground water flowing into the complex will be less than 100 tons," a company spokesman said. Even now, with the ice wall almost complete, about 140 tons of underground water flows into the plant daily, forcing the company to pump it out and store it in on-site tanks

"If the situation were worse than we first thought, the advance team could also turn into a separate rescue squad to provide emergency assistance

It is undeniable that the US used to be the world leader in responding to climate change and will continue to play an important role in the fight, since dozens of its states and cities have promised to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at local levels

The bill-signing prompted a round of applause from first responders in the Rose Garden as well as Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who was mayor of New York City during the attacks and was widely praised for his leadership in the aftermath of the World Trade Center collapse
