                African leaders eye closer cooperation with China
            </p>
            <p>
                BEIJING - African leaders said here Monday that their continent stands ready to further cement its partnership with China and promote win-win cooperation under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.They made the remarks at the High-Level Dialogue Between Chinese and African Leaders and Business Representatives and Sixth Conference of Chinese and African Entrepreneurs, held on the sidelines of the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC).The Beijing summit "reflects the unique as well as the strategic nature of our partnership," South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who co-chairs the two-day FOCAC summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, said at the dialogue.The Africa-China partnership "facilitates the realization of Africa's developmental aspirations reflected in Agenda 2063 through pragmatic collaboration in the quest of win-win cooperation," he added."I am convinced that the FOCAC has taken the comprehensive strategic partnership journey further and to higher levels," Ramaphosa said.Speaking on behalf of leaders of North African countries, Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz said "China and Africa enjoy sound cooperation in trade."He noted that China has put forward the important Belt and Road Initiative, while the African Continental Free Trade Area is gradually taking shape and African countries are making progress in seeking development paths that suit their national conditions.Such moves will help upgrade China's trade and investment cooperation with North African as well as other African countries, he added.North African countries expect to deepen understanding and cooperation with other countries and promote peace, stability and sustainable development in the world, he said."Therefore, the countries need to work together to secure our achievements through win-win cooperation," the Mauritanian president said.Also at the dialogue, Djiboutian President Ismail Omar Guelleh said the Africa-China partnership is based on win-win cooperation and mutual benefit.On behalf of East Africa, Guelleh said the region is delighted that it will continue to benefit from the many advantages of the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China."China's investment and involvement in East Africa date back to more than 40 years ago, which demonstrate not only the depth of our friendship, but more importantly, how China, even when it was trying to develop itself and lift its people out of poverty, always extended the hand of friendship to Africa and believed in our success," he said.China and East Africa have grown together, he said, adding that the region is pleased to see that win-win cooperation and friendship have only deepened and helped better the lives of the Chinese and African people.In his keynote speech at the meeting, Xi said China stands ready to strengthen comprehensive cooperation with African countries to build a path of high-quality development that is suited to respective national conditions, inclusive and beneficial to all.Realizing common prosperity for the people of all nations, including the people of Africa, is an important part of building a community with a shared future for humanity, Xi said in his speech themed "walk together towards prosperity."FOCAC was formally founded in 2000. Since then China and African countries have held the 2006 Beijing summit and the 2015 Johannesburg summit, which have promoted cooperation between the two sides and produced fruitful results.

                China's key to sustainable development
            </a>
            <p>
                Investing in special economic zones can help transformation of Africa, experts say Riding on its deepening relationship with China, Africa should eagerly engage the Asian country on trade and investment in efforts to realize the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, experts say. The goals aim at ending poverty, hunger and inequality, as well as tackling climate change and building resilient infrastructure by 2030.  Moritz Weigel (left), the founding director of The China Africa Advisory, Aboubaker Omar (center), chairman of Djibouti Ports and Free Trade Zones Authority; and Cheng Cheng (right) of Chongyang Financial Institute at Remnin University of China and Made in Africa initiative during Africa-China Economic Forum on July 5. Edith Mutethya / China DailyMoritz Weigel, the founding director of consulting company The China Africa Advisory, says China is well positioned to help Africa to realize the sustainable development goals as well as the African Union's Agenda 2063. This is because the two aides have a strong political commitment and China has the experience, knowledge and technology that Africa requires, he says. Weigel also says African countries should take a leaf from and work in partnership with China on investing in special economic zones, which he says played a key role in transforming China's economy. "We are working with UNDP China(United Nations Development Pro-gramme-China) on developing a framework for sustainable SEZs. We are looking at the existing examples from zones in Africa and Asian countries on how they have incorporated sustainability aspects successfully from a business perspective," he says. Weigel says planning and institutional arrangements must be in place to support the development and operation of special economic zones. "It's not an easy task, because it involves various ministries. Hence coordinating them toward delivering successful programs has been a challenge to many countries. There is also need for sustainable financing to ensure that other supporting infrastructures are also in place for the SEZs to be effective," he says. Meng Guangwen, a professor at the College of Geography and Environmental Science at Tianjin Normal University, describes special economic zones as platforms for structural reform, noting that the zones have played a crucial role in China's economic growth. As part of its economic reform and policy of opening up to the world, China, between 1980 and 1984, established SEZs in Shantou, Shenzhen and Zhuhai in Guangdong province and Xiamen, Fujian province, and designated the entire island province of Hainan as a special economic zone. To date, the zones have transformed China into one of the largest foreign direct investment recipients, exporters and foreign exchange reserve holders globally. Buzuayehu Tedele, chairman of East African Holding Group, says that while foreign companies such as Chinese enterprises can develop master plans and infrastructure designs, it's important for African countries to localize the knowledge. Nabil Mohamed, the Djiboutian minister for higher education and research, says that for Africa to succeed and generally meet the sustainable development goals, it must create industries and attract foreign investors like Chinese enterprises. Creation of industries should also lead to job creation, especially for youths, he says. Mohamed adds that African countries should also work on peace and security in order to attract foreign investments, as well as realize sustainability. Tegegnework Gettu, a UN undersecretary-general and UNDP associate administrator, says multi-stakeholder partnerships and regional collaborations such as the one between China and Africa provide many opportunities for promoting economic growth, industrialization and investment for sustainable development. "China's Belt and Road Initiative is an important example of enhanced regional cooperation, aiming to promote the connectivity of the African, Asian and European continents through better infrastructure connectivity, closer trade relations, financial integration and policy coordination," he says. He says Africa is still extremely rich in natural resources, but only structural transformation, diversification and a transition toward labor-intensive manufacturing will enable African countries to chart sustainable development pathways. "The aspiration of the 2030 agenda to leave no one behind can only be achieved with a combination of effective social protection and improved creation of decent jobs, especially to generate sustained income for the large and growing segment of young people," he says. edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Africa Weekly 08/10/2018 page3)

                Belt and Road opens new path for Guinea
            </a>
            <p>
                The Belt and Road Initiative is a massive project that encompasses three continents and affects more than half of the world's population. It is on the sea routes that this project touches Africa by its horn, including Kenya, the Somali and Djiboutian coastlines. Geographically, the Horn of Africa serves as the gateway to the project in Africa. It is a timely initiative, since China became Africa's largest trading partner in 2009, with total trade worth $91 billion.The initiative is a crucial opportunity to bridge the gap of rapid flow. Through this project, China is deploying financial resources for large-scale infrastructure projects across the continent. The Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway line and the Nairobi-Mombassa highway are two successful examples of Sino-African intra-African development cooperation.Guinea, located on the western Atlantic coast with 300 km coastline, offers enormous potential for the establishment of a multifaceted partnership with China, thus serving as a new corridor for Chinese trade in Africa. Just like Ethiopia and Djibouti in East Africa, Guinea in West Africa can be made as a fine and successful example of Sino-African cooperation. From a historical point of view, Guinea is the first sub-Saharan country to establish diplomatic relations and its President Ahmed Sekou was one of the first African leaders to be received by President Mao Zedong with all the honors worthy of a host president.From the point of view of history Guinea and China have been cooperating in various forms from early years. In the 2000s trade became considerable with the volume of imports of Chinese goods reaching $175 million in 2006.The new Guinean authorities installed in the Sekhoutereya Palace since 2010, under the chairmanship of Pr Alpha Condé, intend to focus on Sino-Guinean cooperation to meet several challenges. First is the energy front. For the last eight years, in partnership with China, many dams have been under construction, one of which was completed in 2015. This is the Kaleta dam, which was constructed at the cost of $440 million, with China financing 75 percent. Souapiti with a cost of $1.3 billion is 85 percent financed by China. The Amaria dam, in which China is a stakeholder, saw groundbreaking ceremony. It is on the energy front that honor is largely due to Sino-Guinean cooperation based on the concrete.In the field of transport, China favors the rebuilding of international transport routes across the continent, the aim of which is to facilitate an increasing and rapid access of Chinese products as well as to revitalize rural economies across the continent. One of the largest road construction projects was launched this year by Guinean in partnership with China. It is the national road number one. Over a distance of 357 km the China Road and Bridge Construction Company has promised to complete this vital route to the country's economy within 33 months. The construction of this road would quickly link Bamako, the capital of Mali, and will contribute to the improvement of flows within the country.The Belt and Road Initiative is the largest historic agreement ever made by Guinean on September 5, 2017, in the presence of Guinean and Chinese heads of state, a $20 billion project financing agreement; it is a deal of the century for Guinea.Keita Moussa is a postgraduate in African Institute of Zhejiang Normal University.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                China and Africa: a true friendship and beyond
            </a>
            <p>
                As the continent with the most developing countries is finding its rightful place in the world, China's actions show what it means to be a responsible contributor to Africa's success.Chinese President Xi Jinping has outlined the new blueprint for China-Africa cooperation, including eight cooperation initiatives, which was warmly welcomed by those attending the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Beijing Summit from Sept. 3 to 4.In the theme that it promotes, the measures it rolls out, and the impacts it has on African countries, the summit reaffirms the true friendship between China and Africa and their shared commitment to world development.Viewing Africa as a great continent full of hope and with great potential, China is sincerely helping Africa explore its path toward revitalization. China respects the core interests of African countries, and, in the new era, links the Belt and Road Initiative with the African Union's Agenda 2063 and African countries' development strategies.China's involvement in Africa is beneficial to the combined 2.6 billion Chinese and African people, over one-third of the world's population.Giving top priority to the interests of the Chinese and African peoples, China complements Africa's development through its own growth. The country has been helping Africa alleviate poverty, increase employment and incomes, and improve the lives of the people.It is up to the people in China and Africa to judge the nature and the performance of China-Africa cooperation. Citing a report, Djiboutian President Ismail Omar Guelleh said 89 percent of the employees of the Chinese companies operating in Africa are Africans, which translates into several million jobs across the continent.Throughout its cooperation with Africa, China has always acted responsibly, with concrete actions.China has pledged to support Africa in achieving general food security by 2030, open more direct flights between China and Africa, seek to expand exchanges and cooperation in addressing climate change, create a China-Africa peace and security fund, and provide more assistance for youth, healthcare, and people-to-people exchanges, among other measures.The eight cooperation initiatives precisely target the bottlenecks in development in Africa. To achieve these goals, China has pledged a new 60-billion-U.S. dollar financing plan.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said China-Africa partnerships "will be contributing to the expansion of Africa's productive capacity and the creation of new industries."Rwandan President Paul Kagame rejected misinterpretations of China-Africa ties, saying "Africa is not a zero-sum game and our growing ties with China do not come at anyone's expense. Indeed the gains are enjoyed by everyone who does business on our continent."When Xi invited African countries to board the express train of China's development in his keynote speech, the warm applause from African guests at the Great Hall of the People came as evidence that China's actions are in line with its commitment to Africa.China-Africa cooperation has deepened South-South cooperation and boosted efforts to improve the global governance system. As United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, the Beijing summit "exemplifies the win-win globalization that is necessary for the future world."

                40 years of Djibouti ties hailed
            </a>
            <p>
                China stands ready to work with Djibouti to implement the results of the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and bring bilateral ties to a new stage, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday.Xi made the remark during an exchange of congratulations with Djiboutian President Ismail Omar Guelleh on the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries.In his congratulatory message to Guelleh, Xi said bilateral ties have developed healthily and steadily over the past four decades with mutual understanding and support for each other's respective core interests and major concerns as well as fruitful cooperation in various fields.He recalled Guelleh's state visit to China in Nov 2017, when they jointly announced the establishment of a bilateral strategic partnership, and their meeting during the Beijing Summit of FOCAC in September. During that visit, they witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding on building the Belt and Road.Xi said that he attaches great importance to developing ties with Djibouti, and he is willing to work with Guelleh to consolidate political trust and deepen bilateral cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative.Guelleh expressed appreciation to the Chinese government and people for their assistance to and support of his country and said he is satisfied and proud of the sound development of relations with China.Djibouti will firmly uphold the one-China principle, Guelleh said, adding that he is willing to work with Xi to further promote bilateral ties.

                Rwanda commemorates 25th anniversary of 1994 genocide
            </a>
            <p>
                KIGALI, Rwanda－Rwandans on Sunday started commemorating the 25th anniversary of the 1994 genocide that left more than 1 million people dead, with President Paul Kagame calling for continued efforts to transform the country."Rwanda's young people have everything needed to transform our country," Kagame said. "They have the responsibility to take charge more and more, and participate fully in securing the Rwanda we want and deserve."Three-quarters of Rwandans are under 30, and almost 60 percent of Rwandan people were born after the genocide, Kagame said.Rwandans are the last people in the world who should succumb to complacency, he said, adding that the suffering the Rwandan people have endured should be enough to keep their fighting spirit alive."The fighting spirit is alive in us. What happened here will never happen again," Kagame said.Dignitaries present at the ceremony also recognized Rwanda's recovery after the genocide, whose victims were primarily ethnic Tutsis.Rwanda is an example of how a deeply wounded society can rise again, thanks to the courage of its people, said president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker.The genocide commemoration event is an opportunity to celebrate the remarkable resilience of the people of Rwanda as well as the extraordinary leadership, said Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel.The leadership of the Rwandan government, coupled with the resilience of Rwandans, is what has made Rwanda move forward, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said.Rwanda's commitment to reconciliation is a testament to honoring victims and it's a lesson for the world to have hope in reconciliation, Ahmed said."I applaud the resilience of genocide survivors and all Rwandans. Rwanda has emerged from the darkest period to become one of the fastest growing economies in Africa," said Djiboutian President Ismail Omar Guelleh.New platform plannedMoussa Faki Mahamat, chief of the African Union Commission, told the ceremony that he is planning to set up a platform in charge of fighting against the most abominable genocidal ideologies and ethnic derivatives in Africa.Performances for remembrance were staged during the ceremony.Shortly before the ceremony, Faki, Juncker and other dignitaries laid wreaths at the Kigali Genocide Memorial, the final resting place for more than 250,000 victims of the genocide.Kagame, Rwandan first lady Jeannette Kagame, Faki and Juncker jointly lit the flame of remembrance at the memorial.Other activities on the first day of the commemoration include a Walk to Remember event and a night vigil at the Amahoro National Stadium.Heads of Rwandan national commissions for anti-genocide and reconciliation both spoke highly of Rwanda's reconciliation and unity after the genocide days ahead of the commemoration.Rwandans have reconciled whereby genocide perpetrators and survivors are able work together to develop their respective communities through community work, or Umuganda, and other national development initiatives, said Jean-Damascene Bizimana, executive secretary of the National Commission for the Fight against Genocide.Unity and reconciliation among Rwandans have reached more than 95 percent and the country is continuing to ensure that Rwanda will be a completely unified country in the next few years, according to Fidele Ndayisaba, executive secretary of National Unity and Reconciliation Commission.Xinhua

                East Africans enjoy benefits of China-built electrified railway
            </a>
            <p>
                Salamnash Meles used to travel 10 hours by bus to check her business in Dire Dawa, a town 450 kilometers east of the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, where her extended family lives.Meles, 37, runs a boutique in Dire Dawa and owns a coffee farm in the outskirts of the city. However, she lives in Addis Ababa with her husband and their three children, where she also operates another boutique.Before the launch of a railway line, she used to travel to Dire Dawa twice per month, meaning she couldn't monitor her business and farm properly.Because her children made the journey more tedious, she rarely traveled with them, despite their plea to visit their grandparents.Meles's story is similar to that of Siraj Yawsin, who runs a logistics company in Djibouti. Yawsin found it both expensive and tiresome to travel frequently from Djibouti to Addis Ababa.He used to board a bus from Addis Ababa to Dire Dawa and spend the night there before riding another bus to Djibouti the following day. "This meant spending extra on accommodation and meals," he said.Now, the two ride the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway line, which started operation in January 2018. A train ride between Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa takes seven hours, while the journey from Addis Ababa to Djibouti takes 13 hours.Both Meles and Yawsin said riding the train is comfortable and affordable. Meles said she now goes to Dire Dawa twice a week."The turnover of my businesses has increased significantly since I'm able to monitor it closely. My farm is also doing well than previously," Meles said, but declined to disclose her business returns.She said it costs her $11 to travel from Addis Ababa to Dire Dawa by train, compared to $12-$14 by road, and more than $70 by flight.On the other hand, a train ride to Djibouti costs Yawsin $17.4, in comparison to $28 by bus and $120 by flight.The 756-kilometer track which is the first standard-gauge electrified railroad in Africa, has shortened the journeys between the two countries from 10 days via the old meter-gauge railway built by the French 100 years ago, and two days by road to 14 hours.The $3.4 billion project, 70 percent funded by the Export-Import Bank of China and 30 percent by the Ethiopian government, was constructed and is currently operated by the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation Ltd, or CCECC, and China Railway Group Limited.Muhammed Ahamad, a Djiboutian businessman said the train is fast, affordable, clean, convenient and safer than road transport. Although it was his first time to use the train, he said he would consider traveling via it for his trips to Ethiopia."We are grateful to China for constructing the modern railroad. The old meter-gauge one was very slow and uncomfortable," he said.Job opportunitiesWhile Meles, Yawsin and Ahamad celebrate the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway for easing their movement, Abraham Fetene and Mesay Diriba are grateful for securing jobs at the railway. They have not only been able to put food on the table but are also honing their skills.Before the launch of the railway, Fetene was a frustrated jobless man. Despite acquiring entrepreneurship skills from Digital Opportunities Trust Ethiopia, he had no capital to start a business.Fortunately, he secured a job at the railway as a plan statistician for material and equipment.His responsibility is to summarize the equipment and material purchasing plan, and supervise and inspect material and equipment."Today, I can comfortably cater for my basic needs as well as support my family financially. There is career growth opportunities here and I hope to get sponsorship to pursue master's degree program in China," Fetene said.Unlike Fetene who was jobless, Diriba worked as a maintenance engineer in a cement company but the job wasn't fulfilling. Today Fetene who works as a team leader and a trainer. He said the job is more fulfilling, there are career growth opportunities and his future looks bright.Tilahun Sarka, the director-general of the Ethio-Djibouti Standard Gauge Railway Share Company that operates and maintains the Ethio-Djibouti Railways, said the company employed 1,000 Ethiopians, 200 Djiboutians and 700 Chinese.He said the Ethio-Djibouti Railways has employed Chinese expertise to drive and operate the trains for six years starting last year. Already, 60 local train masters are under training as drivers and operators of the trains."Within the next year, they should be fully equipped to start driving," he said.Lin Xiaohua, the acting deputy manager of the China Railway Group Limited, which operates the railway with the CCECC, said over 1,000 passengers travel by the train per day."Both Ethiopia and Djibouti are developing countries, so there is potential for freight cargo growth. We plan to increase the number of cargo freight to seven sets per day within the next few years," he said.

                Chinese investment needed in Djibouti
            </a>
            <p>
                Unlike the Western investment with strings attached to it, Chinese investment, which is mutually beneficial to both parties and respects the destination country's interest, is much needed, said Abdallah Abdillahi Miguil, Djibouti's ambassador to China.Miguil said investment is key to the economic growth in a country. China's Belt and Road Initiative created in Djibouti an environment that attracted major Chinese and international investors, and paved the way the implementation and construction of huge projects in Djibouti.Located in the Horn of Africa, Djibouti is an important choke-point that links the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. It is pivotal, given its proximity to key nations in both Africa and Asia, as well as being a crucial route for global shipping.A major China-funded project is the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone, which Miguil said is considered by Djibouti authorities as "a zone of hope".The 10-year project will comprise a total investment of $3.5 billion. Once complete, the zone, which is connected to Djibouti's main ports, will span an area of 4,800 hectares, making it Africa's largest free trade zone. It will focus in particular on the development of industries such as logistics, marine, construction, automotive, and home electrical industries.In July, the initial phase of the zone was launched, covering 240 hectares and involving $370 million investment. It was built by a multiparty joint venture formed by China Merchants Group. More than 20 companies have signed agreements to operate in the trade zone, according to the Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority.Miguil said that the free trade zone is estimated to have added $200 million to Djibouti's gross domestic product during the first phase and it will increase up to $2.5 billion to $4 billion after completion of its all phases."There is no doubt that Djibouti International Free Trade Zone will offer new opportunities for businesses community around the world looking to enter the African market," he said.Djibouti has made its own plan of Vision 2035, which aims to transform the country into a middle-income economy and a regional transport and logistics hub akin to Singapore or Dubai."This would not have happened without the help and involvement of the direct investment from Chinese companies," he said, adding that Chinese investment also contributed to well-being of many Djiboutians, particularly the youth.Other projects under the initiative are the railway links from Djibouti to Addis Ababa and the Multipurpose Port in Doraleh.He said that with all these infrastructure combined, the outlook of the country to transform into a middle-income economy is promising.He said China launched Luban Workshop in March in Djibouti, the first of its kind, with an aim to provide quality vocational training to local people. He said it's an example showing that China is keen to share its expertise with Djibouti."The workshop will definitely improve the professional skills of our country's workforce and we see it as a prelude to technology transfer. It is in line with the Chinese proverb: 'Do not give a fish to a poor man, teach him how to fish'."
