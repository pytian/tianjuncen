                Leading exhibition events organizer committed to serving as platform for domestic firms eyeing global expansionOne moment was all it took to inspire a company's vision.More than a decade ago, Chet Burchett, chief executive officer of Reed Exhibitions and a newcomer to the business, witnessed a woman winning an award for "Best Show Product".While accepting the award, the woman broke down and cried. Burchett was puzzled by such an outburst of emotion. He later learned that the female entrepreneur had taken a year out and practically risked everything to create and finance her product. Winning the award was not only recognition of many months of hard work, it was also the source of a new business and a dream come true."It truly touched my heart," Burchett said. "And it was at that moment that I realized our business is so much more than putting on shows. It's about finding solutions to great challenges and helping others to achieve their dreams.""That moment, followed by many others, has inspired me to help individual business people achieve their goals, while opening doors to trade, lifting up economies and removing barriers along the way," said Burchett, who joined the company in 2004.Burchett stepped into the global CEO role in 2015 after serving as president of the Americas for Reed Exhibitions for nearly 11 years. He oversaw the company's expansion to Brazil and Mexico, the launch of Reed's Pop Culture Group, implementation of a dynamic, value-led pricing model, and the creation of a cross-border collaboration program.Burchett considers China a vital market for Reed's global business with its rising domestic show numbers and increasing visitor presence at overseas exhibitions.During his recent visit to Shanghai, China Daily had an interview with Burchett, who discussed how Reed serves as a platform for Chinese businesses keen to expand into global markets, and how the company's ongoing digital innovations provide a better and in-depth understanding of their customers and a personalized show experience.How do you see China's role in Reed's global business strategy and layout? China's role is vital. Over just a few decades, it has grown into one of our largest business sectors, while securing its position on the global stage. China is currently the largest market in the Asia-Pacific region. In terms of revenue by region, Europe accounts for 44 percent of the global market, with the US generating 18 percent and the rest of the world 38 percent.What are your thoughts on China's economy and its prospects? China's economy is still one of the largest and fastest-growing economies in the world. The exhibition industry has long served as an engine for business development and growth, both domestically and internationally. It's important to remember that even in the midst of the most challenging times, exhibitions can open doors to new markets and provide businesses opportunities to grow.How do you see Reed's development and prospects in China's exhibition industry? Last year we saw strong growth with a total of 65 successful events, and we formed a joint venture with Shanghai Forever Exhibition, expanding our profile into automotive manufacturing. Our joined forces will be launching AMTS Brazil next year.We also took 170 Chinese companies and exhibitors to this year's CMEF Indonesia, an exhibition that serves the medical equipment and manufacturing sectors, with an aim of helping to further build business and broaden their exposure in the global market.We've continued to experience solid growth throughout 2019. This year, we launched six new events spanning multiple sectors from automotive manufacturing and materials, electronics manufacturing and assembly, flowers and gardening, gifts and homeware, to food and hospitality.How is Reed supporting Chinese companies looking to expand overseas? Our Reed International Sales Group focuses exclusively on export sales. Last year, this passionate team helped nearly 11,500 Chinese exhibitors attend Reed exhibitions around the globe. This year, we have already exceeded that number. This represents about 15 percent of our business in China. It's exciting to see our customers moving to new markets. And we are here to support that growth.Reed serves more than 40 industry segments globally, which provide tremendous opportunities for Chinese companies looking to expand abroad. Our job is to help customers be successful as they navigate the international arena.What's the current state of Reed's presence in China? Domestically, we're approaching the two-million mark in both exhibitors and buyers. And those numbers continue to experience healthy growth. We recognize that each of China's markets and regions is unique. An important part of our vision includes seeing each individual customer with the utmost clarity. By better understanding our customers, we can actively engage with them to produce the positive results they need to succeed.How does Reed's current operating model differ from more traditional exhibitions? Our model is simple: help our customers achieve their business goals. To that end, our work increasingly centers around getting to know our individual customers, together with their markets and needs, resulting in a personalized (and maximized) event experience.And I'm proud to say that we now serve more than 7 million customers worldwide. Recent years have brought a keen focus on innovation. We'll be rolling out a new digital platform, exclusive to China, later this year. And next year, we'll be introducing our new and increasingly personalized, marketing automation platform to the world.One of our most successful initiatives, our business matchmaking program, launched in 2015, and is now available at all of our China-based shows. Its exclusive and intense focus on improving the buyer-visiting experience, via tailored recommendations, products and services, has delivered big results and high levels of satisfaction. The program served 1.9 million customers last year with an anticipated jump to 2.5 million by the end of 2019. More than 60 percent of our buyers have reported positive interactions leading to better overall business results.In addition, our show service app, Reed Connect, which provides smart exhibition experience for Chinese customers, continues to grow with 140,000 match recommendations to date.What are Reed's core strengths that have helped it to develop customized visitor experiences? Our company strengths stem from within. Reed is part of RELX Group, a global provider of information-based analytics and decision tools, which employs thousands of data scientists and technologists, and whose expertise we regularly utilize. We also conduct extensive research before launching any new project or event.These combined resources not only give us a deeper understanding of our customers' markets and needs, they allow us to provide the value-added products and services that gain their attention and lead them on the road to success.In your view, what is the effect of artificial intelligence technology on conventional exhibition business? Change is often viewed as threatening. Years back, when the internet started entering the mainstream, people were worried. But it actually ended up working in their favor. Nowadays, it would be impossible to imagine any business, not just exhibitions, succeeding without the internet and its relevant technology.AI is simply another new level, a next step. For example, virtual reality technology allows on-site buyers to experience products in truly remarkable ways. Technology is here to stay and people would be wise to harness its benefits.All that aside, though it is exciting to envision AI's future role in the industry, one fact remains: it will never replace human emotion and interaction. Nearly 75 percent of all of our customers, exhibiting or attending, are small-and medium-sized enterprises. We've learned that they do not only come to our events to increase their industry knowledge and contacts, their number-one reason is to be inspired and discover what the industry has to offer.Inspiration is a human emotion. Though AI has and will surely continue to influence and enhance the exhibition experience, it cannot and will never replace the human spirit.

                US entrepreneur: Sorry, President Trump...We are not leaving China
            </a>
            <p>
                American entrepreneur Brian Linden, like many of his fellow expats in China, has developed his career and built his life in China.Linden founded his hotel, Linden Center, together with his wife Jeanee Linden in Dali, a well-known tourist town in Southwest China’s Yunnan province in 2008.Linden wrote this open letter to US President Donald Trump, who order US companies to leave China and suggested in a tweet on Friday that he has the authority to do so.China Daily website has been authorized to publish this open letter.Below is the full text.In 2004, my wife, two sons (ages 7 and 9 at the time), and I gave up our careers in America, sold our home and came to China to pursue a dream steeped in idealism and respect. Our goal was to create a social enterprise: a sustainable business that would demonstrate its values - a reverence for Chinese culture - via tangible and intangible contributions. We arrived as a family with this mission and have spent the last fifteen years refining it. What started as a small hotel is now inspiring many people to recognize the beauty and wisdom of China's cultural heritage.Our model's tangible aspirations are embodied in our protected structures. Restoring said buildings requires more money, time and care than new construction. We felt that our preservation efforts would demonstrate our commitment to the promotion of China's august cultural heritage and would symbolize the first step in the creation of our social enterprise.From a business point of view, we understood that heritage buildings often could not provide the same comforts that many increasingly wealthy travelers expect in a hotel. Physical restoration, while honorable and important, was not enough to make a functioning business. Without unique 'software', we would never be able to compete and survive as a hotel.We set out to source our 'software' from the indigenous culture and traditions of the region, most importantly its people. We felt that the world, in the rush to cater to a booming tourism industry, did the easy thing: invest in 'hardware' because 'software' takes time and energy to develop. Idiosyncratic architecture and extraneous attractions such as large bathtubs, massive televisions, and French wine cellars became the routinely financed expectations of many travelers. Guests were trained to value hardware in lieu of any software. In such models, the cultural and social resources of a destination become inconsequential, less important than the physical comforts of hotels that too often are designed and managed by non-local staff. Few benefits trickle down to the community.Our social enterprise aimed to reverse this trend. As travelers ourselves, we were inspired by our past interactions with local people. We felt that the spirit of travel was being bankrupted in the name of superficial comforts. We believed that locals were benefiting little from the economic disruptions in their backyards, and we wanted to inspire our neighbors and travelers alike to aspire after a more sustainable model. We have worked hard; we got our hands dirty. We took on risks that affected our whole family. We sold our home in America, gave up our professions and invested every dollar we had in these projects. We home-schooled our boys until university. China became our home and the Chinese embraced us like family. Leaving this special place has never entered our minds.I first arrived in China in August 1984 and stayed until 1988. China has given me and my family a supportive platform upon which to pursue our dreams. We initially could offer this country little more than our passion and respect; in return, China has not allowed us to fail. We firmly believe that America must respectfully remain engaged with China. The Chinese have a saying: "The times may be changes but opportunities also abound. Let's not build walls."We kindly decline the request to leave this great country and its people, Mr. President. We are proud to be Americans, but we are equally honored to say that China is and will remain our home.

                The future beckons for China's millennial generation
            </a>
            <p>
                As China commemorates the 70th year of the beginning of this profoundly transformative chapter in its long and illustrious history, this monumental occasion provides an excellent opportunity for reflection and an understanding of the vast changes that China underwent, how it was impacted by global development and vice versa within the context of the Chinese millennials and generation Z as they will be at the center of everything for the next leg of this journey.Most comparisons delve into the colossal changes from where China stood 70 years ago to where it stands now: As the world's second biggest economy, as well as having hit milestones on both ends, such as poverty reduction, as well as staggering economic growth simultaneously. What is interesting is that the millennials and those after them personally experienced China as it was just beginning to see the effects of globalization.This generation, instead of experiencing the incredibly challenging situations that the previous generation overcame, grew up in the age of smartphones and unicorns (start-ups valued at over a $1 billion), rampant e-commerce, society going cashless and the rise of platforms powered by tech and enabled by smartphones that have completely and irrevocably overhauled everyday life and economic activity, ranging from renting out apartments to dating, and everything in between. China is already lauded for adopting advanced technologies and a willingness to be open to new ideas, as evidenced by the astoundingly fast adoption of new technologies and the innovative Chinese approach towards localized implementation.The premise that needs to be considered is that taken as a whole, there is no other country with a reservoir of highly educated individuals with access to the second largest economy that also happens to be responsible for nearly one-third of the world's economic growth on a yearly basis.That is in addition to the massive purchasing power that has the power to greatly impact consumption patterns around the globe.At the same time, they are also faced with a number of challenges that are unique to their situation. The rise of new technologies, such as AI, cloud computing, and big data, and their intensive application on a very diverse range of applications has evolved automation to the point where although it would be too expensive to replace a bus driver with a robot, it would be cost-effective to replace accountants and tax lawyers with algorithms. This is an issue that everyone in developed and developing countries will come across sooner or later. There will be changes in certain careers and complete disappearance of others. The gig economy and mid-career shifts and disruptions will be a feature of their working life, thus becoming a notable departure from the long-term career prospects of the previous generation. However, they are equipped with quality education and empowered by an entrepreneurial spirit inspired by the incredible rise of their country to staggering heights in such a relatively short amount of time. Their reaction to the situation will not only define the future economy of China, but will also exert a sizable impact on the global economy and direction of development. A globally-oriented education also will enable them to greatly enhance China's presence in the hitherto untapped services export sector.This generation has also directly been affected by mass urbanization and resulting pollution and climate change to the extent where it is not a scientific theory or prediction of the future to them, but an ongoing existential threat to all of humanity and peace of the world. Thus, this generation needs to be acutely aware of the importance of sustainable lifestyles, and take cue from the top leadership that "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets" and not strive for just their preservation, but be mindful to stay in touch with nature to maintain inner peace and joy. With the Chinese leadership's firm declaration of commitment to fighting catastrophic climate change, a lot of the world's hopes lie upon the direction in which China heads in by building smart, sustainable cities and fosters lifestyles that adapt zero-waste design philosophies and are powered by clean and renewable energy sources. In that end, it would be fascinating to see the next generation openly embracing zero-waste smart and sustainable cities and ways of life. The unified commitment backed by the government bodes well for the country and the planet as a whole as Chinese innovations, resources and economies of scale will allow the whole world to benefit from this experience. The staggering growth that has made the cost of going solar in certain aspects affordable and feasible would not have been possible without the immense manufacturing capacity installed in China.As time moves forward, this generation will also bear the brunt of the burden rising from an aging and decreasing population, as is with other developed countries where birth rates have been steadily decreasing for quite some time. This will present interesting demographic switches with the milieu of the social fabric of society, as well as require a redefinition and redesign of the concept of elderly care and technology-assisted health care. Again, developments and solutions conceived and implemented here stand to contribute much to solutions for the rest of the world as well.But beyond all the facts and figures, the youth of China should be grateful for the immense potential that much sacrifice and difficult decisions has brought them. The world stands at a critical juncture as it reels from climate change, seethes with populist rage, roils in economic turmoil and seeks solutions to problems that require disciplined and principled approaches. And yet, few nations are as prepared to deal with situations such as these as the Chinese nation and its people, so it is time that the youth start gearing up for responsibly and capably utilizing that potential for creating a better, sustainable and equitable future not just for themselves, but a shared future for humankind.Hassan Chattha is a writer and digital media producer based in Beijing.

                Chinese expansion and investment in the pipeline for gas major Linde
            </a>
            <p>
                Founded in Germany in 1879, Linde plc is one of the leading gases and engineering companies in the world. Photos Provided to China DailyAs the global gases and engineering giant founded in Germany in 1879 celebrates its 140th anniversary this year, Steven Fang, head of Linde Greater China, spoke with China Daily on the company's development and future vision in China.Q: Could you give us a brief introduction to Linde's business performance in China in 2018? What's China's position in Linde's global business network?A: One of the most significant events was the approval for Linde AG and Praxair Inc to merge to form Linde plc, a leading industrial gases and engineering company with 2018 pro forma sales of $28 billion.So far, China has become the second-largest market following the United States for Linde. And it is the one of the fastest growing markets in the Asia-Pacific region.In 2018, Linde in China delivered strong business performance by improving its base business and strengthening new business wins. A series of new business wins were secured with Linde's further investment in China, such as the Sinochem project and Huayi Qinzhou project.Q: We know that Linde has been in the Chinese market for more than three decades and it has witnessed the industrial gas industry's development in China. What is your perspective of these changes?A: Linde has endeavored to promote gas industry development since 1987 when legacy Linde entered China as the first international gas company. Since then, we have created many firsts that witnessed the progress of the whole industry across the country. For example, we first introduced the business model of commercialization of liquid gas in the country. In 1992, legacy Praxair operated and managed one of the longest industrial gas pipelines in China.Now the industrial gas outsourcing rate in China has exceeded more than 50 percent from zero in the 1980s. In this course, Linde has played a very important role. In developed countries, such an outsourcing rate, which reflects the industry's specialization and segmentation, is higher than 70 percent. In this regard, we can see that there is still a large amount of growth potential left in China.Q: In a dynamic economic environment, how does Linde cope with changes and uncertainties?A: With more than three decades of development in China, We are confident to cope with the ever-changing and periodic economic environment cycle globally and domestically.Linde serves a wide range of industries from petrochemical, manufacturing, metallurgy electronics, transport, healthcare, chemical, food and beverage, to energy. The diversified industry and customer portfolio enable us to stay ahead the economic cycle and keep a stable growth in China market.Q: The merger of Linde AG and Praxair Inc reportedly created the single biggest player in the global industrial gases business. For the Chinese market, what can be expected from such a combination?A: The successful merger of Linde AG and Praxair Inc combined legacy Linde's expertise in engineering and technology and legacy Praxair's operational excellence. Now, Linde is a leading gases and engineering company and is regarded as one of the most valued gas companies, with a market value exceeding $100 billion. Meanwhile, it owns a more balanced geographic footprint globally.In China, after the merger, we not only expanded our footprint geographically, but also strengthened and enlarged our customer portfolio to include companies such as Sinopec, Baosteel, Shanghai Huayi, Wanhua Chemical, on multiple projects.The merger brought about an increased market network density that has resulted in efficiency and profitability. Besides that, operational efficiency and digital operating technologies innovation have been optimized, which helps maximize the customer benefits and added value.Also, the merger allows us to gather the best talent in the gas industry, who will play a vital role in our future development.Q: Could you share more about Linde's business strategy in China in the next three years?A: We will ramp up our development in China, an important market for Linde. We have confidence in China and would like to continue to contribute to the industry development in the future. One example could be hydrogen mobility.Linde is a global leader in hydrogen technology. With significant advantages in technology, engineering, R&D and successful application experience, Linde wants to supporting the development of China's hydrogen mobility industry.For example, in 2017, Linde with other local partners including SAIC and Shanghai Shunhua New Energy jointly invested in and established a joint venture of Shanghai Elite Energy Technologies. This year, Linde provided proven hydrogen technology to help Shanghai Elite commission the first commercialized hydrogen fueling station as well as the first commercialized 70-Mpa hydrogen fueling station in China. It is also the largest hydrogen fueling station in the world. In this project, Linde provides a stable and reliable hydrogen supply through pipelines in the park, hydrogen transport, storage and key equipment such as ionic compressors for the fueling equipment.Q: In July, Linde started a new research laboratory in Shanghai. Could you share more information about it? What breakthroughs and innovation has Linde made over the past years?A: Globally, Linde has a total of three R&D centers in China, Germany and the US. The China center - Linde Technology Center Shanghaiwas established in 2007, including the Linde Technology Center Combustion Laboratory in Suzhou and the Laser Laboratory in Shanghai, which opened in July.Linde Technology Center Shanghai is responsible for developing new industrial gas application technologies and solutions to meet the needs of customers in China and the Asia-Pacific region, and to promote gas sales and profitability through application technologies.Meanwhile, the center also introduces and transfers Linde's global advanced technologies to China.Innovation is Linde's DNA since its establishment by Carl von Linde. The company founder was an inventor and pioneer in refrigeration technology, which laid the foundation for a new sector of industry in his day. The company advocates and encourages innovation throughout the whole company globally. We have made a series of innovations in areas such as hydrogen mobility technologies, supercritical carbon dioxide plastic foaming technologies, waste water treatment and ground freezing technologies by using liquid nitrogen for tunnel excavation.Q: This year also marks the 140th anniversary of the establishment of Linde. Looking into the future, is there any new vision for Linde in its growth path? And what does Linde expect from the Chinese market?A: This year not only marks 140 years' development of Linde, but represents the history of the industrial gas industry. In the long run, Linde is committed to fulfilling its vision to be the best-performing global industrial gases and engineering company.In China, we will focus on improving efficiency and performance, creating more value for our customers.We will go closer to China's market and keep pace with China's economic moves to explore new market opportunities. With China's industrial transformation and upgrading, we will expand our product offerings and services for more regions, especially the inland area.Business in sectors like petrochemical, chemical, energy, steel, hydrogen mobility, healthcare and electronics will also be enhanced.wanghongyi@chinadaily.com.cn(China Daily 09/07/2019 page13)
