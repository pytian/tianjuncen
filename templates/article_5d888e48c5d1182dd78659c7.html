                ROK to do all it can for successful DPRK-US talks: unification minister
            </p>
            <p>
                SEOUL - ROK (The Republic of Korea)'s Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul said Thursday that his country will do all it can for the successful working-level denuclearization talks between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the United States, which were expected to resume in the near future.Kim made the remark at a ceremony to mark the first anniversary of the third summit in Pyongyang last September between ROK's President Moon Jae-in and top DPRK leader Kim Jong-un.Citing the impromptu meeting on June 30 at the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjom between the leaders of the two Koreas and US President Donald Trump, the minister said the DPRK-US working-level talks would resume in the near future.Choe Son-hui, the DPRK's first vice foreign minister, said earlier this month that the DPRK was willing to hold talks with the United States in late September to comprehensively discuss issues the two sides had taken up.Kim said both Pyongyang and Washington would cherish the opportunity for the working-level dialogue though it would not be easy as the two sides are required to overcome a "wall of age-old distrust and confrontation".The minister said that only when the DPRK and the United States make productive, reasonable negotiations based on sufficient trust, the DPRK would take a big step toward the denuclearization.He said the South Korean government will do all it can for the DPRK-US working-level dialogue to bear good fruit, while closely communicating with the US side and opening communication channels between the two Koreas.

                A shares attracting foreign funds as economy maintains steady growth
            </a>
            <p>
                China's A-share market is becoming more attractive to overseas investors as the country maintains a steady pace of economic growth and capital market opening-up amid a precarious global recovery, experts said.When the market opens next Monday, two major investment index compilers, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indices, will implement their latest A-share inclusion steps. The former will roughly triple the weighting of A-share constituents, while the latter will add more than 1,000 A shares to its global benchmarks, after their competitor MSCI Inc raised A-share weighting in August.Founder Securities estimated the moves will trigger about $30 billion to $40 billion in foreign inflows into A shares.Huang Jun, chief Chinese analyst at currency trading platform forex.com, said the three major global equity index providers' successive inclusion moves demonstrated the increasing allure of Ashare assets to global investors.China's economic growth has slowed in the past two years but still showed "clear advantage" compared with other emerging markets and advanced economies, Huang said.In the first half of this year, the world's second-largest economy expanded by 6.3 percent. The figure slowed from 6.6 percent for the whole of 2018, but was the highest among all major economies worldwide, official data said."(The economic situation of) China has been stable with solid development foundation, which is the biggest reason why global capital favors the country," Huang said, citing the dampening effect of Brexit on the eurozone and emerging market debt issues such as those in Argentina and Turkey on global investors' confidence in these economies.Besides China's growth prospects, investment opportunities in A shares also derive from the potential enhancement in valuation, said Lynda Zhou, equities chief investment officer in China at Fidelity International."With deepening reform of China's asset management sector, onshore risk-free interest rates are expected to decline sustainably, pushing up the valuation levels of equity assets," Zhou said.Meanwhile, as the market's investor structure, which is dominated by retail investors, may make short-term stock price performance deviate from the true value of listed firms, long-term investment opportunities abound, she said."We believe the valuation levels and growth prospects of A-share listed firms still have an advantage (over global peers)," Zhou said, adding that she pays particular attention to investment opportunities related to consumption upgrading, high-end manufacturing and independent technologies.The A-share market regained upward momentum after the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index hit an intraday low of 2733.92 points in early August, the lowest since mid-February. The SCI went up by 0.25 percent to close at 2985.66 points on Wednesday.Foreign inflows accelerated along with the recovery, with net inflows via northbound trading of stock connect programs between mainland and Hong Kong bourses standing at 28 billion yuan ($3.95 billion) during the first trading week of September, the highest since the first week of November last year.By the end of the first half of this year, foreign capital accounted for 7.6 percent of the A-share market's free float capitalization, up from no more than 3 percent at the beginning of 2016, data collected by Fidelity International showed."Global investors have been structurally underweight in China for many years," said Michael Orzano, senior director of global equity indices at S&P Dow Jones Indices.But this situation has been gradually changing as investors' exposure to the A-share market rose after the market became more accessible and gained inclusion in global equity benchmarks, Orzano said.China has made steady progress in opening up the A-share market in recent years. The authorities quadrupled daily transaction limits for stock connects last year, and continuously relaxed regulation of qualified foreign institutional investor schemes, including announcing an end to quota limits of the schemes last week.

                Casualties of car bomb soar to 20 deaths, 93 wounded in S. Afghanistan
            </a>
            <p>
                 QALAT - The death toll of a car bomb on Thursday that rocked Qalat city, the capital of southern Afghanistan's Zabul province, has risen to 20, with over 93 others wounded, provincial government spokesman Gul Islam Sayal said."Twenty people lost their lives and 93 others wounded in the car bomb that hit a hospital in Qalat city today morning," Sayal told Xinhua.Earlier, Interior Ministry spokesman put the number of casualties at 15 dead and 66 injured.Sayal said the target of the militants was the civilian hospital and all the victims including women and children are civilian people.Taliban outfit has claimed responsibility for the blast and in contact with media claimed that a suicide bomber targeted the provincial office of National Directorate of Security or the country's counter-intelligence agency, inflicting huge casualties.Sayal rejected the Taliban claim, saying all the victims killed in Qalat's attack Thursday morning are the innocent civilians.The armed group which has stepped up activities mostly in the shape of suicide bombing has also claimed responsibility for the deadly bombings that claimed scores of lives in Kabul, Charikar and Jalalabad cities over the past week.

                China's A-shares see foreign inflow spike amid global indices inclusion
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - Foreign capital inflow into China's A-shares market remains robust since the beginning of September after major global benchmarks announced widened inclusion of A-shares.Net foreign capital inflow reached 45.9 billion yuan (about $6.5 billion) since the beginning of this month through stock connect schemes with the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, according to a Friday report by the Economic Information Daily.The figure accounts for about 27 percent of foreign capital inflow since 2019, which stood at 167.4 billion yuan.The influx came after global index provider MSCI raised index weighting for Chinese A-shares from 10 percent to 15 percent, effective from Aug 27.Another benchmark FTSE Russell strengthened the A-shares' weighting in one of its indices from 5 percent to 15 percent, while the S&P Dow Jones Indices will weigh 1,099 A-shares at 25 percent in an upcoming inclusion.The two moves to take effect on Sept 23 are expected to generate $5.1 billion worth of inflow into the A-shares, according to FTSE Russell estimates and analysis from China Merchants Securities.Analysts believe the A-shares are at the outset of a hot streak of foreign capital influx with more to follow as the country further opens up its financial sector.China's forex regulator scraped two investment quota restrictions for foreign institutional investors earlier this month to better facilitate participation in the financial markets.

                Chinese satellite tests space-based gravitational wave detection technologies
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - A recently-launched Chinese satellite has conducted in-orbit experiments on the key technologies related to space-based gravitational wave detection, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) announced on Friday.The satellite, sent into orbit on Aug 31, is China's first such kind of satellite, and has completed its first stage tests in orbit, laying a solid foundation for future gravitational wave observation in space, said Xiangli Bin, vice president of CAS."This is the first step of China's space-based gravitational wave detection. But there is still a long way to go to realize detecting gravitational waves in space. Chinese scientists will continue to contribute Chinese wisdom to the exploration and human progress," Xiangli said.The satellite has been named Taiji-1. As a Chinese term for the "supreme ultimate," Taiji is well-known as the black and white circular symbol representing yin and yang. The pattern of Taiji also resembles a binary star system composed by objects like neutron stars or black holes.Gravitational waves are "ripples" in space-time caused by some of the most violent and energetic processes in the universe. Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves in 1916 in his general theory of relativity.The strongest gravitational waves are produced by catastrophic events such as colliding black holes, supernovae, coalescing neutron stars or white dwarf stars and possibly even the remnants of gravitational radiation created by the birth of the universe itself.The first discovery of gravitational waves by the LIGO Collaboration in 2015 has opened a new window to observe the universe and encouraged scientists worldwide to accelerate their research.CAS has announced the research program "Taiji" that will study gravitational waves from the merging of binary black holes and other celestial bodies.Unlike the LIGO research conducted from a ground-based observatory, Taiji will conduct space-based detection on the gravitational waves with lower frequencies to observe celestial bodies with greater mass or located farther away in the universe, said Wu Yueliang, chief scientist of the Taiji program and an academician of CAS.However, the gravitational wave signals from those celestial bodies are extremely weak, posing great challenges for detection. Scientists need to break through the limit of current precise measurement and control technology, Wu said.Taiji-1 aims to test the key technologies such as high-precision and ultra-stable laser interferometer, gravitational reference sensor, ultra-high precision drag-free control and ultra-stable and ultra-static satellite platform, according to Wu.Taiji-1 has realized China's most accurate space laser interference measurement and the first in-orbit drag-free control technology test. It also carried out electric propulsion technology experiments, Xiangli said.The first-stage in-orbit test showed that the accuracy of displacement measurement of the laser interferometer on Taiji-1 could reach a 100-picometer order of magnitude, equivalent to the size of an atom."The accuracy of the gravitational reference sensor on the satellite reached ten billionths of the magnitude of the earth's gravitational acceleration, equivalent to the acceleration produced by an ant pushing the Taiji-1 satellite," Wu explained.The thrust resolution of the micro-thruster on the satellite reached a scale equivalent to one-ten thousandth of the weight of a sesame grain, Wu said.However, the technological requirements for detecting gravitational waves in space are much higher, scientists say.CAS set a three-step strategy to implement the Taiji program. It took the research team about one year to develop Taiji-1, the first satellite of the program. It is expected to launch another two satellites in the second step after 2023, and three more satellites in the third step around 2033, according to Wu.Over the past few years, China has sent a series of space science satellites into space, including the DAMPE to search for dark matter, the world's first quantum satellite and the HXMT, China's first X-ray space telescope.In the coming three to four years, China plans to launch new space science satellites including the Gravitational Wave Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM), the Advanced Space-borne Solar Observatory (ASO-S), the Einstein-Probe (EP) and the Solar wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer (SMILE) to study gravitational waves, black holes, the relationship between the solar system and humanity and the origin and evolution of the universe.
