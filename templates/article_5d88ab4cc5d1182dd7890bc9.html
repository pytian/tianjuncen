                Johnson seeks election as UK lawmakers deal him another blow
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson called Wednesday for a national election on Oct. 15, saying it was the only way out of Britain's Brexit impasse after opposition lawmakers moved to block his plan to leave the European Union next month without a divorce deal.After lawmakers in the House of Commons approved a bill designed to halt a no-deal Brexit — delivering the second setback to Johnson in as many days — he said: "There is only one way forward for the country."Johnson insists Britain must leave the EU on Oct 31, with or without a deal, and he accused the opposition of trying to "overturn the biggest democratic vote in our history," referring to the outcome of the 2016 referendum to leave the EU.But Johnson is unlikely to get the general election he craves — at least not yet. Opposition parties said they would not back one until the Brexit bill becomes law. Johnson needs the support of two-thirds of the 650 lawmakers in the House of Commons to trigger an election."Let the bill pass and have Royal Assent and then we can have a general election," said Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.In a second straight day of parliamentary turmoil, the House of Commons voted by 327-299 in favor of the bill, sending it to Parliament's upper chamber, the House of Lords. An earlier version was approved 329-300.Even so, the bill's fate is unsure. Pro-Brexit peers in the Lords are threatening to try to stop it by filibustering until time runs out.The maneuvers are part of a head-on showdown between Johnson's Brexit-at-all-costs administration and a Parliament worried about the economic and social damage that could be wrought by a messy divorce.Opposition lawmakers, supported by rebels in Johnson's Conservative Party, warn that crashing out of the bloc without a divorce agreement would cause irreparable economic harm."There is very little time left," said Labour Party lawmaker Hilary Benn as he introduced the opposition bill. "The purpose of the bill is very simple: to ensure that the United Kingdom does not leave the European Union on the 31st of October without an agreement."The bill would require the government to ask the EU to delay Brexit until Jan 31, 2020, if it can't secure a deal with the bloc by late October.The lawmakers hope to pass the bill into law — a process that can take months — by the end of the week, because Johnson plans to suspend Parliament at some point next week until Oct 14.Johnson became prime minister in July by promising to lead Britain out of the EU, breaking the impasse that has paralyzed the country's politics since voters decided in June 2016 to leave the bloc. But he is caught between the EU, which refuses to renegotiate the deal it stuck with his predecessor, Theresa May, and a majority of British lawmakers opposed to leaving without an agreement. Most economists say a no-deal Brexit would cause severe economic disruption and plunge the UK into recession.Johnson insisted Wednesday that talks with the EU on a revised deal were "making substantial progress."But the bloc says the UK has not submitted any substantial new proposals. European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said "there is nothing new" from London.Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn accused Johnson of bad faith — pretending to negotiate but really frittering away time until a no-deal Brexit became inevitable."These negotiations are a sham. All he is doing is running down the clock," Corbyn told lawmakers in the House of Commons.Johnson condemned the opposition legislation as a "surrender bill" that would tie his hands and "wreck any chance" of Britain concluding successful negotiations with the EU.Johnson, who was a leader of the 2016 campaign to leave the EU, has long said that his enthusiasm and energy for Brexit will allow him to succeed in leaving the EU where May had failed, leading to her resignation.But events have spiraled out of his control. He leads a government with no majority in Parliament and may not be able to secure an election that could change that fact.He was humiliated Tuesday — the first day of Parliament's autumn term — by losing his first Commons vote as prime minister when lawmakers passed a motion 328-301 that enabled their push for a law stopping a no-deal Brexit. His government lost its working majority as one Conservative lawmaker defected to the opposition, and more than 20 Tory legislators sided with the opposition on the vote."Not a good start, Boris!" one unidentified lawmaker shouted after the vote.Johnson responded with swift vengeance, expelling the rebels from the Conservatives in Parliament, leaving them as independent lawmakers. Among those bounced out were former International Development Secretary Rory Stewart; Kenneth Clarke, a former treasury chief and the longest-serving member of the House of Commons; and Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Johnson hero Winston Churchill.Soames came close to tears as he told the House of Commons that he had been proud to serve as a Conservative lawmaker for 37 years."I am truly very sad that it should end in this way," he said.The beleaguered UK leader got a boost Wednesday when a Scottish court refused to intervene in his decision to suspend Parliament, ruling it was a matter for lawmakers to decide, not the courts.The case was only the first of several challenges to Johnson's maneuver, however.Transparency campaigner Gina Miller, who won a ruling in the Supreme Court in 2017 that stopped the government from triggering the countdown to Brexit without a vote in Parliament, has another legal challenge in the works — set to be heard Thursday. A human rights campaigner has sued in Northern Ireland, arguing that the historic Good Friday peace accord is in jeopardy because of Johnson's actions.AP

                    Germany, Netherlands win as Croatia drops points

                Germany flirted with defeat for a second straight European Championship qualifier before Marcel Halstenberg's first international goal lifted the team to a 2-0 win over Northern Ireland on Monday.Coming off a 4-2 loss to the Netherlands, Germany's recovery was unconvincing, helped by Northern Ireland wasting good chances.The Dutch delivered another impressive attacking display as Memphis Depay marked his 50th game for the Netherlands by scoring one goal and setting up two more in a 4-0 win over Estonia.Belgium made qualifying seem a pushover by beating Scotland 4-0 to keep a perfect winning record, but other favorites faltered. Croatia and Poland both dropped points but remained top of their increasingly competitive groups.Rebuild continuesGermany's still in rebuild mode.More than a year on from its embarrassing group-stage elimination at the World Cup, Joachim Löw's team still struggles to get what should be routine wins.Just as South Korea ran Germany into the ground at the World Cup, so hard pressing from Northern Ireland nearly earned an upset win in Belfast. The host had the better of the first half. Conor Washington had one good shot saved by Manuel Neuer, and later tripped over the ball in front of goal, missing the best chance of the game.Germany emerged from the break refreshed and needed just three minutes before Halstenberg volleyed the ball into the net after Julian Brandt flicked on a cross.Stuart Dallas then went close for Nothern Ireland, who continued to challenge until deep into stoppage time, when Serge Gnabry grabbed Germany's second goal on a counter."They pressed us hard in the first half, but at some point they got tired," Halstenberg said. Asked if Germany was getting back to the level of Europe's best, he was diplomatic. "It's hard to say."Ryan Babel was crucial in the Netherlands' come-from-behind win over Germany on Friday and he tore up another defense on Monday, scoring twice against Estonia.It was the first time Babel scored two in an international game and left the Dutch third in Group B, though they've played one game fewer than everyone else.The Netherlands' home-and-away games against Northern Ireland next month and in November will likely decide the automatic qualifying places in Group C.Croatia checkedWorld Cup finalist Croatia was held by outsider Azerbaijan to 1-1 on Monday, denting its chances of reaching next year's European Championship.Croatia won an early penalty for handball, converted by captain Luka Modric, but Azerbaijan wing back Tamkin Khalilzade cut in from the left in the 72nd minute and beat Dejan Lovren before shooting past goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic.For Azerbaijan, a Euro 2020 host, it was the first point of the qualifying campaign after four straight defeats.Croatia leads Group E by a single point from Slovakia and Hungary with two qualifying spots available. Slovakia beat Hungary 2-1 to move up to second. The other team in the hunt for qualification, Wales, was playing a friendly.Belgium takes it easyScotland's Hampden Park was a walk in the park for Belgium.The visitors were three goals up after just 32 minutes as they kept a perfect record of six wins from six in qualifying. With an 11-point cushion to third-placed Kazakhstan, Belgium could seal qualification in its next game against San Marino.Belgium's goal difference of +18 is the best of any team in the qualifying competition and its gone five competitive games without conceding.Russia kept second place in Group I, but was lackluster in beating Kazakhstan 1-0, needing an 89th-minute headed goal from right back Mario Fernandes.Cyprus beat San Marino 4-0.After a fourth defeat, Scotland was in fifth place. It has never finished a European Championship qualifying campaign below fourth.Poland scoreless againPoland looked a dead cert to qualify until last week, and now that seems a long time ago.After four straight wins, a 2-0 loss to Slovenia on Friday rattled the Poles. A 0-0 draw with Austria on Monday left Poland with its lead cut to two points.Slovenia earned a second big win in four days, beating Israel 3-2 to snatch second place in Group G.The competition's top scorer, Eran Zahavi, netted his ninth goal in qualifying as Israel turned a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 lead, but Roman Bezjak drew Slovenia level before winger Benjamin Verdic scored the winner.Fourth-placed North Macedonia kept long-shot qualifying hopes alive by beating Latvia 2-0.AP

                    Northern Irish 'no-deal' Brexit challenge dismissed in court
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                 BELFAST - Belfast's High Court dismissed on Thursday a case arguing that a British exit from the European Union without a withdrawal agreement would contravene Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord.The case is one of a series across the United Kingdom challenging Prime Minister's Boris Johnson's Brexit strategy. Johnson has said Britain must leave the EU on Oct.、 31, whether or not it secures a deal on an orderly exit.Scotland's highest court of appeal ruled on Wednesday that Johnson's decision to suspend parliament for five weeks was unlawful and should be annulled, a verdict that will be appealed at the United Kingdom Supreme Court next week.Northern Irish rights campaigner Raymond McCord, one of three people backing the case, had argued that a no-deal Brexit would breach the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to the British-run province and that leaving without a divorce agreement was not provided for in existing legislation."I consider the characterisation of the subject matter of these proceedings as inherently and unmistakably political to be beyond plausible dispute," Judge Bernard McCloskey said in a 68-page written judgement."Virtually all of the assembled evidence belongs to the world of politics, both national and supra-national."A lawyer representing Johnson's government said on Monday that under Article 50 of the EU Treaty, the obligation to negotiate was on Brussels rather than on the member state. UK legislation in 2017 and 2018 "assumes but does not require a Withdrawal Agreement," said the lawyer, Tony McGleenan.The Northern Ireland case had also sought a legal challenge to the suspension of parliament but the court decided to hear the wider case against "no deal".Judges for Northern Ireland's Judge Court of Appeal said they could hear an appeal as early as Friday, if one is lodged. Lawyers in the case were told to return to the court with a decision at 1200 GMT.Reuters
