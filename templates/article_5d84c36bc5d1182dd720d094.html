                Wine firms languish in Colorado as trade spat continues
            </p>
            <p>
                DENVER - Perhaps Colorado's best-kept secret is the North Fork River Valley, located in a remote central part of western Colorado, a place perfect for growing wine grapes.With its natural irrigation, rich bottomlands and mild climate, the verdant river valley is perfect for growing the quality wine grapes that have won Colorado vineyards several national awards.Even though the Rocky Mountain state produces a tiny volume of wine compared to industry giant California, growers are feeling the trade dispute pinch and seem to stand in unison supporting their embattled west coast comrades."Totally backward and destructive to the industry," said Colorado wine grower Alfred Peterson, of the trade dispute's impact on US vineyards.According to WineAmerica, a Washington DC-based group that represents wineries across the US, the industry's total contribution to the US economy in 2017 was around $220 billion. California produces about 85 percent of the wine made in the US.The United States, the fourth largest wine producer in the world, exported $1.46 billion worth of wine last year, over 90 percent of which came from California.With China only the fifth-largest importer of US wine, industry insiders told Xinhua News Agency that producers are missing out on untold sales to China's burgeoning, thirsty middle-income group of 300 million people.Since April last year, growers from Australia and Chile have seen China sales skyrocket as buyers in the world's most populous nation turn to more affordable brands."It has not affected smaller wineries, but it has hit the industry hard," said Colorado wine grower Ty Gillespie. "They're very worried," he told Xinhua.US global exporters view China as a barely tapped opportunity - one that now is slipping from their grasp. The Colorado wineries may be small and the distance far, but China and the remote Rockies have been connected by the tariff spat."Totally prohibitive," Peterson said of the Sept 1 expected tariff hike that will "eventually hit us as well".On the southwestern foothills of Grand Mesa, the largest flat-top mountain in the world, Peterson and his wife Pam ran the Puesta del Sol vineyard in 1995 and in 1998.Today, his operation produces 2,000 cases a year of high-quality pinot noir as well as Bordeaux style blends, the Alfred Eames Cellars' website said.As a state, Colorado is one of the fastest-growing wine areas in the country, and most of its wineries are situated at around 6,500 feet in the foothills of Grand Mesa, in the state's Western Slope region."Our volume has jumped to 12,000 a year - up 3,000 cases in just the past two years," said Carlson Vineyard co-owner Cailin Portra, whose vineyard is located to the north of Grand Mesa near the Utah border city of Grand Junction.Portra said that Colorado's Western Slope wineries have recently seen great growth and recognition, especially ones surrounding Grand Mesa.Now, Peterson has to pay an additional $800 "tariff tax" on his glass bottle order from China."I tried to order bottles from a US manufacturer, but they were twice as expansive and the quality was not good," he said.

                ICE releases some workers after Mississippi raid
            </a>
            <p>
                300 of 680 arrested at poultry plant, suspected of being in US illegally, released after processing; volunteers provide aid to familiesAbout 300 of the 680 immigrant workers arrested by federal authorities at seven poultry processing plants in Mississippi were released on Thursday as church groups, schools and other volunteers prepared to take care of children whose parents remained in custody following the raids.About 30 workers were released at the plants east of Jackson, the state capital, and about 270 were released from a nearby military base where they were taken to be processed. No court dates were immediately set to determine if those held or released will be deported."Not everyone is going to be detained," Bryan Cox, a spokesman for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), said in a statement.The raids, conducted Wednesday by about 600 officers from ICE and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in conjunction with the US attorney's office for the Southern District of Mississippi, were the largest since April, when agents arrested more than 280 people, suspected of being in the US illegally, in Texas in what then was called the largest worksite roundup in 10 years.In 2006, about 1,200 immigrants were arrested at food-processing plants in Colorado, Nebraska, Texas, Utah, Iowa and Minnesota."HSI's worksite enforcement efforts are equally focused on aliens who unlawfully seek work in the US as well as the employers who knowingly hire them," Jere Miles, special agent in charge of the New Orleans office, said in a statement. "The execution of federal search warrants was about enforcing the rule of law in our state and throughout the country."A spokeswoman for Koch Foods, which operates three plants in the region, told China Daily the company had no comment on the raids. Koch Foods is a privately held company and is not affiliated with Koch Industries or the Koch brothers, who contribute to Republican candidates and support libertarian causes.Joanna King, spokeswoman for the Catholic Diocese of Jackson, said attorneys from around the nation have volunteered to represent those arrested."Concerns about food and clothing are being taken care of at the parish level," she told China Daily. "Our next concern is the financial needs of the families. Many have paid rent but now have no income."Chad Harrison, assistant superintendent at the Scott County School District located about 47 miles (75 kilometers) east of Jackson and near several food-processing plants, said teachers told students about the raids and tried to comfort those whose parents were detained.He said the school district has 4,024 students, including 576 Hispanics, or about 14.31 percent of total enrollment. Most Hispanic students are young and enrolled in elementary or middle schools. On Thursday, 153 Hispanic students were absent, but Harrison said the school district didn't know if their parents had been swept up in the raids."We're trying to make it a routine day," Harrison told China Daily. "We have translators at the schools, and the federal agencies have been very helpful and will help with reunification. No students stayed at school overnight — they were released to relatives or friends."Harrison said he didn't want to "get into the politics of the situation" and noted, "The kids were afraid at first, but our teachers want the kids to feel like school is a safe harbor."Elected officials, advocacy groups and lawyers decried the raids of the poultry processing plants east of Jackson. The industry relies on immigrant labor to work in cold conditions to cut, clean, debone and pack chicken."The ICE raids are both dehumanizing and ineffective as a tactic for protecting citizens from potential harm," Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said in a statement. "These raids will only further alienate communities from law enforcement, disrupt community policing efforts and cause law enforcement to forfeit credibility and trust among the people they are sworn to protect."Bill Chandler, director of the Immigrants Rights Alliance in Jackson, said the raids were part of US President Donald Trump's continued actions against immigrants."These raids are part of an anti-immigrant campaign that Trump has engaged in since the 2016 campaign," Chandler told China Daily. "The raids are meant to terrorize Latinos and get them out of Mississippi. Trump's racist reaction to the immigrants is appalling."Cliff Johnson, director of the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi, called the raids "political grandstanding"."What did the government accomplish today by sending hundreds of out-of-state agents into Mississippi for the purpose of rounding up and detaining more than 680 of our hard-working neighbors and friends?" he said in a statement. "We're aren't one bit safer tonight — nobody believes these people were a danger to anyone. Families have been torn apart and local businesses have been hurt."

                Warriors' offseason 'painful', says Kerr
            </a>
            <p>
                LAS VEGAS - Golden State coach Steve Kerr knows that a new era of Warriors basketball is about to begin.He just doesn't know what that means yet.It has been a rough summer for Kerr, whose roster is wildly different following the offseason departures of Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, DeMarcus Cousins and Shaun Livingston - all on the heels of the team losing the NBA Finals to Toronto and Klay Thompson tearing an ACL in the last game of this past season. He spoke of the summer of tumult on Monday, when USA Basketball opened its World Cup training camp.

                One of the pleasant aspects of working at China Daily in New York is sampling some of the delicacies that pop up in the office, either when staffers return from China or when the goodies are cooked right here.There are the annual holiday servings of baozi and jiaozi and various treats containing bean paste. They all have unique tastes, and some are very sweet and high in calories. There is something comforting about the fact that China still boldly makes treats without regard to sugar and caloric content.The snacks also usually come in colorful, elaborate wrappers, which to me means that if the makers went through the trouble of packaging them that nicely, they must taste pretty good.Recently I got to try something new: goji berries, also known as wolfberries, along with cookie-type treats based on the bright fruit.Xu He, one of China Daily's website editors currently working in New York, gave me and other colleagues each a plastic, octagonal jar filled with probably a month's supply of goji berries. I plowed through almost the entire bottle in a few days.But Xu He told me not to eat more than 15 a day. She says they can "heat you up".I told her they reminded me of raisins, or at least orange-reddish raisins. Goji berries are not as sweet and soft as raisins, and they have a dry, chewy texture.Xu He had them shipped from her hometown, Yinchuan, the capital city of Northwest China's Ningxia Hui autonomous region. As she explained it, each province and region is promoting what it's known for to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.Ningxia has been growing goji berries for thousands of years. The region has ample sunshine, a swing in temperatures between day and night, and unique water quality. The geographical conditions and climate provide an ideal environment for goji growing.From January to May 2019, the export value of Ningxia goji berries reached 90.3 million yuan (about $12.8 million). Exports to the United States were worth 25.08 million yuan, up 57.4 percent."Goji has traditionally been regarded as a good health supplement by Chinese people. Almost everywhere we can see people carrying a glass of water boiled with dried goji berries," said Jia Dengqi, head of the Zhongning International Goji Trade Center in Zhongning county, in west central Ningxia."Demand for goji has been rising, and we have seen increasing numbers of buyers from overseas, including Japan, the United States and Europe," Jia said.What's more intriguing than goji berries? Snacks made with them.Xu He put out two bags of crunchy goji snacks in the office kitchen: "Bairuiyan Goji Leaf Tea Oatmeal Cakes" (green) and regular (red). I'll admit to "wolfing" down about half the bags.They are really tasty, and naturally, came individually wrapped.I am a goji berry convert now. I went on eBay and Amazon and ordered some.Why am I going on about goji berries?It turns out they have some pretty good health benefits: high levels of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, the latter of which help fight cancer; they supposedly can help improve eyesight, reduce blood pressure, control cholesterol and improve circulation.Goji berries have been commercially grown in the US for about two decades. In 2004, they were discovered growing wildly in Utah, and it turned out the discovery was near the site of an 1860s housing camp for Chinese workers who helped build the Transcontinental Railroad.One other claim about goji berries is that they can increase your metabolism, which facilitates weight loss.So could that explain why when I weighed myself after gorging on gojis I was 5 pounds lighter?

                Contemporary dance routine developing a fan following in the capital
            </a>
            <p>
                In a spacious dance studio in the 798 Art Zone, located in the northern part of Beijing, 66-year-old Yuan Xiaofei closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Following the instructions of teacher Madison Hoke, an American dancer-choreographer, Yuan then stretched her body to portray elements from nature, such as wind, water and fire. Yuan, who recently completed a five-day dance course, which ran from Aug 17 to 21, says: "I learned that the course, which is called Gaga people class, is a kind of art therapy, which helps people recover from illness." Yuan has breast cancer and just had surgery for the second time in April. Yuan was among the 50 amateur dancers, who joined contemporary dance workshops in Beijing held as part of the ongoing New Dance Festival, which is in its fifth year. The festival is being held by the Chaoyang Culture Center and the Beijing 9 Contemporary Dance Theater. The event, which aims to popularize the art form, features Chinese and international dancer-choreographers who run workshops for amateur dancers of all ages. Hoke from Fairmont, West Virginia was in Beijing for two years as a dancer with Sol Dance Company from Israel. Hoke says: "The students are very interested in what we are doing and they want to learn more about their bodies and about contemporary dance." The language of movement called Gaga, was developed by the Batsheva Dance Company's artistic director, Ohad Naharin. It is based on a deep listening and awareness of the scope of physical sensations. "We encourage students to use rich imagery that stimulates the imagination while dancing. It's about the passion to move and it helps develop physical possibilities, like flexibility, stamina and efficiency of movement," says Hoke, who started to dance at the age of 5 and has been a certified Gaga teacher since 2016. Zhan Li, the executive director of the festival, who is also a dancer-choreographer with Beijing 9 Contemporary Dance Theater, says: "We invited Hoke to conduct one of the workshops because her method encourages people to move, whether you are a professional dancer or not. This matches with our goal for the festival, which is to engage more people in dance movements." "We've taken our workshops to many communities and schools. Contemporary dance may not appeal to mainstream audiences in a big way, but we've built a fan base thanks to our workshops." Born and raised in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, Zhan, 30, graduated from Nanjing University of the Arts and furthered her study at the University of Utah with a major in modern dance. In 2014, she returned to China and danced with Chinese dancer-choreographer Hou Ying, a former member of the internationally acclaimed Shen Wei Dance Art in New York. Zhan joined in Beijing 9 Contemporary Dance Theater in the end of 2015. Besides Hoke, the workshops also had Australian dancer-choreographer Paul Blackman, Chinese dancer-choreographers Tang Yupei and Chao Ken as teachers. Meanwhile, nine dance performances by artists from Spain, Israel, Albania and China will be staged in Beijing from Oct 8 to 15, and they are free to the public. One of the highlights of the October program will be the theater's latest work, Knot, which marks the theater's ninth anniversary. Barcelona-based dance company, GN | MC, will bring its latest award-winning work, Set of Sets, to Beijing. The work premiered in April 2018 in Spain, and involves repetitive and rhythmic gravity-defying movements while exploring the notion of time as a fundamental concept.

                NY finds $1b in hidden transfers by family behind OxyContin
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW YORK - The family that owns OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma used Swiss and other hidden accounts to transfer $1 billion to themselves, New York's attorney general contends in court papers filed Friday.New York — asking a judge to enforce subpoenas of companies, banks and advisers to Purdue and its owners, the Sackler family — said it has uncovered the previously unknown wire transfers among family members, entities they control and several financial institutions.The transfers bolster allegations by New York and other states that the Sacklers worked to shield their wealth in recent years because of mounting worries about legal threats.Scores of those transactions sent millions of dollars to Mortimer D.A. Sackler, a former member of Purdue's board and a son of one of its founders, according to the filings.They point to $20 million shifted from a Purdue parent company to Sackler, who then redirected substantial amounts to shell companies that own family homes in Manhattan and the Hamptons. Another $64 million in transfers to Sackler came from a previously unknown family trust, using a Swiss account, prosecutors said in their filing.The filing, made in a New York court, follows decisions by that state and others to reject a tentative settlement with Stamford, Connecticut-based Purdue, announced this week, arguing it does not do enough to make amends for the company's and family's alleged roles in flooding US communities with prescription painkillers.A spokesperson for Mortimer D.A. Sackler called the attorney general's contention an attempt to "torpedo a mutually beneficial settlement that is supported by so many other states and would result in billions of dollars going to communities and individuals across the country that need help."The transfers were "perfectly legal and appropriate in every respect," the spokesperson said.As part of the settlement, Purdue is likely to soon file for bankruptcy protection. But New York and other states have promised they will continue to pursue the Sacklers, alleging that family members drained more than $4 billion from the company over the past dozen years. The family has used a complex chain of companies and trusts to control their holdings, some located in offshore tax havens.The Sacklers had an estimated net worth of $13 billion as of 2016, making them America's 19th-richest family, according to Forbes magazine.In its filing Friday, New York told a state judge that the only way it can determine the full extent of those transfers is if all those it has subpoenaed are forced to provide documents detailing their interactions with the Sackler family."While the Sacklers continue to lowball victims and skirt a responsible settlement, we refuse to allow the family to misuse the courts in an effort to shield their financial misconduct. The limited number of documents provided to us so far underscore the necessity for compliance with every subpoena," New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a prepared statement.AP

                Utah setting pace for win-win
            </a>
            <p>
                Many Utah business leaders and legislators are strong advocates for a close relationship with China, so much so that US Ambassador to China Terry Branstad, during a visit to the state in July, commented that other states would benefit by following Utah's example.As one of the Utah legislators with close ties to China, state Senator Jacob Anderegg also has strong personal ties with China.In 2005, Anderegg and his wife went to China's Peking University and University of Xi'an as part of his master's degree program."I was amazed how normal it was. Chinese people are very loving, very kind and were very gracious to us. They are very smart and inquisitive, too. I made comments to my wife that I feel like we are in the United States," he said.In Shanghai, they visited an elementary school where students were from the neighboring orphanage."The little 5-year-old kids put on some performances for us. We did a service project to repair the playground. I started to play with some of the kids and had fun," Anderegg said.Anderegg felt something else from that experience. "It was a strong feeling I felt; I felt the impression that said, you have children here. Later, I found my wife felt the same thing separately," he said.As a result, in 2011, the Andereggs went back to China and adopted a 23-month-old girl from Zhengzhou, Henan province. Two years later in 2013, they adopted a 2-year-old girl from Zhoukou, Henan."We have done enough research to know that if you adopt from a different culture, it's really beneficial that someone else in the family looks like them, who experiences a lot of the same things they experience," Anderegg said. "If you only adopt one, their transition into teenage years can be very hard. They are like sisters now, and I think they will be a great comfort to each other."Anderegg has three biological children and calls his family a "part-Chinese family". "They are our daughters for sure, but they are daughters of China, too. When they get a little older, will take them to tour and get to know China."In 2012, Anderegg, a Republican, was elected to the Utah House of Representatives. In 2016, he won a seat in the state Senate. As a member of Utah legislators' International Trade Relations Committee, his involvement with China extended into his official capacity, and he sought to strengthen the state's ties with China.In 2017, Anderegg and scores of other Utah officials visited China to promote the bilateral relationship."We were in Liaoning province. I could not believe the number of power plants built. We counted 17 new power plants. It's a testament to me that this huge middle class of China is coming of age from now to the next 20 and 30 years. Where is the world economy to go? It will not be US dominated," said Anderegg.Between 2005 and 2017, China's modes of transportation were transformed. "In 2005, most people had bicycles; in 2017, most people have cars. I could not believe the traffic," he said, pointing to another indication of China's economic growth.Utah has many ties with China as one of the top import sources and export destinations for the state. Utah is selling about 40,000 tons of hay to China daily, Anderegg said.In addition, Hong Kong-based shipping carrier Orient Overseas Container Line — one of the world's largest shipping companies — recently opened an office in South Jordan near Salt Lake City."China played an intricate role in Utah's railway construction," Anderegg said.The completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad took place in Promontory, Utah, on May 10, 1869. Thousands of the men who helped build it were Chinese immigrants."Now Utah is trying to set up an inland port and trying to be a global hub for trade. China again will play an intricate role," he said.More prominent is Utah's educational and cultural exchanges with China, Anderegg said. Almost every major university in Utah has 3,000 to 4,000 Chinese students. The state has the most and best dual-language immersion programs in the country, and Chinese immersion students accounted for more than half of that.Anderegg is quite proud of Utah's dual-language programs. "Within the next five to 10 years, when these students are headed to college and graduating, our ability to have an even closer relationship with China will be unparalleled because we have Chinese-language capability on a very technical level. We are preparing our next generation to have the ability to have a much stronger relationship with China and other countries throughout the world," he said.Anderegg considers the relationships at the subgovernmental level vital. "Those bridges and partnerships we can build between Utah and China, with People's Congress and the individual province governments, are vital for the long-term interest of Utah. It will ultimately benefit the country as well," Anderegg said.Commenting on the ongoing trade friction between the US and China, Anderegg said that it makes no sense to cut trade ties with China. "I don't think either China or the US is really served by allowing this to continue for very long. I don't think it's in either country's long-term interests to have an adversarial relationship."If we were to lose all the goods and services we receive from China, like cutting it out 100 percent right now, that would devastate our economy as well as China's economy. That does not make any sense," Anderegg said.
