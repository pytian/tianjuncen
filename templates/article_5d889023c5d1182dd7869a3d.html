                British Prime Minister faces Article 50 endgame
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                As UK government members plan to back an amendment that could delay Brexit this week, British Prime Minister Theresa May has been advised that dismissing any rebels would cause deeper splits in her party.Allies to the prime minister have told her the resignations of Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston from the Conservative party last week have made it too dangerous to sack ministers willing to vote for a Brexit delay.Last week, three pro-European Union cabinet members warned they could vote to delay Brexit to prevent a "disastrous" no-deal.Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark made it clear they are prepared to defy the prime minister unless there is a parliamentary breakthrough on her deal.The trio declared that if hardline Conservative Brexiteers in the European Research Group, also known as ERG, scupper a deal they will back other members of Parliament to try to force Theresa May to extend Article 50 and delay Britain's exit from the EU.The Cabinet ministers warn a no-deal departure would wreck the economy and risk the break-up of the United Kingdom. They say it remains their hope that Parliament agrees a deal "in the next few days".MPs are due to vote on the plan to delay Brexit – proposed by Oliver Letwin, the former Tory Cabinet minister, and Labour's Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee – on Wednesday.It would force the government to request a delay if a deal has not been secured by the mid-March. Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29.In an article for the Observer, Letwin states that a vote for his plan would open the door to Parliament taking control of the Brexit process. "If we don't act now, the UK will sleepwalk out of the EU in just over 30 days with no deal whatsoever," he wrote."Many of us on the Conservative benches have already voted for the prime minister's deal once. We are more than prepared to do so again next week and in coming weeks. But we have watched with increasing dismay as the government has shuffled, bit by bit, towards a cliff edge."The prospect of falling by mistake into a no-deal Brexit, simply because we have failed to create an opportunity for cross-party consensus to emerge, would be a tragic and historic mistake."However, allowing the amendment vote could pose dangers for the government. One Cabinet minister was reported by the Guardian to have said such a decision would "look like the government failing to take responsibility for delivering Brexit on time", and cause a revolt among Brexiteers.Activists gathering for the Conservative party's national convention on Saturday passed a motion opposing any attempt to delay Britain's EU exit.In a speech to the Tory activists the prime minister said the "worst thing we could do is lose our focus".The government has repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility of the UK leaving without a formal deal.Contact the writer at jonathan@mail.chinadailyuk.com

                    MPs determined to prevent UK leaving without deal
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                A cross-party alliance of MPs is determined to use every means available to prevent Britain leaving the EU without a deal in March.British Prime Minister Theresa May faces a resolute fight from a group of senior Conservatives that have banded together with Labour leadership, in seeking to avoid a no-deal Brexit at all costs.The group, including former staunch loyalist Sir Oliver Letwin and the home affairs select committee chair, Yvette Cooper, passed an anti no-deal amendment to the finance bill that defeated the government by 303 votes to 296 – a majority of seven – making May the first prime minister in 41 years to lose a vote on a government finance bill.The first Cabinet meeting of the new year exposed deep divisions in the government, with several pro-remain ministers, including David Gauke, Amber Rudd and Greg Clark, stressing the importance of avoiding a no-deal Brexit.The Guardian reported that Rudd told her colleagues that this would mean reaching out across the House of Commons. "More than ever we need to find the centre, reach across the house and find a majority for what will be agreed. Anything will need legislation," she said.The rebellion by Tory loyalists underlined Parliament's determination to take control of the next steps in the Brexit process.Letwin said Tuesday's vote was the first step in a concerted effort by Parliament to bind the government's hands in the run-up to Brexit day."The majority tonight that is expressed in this house will sustain itself," he said. "We will not allow a no-deal exit to occur at the end of March."On Wednesday, MPs voted in favor of the Grieve amendment, with 308 voting for, and 297 against. It means the government will be required to return to Parliament within three sitting days if the deal is voted down next Tuesday.On Tuesday, the British government acknowledged talks were taking place about extending the two-year Article 50 process for leaving the EU — but insisted they were not at the UK's initiation."There are people in the EU who are discussing this issue but it's not the position of the British government," said May's spokesman."We will not be extending Article 50." However, some Conservative MPs have suggested delaying the date of departure if the prime minister's Brexit deal is defeated in Parliament next week.Britain is due to leave on March 29, at 11pm GMT. But May's struggle to win a parliamentary majority means a delay could become unavoidable.Whether it was May's deal, a second referendum, or even a no-deal Brexit, the House of Commons could potentially accept an Article 50 extension if it were necessary.The EU withdrawal act, passed by Parliament last year, gives ministers the power to amend the March 29 exit date by issuing regulations.According to a report in the Financial Times, diplomats said EU leaders are unlikely to have any problem with a request for a short extension, of a few weeks or months, and most countries are "open" to Britain seeking more time for an election or referendum.The biggest problem would come, it said, if Britain asked for more time because Westminster could not make up its mind, or wanted better terms.

                    Labour calls for vote on Brexit options
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Opposition proposes alternative plan to rule out possibility of a no-deal EU exit The UK's Labour Party moved toward clarifying its policy on Brexit by calling for MPs to vote on preferred next steps in the process, including the possibility of a second referendum. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn proposed votes on options for how the United Kingdom can avoid an economically damaging no-deal Brexit, and the main opposition party is backing a plan that could bring closer the possibility of stopping Brexit altogether.  Demonstrators protest outside Parliament before British Prime Minister Theresa May's speech on an alternative Brexit deal on Monday. Lightrocket via Getty ImagesThe party's alternative Brexit plan, which would be the subject of a separate vote if the amendment were carried, proposes that the UK remain in a post-Brexit customs union with the European Union and have a strong relationship with the single market. MPs are putting forward plans to change the outcome of Brexit ahead of a vote next week on British Prime Minister Theresa May's amended deal. May said on Monday she was focused on altering the backstop - the "insurance policy" to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. More amendments to change her next steps could be added in the coming days before MPs are due to vote on May's proposals for Brexit on Jan 29. Corbyn acknowledged that this latest amendment could pave the way for another referendum. "Our amendment will allow MPs to vote on options to end this Brexit deadlock and prevent the chaos of a no-deal," he said. "It is time for Labour's alternative plan to take center stage, while keeping all options on the table, including the option of a public vote." It is the first time the party has asked MPs to formally consider a second poll, although the carefully worded compromise amendment did not commit the party's leadership to backing a referendum if such a vote were to take place. Pressure on May to rule out a no-deal Brexit is stacking up after MPs derided her so called Plan B. Sky News reported on an estimate, by the UK Border Force, which predicts cross-Channel freight trade could collapse by between 75 percent and 87 percent for six months in the event of a no-deal. It added that a hard-hitting Whitehall report claims uncertainty over Brexit has caused serious disruption in government and torn British politics apart. The pro-Remain cabinet minister Amber Rudd is said to have warned Downing Street that dozens of ministers could resign if Tory MPs are banned from voting to stop a no-deal Brexit. Responding to the leaked Border Force document, Labour MP David Lammy said: "As this shows, no-deal will be catastrophic for British trade. "A worst case 87 percent fall in channel freight traffic means job losses, shortages of vital supplies and potential recession. "It's time for parliament to rule out no-deal, and begin an honest discussion about the remaining options for Brexit, in comparison to remaining in the EU." After her Brexit plan went down to the most resounding defeat in modern British history, Theresa May was told to come back with a Plan B, which she did on Monday. Even though her plan was defeated in Parliament last week by 230 votes, May told MPs on Monday that she still hoped to win them over by negotiating changes to the plan that many regard as cosmetic. She told MPs that she could not rule out the possibility of leaving the EU without any agreement, even though preventing that outcome is probably the one thing that a majority in Parliament could agree on. She also said she did not believe there was a majority in Parliament for a second referendum that could reverse the whole process of withdrawal. And she rejected the option of pivoting toward a model of Brexit that keeps closer ties to the EU, an option more attractive to opposition MPs. jonathan@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily 01/23/2019 page12)

                LONDON - Three members of British Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet have warned that Brexit would be delayed if the Parliament fails to approve the Brexit deal next week.Ahead of crucial votes in the Commons, Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauke told local media that time was running out and that they hoped for a breakthrough in negotiations soon.This was the first time cabinet ministers have warned publicly of a delayed Brexit.Downing Street said in a statement that May is working hard to ensure the country gets a deal with the European Union (EU) that allows it to deliver on the result of the referendum, and that was what the cabinet should be focused on.Britain is set to leave the EU on March 29.

                    Candidates urged to stand aside in crowded UK leadership race

                Candidates bidding to replace Theresa May as Britain's prime minister and the leader of its ruling Conservative Party are vying to separate themselves from the pack in a crowded leadership race that had, as of Monday, attracted 13 competitors and much criticism.Leadership battles typically attract a handful of hopefuls but this is the largest in Conservative Party history.The BBC said on Monday the overcrowded race had led some senior members of the Conservative Party, including Housing Minister James Brokenshire, to urge fringe candidates to pull out in order to save time and leave the waters less muddied."We simply do not have the luxury of weeks of navel gazing or days and days of whittling candidates down to the final two," Brokenshire said in a speech at the Policy Exchange, a center-right think tank.Elder statesman and former chancellor of the exchequer Ken Clarke said on BBC Radio 4's Today program that the contest had become a "shambles"and was "in danger of becoming a rather tragic farce, unless some order is brought into it".Hopefuls have been seeking high-profile endorsements and unveiling policy proposals ahead of May's resignation on Friday.Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who is seen by many as a frontrunner, got a thumbs-up from United States President Donald Trump on the weekend and was further boosted by Liz Truss, chief secretary to the Treasury, and Kwasi Kwarteng, the Brexit minister.Michael Gove, the UK's environment secretary, has been endorsed by former education secretary Nicky Morgan, Cabinet minister Amber Rudd, and Mel Stride, leader of the House of Commons.And Rory Stewart, the international development minister, has been endorsed by Justice Secretary David Gauke.May is standing down because of widespread dissatisfaction within the party about how she has handled the UK's pending departure from the European Union. Candidates have unveiled their Brexit stances. Some favor an immediate hard Brexit, others favor reopening negotiations with the EU and a possible deferral of the scheduled Oct 31 departure date, and others are ranged in between.Candidates have also unveiled other policy plans.Johnson said in his column in the Daily Telegraph that he would like to increase per-student funding sent to secondary schools to a minimum of 5,000 pounds ($6,300) a year.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, wants to establish an Irish Border Council to work with communities to avoid post-Brexi tdisruption along the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.Home Secretary SajidJavid wants to spend 100 billion pounds on improving the UK's infrastructure.And Sam Gyimah, the former universities minister, wants a second referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU.Conservative Party grandees, meanwhile, have appealed to the party's 1922 Committee, which manages rules and discipline, and asked it to look at the rules surrounding leadership elections. Currently, MPs only need two other MPs to back them in order to stand in a leadership race. The 1922 Committee will look at whether prospective candidates should jump through more hoops in order to stand, something that would likely lead to smaller fields.The committee is expected to make a decision on Tuesday.The 13 hopefulsJames CleverlyMichael GoveSam GyimahMatt HancockMark HarperJeremy HuntSajidJavidBoris JohnsonAndrea LeadsomKit MalthouseEsther McVeyDominic RaabRory Stewart

                    UK leadership race boils down to final two

                The final two candidates in the Conservative Party leadership election race to be the United Kingdom's next prime minister were decided on Thursday, with Jeremy Hunt selected to face off against Boris Johnson.A field of four was whittled down to three in an afternoon ballot, when Sajid Javid was eliminated, before the remaining two were confirmed when Michael Gove was eliminated in the evening.Boris Johnson got 160 votes, Hunt netted 77, and Gove 75.On Wednesday, Rory Stewart was eliminated from the contest after he lost the votes of 10 MPs between Tuesday's second round and the third ballot, in which he was backed by just 27 MPs.Prior to Wednesday's ballot, Stewart was the only remaining candidate to have ruled out a no-deal Brexit and the only to argue that British Prime Minister Theresa May's existing EU withdrawal agreement could not be renegotiated with Brussels.In a warning to the candidates still left in the race for 10 Downing Street, he said: "My judgement, my professional, considered judgement, is that what I said is true."We will now see, between now and the end of October, whether people can deliver what they promised and my instinct is they can't."After Thursday's vote, the hustings process begins nationwide and 160,000 party members will decide in a postal vote between the final two candidates. The new leader will be announced in the week of July 22.Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd told the BBC she was not "resigned" to Johnson becoming prime minister."We haven't seen much of Boris," she said, adding that there were 16 hustings coming up over three weeks, with plenty of opportunities for members to decide who would be the best prime minister and "not just a good campaigner".The leadership campaign has been dominated by Brexit — with the candidates criticizing each others' plans for getting the UK out of the EU by the Oct 31 deadline.British politicians' concern over the Irish border backstop arrangement was a key reason why May was unable to win approval for her European Union withdrawal agreement with Brussels.Reports this week indicate Ireland is considering a no-deal Brexit budget for 2020, meaning it will slash spending significantly. It suggests that Leo Varadkar's government is prepared to resist any British pressure to make concessions on the backstop deal struck for the Irish border.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said this week that Dublin would decide "later on in the year" which option to adopt for the 2020 plan.The Financial Times reported that as the October budget is due to be unveiled only weeks before Brexit day on Oct 31, Irish government figures would base plans on the premise of a no-deal.Donohoe will in the coming weeks outline the budget resources available in the case of an orderly Brexit and a disorderly crash-out on Oct 31.Varadkar, Donohoe and ministers will have to choose by September at the latest which scenario to base the budget on.A no-deal budget was emerging as the likelier option since there was unlikely to be clarity on Brexit by September, when budget preparations and negotiations would intensify.

                    Britain 'would need help from EU over hard border': Boris Johnson

                Boris Johnson said he would need help from the European Union to avoid crippling trade tariffs or a hard border with the Republic of Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, should he win the race to become the next leader of the Conservative Party and Britain's new prime minister.In a BBC interview, he said the matter would be " not just up to us" but also stressed that he did "not believe for a moment" that a no-deal Brexit was a likely scenario, despite having already publicly said he would be willing to lead one, and then later reinforcing this position by saying the scheduled leave date of Oct 31 was a "do or die" date.The status of the frontier between Northern Ireland, part of the United Kingdom, and the Republic, an EU member state, has been one of the most insurmountable obstacles in the Brexit process so far.Currently there is no hard border between the two, but a no-deal Brexit could see one re-introduced, which could prove devastating economically and socially.Frontiers, barriers and checkpoints would be a visual reminder of and potential trigger for the restart of the civil conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles, which resulted in more than 3,000 deaths from the late 1960s into the 1990s.Despite numerous statements from the EU that the issue is not open for more discussion, Johnson insisted he would be able to persuade Brussels to help solve it.He said the issue of border checks could be avoided by "abundant technical fixes" but when challenged on whether they existed, he said: "Well, they do actually, you have in very large measure they do, you have trusted trader schemes, all sorts of schemes that you could put into place." However, he added that there was "no single magic bullet" to solve the problem.The BBC interview took place shortly after Sky News postponed a planned televised head to head debate with leadership rival Jeremy Hunt, because Johnson would not confirm his attendance.Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has urged Johnson to reconsider his reluctance to get involved in televised debates－having also done so earlier in the campaign－calling it "very odd".When asked by the BBC about a row he had with his partner Carrie Symonds on Friday night, which led to the police being called, Johnson refused to be drawn saying it was "simply unfair" to involve "loved ones" in a political discussion.However, Monday morning's newspaper front pages featured pictures of Johnson and Symonds, supposedly taken at the weekend, suggesting the couple were on good terms, until it was pointed out that in the photos, his hair is clearly a different length.In another interview on the LBC radio station on Tuesday morning, Johnson was asked 26 times about the origins and source of the photos, and again refused to answer.In the same discussion, he also said reports he had been taking advice from right-wing US political strategist Steve Bannon were "codswallop", despite Bannon having been filmed talking about their discussions "back and forth" about a key speech made by Johnson.

                    UK MPs expected to reject new election call

                Parliament passes law seeking Brexit delay as Johnson tries to nullify the billThe British government was on Monday set to ask members of Parliament for a second time to agree to a snap general election next month, and was expected to face yet another defeat. It would be one of this Parliament's last acts before being suspended on Monday evening for five weeks, per the order of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Legislation designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit was passed by MPs and was expected to gain royal assent and become law before the shutdown. It compels Johnson to seek a delay to Brexit, though he is thought to be exploring ways to nullify it.Downing Street said Monday's vote would be Labour Party's last chance to win MPs' approval for an early election and win its own mandate to delay Brexit. The government is not expected to reach the two-thirds majority of MP votes required to secure an election, because opposition parties want to ensure there is an extension of the current European Union exit date of Oct 31.With the government seemingly intent on finding a way around the law, there has been considerable speculation on how Johnson could be forced to request a Brexit delay from the EU.The BBC reported that one plan under discussion among Johnson allies is to request an extension from the EU while at the same time making it clear that the United Kingdom does not in fact want one. A letter requesting a delay could be sent along with another document setting out the government's political position, with the aim being to prompt the EU to refuse the extension. Asking one sympathetic EU member state to veto the request is another potential option.Johnson met the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Monday morning in Dublin to discuss the contentious issue of the Irish "backstop" measure in Britain's proposed withdrawal agreement from the EU.This meeting came as the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, highlighted the lack of realistic proposals being put forward by Downing Street as an alternative to the Irish backstop.The French government has threatened to veto a further Brexit extension due to the "worrying" lack of progress in the recent talks.When asked if an extension beyond Oct 31 was possible, Le Drian said the EU's patience was waning. "We are not going to do this (extend the deadline) every three months," the French minister added.The comments appear to confirm the fears of the former work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd, who resigned on Saturday, citing the lack of effort being put into negotiating a deal.Meanwhile, the accountancy giant KPMG forecasts UK GDP to shrink by 1.5 percent with business confidence badly dented in the case of a no-deal Brexit.A report from the company claims no-deal would have a significant short-term economic impact on the UK, plunging the country into recession, causing a rise in unemployment and prompting an estimated 6 percent slide in house prices.Yael Selfin, KPMG UK's chief economist, said she expected that in every quarter of next year the economy would contract, leading to the first recession since 2009 and the aftermath of the financial crisis."With the Brexit debate poised on a knife-edge, the UK economy is now at a crossroads. It is difficult to think of another time when the UK has been on the verge of two economic out-turns that are so different, but the impact of a no-deal Brexit should not be underestimated," she said.
