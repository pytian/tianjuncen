                Development of nation can shed light on benefits of a growing economyAround 300 Sinologists have gathered at the ongoing Eighth World Forum on China Studies to reflect upon global challenges and foster an informed understanding between China and the rest of the world.The two-day forum, a biennial event jointly organized by the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences and the Information Office of Shanghai since 2004, opened on Tuesday in Shanghai. This year, it is themed China and the World: Progressing Together Over 70 Years."The world is undergoing major changes with mounting challenges and risks in governance, mutual confidence as well as peace and development. This has resulted in the release of a statement that calls for all countries to act together against this background," Huang Kunming, head of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said during the opening ceremony."We hope the forum will provide international scholars who specialize in China a platform to share their insights, explore how the country is connected with the world and understand the meaning of its development to the world," Huang said.The forum features an opening plenary session, two special panels, six roundtable discussions and a concluding plenary session on topics such as the Belt and Road Initiative and new trends and features of China studies overseas.Bert Hofman, director of the East Asian Institute of National University of Singapore who addressed the opening plenary section, said China's success in development and poverty reduction is of great interest to the rest of the world."Understanding China's past reforms and the basis for China's success is important for China's future reforms - understanding the path traveled, the circumstances under which historical decisions were made and what their effects were on the course of China's economy - and will inform decision-makers on where to go next," Hofman said.At the time of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country was among the poorest in the world. Contrast this to next year when China hopes to celebrate the elimination of absolute poverty among its people."China's experiences will benefit other countries as well, as more countries see China as an example to emulate, a model of development that could mean moving from rags to riches within a generation," Hofman added.Fan Gang, a professor of economics at Peking University, stressed that the development of China has been a critical case that can shed light on the benefits of a growing economy."Cheap and abundant labor is the most often-mentioned comparative advantage of developing countries. However, this has not been the only reason for the robust development of China over the past four decades," said Fan, also chairman of the China Development Institute.Knowledge, he said, is a pivotal element that differentiates developing countries from developed ones.Apart from the discussions, the forum also presented several scholars with the Award for Outstanding Contributions to China Studies in recognition of their accomplishments in the academic discipline. Recipients included Nicholas Platt, president emeritus of the Asia Society in the United States; Hamashita Takeshi, research department head of Japan's largest Asian studies library Toyo Bunko; Kristofer Schipper, a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences and Tu Weiming, professor of humanities at Peking University."I am deeply honored to accept this award for contributions to China Studies," said Platt.He said the Sino-US relationship over the years has become intertwined and neither side can take action against the other without hurting themselves.

                Now that the EU is encountering problems and can no longer be the pathfinder, East Asia can lead the way On August 2, 2019, the annual ASEAN"10+3" Foreign Ministers' Meeting and East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers' Meeting were held in Bangkok, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Ministerial Meeting was held in Beijing. With regional cooperation suffering setbacks in Europe and North America, East Asian regional cooperation has once again attracted global attention. Europe has long led the trend for regional cooperation. The regional cooperation under the European Union framework is the earliest, fastest, largest, highest, and the most complete mechanism and system construction. However, it is currently experiencing a serious setback from Brexit. But it is not just the United Kingdom where there has been upswing in anti-EU sentiment among the public. In fact, the European debt crisis exposed serious flaws in the EU's institutional mechanisms and the refugee crisis added fuel to parties opposing the EU. The United States has long dominated multilateral mechanisms to meet its global strategic interests and lead global governance without distracting from regional frameworks. However, under the current administration, the US has begun to pay attention to bilateral agreements in an attempt to leverage and maintain its dominant position in the global governance system. East Asia is therefore pursuing greater economic integration at a time when multilateralism is under threat and rapid changes and profound adjustments are happening in the global landscape. The total economic output of the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus China, Japan and South Korea (10+3) has surpassed that of the US and the EU, and they are keen to take advantage of that to establish a "three-pole" global economic pattern. Especially in the context of the rising anti-globalization sentiment in many EU countries and North America, it is now time for East Asia to shoulder the historical responsibility of leading the global trend of regional cooperation. East Asian regional cooperation started late, and it was not until the end of 1997 that the"10+3" cooperation framework was launched. Even as the "main channel" of East Asian cooperation, the progress of the 10+3 cooperation has not been smooth. Although there have been some cooperation achievements at the financial level, such as the establishment of the East Asian foreign exchange reserve, it has not been able to initiate free trade negotiations under this framework even till now. To make up for this deficiency, by the end of 2010, four pairs of"10+1" and a pair of"10+2" free trade zones were built. The main path and key step in promoting regional cooperation in East Asia is to combine these five groups of free trade partnerships into a unified Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which would comprise ASEAN plus China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and India). At the 10+3 Foreign Ministers' Meeting held in Bangkok, China's State Councilor and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi clearly stated that "efforts need to be made to conclude the regional comprehensive economic partnership agreement negotiations by the end of the year". At the same time, the RCEP (Commerce) Ministerial Meeting held in Beijing made important progress. In terms of market access, more than two-thirds of bilateral market access negotiations have ended, and the remaining negotiations are actively moving forward. In terms of the negotiations on trade rules, the three contents of financial services, telecommunications services and professional services have been newly completed. The parties have reached agreement on more than 80 percent of the texts of the agreement, and the remaining rules negotiations are coming to an end. The ministers attending the meeting made it clear that the countries must work hard to achieve the goal of ending the negotiations within 2019, which was set at the RCEP Leaders' Meeting last year. East Asia has created a world-famous economic growth miracle and is still the main driver of global economic growth. East Asian economic growth, with typical external demand or export-led characteristics, is more dependent on a stable international environment and an efficient governance system. In the context of the deeply troubled multilateral governance system, the growing proliferation of protectionism, and the undercurrent of anti-globalization sentiment, East Asia needs to improve the regional governance framework to create a free, open and stable regional trade and investment environment. At present, the driving forces for regional cooperation in East Asia are many: China is striving to promote positive interaction between the Belt and Road Initiative and regional cooperation; ASEAN has established the ASEAN community in 2015 and it celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2017, and its leading capacity for East Asian cooperation has been further enhanced. Third, East Asian cooperation has been characterized by being crisis-driven. Just as the 1997 financial crisis forged strong East Asian cooperation, the external pressure caused by the "America first" strategy of the US has once again become a strong driving force for East Asian internal cooperation. East Asia, which once created a miracle of economic growth, has the ability to create a miracle of regional cooperation. The miracle of economic growth relies on a unique East Asian model. East Asian regional cooperation should also rely on its own methods, different from that of the EU and US. The "ASEAN Way" of seeking consensus through an approach that respects the cultural norms of Southeast Asia has played a pivotal role in enabling ASEAN to be at the forefront of East Asian cooperation and become the dominant force in East Asian cooperation. What is needed now, is for East Asia to actively explore how to carry forward the "ASEAN Way" and build the "East Asian Way" of regional cooperation when European and US way of regional cooperation have got into trouble.

                Grand Slam champions Barty and Halep headline starry lineup that features eight of world's top 10Simona Halep and Ashleigh Barty head another star-studded lineup as the Wuhan Open returns for its sixth edition from Sept 22-28 in Hubei province.The prestigious WTA Premier 5 event will feature 17 of the world's top 20 players, including eight of the top 10.Reigning Wimbledon and French Open champions Halep and Barty top the bill, while fan favorite Petra Kvitova will also make a welcome return to a tournament she has won twice."I'm really looking forward to returning to the Wuhan Open for the sixth time," said world No 4 Halep, who has competed every year since the tournament's inception in 2014."Every time we go back the site has gotten bigger and better and the tournament always takes special care of us, so I can't wait to again play in front of the great fans there."Fresh from her Rogers Cup triumph in Toronto, Canadian sensation Bianca Andreescu heads a list of exciting young breakout stars in the field, including Roland Garros runner-up Marketa Vondrousova of the Czech Republic and rising American pair Amanda Anisimova and Sofia Kenin.This year's purse totals $2.8 million, with the singles winner pocketing $520,615.The 900 ranking points on offer for the champion also makes Wuhan pivotal for those trying to seal a spot in the year-end WTA Finals in Shenzhen.The tournament boasts some of the most impressive facilities of any WTA Tour event, including a celebrated 15,000-seat main stadium－complete with sliding roof－and 5,000-seat No 1 Court.The state-of-the-art Optics Valley Tennis Center has 26 courts, an area called Carnival Square designed for fan-focused family fun, and an adjacent shopping center."We're thrilled with this year's entry list and proud to host such a fantastic showcase of so many of the world's best and most incredibly talented female athletes," said Brenda Perry, tournament co-director of the Wuhan Open."With over half the field already having won a title in 2019, it's going to make for some really compelling and fierce encounters every day. It is an amazing opportunity to see the best in the world."Wuhan is the birthplace of tennis Hall of Famer Li Na, now an ambassador for her hometown tournament.Last year Li hit shots with Elina Svitolina on a floating court on Wuhan's East Lake as a novel way to promote the event. It remains to be seen what Asia's first major singles champion has in store for fans this year.Since Li's retirement in 2014, fans have been longing for a new Chinese superstar to emerge.Leading the domestic charge are world No 17 Wang Qiang, world No 34 Zhang Shuai, who reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals this summer, and Zheng Saisai, who hit a career-high ranking of 39 by winning this month's Silicon Valley Classic in San Jose, California.The trio will carry China's hopes at the Open."I'm very excited to come back to Wuhan. Playing in front of my home crowd is an amazing experience and I know it will be a wonderful atmosphere," said Wang."Li Na is an inspiration to all of us and to play in her home city is a great experience. I am really looking forward to this year's matches."Organizers are proud of the tournament's role in developing Chinese tennis."It's wonderful to welcome so many of the world's best players to Wuhan and to celebrate our city by hosting the very best from around the world as well as successful homegrown players such as Wang Qiang, Zhang Shuai and Zheng Saisai," said tournament co-director Li Qiuping."The Wuhan Open will continue to grow bigger and better every year."We're working very hard to help create a new generation of tennis players here, inspired by seeing so many amazing matches at this tournament."

                    UN envoy: Middle East pivotal to global stability
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                Peace and security in the Middle East extend beyond the region and affect global stability and development, China's envoy to the United Nations said Tuesday."China has always paid close attention to peace and security in the Middle East and has always adhered to an objective and impartial position and actively advocated for the establishment of a new security concept featuring common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable elements in an effort to build a community with a shared future for mankind," Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the UN, said at a Security Council session at UN headquarters in New York.Zhang emphasized that it is necessary to increase political solutions to regional hotspot issues, support the UN's role of mediator, promote dialogue and negotiations, and insist on upholding the legitimate rights and interests of all parties.Zhang said the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of countries must be respected."China resolutely opposes the use of force or the threat of force, opposes external interference, and opposes power politics and bullying," he said.He said the issue of Palestine is at the core of Middle East politics."Safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the Palestinian people is the common responsibility of the international community," he told the meeting."We should work together to deal with the threat of terrorism. The international community must … treat both the symptoms and the root causes, and resolutely fight terrorism and extremist forces," he said.Zhang called for preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and for maintaining the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action limiting Iran's nuclear program, which the US withdrew from in 2018.Zhang said responding to challenges in the Middle East is far beyond the power of one country.He called for regional and sub-regional organizations such as the United Nations and the League of Arab States to deepen cooperation and consolidate and strengthen collective security mechanisms."We support regional countries to develop good, neighborly relationships on the basis of mutual respect and non-interference in internal affairs," he added."All parties should persist in resolving disputes through dialogue and consultation, promote the downgrade of tensions, maintain regional security and international energy security, and avoid triggering new crises," he said."We welcome any dialogue initiative that will contribute to peace and security in the Middle East," he added.In remarks to the council, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: "Clearly, from Aleppo to Aden, from Tripoli to Teheran, greater cooperation in the Middle East is needed more than ever," he said. "We need fresh thinking to solve old problems."Pompeo also accused Iran of continuing to develop its nuclear program.Zhang said that China has always been committed to peace and stability in the Middle East.Through the Belt and Road Initiative, China is helping provide development opportunities and platforms for the Middle East."China will continue to make unremitting efforts for the realization of lasting peace, stability, prosperity and development in the Middle East," he said.

                The digital economy in China is picking up steam as digitalization leads a new global round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, noted Zhang Xueying, deputy head of the State Information Center.Zhang made the comments while addressing the main forum of the 2019 World Digital Economy Conference that opened in Ningbo, East China's Zhejiang province on Friday.Echoing Zhang, Gao Xingfu, vice-governor of Zhejiang, pointed out that the digital economy has emerged as a pivotal engine behind economic growth worldwide with the accelerated integration of technologies including the internet, big data and artificial intelligence, all driving social and economic development.China's digital economy accounted for 34.8 percent of its gross domestic product in 2018, remaining a key pivot for the country's economic growth, a report said.Released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology in April, the report shows that the internet-based digital economy rose to 31.3 trillion yuan ($4.6 trillion) last year, up by 20.9 percent year-on-year.As a spearhead of China's reform and opening-up, the coastal province of Zhejiang is leading the nation in terms of digital economic growth.According to Gao, the scale of the digital economy in the province soared 19.26 percent to 2.33 trillion yuan in 2018, accounting for 41.54 percent of its total regional GDP.Zhejiang intends to take the amount to over 4 trillion yuan, double that of 2017.Hosting the World Digital Economy Conference is part of the province's efforts to facilitate global cooperation and exchanges in the digital economy, the vice governor revealed.Luminaries including Nobel Prize Laureate George Smoot, Pan Yunhe, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and Jahannes Vizethum, executive director of DIF Industries 4.0, also delivered speeches at the forum.The conference coincided with the China Smart City and Intelligent Economy Expo which kicked off on the same day in Ningbo.Covering an area of nearly 30,000 square meters, the expo, which ran until Sept 8, attracted over 400 tech companies and organizations, including Baidu, Huaiwei and ZTE, all eager to showcase their latest accomplishments and products.The expo, now in its ninth year in the city, has become a significant platform promoting cooperation and exchanges in smart city construction and the intelligent economy in China.
