            <p class="style-content">
                Doing more good better than doing less harm to reduce emissions In a few weeks the UN will con-vene a climate summit in New York. Unfortunately, the event will, again, be problem-focused. While well-intended, the focus on just reducing emissions from companies and countries is an approach we must move beyond in order to ensure a solution agenda for climate change in the future. The current approach by the UN and the World Economic Forum, which is helping it organize the event, is an accounting approach that focuses on commitment from business to reduce emissions. So, when companies, cities and financial institutions attend the UN climate action summit and talk about their contributions, they will focus on their own reductions and how big emitters can reduce their emissions within existing business models, rather than how innovative new products and services lead to reductions in society. This problem approach is not relevant if we are to deliver the dramatic emission reductions that are needed and ensure delivery on the other sustainable development goals. It is time to move beyond a business-as-usual approach where companies and countries only focus on reducing their existing emissions. We need a solution approach driven by companies, cities, countries and accelerators that focuses on accelerated uptake of innovative and disruptive solutions that will bring about significant changes in how we deliver what society needs. Many of the significant emission reductions today have been made possible by companies delivering solutions for nutrition, mobility and buildings in different parts of society, while not simply reducing their own emissions. Companies cite examples such as renewable energy, electric cars, dematerialization and virtual meetings, rather than reducing their own emissions. The Fourth Industrial Revolution (with global connectivity, new materials and new business models, and falling prices for many key technologies) provides ample opportunities that could radically reduce emissions by delivering much smarter solutions for mobility (including virtual mobility), building spaces (including virtual spaces) and nutrition (especially when linked to health and wellbeing). To accelerate emission reductions, companies, governments and the financial sector cannot be driven primarily by cost and risk reductions in existing systems. They must use their capacity to deliver the kind of innovation that delivers the solutions we need. Governments need to be able to set targets that support solution providers. Investors need to be able to identify winners in a low/zerocarbon economy (not just avoid the losers). Cities must assess how much they can help emission reduction. What is needed is a shift in emphasis from "doing things less bad" to "doing good things", but we will also need tools and methods to quantify and compare the impact of different solutions and potential solutions. By embracing a solution perspective, we will also support companies from traditional sectors and move toward sustainable innovation. Mining companies will shift focus from mines to providing materials in society with sustainable recycling. Automotive companies will move from cars to sustainable mobility, including teleworking and virtual meetings. There are positive signs that we are moving in the right direction, but too slowly. A problem focus will slow us down further. A number of studies show that experts now see real leadership among companies that try to deliver what society needs. In the report on the GlobeScan-SustainAbility annual survey, The 2017 Sustainability Leaders, two separate eras were identified. The first leadership era, "do less harm", lasted until 2006. The second era, "sustainable growth", began in 2007. It is therefore understandable that the UN is lagging behind, but it is time for it to move beyond "do less harm". The first era was dominated by big polluters who showed leadership by reporting and focusing on their own pollution, using traditional tools to measure carbon emissions. The UN needs to base future summits on solution frameworks, such as Mission Innovation's 1.5 C Compatibility Framework. Establishing new structures, knowledge and tools that support the move toward a service-based circular economy, where companies can assess their positive contributions, can help accelerate a sustainable transition. Let's hope that the next summit focuses on solutions and welcomes companies, cities and countries with such focus. The fact that Chile, which will host the global climate meeting in December (COP25), will present solution providers with the potential to reduce emissions by more than 150 million metric tons - more than Chile's current emissions - is good reason for hope moving forward. Emerging countries have a special role to play and hopefully we can see new solution initiatives from countries like Chile, India and China, where companies, countries, the finance sector, cities and accelerators commit to help accelerate the uptake of tomorrows' sustainable solutions. Such a solution perspective would also provide muchneeded optimism for the future and turn the existential threat of climate change into our generation's driver of innovation.

                    Bolton out, but not much change expected in US foreign policy

                The broad outlines of US foreign policy are unlikely to change following the abrupt departure of John Bolton, the third national security adviser to leave the White House post in three years, analysts and officials have said.US President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he had fired Bolton amid "strong" disagreement with the man he tapped 17 months ago to replace H.R. McMaster, who was brought in after Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was ousted after less than one month in office."I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House," the president tweeted. "I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service."Bolton offered an opposing account on his departure, saying on his own Twitter account moments after the president's post that "I offered to resign last night and President Trump said, 'Let's talk about it tomorrow.'"Trump said he would name Bolton's successor next week. The White House said Charles Kupperman, the deputy national security adviser, would fill Bolton's role on an acting basis.Just an hour before the president's tweet, the media corps in Washington had received an update from the White House press office that Bolton would join Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in the afternoon for a briefing on an executive order expanding ways to counter terrorism."I don't think any leader around the world should make any assumption that because some one of us departs, that President Trump's foreign policy will change in a material way," Pompeo said at the news conference, where Bolton was absent.Asked if Bolton's departure would make it easier for him to do his job and for the administration to implement the president's foreign policy agenda, Pompeo said, "I don't talk about the inner workings of how this all goes. There were many times Ambassador Bolton and I disagreed; that's to be sure. But that's true for lots of people with whom I interact."Mnuchin also said the president's view of the Iraq war and Bolton's was "very different".Cal Jillson, a political scientist and historian at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said Bolton's influence had been declining for some time, even as, or perhaps because, Pompeo's influence had been rising."Bolton and Pompeo did not differ greatly on policy, but Bolton's more aggressive and uncompromising personality likely came to grate on President Trump," Jillson said.The New York Times also reported Tuesday that the rift between the president and his national security adviser "owed as much to personality as to policy".A former under-secretary of state and ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, Bolton had been a foreign policy hawk who had fundamental disagreements with the president on Iran, Afghanistan and a slew of other global challenges, The Associated Press reported Tuesday.But even with Bolton sidelined, "the broad outlines of American foreign policy are not likely to change much. Pompeo will continue to take great care to be seen as faithfully implementing Trump's policies rather than be seen as resisting or even steering them," Jillson told China Daily.He said Bolton saw rebalancing the China-US economic relationship as a "critical" foreign policy issue, which will not change in the wake of Bolton's dismissal. "President Trump's principal requirement for his next national security adviser will be that he or she agree with him on most, ideally all, major issues," Jillson said.Pompeo also said the president is entitled to the staff that he wants at any moment.Stanley Renshon, a political science professor at City University of New York, said Tuesday's sudden shake-up was just one more of many illustrations that Trump is a "demanding boss" who is not afraid to make changes."I think he is still searching for the right foreign policy adviser mix," Renshon told China Daily.The succcessor could be someone on the "tough" end of the policy options scale, but someone who can be creative and thoughtful within one's own framework, he said."It has been brewing for a while, and Bolton is too ready to use American force, if he feels it necessary. Trump, for all his verbal bluster, is cautious on that score," Renshon added.

                After national security adviser's departure, Trump says to name successor next week The broad outlines of United States foreign policy are unlikely to change following the abrupt departure of John Bolton, the third national security adviser to leave the White House post in three years, analysts and officials said.

Trump said he would name Bolton's successor next week. The White House said Charles Kupperman, the deputy national security adviser, would fill Bolton's role on an acting basis. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying did not make any comment on Wednesday regarding the resignation of John Bolton, saying it is a matter of US domestic affairs. Stable development of Sino-US ties is in line with the fundamental interests of people of both countries, and is a common expectation of the international community, Hua said, adding that China hopes that whoever eventually assumes the post will play a constructive role in promoting such development.

The new replacement could be someone on the "tough" end of the policy options scale, but will also be someone who can be creative and thoughtful within one's own framework, he said. "It has been brewing for a while, and Bolton is too ready to use American force if he feels it necessary. Trump, for all his verbal bluster, is cautious on that score," Renshon added.

                    Cultural exchanges to boost people-to-people relations between China, Pakistan

                ISLAMABAD -- China and Pakistan enjoy decade-long friendship since the two neighbors established diplomatic ties in the early 1950s, but cultural exchanges of the two nations can be dated back much earlier to the time of the ancient Silk Road.History books record that over 1,000 years ago, revered Chinese Buddhist monks including Fa Xian and Xuan Zang travelled all the way to Pakistan to study Buddhism. In modern times, Chinese dramas and movies of Kung Fu have been screened every week at the country's national TV, enlightening Pakistanis about Chinese culture and traditions.FROM KONG FU MOVIES TO MASTER CHENA whole generation of Pakistanis grew up watching Chinese Kong Fu movies of Bruce Lee and later on those of Jackie Chan. The kids born in the 1980s and 1990s have great interest in Chinese martial arts due to the action movies. The kids even nickname their scrappy fellows as "Bruce" to show their fondness for the Kong Fu star.Stephen Chen trains dozen of such aspirants in a fitness club in a posh area of Islamabad. He speaks fluent Urdu to communicate with his students.Fondly called as Master Chen by his students, the 42-year-old belongs to the third generation of a Chinese family living in Pakistan for decades. Born and bred in Pakistan, Chen loves the country, but his Chinese roots made him choose the profession for himself through which he is not only enkindling the spirit of learning martial arts in young Pakistanis, but also finding solace for himself by being connected to his Chinese background.Master Chen calls himself a bridge between the cultures of Pakistan and China. Initially when he started training in the early 1990s, the response was very welcoming. At that time he could not afford to have a well-equipped club, and used to hold the training session at open ground, but he still had a big class of students and many of them have participated in and won medals at national and international level games.Syed Basharat Hussain, one of the brightest students of the master, migrated from the southwest Balochistan province to Islamabad one year ago. Right after shifting to his new home, he joined the master's class."I am a fan of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee since my childhood, so I naturally grew up with a fondness for martial arts. After shifting to Islamabad I was clear in my mind that I will get trained by a Chinese because he will teach me the authentic martial arts which I wanted to learn," the 14-year-old told Xinhua."And in just one year's time he trained me in many things specially in boxing, making me compete and win national level boxing championship."Hussain was one of the very few in the country who directly got selected for national level boxing championship. "I was not so confident about my skills, but a week after joining the club, the master came to me one day and said that he saw a spark in me to do something big in boxing. I owe all my achievements to him. He goes with me on my every match."After helping Hussain conquer the national games, Master Chen is helping the talent prepare for international level boxing competition next year.

                INGOLSTADT, Germany - China will be a key player in designing cars in the next centuries, a German automotive expert told Xinhua on Tuesday here on the sidelines of the 3rd German-Chinese Automobile Congress."In the future, the Chinese automotive industry will be very important (to the whole industry)," said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, automotive expert at the German CAR Institute.The power train of the future is the electric vehicle. In China, there are some important batteries manufacturers. So China has a big stake in the future car, Dudenhoeffer added.In addition, Dudenhoeffer said that it is very impressive to observe what is going on in China in the field of artificial intelligence, which will help to define the car of tomorrow.According to him, it is hard to imagine the current development of German carmaker like Audi AG without China, as Audi has delivered 5 million units to Chinese customers from its entry into China in 1988 to 2018.China is the center of the car world. China sells more than 20 million cars. The number could be 30 million in a few years, he said.More than 400 company representatives, government officials and experts from China and Germany, attending the 3rd German-Chinese Automobile Congress in southern German city of Ingolstadt, said that they expected to see strengthened cooperation between the two countries in the auto sector and related fields.During the conference, the participants discussed a wide range of topics, including industry cooperation, future technologies, as well as intellectual property rights and talent recruitment.

                CATL and Daimler strike battery deal Chinese battery cell producer Contemporary Amperex Technology and Daimler reached an agreement to supply the German automaker with batteries for its electric truck fleet starting in 2021, Daimler said on Wednesday. Under the agreement, CATL will provide Daimler with batteries for the Mercedes-Benz eActros, Freightliner eCascadia and Freightliner eM2 models, Daimler said, adding that the Stuttgart-based firm will develop and install the battery systems itself. Earlier this month, German auto supplier Robert Bosch said it was teaming up with CATL to develop high-performance battery cells. Automotive expert impressed with China China will be a key player in designing cars in the coming centuries, a German automotive expert told Xinhua on the sidelines of the 3rd German-Chinese Automobile Congress. "In the future, the Chinese automotive industry will be very important (to the whole industry)," Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, automotive expert at the German CAR Institute, said on Tuesday. "The power train of the future is the electric vehicle. In China, there are some important battery manufacturers, so the country has a big stake in the future vehicles." Dudenhoeffer added he was impressed to observe what is going on in China in the field of artificial intelligence, which he said will help define the car of tomorrow. Tata Motors gets ready to go green Indian automobile manufacturer, Tata Motors, launched its own electric vehicle technology, Ziptron, to power a future range of electric cars, according to a company statement late Thursday. The technology includes an efficient high voltage system, zippy performance, long range, fast charging capability, and a battery with a warranty of eight years, the statement said. The company, which had annual revenue of $45 billion in 2018, is expected to launch an electric car with this technology around January to March next year, the statement said. Speaking at the launch, Guenter Butschek, CEO and managing director of Tata Motors, said, "At the heart of our future EV line-up, this technology will deliver a thrilling driving experience to our customers aspiring to go-green." Car production in South Korea tumbles Automobile production in South Korea posted a double-digit decline last month on fewer business days, a government report showed Wednesday. The number of cars manufactured in local factories totaled 249,390 in August, down 15.9 percent from a year earlier, according to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. It came as the summer vacation for most of workers fell in August. Automotive export diminished 3.4 percent to 164,154 in August on fewer business days that offset solid demand for SUVs and environmentally friendly models. E-vehicle startup gets Amazon boost Electric vehicle startup Rivian Automotive LLC got a big boost from one of its investors on Thursday when Amazon announced it was ordering 100,000 electric delivery vans. Before United States-based Rivian started commercial production at its factory in Normal, Illinois, the Amazon order rocketed it to the forefront of electric vehicle makers. Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in Washington that as part of the online retailer's plan to be carbon neutral by 2040 it would order the electric vans from Rivian, with deliveries starting in 2021. The goal is to deploy all the vehicles by 2024. Rivian, a potential rival to Silicon Valley's Tesla Inc, unveiled its electric R1T pickup and R1S SUV last November, but had piqued Amazon's interest earlier.
