                US Senate fails to prevent arms sales to Arab partners
            </p>
            <p>
                 WASHINGTON - The US Senate on Monday failed to override President Trump's veto of three resolutions blocking arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Senators voted 45-40, 45-39 and 46-41 on the override attempts, falling well short of the two-thirds majority needed.Citing the humanitarian crisis caused by the Saudi-led military campaign against Iran-allied Houthi rebels in Yemen and the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the US Congress had put on hold the pending arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.The Trump administration announced in May that it would invoke the "emergency" provision of the Arms Export Control Act to complete the 8.1-billion-US-dollar arms sales to US regional partners in the Middle East to deter Iranian threats.The move, which intended to bypass the congressional review of the arms deals, provoked US lawmakers from both parties. The Senate and the House voted to block those arms sales in June and July respectively.

                US House of Representatives votes to end support for Yemen war, rebuffing Trump
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON — The US House of Representatives on Thursday voted to end the country's involvement in the Yemen war, rebuffing the Trump administration's support for the military campaign led by Saudi Arabia as Congress for the first time invoked the War Powers Resolution to try and stop a foreign conflict.The measure now heads to President Donald Trump, who is expected to veto it, with the White House citing "serious constitutional concerns." Congress lacks the votes to override him.House approval came on a 247-175 vote. The Senate vote was 54-46 on March 13."The president will have to face the reality that Congress is no longer going to ignore its constitutional obligations when it comes to foreign policy," said Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He said the humanitarian crisis in Yemen triggered by the war "demands moral leadership."The war in Yemen is in its fifth year. Thousands of people have been killed and millions are on the brink of starvation. The United Nations has called the situation in Yemen the world's worst humanitarian crisis.The top Republican on the committee, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, acknowledged the dire situation in Yemen for civilians, but spoke out in opposition to the bill, saying it was an abuse of the War Powers Resolution."This radical interpretation has implications far beyond Saudi Arabia," McCaul said. He warned that the measure could "disrupt US security cooperation agreements with more than 100 countries."Democrats overcame a GOP attempt to divide the majority party through a procedural motion involving Israel just minutes before the Yemen vote. Republicans wanted to amend the Yemen bill with language condemning the international boycott movement and efforts to delegitimize Israel. Democrats argued the amendment would kill the Yemen resolution, and most of them voted against the Israel measure."This is about politics, this is about trying to drive a wedge into this caucus where it does not belong," said Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., said to applause from Democrats. Deutch described the boycott movement as "economic warfare," but called on lawmakers to vote against the amendment."The Jewish community also has a history of standing up against atrocities like the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. My colleagues are trying to block us from standing in support of human rights," he said.Opposition to the Saudi-led war in Yemen gathered support last year in the aftermath of the killing of US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Washington Post columnist was killed in October by agents of the kingdom, a close US partner, while he was in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. US intelligence agencies and lawmakers believe that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder of Khashoggi, who had written articles critical of the kingdom.Lawmakers from both parties have scrutinized US-Saudi ties and criticized Trump for not condemning Saudi Arabia strongly enough.AP

                US House invokes powers to end support for war in Yemen
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - The US House of Representatives passed a resolution on Thursday asking for an end to US support for the Saudi Arabialed coalition's war in Yemen, a move that is likely to invite a veto from the White House. The vote was 247 to 175, largely falling along party lines. It approves the resolution seeking to direct US President Donald Trump to remove the US troops from Yemen within 30 days and to terminate US support for the coalition in the war. "The president will have to face the reality that Congress is no longer going to ignore its constitutional obligations when it comes to foreign policy," said Democratic Representative Eliot Engel of New York, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

                Suspected UAE spy commits suicide in Istanbul prison: media

                ISTANBUL - One of two men apprehended in Istanbul recently over suspected spying for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has committed suicide in prison, local media reported Monday.The two suspects were ordered to be arrested by a Turkish court earlier this month on charges of "political and military espionage" and "international espionage."The NTV broadcaster said the duo were held at the Silivri prison in Istanbul, where one committed suicide.According to press reports, Turkish authorities were investigating whether they had links to the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Saudi Arabia earlier admitted that Khashoggi was killed inside the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul on Oct 2 last year.

                Defying Congress, Trump sets $8 billion-plus in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, UAE
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump, declaring a national emergency because of tensions with Iran, swept aside objections from Congress on Friday to complete the sale of over $8 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.The Trump administration informed congressional committees that it will go ahead with 22 military sales to the Saudis, United Arab Emirates and Jordan, infuriating lawmakers by circumventing a long-standing precedent for congressional review of major weapons sales.Members of Congress had been blocking sales of offensive military equipment to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for months, angry about the huge civilian toll from their air campaign in Yemen, as well as human rights abuses such as the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Turkey.Lawmakers and congressional aides warned earlier this week that Trump, frustrated with Congress holding up weapons deals including the sale of bombs to Saudi Arabia, was considering using a loophole in arms control law to go ahead by declaring a national emergency."President Trump is only using this loophole because he knows Congress would disapprove ... There is no new 'emergency' reason to sell bombs to the Saudis to drop in Yemen, and doing so only perpetuates the humanitarian crisis there," said Senator Chris Murphy.Murphy, a Democrat, made public on Twitter on Wednesday that Trump was considering the loophole in the Arms Control Export Act to clear the sales.Several of Trump's fellow Republicans, as well as Democrats, said they would object to such a plan, fearing that blowing through the "holds" process would eliminate Congress' ability to check not just Trump but future presidents from selling weapons where they liked.Representative Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said the administration's action was "unfortunate" and likely to damage future White House interactions with Congress."I would have strongly preferred for the administration to utilize the long-established and codified arms sale review process," McCaul said in a statement.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that US partners in the Middle East needed the contracts to be completed to help deter Iran, and that the decision to circumvent Congress was meant to be a "one-time event."It is not the first time Congress and Trump have clashed over policy in the region, or the division of powers between the White House and Capitol Hill. The House and Senate voted to end US military support for the campaign in Yemen earlier this year, but Trump vetoed the resolution.Reuters

                Kushner renews push for Middle East peace
            </a>
            <p>
                RABAT, Morocco - US President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met Morocco's King Mohammed VI on Tuesday as part of a fresh push on a long-promised peace plan for the region.The trip, which will include stops in Amman on Wednesday and Jerusalem on Thursday, comes amid a flurry of other administration moves to shore up alliances with Arab allies against Iran and the deployment of warships and bombers to the region.Kushner is accompanied by Jason Greenblatt, Trump's special representative for international negotiations, and Brian Hook, the special US representative for Iran.The meeting in Rabat focused on developments in the Middle East and North Africa as well as strengthening the partnership between Morocco and the US, a palace spokesman said.The Trump administration was expected to unveil the peace plan - after numerous failures by its predecessors - possibly as early as next month, but Palestinians have already rejected it as heavily biased in favor of Israelis.Washington has yet to commit to an exact timetable with respect to the political aspects of the plan.Kushner is the chief architect of the proposals and Greenblatt, a longtime Trump lawyer, has served as his right-hand man on the initiative.Upon his arrival in the White House more than two years ago, Trump proclaimed his ambition to secure a final accord ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.But the odds of his succeeding where every previous US president has failed appear particularly low.Palestinians have boycotted the process since Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in 2017.The United States is expected to roll out the economic aspects of the peace plan at a conference in Bahrain on June 25-26.Co-hosts the US and Bahrain have billed it as "a pivotal opportunity... to share ideas, discuss strategies and galvanize support for potential economic investments and initiatives that could be made possible by a peace agreement".Palestinians urge boycottBut the Palestine Liberation Organization on Sunday called on the world to boycott the conference and Palestinian business leaders said they won't attend either, raising further questions about the plan's viability."Any economic project without a political solution is selling an illusion," said Arafat Asfour, chairman of the Palestine Trade Center.Kushner, who will join up with Trump in London after his Middle East trip, has been evasive about the US plan, which has been shrouded in secrecy.While promising new ideas to revive a moribund peace process, he has refused to talk about a two-state solution, the formula that has long been at the heart of international efforts to achieve peace and also the official US position. Instead, he has looked to an alliance with the Saudis against Iran as a way to gain Arab support for his plan.Three days before Kushner's trip, Trump authorized $8.1 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia and other Arab allies, bypassing Congress.Arms sales to the kingdom were frozen after the death of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi in October and in response to mounting concerns over the human toll of a Saudi-led armed campaign in Yemen.But the administration defended the sales as necessary "to deter Iranian aggression and build partner self-defense capacity".AFP - Xinhua - AP

                UN expert eyes probe of Saudi prince role in Khashoggi death
            </a>
            <p>
                GENEVA — An independent UN human rights expert investigating the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi is recommending an investigation into the possible role of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, citing "credible evidence."Agnes Callamard released a 101-page report into the October killing of Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that lays out dozens of recommendations. It calls on UN bodies or Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to "demand" a follow-up criminal investigation.Callamard noted the "extreme sensitivity" of considering the criminal responsibility of the crown prince, as well as Saud Alqahtani, a senior adviser to the Saudi royal court who has not been charged."No conclusion is made as to guilt," she wrote of the two men. "The only conclusion made is that there is credible evidence meriting further investigation."AP

                Saudi journalist Khashoggi victim of premeditated extrajudicial execution: UN expert
            </a>
            <p>
                GENEVA -- A United Nations Special Rapporteur said in a report Wednesday that Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was the victim of a premeditated extrajudicial execution, for which the State of Saudi Arabia is responsible.UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary killings, Agnes Callamard, published the report following a six-month investigation into the killing in October 2018 of Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The report analyzes evidence using international human rights law and considers steps that could have prevented his murder."The circumstances of Mr. Khashoggi's death have led to numerous theories and allegations, but none alters the responsibility of the Saudi Arabia State," the report reads.The report says Khashoggi's killing was the result of elaborate planning involving extensive coordination and significant human and financial resources.The Special Rapporteur also determined that there was credible evidence, warranting further investigation of high-level Saudi officials' liability, including that of the Crown Prince."It (the killing) was overseen, planned, and endorsed by high-level officials. It was premeditated," says the report.Saudi Arabian minister of state for foreign affairs on Wednesday rejected the report.

                US Senate votes to block arms sale to three Arab countries
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON -- The US Senate voted on Thursday to block the Trump administration's effort to complete 22 arms sale to three Arab countries without congressional review.With the endorsement of several Republican senators, the Senate voted 53-45 on two resolutions to block two of the sales, and later voted 51-45 to block the rest 20 arms sales.The votes on Thursday demonstrated lawmakers' discontent with the Trump administration's decision last month to bypass the review process of Congress to complete the 8.1-billion-US-dollar arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Jordan.Citing the humanitarian crisis in Yemen conflict and the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the US Congress has put on hold the pending arms sale to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.The Trump administration announced last month that it would invoke "emergency" provision of the Arms Export Control Act to complete 22 pending arms sales to the three US regional partners to deter Iranian threats."These partnerships are not a blank check for weapons and direct support for a campaign that is decidedly working against US interests in the region," said Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, who sponsored the resolutions.House Democrats have pledged that they would also pass resolutions blocking the sale, according to US media.However, neither chamber is expected to gain the two-thirds votes necessary to override vetoes from the Trump administration. US media reported that the White House had planned to veto congressional efforts to block arms sale.

                Final words of Saudi journalist Khashoggi before death revealed by Turkish paper
            </a>
            <p>
                ANKARA - Turkish newspaper Daily Sabah on Tuesday revealed the audio recordings of the final words of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered last October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The audios were obtained by Turkey's National Intelligence Organization right after the murder, and were shared with relevant Turkish authorities who carried out an investigation into the incident, said the report.The recordings included conversations between the killers of Khashoggi before his arrival at the consulate, who discussed plans to murder and dismember the Saudi journalist.After Khashoggi arrived at the consulate for his marriage procedures, Maher Mutreb, a member of the Saudi hit squad, was heard telling Khashoggi that he would be taken back to Riyadh based on an Interpol order against him, according to the transcripts.The hit squad also tried to force Khashoggi to send his son a message telling him not to worry if he did not hear from his father, which the slain journalist rejected, the report said."Help us, so that we can help you. Because in the end, we will take you to Saudi Arabia. And if you don't help us, you know what will happen in the end," Mutreb was heard saying later in the recordings.The report added that in the end, Khashoggi, who worked for The Washington Post, was apparently drugged and lost consciousness.The kingdom has put Mutreb and 10 others on non-public trials for their involvement in the murder.
