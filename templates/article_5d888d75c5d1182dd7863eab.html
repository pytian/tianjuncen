                Better energy utilization a pressing need
            </p>
            <p>
                Country's August crude oil imports rose 9.9 percent to 42.17 million tonsChina will take key measures to increase capacity, tap more oil resources and establish better systems for the production, supply, storage and sale of natural gas in an effort to further enhance energy security, according to the country's top energy regulator."Due to the particular 'rich coal, meager oil and deficient gas' energy structure, China's crude oil production grew slower than consumption growth in recent years," said Zhang Jianhua, director of the National Energy Administration. "And China's oil import dependency continued to deepen over the years."Zhang made the remarks on Friday at a State Council Information Office news conference in Beijing.To help ensure the security of oil and gas supplies, more efforts are needed to increase investment in exploration and development of oil and gas resources, tackle key scientific and research problems, speed up construction of key production bases, deepen institutional reforms and offer supportive policies."We've already made some progress, and will endeavor to keep oil dependency at a reasonable level," Zhang added.China aims to increase its annual domestic crude oil output to 200 million metric tons by 2022. The output stood at 190 million tons in 2018, and is expected to hit 191 million tons this year.Retail prices of gasoline and diesel in China were higher on Thursday as international oil prices soared following attacks on a major oil-processing facility and oilfield in Saudi Arabia.Zhang said the attacks in Saudi Arabia will not affect China's oil supply."We won't gamble on depending on any particular country or region. And we always attach great importance to diversifying importing channels and we've worked well at that," Zhang noted.Lin Boqiang, director of Xiamen University's China Centre for Energy Economics Research, warned any rise in international oil prices means that Chinese consumers will have to pay a lot more, as China's refined oil prices are closely linked to international markets.A$1 rise in international oil prices would cost Chinese consumers an extra 3.5 billion yuan ($494 million) or so a year.China imported 42.17 million tons of crude oil in August, up 9.9 percent year-on-year.Lin said China needs to pay more attention to energy security."It is indeed a matter of national security and we should beef up efforts to reach the goal of energy independence which will definitely take a long time. We need to not only diversity import sources, but also look for alternatives to reduce oil dependency, such as encouraging people to take public transportation and purchase electric vehicles."

                Saudi investment in UK newspapers not a problem, says watchdog
            </a>
            <p>
                Evgeny Lebedev, the billionaire owner of several United Kingdom newspapers and other assets, will not be additionally investigated over his sale to a Saudi investor of stakes in two of his publications, a British regulator ruled on Monday.The Russian-British businessman had been embroiled in a protracted dispute with the UK government over the sale of parts of The Independent newspaper and the Evening Standard, with the UK claiming partial Saudi ownership may influence editorial freedom. Media regulator the Office of Communications, which is also known as Ofcom, said it could find no evidence of any meddling at the papers following the investment from Sultan Mohamed Abuljadayel.Ofcom, the government-approved regulatory and competition authority that oversees the UK's broadcasting, telecommunications, and postal industry, said no additional investigation was needed. It had been considering referring the matter to the Competition and Markets Authority.Nicky Morgan, the UK's culture secretary, said the government will not appeal Ofcom's ruling.Ofcom said at the conclusion of its probe that a "strong incentive and ability to influence the editorial stance of the two newspapers would have been visible by now" but added that "we cannot, of course, rule out any suggestion that the buyers might in future, perhaps with the other shareholders' consent, seek to present more positive coverage of Saudi matters."Abuljadayel bought 30 percent of the parent group of the Evening Standard earlier this year, through a Cayman Islands company. Initially, his identity was unknown. A year earlier, he had bought a similar-sized stake in The Independent.But Ofcom said the newspapers had not changed their often-critical coverage of Saudi Arabia following the investment."The risk to accuracy or freedom of expression in newspapers is not, in our view, significantly greater where a Saudi consortium takes a 30 percent stake in a newspaper that is 60 percent controlled by an Anglo-Russian, than where that newspaper was 100 percent controlled by an Anglo-Russian".A spokesperson for ESI Media, the umbrella group that owns The Independent and the Evening Standard, said in a statement: "We continue to take the editorial independence of both our titles very seriously. We are pleased, but not at all surprised, that the secretary of state has agreed with the conclusions of (Ofcom that) there was no evidence whatsoever of interference by the investors in our editorial operations."During its probe, Ofcom heard from The National Union of Journalists, which said its members among staff at the papers had insisted that coverage of Saudi Arabia and its allies had continued to be "accurate and tenacious in its pursuit of truth and accountability over human rights abuses and war crimes".Christian Broughton, editor of The Independent, told Ofcom he had no contact with Saudi shareholders and was not aware of their opinions on any of the stories he had covered.The Press Gazette said Lebedev had said the Ofcom report had "completely vindicated" the papers' editorial integrity. In a tweet, he criticized the government's "poor judgment and errors" in probing the issue, saying it was a "waste of public money, and ours".

                Gas prices to rise in China
            </a>
            <p>
                China will increase retail prices of gasoline and diesel from Thursday, according to the country's top economic planner.Based on international oil price changes, the retail price of gasoline and diesel will be raised by 125 yuan ($18) per metric ton each from Thursday, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said in a statement on its official website.The announcement came as international oil prices soared following attacks on the world's biggest oil processing facility and an oil field in Saudi Arabia.Lin Boqiang, director of the China Centre for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, said any rise in international oil prices means domestic consumers have to pay more, as the country's refined oil prices are linked to international markets."A $1 rise in international oil price would cost Chinese consumers around an extra 3.5 billion yuan a year," Lin added.China, one of the world's largest oil buyers, imported 42.17 million tons of crude oil last month, rising 9.9 percent year-on-year.The country's three oil giants – PetroChina, Sinopec and CNOOC – are required to organize the production and distribution of refined oil products to ensure a stable supply in the market.The NDRC said it is closely tracking the pricing mechanism of refined oil products and the international oil market to make improvements accordingly.
