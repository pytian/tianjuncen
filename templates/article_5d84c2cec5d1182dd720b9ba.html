                Huawei sees bigger global role for cloud business
            </p>
            <p>
                Huawei Technologies Co is gaining momentum in its cloud services, with more presence in overseas markets and more domestic data centers in the pipeline.Zheng Yelai, president of Huawei's cloud business unit, said the company is considering its cloud services from a global perspective. So far, the company has the most complete layout in the Asia-Pacific region, including four availability zones in Singapore and two in Thailand.According to him, Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei positioned cloud services as the "root" for the world's largest telecom equipment maker and No 2 biggest smartphone vendor."We are offering clients Huawei's computing, storage and network capabilities through the form of cloud services," Zheng said.Huawei Cloud said on Aug 28 that it started offering services in Chile, providing a full-stack cloud platform and a wide range of artificial intelligence services for Latin America.The move came as Huawei has been serving Chile for 16 years and has earned the trust of customers, partners, institutions, universities, and governments in the country, the company said in a statement.To meet the demands of the region's current and future digital applications, Huawei said its cloud services can deliver a domestic latency, or time lag of only 20 milliseconds in Chile, and a latency of 50ms for other Latin American countries.In Europe, the Shenzhen-based company has also been partnering with local telecom carriers such as Orange SA to offer cloud services or build up their public cloud capabilities with the help of Huawei technology. In South Africa, it has deployed a regional data center in Johannesburg, from which its cloud services can cover neighboring countries and regions.Zheng said earlier that Huawei Cloud's overseas performance is likely to exceed that of other Chinese cloud service providers by the end of this year.Chinese companies Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd are also working hard to build more overseas availability zones to compete with global giants including Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp.The global public cloud market is expected to surge to $206.2 billion in 2019, rising 17 percent year-on-year from the expected $175.8 billion in 2018, market research company Gartner Inc said.Huawei Cloud is also seeing strong growth in its home turf. About 30 of China's top 50 internet companies including Sina and Net-Ease, as well as top 10 domestic carmakers have all adopted its cloud services, Huawei said."We will soon build big internet data centers in Guizhou province and the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, laying down a sound infrastructure foundation for our businesses," Zheng added.Charlie Dai, principal analyst at market research company Forrester, said in the global market, Huawei is strategically opening up new regions and cloud services, aiming to strike the right balance between its partnership with global telecommunication providers and its own cloud operations expansion.

                Bai hoping to stay hot as bigger rewards beckon
            </a>
            <p>
                Rookie continues to close on coveted Korn Ferry spotBai Zhengkai is primed to continue his remarkable season on the PGA Tour Series-China at this week's Zhuzhou Classic at Xiangshui Bay Golf Club.Coming off his runner-up finish last week in Haikou, the 22-year-old from Shantou, Guangdong province, has jumped to sixth place on the order of merit and a strong showing this week could vault him into the top five.The top five finishers at the end of the season will earn tickets to next year's North America-based Korn Ferry Tour, while those finishing sixth to 10th will bypass the tour's early qualifying events and advance directly to the final stage.Considering he has played five fewer tournaments than any of the players ranked above him, Bai's progress in his first season on the PGA Tour Series-China marks a major breakthrough. He missed the first few events while attending classes at the University of Central Florida, but is now taking his courses online.If all goes well, Bai could be a college graduate playing alongside his compatriots and good friends Yuan Yechun and Dou Zecheng on next year's Korn Ferry circuit."I know all the Chinese players on the Korn Ferry Tour and the PGA Tour; we've all played and trained together in the US so I'm hoping to join them soon," said Bai, who takes lessons with renowned Canadian coach Sean Foley."I came to the PGA Tour Series-China to try to get on the Korn Ferry Tour, so I'm really happy with where I am right now. I've made some good scores and had some good results, but I still have a lot of work to do. I need to work harder and play better."Bai has recorded three top-10 finishes, including a victory at the Huangshan Championship, where he defeated American David Kocher by two strokes to earn his first professional triumph.With just the Macao Championship (Oct 7-13) and Hong Kong's Clearwater Bay Open (Oct 14-20) remaining after this week, Bai is less than 2,000 yuan ($282) behind France's Cyril Bouniol for fifth place on the order of merit."I'm hoping to have another good week. Zhuzhou is a very good course in great condition, and I think I have a good plan for it," said Bai."Hopefully I can get off to a good start. From now on, every tournament is very important so I need to have a couple more good ones to get into the top five. It would be nice if this week was one of them."Meanwhile, Bai plans to wait until after the tournament to sample some of Hunan's famous spicy food."I'm from Guangdong and we don't eat much spicy food there. Out here, the food is a little bit too spicy for me, so I probably will wait until after the tournament to try it," he said.shifutian@chinadaily.com.cn

                Striking union could learn from Confucius' middle way
            </a>
            <p>
                 Nearly 50,000 workers in the United States walked off their jobs at more than 50 General Motors plants and other locations across the country's Midwest and South starting on Sunday, striking to get what they see as a fair share of the company's hefty returns.It was the first by the United Auto Workers since 2007. The UAW believes workers are not getting a fair share of the company's returns, but how much is a fair share?In negotiations that resumed on Monday morning and continued into the evening, the company offered to invest $7 billion in its US plants and add 5,400 jobs. It said it was willing to increase pay and benefits, without giving details. But the UAW was not pleased.What if what the union is asking for is too much? It may drain GM of its resources for developing new technology.Then the 50,000 workers might lose their jobs. That was what had happened in the Rust Belt, a region in the US that saw industrial decline starting in the 1980s.Such fears made Chinese entrepreneur Cao Dewang turn down the request of the trade union to enter his factory, Fuyao Glass America, an automobile glassmaker in Dayton, Ohio. He said he would withdraw from the US if the union got involved. A majority of workers voted in support of Cao's decision not to let the union in.On the surface, it is the question of whether workers need the union to protect their interests or whether the union needs to fight with employers on behalf of workers to justify its own existence. The union, it seems, is trying to balance the relationship between employers and employees.But it is not that simple. It depends on how far the union can play its role.Maybe the concept of zhong, or the middle course, can be borrowed from Confucianism, a system of philosophical teachings founded by Confucius, to explain the relationship between employers and workers. Zhong means that one should not go beyond what is necessary, while at the same time not falling short.There should be a balance between how much the employer should give and how much an employee should get.On one hand, an employer should keep enough money for the smooth running of the company and for technological innovation, which will help the enterprise remain competitive. On the other hand, what an employee gets from the employer should ensure he or she can make a decent living.It is human nature to expect maximum benefits. It is counterintuitive for an employee to think about how the company will perform if he or she gets high wages or too many benefits, since the employee is not in a position to think on behalf of the employer.When GM was on the brink of bankruptcy a decade ago, the company's union bore a significant portion of the pain to restore the automaker's financial health.GM was allowed to hire a number of workers at roughly half the hourly wage of those already on the payroll, and with reduced retirement benefits. In the following years, it also hired temporary workers with even lower wages and little job security.This made it possible for GM to compete with its rivals and survive in the competitive market, which implies the company cannot afford to pay all its employees, including those hired after the crisis 10 years ago and the temporary ones, the same hourly wages as its senior employees.In its effort to seek what it believes is the fair and reasonable treatment of workers, the union cannot decide what is most appropriate.It is impossible for the union to know how much money GM needs for technological innovation to keep it competitive.According to the documentary American Factory, workers at the GM plant in Dayton, Ohio, made $29 an hour, while the hourly wage is $12.84 for the Fuyao Glass America workers. But the GM plant is gone, rendering workers jobless. Fuyao Glass America provided employment to some of those unemployed.Zhong, as a code of conduct in Chinese culture, is meant to bring about harmony between people and among different parties.There is no telling what will happen as a result of the current strike. There is no telling whether GM will give in or whether it will consider moving more of its plants to other countries to bring down the costs. If that happens, the striking workers will be severely affected.While zhong can provide some food for thought, the UAW should decide what role it should play in the long-term interest of US autoworkers.The author is a senior writer at China Daily.

                A father's visit to his daughter in Hangzhou
            </a>
            <p>
                My jaw dropped and all I could say was, "Wow," after 36 hours traveling from my hometown, Ahuachapan, 100 kilometers west of El Salvador's capital, San Salvador.Although I am used to long distance traveling, this was my first visit to an Asian country, China, and I was in Shanghai. I was impressed by all the skyscrapers above me, the city's modern well-signaled highways (many in English) and the crowds of people walking and touring along the Bund.For me, it was like an epiphany. Even though the US and Europe have always impressed me with their progress and development compared with other countries (especially developing countries like mine), this encounter made me realize there is a large part of the world I had no idea about at all.After graduating from college, my kid had been working here for a year as a teacher and I intended to find out if all her stories – and what the internet says – are true.After two days in Shanghai, visiting places like the Oriental Pearl Tower and the Financial District shopping at the famous Nanjing Road, we started our trip to where my daughter lives, Hangzhou.When we arrived, she led us to her apartment, just across the street from the Zhejiang University of Technology. Although it was not as developed as Shanghai in 2016 – no English street signs, only Chinese characters – the people were so friendly they immediately made me feel welcome and appreciated.Everyone we met was respectful to my daughter and to me by extension: I was her baba and in China, that counts for a lot! Even though I was 55 at the time, according to Western standards not that old, elders are treated with a kind of special respect here. I appreciated that, and in return I would provide the same treatment to whomever we met.Although there were the expected cultural differences, I learned that family is of great importance in China, as in Latin America, particularly El Salvador. All this made me feel very comfortable and safe about my daughter living here. She could teach a lot, but possibly learn even more from Chinese people than we ever imagined.Little did I know that this was going to be the city in China with which I would fall deeply fall in love.I was amazed the first time I saw the West Lake of Hangzhou. Every story I'd heard about it didn't come even close to describing the beauty of its calm waters and its relaxing walking trails, well-kept gardens and surrounding pagodas. The city almost encircles it, so it's like an oasis in the middle of a frantic and continuously growing city.Visited by thousands every day, all year long, I would undoubtedly nominate it as one of the seven natural wonders of the world. A breathtaking view from the fifth level of the beautiful Leifeng Pagoda gave me confirmation of this.Afterwards, to relax a little and grab a bite, we visited the famous Long Jing Village, one of the finest green tea plantations in China. Coming from an intensive quality-coffee growing country, it was an all-new but somehow familiar experience that really delighted me because of the similarities between our two highly regarded drinks.After a six-hour ride on a high-speed train covering the 1,200 kilometers to Beijing, sometimes at 330 kilometers per hour, and a car drive a little way up north, I was facing the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall. The world's largest man-made structure built many centuries ago was more than I could ask for.Using the state-of-the-art funicular to climb to the top, it was inspiring to walk by and absorb the beauty of the landscape. All these experiences moved me to make myself the promise to return to China and learn from its noble people and their ancient culture, only that time I would learn to speak some Chinese.

                Chinese films looks to make mark in Toronto, around world
            </a>
            <p>
                A short video clip from the Fengshen Trilogy at a Beijing International Film Festival (BIFF) promotional event in Toronto won a round of applause at the Bell Lightbox of the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).Du Yang, vice president of Beijing Culture, said she was proud to present the film project at TIFF, one of the world's top film festivals."With a total investment of over 3 billion yuan, we have assembled the world's top-notch teams to develop this project, aiming to initiate the Chinese mythology film and present China's time-honored literary epic to the world," Du said.Cui Yan, deputy executive director of BIFF, said it has made great strides in the past nine years and forged cooperation with major film festivals like TIFF."We aim to further promote Chinese film industries and strengthen the international cooperation, and build a big communication platform for films in Asia," Cui said.As a "going abroad" program, BIFF is just one of the strategic approaches for Chinese films going global.The filmmakers from North America shared their insights on the implications for the globalization of China's growing movie industry, as well as how Chinese film could integrate its culture internationally.Cameron Hood, a senior story artist, director and producer at Cameron Hood Studios, told China Daily that he loves writing stories, specifically for the world market."Like Minions, I make a lot of money in China, and I am looking for Chinese partners to see what the next big idea for the China market could be as well as for the rest of the world," he said.Hood has visited China and worked with studios in Wu Xi, and brought Western style animation to Chinese partners."We come up with lots of collaboration, because the audiences in China are going so fast. When I did master class in China … the students were very professional, and they keep learning and sharing," he added.Liz Taylor, the president of Wild Maple Films, said she is learning the Chinese language and hoping to shoot pictures and co-produce in China."I really want to collaborate with China because this is the country I really love ... the culture and the people," Taylor said.Raymond Massey of Massey Productions, who co-produced the film Iron Road with China in 2007, said the company is interested in telling Chinese stories around the world."I go to China frequently, and I am excited by China," said Massey. "I have been working with China projects every year since producing of Iron Road. China has a special place in my heart."Unlike here in North America, investors can be only behind the producers who make the movie, but Chinese film investors sometimes drive the producers, and they always ask what day they could make profits," he said.Another hiccup is the language, because Chinese movies need English subtitles in the Western market, which can limit the promotion and distribution of films. "And most of the Western audiences here only know a few Chinese filmmakers, such as Zhang Yimo, Feng Xiaogang, Jackie Chan," Massey added.

                US heartland reaps benefits of China’s capital investments
            </a>
            <p>
                Kentucky needs and encourages foreign investment — especially from China, a state official said Tuesday at the Vision China event in New York.Kentucky has attracted $21 billion in foreign investment in the last three and a half years, including $2 billion from China and $200 million recently, said Vivek Sarin, interim secretary of the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development."The situation in Kentucky is one of great encouragement," Sarin said. "We hustled because business is a contact sport. You have to get out of the office."He made the comments during a panel discussion moderated by Ji Tao, president and editor-in-chief of China Daily USA. The event was held at the Asia Society and co-hosted by China Daily and the Bank of China.Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin led a delegation to China where state officials met investors and pitched Kentucky's eagerness for foreign investment.Sarin said the continuing US-China trade dispute has not affected discussions with China because business is conducted face-to-face, and politics isn't an issue."In Kentucky, we take more of a long-term view," he said. "We build personal relationships. Capital goes where capital is welcome. We make it clear that we want to do more business."Sarin said the Kentucky delegation split into two groups: politicians and business representatives. The politicians meet in one room, and the investors meet in another to keep the lines of communication open and uncomplicated.Xiao Yuqiang, vice-chairman of China General Chamber of Commerce-USA and chairman of the US management committee, said at the panel discussion that he is confident about the future because investment benefits both nations.The market demands efficiency at every level of production. This requires sound management practices and a deep reservoir of human capital, factors that abound in China, he said.Jeff Liu, another panelist who is a CGCC director and CEO of Fuyao Group North America, said Chinese companies operating in the US must understand cultural differences to get the most out their workers.Liu appeared in American Factory, a recently released movie about Fuyao Glass that took over an abandoned General Motors factory in Ohio to produce auto glass. The movie examines the cultural factors as blue-collar American workers adapt to high-tech management techniques.He said attracting young workers to manufacturing is difficult because the work is demanding, and technology jobs pay much better. Nevertheless, training can create engaging jobs that will attract younger workers who will thrive in an industry increasingly dependent on automation."It's hard to find young, talented people," Liu said. "It's not old-style manufacturing, and now involves a lot of automation. We need to work together because automobile production is a nonstop production line."The demands of the production line are unforgiving, and therefore everyone must give their best effort to meet the demands of auto companies, including GM and BMW, while maintaining worker morale. A lapse in either will delay deliveries and erode profits, he said.Liu said his operation is not directly affected by the continuing US-China trade dispute, and he's confident foreign investment will continue to fuel expansion."We work together — and that's a success," he said.

                China: 70 years evolution through innovation
            </a>
            <p>
                Solving Challenges of Post-War SurvivalIn 1949, the Communist Party of China won an epic civil war against the Kuomintang and established the People's Republic of China. It came to power on a popular mandate: reforming agriculture so people could become self-sufficient, create jobs for massive populations displaced by civil war and Japanese invasion and bring China from underdevelopment to industrialization. This was no easy task for the leadership. Moreover, the leadership had spent their lives fighting a revolution and then a civil war. They were not trained economists or industrialists.Following the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the United States of America slapped China with economic sanctions, severed ties and prevented others from having normal diplomatic relations. China was isolated and had to rely on the relations and support available at that time, and the Soviet model of state planning was adopted for industry. It solved a key problem at the time by employing people, assuring industrial output and providing social benefits of health, housing and retirement as social security in a society that for decades had not known any security, suffering from invasion and civil war.On the agricultural front, land was first given to local villagers who in the first stage were grateful simply to be lifted from a feudal social structure and have their own land to live on. However, when this proved inefficient, the land was then communalized in the belief collective agriculture would offer evenly shared yields. This may have worked in the first stage but became inefficient as the nation progressed, facing new challenges.In 1949, collectivization, socialization and central planning were immediate answers rectifying decades of social dislocation caused by war. These measures were considered solutions from the toolbox of options available then. But these were long-term solutions, and the story of China's evolution over the decades to follow would be one of innovation, experimentation and reform, ever re-inventing itself to meet the challenges of both domestic development and global change.Incentive Through Self-ResponsibilityIn 1979, a tiny experiment occurred in far-off Anhui province. Against the backdrop of nearly three decades of foreign economic sanctions and a process of communalization, China's economy needed to change course, introduce new incentive systems and open its economy through a process of reform.These reforms began in Anhui Province, when 18 village families agreed by contract that they would pool resources. As simple as it sounds, it was a bold move. They agreed among themselves they would turn over to the state only their quota requirement of crops harvested. Each family could sell the rest and retain the proceeds. Wan Li, then the provincial party secretary, supported their decision. It was later dubbed the "household responsibility system."In 1981 as a student at Nankai University in Tianjin, the emergence of Chinese entrepreneurialism could be seen across from the entrance gate of Nankai University. There was a fledgling free market. Until then there were no other choices. People had to queue every day to buy food, because they did not have refrigerators. State-distributed food supplies were sparse and irregular; state-store employees dour and irascible. Each day people lined up at those state-run stores with tickets to exchange for staples. Even with money, you could not buy rice or dough without quota-rationed coupons.But across the street, farmers had all sorts of fruits and vegetables. There was variety. People could see the difference, and the goods on offer grew each day. However, at the state stores, every day, everywhere, selection was always the same — if anything was available. At that time, the free market was on the fringes of China's economy..Wan Li's early experiment in Anhui ushered in a new Chinese phrase. People in the street were whispering the words "free market." But what did it really mean? A few bold peasants brought vegetables and peanuts folded in rough cloth -- because they had no bags. Squatting on the curbside, they sold them for cash. Remarkably, they kept the money. People talked about it excitedly.Enterprise Reforms and Innovative IncentivesThat little experiment in Anhui Province, allowing one small group the right to grow their own rice and cabbage and keep profits after meeting state quotas, deeply changed China. A decade and a half later, what seemed like the far-flung dream of an old revolutionary became a reality that would shake the economic order of our planet.It was winter 1992 when Wan Li, then Chairman of the National People's Congress, received me in the corridors of the Great Hall of the People. I was a young lawyer then, shuttling between Beijing and Hong Kong, helping Chinese enterprises restructure to become corporations and set up global subsidiaries through Hong Kong. As Wan Li sat in an overstuffed red velvet sofa in the center of a vast room, he had one question to ask me as a foreign lawyer – how to turn China's monolithic state-owned enterprises into multinational corporations. His vision was already reaching beyond the rice paddies of Anhui.By 1997 I was in Anhui province, where Wan Li's experiments in economic incentives began. As a China trade lawyer, every foreign investment involved restructuring a state-owned enterprise. By retooling one enterprise after another, I inadvertently became the "doctor" of state-owned enterprise reform, and in 1997 was appointed to lead a task force blueprinting a nationwide reform program. The experiment was to begin in Anhui, of all places.On the ground with a team of Chinese economists and officials, we inspected megalithic enterprises in four sectors: iron and steel, cement, chemicals and fertilizer. These were Jurassic enterprises. Leaving the production facility we drove past blocks of schools, kindergartens, cafeterias, medical clinics, recreation centers and retirement gathering areas. A worker could be born, go to school, get married, work, live and die within the confines of this enterprise without ever having to set foot outside. The enterprise was a city in itself.The state-owned enterprises were responsible for housing, healthcare, retirement and all aspects of living, social and material benefits for the workers and cadres at the factory. That was China's first priority after nearly a century of internal chaos, civil war, foreign invasion and semi-colonization. The state-owned enterprise model actually solved the core set of problems Mao and his revolutionaries inherited when they took power. But in the competitive globalized world of the 1990s, China's enterprises had to get rid of their social burdens. This required commercializing everything, and all of this needed regulation. At the time, there was none. Ultimately the costs would be passed on to the capital markets — although they hardly existed either.For example, removing the burden of housing required banking reforms to provide loans so people could borrow money to buy their own homes and developers could borrow cash to actually build them. The need for legal collateral called for land and ownership rights, which also did not exist under socialism. In fact, the very concept of private ownership did not exist at all! Ultimately, this called for constitutional reform.So in 1998 China embarked on a major restructuring of state-owned enterprises together with its entire social structure. The commercialization of medical care and introduction of pension funds meant re-organizing the insurance industry, which in turn called for financial reforms. This thing was so complex it could only be handled by adjusting each link in the chain in a sequential order. China's leadership and policymakers had to innovate banking, real estate, financing, insurance and pension systems within a short period of time to meet social needs.Fast forwarding to two decades through the millennium to 2018, China had transformed into an industrial powerhouse, exporting to the world. The once inefficient state owned enterprises were now multi-national corporations, entering markets unforeseen and unimaginable years before. The non-state sector had already overtaken the state sector in terms of GDP contribution as a result of the reforms that had occurred in 1998.By this point new challenges had taken precedence. A heavy industrial base had created pollution and threats to water, food and health security. Responding with new innovative approaches, China has adopted the "Ecological Civilization" as China's new policy for reducing fossil fuel dependency, restoring the environment and respecting natural boundaries and culture. It envisions environmental protection as the next driver for technology, innovation and a plethora of new industries for renewable energy grids, transport and household appliances. Today China leads the world as the largest issuer of green bonds, debt instruments that must apply finance to renewable infrastructure development. It is leading the global fight against climate change.Environmental solutions require technology, as data is critical for green energy to work. China has placed unprecedented emphasis on technology development and local innovation. The entire Greater Bay Area in China's southern coast is focused on technology development and finance for innovative startups and green energy solutions. China's remarkable transformation over these decades has come from facing challenges head-on, using innovative approaches, experimenting with what might be considered the impossible and then making it national policy. When a new challenge arises, it calls for innovative approaches and these are quickly adopted to respond rather than react to change.The solution for any country or people does not need to come from outside. The solution is within the culture, economy and psychology of each people and nation. From these sets of shared solutions that are pragmatic, ecologically scientific and sensitive to local cultures and conditions, we see emergence of the concept of a "community of common destiny for all mankind." It represents our new universal values. Only this way can there be true diversity and in turn resilience. Isn't that what true innovation is all about?The author is the founding director of the Himalayan Consensus and a senior international fellow at the Center for China and Globalization.The views expressed here don't necessarily represent those of China Daily.

                Pressure from America helps Huawei grow
            </a>
            <p>
                "LIKE THE WEATHER TODAY. NICE AND CLEAN." This is what Hu Houkun, vice-chairperson of the Huawei board, said when asked about his views on the condition of Huawei at the company's annual developers' meeting. China Daily writer Zhang Zhouxiang comments: It has been five months since the United States included Huawei in its "Entity List" and about 10 months since Canada detained Meng Wanzhou, Huawei chief financial officer and daughter of the company's founder Ren Zhengfei. The US administration has given Huawei two three-month "reprieves", though, showing US companies are also affected by Washington's move against the Chinese company. Although the restrictive measures expose the narrow-mindedness of some US politicians, they have not been able to "contain" Huawei, as the company continues to grow. On Wednesday, the Chinese high-tech giant unveiled the world's fastest artificial intelligence computing platform. It unveiled its first mobile operating system, Harmony, last month. In the first quarter of this year, Huawei sold 59 million smartphones, much more than iPhone. Huawei has not only become a competitor that Apple can no longer ignore but also an important player in the global telecommunications market that very few can do without. In fact, by putting "maximum pressure" on Huawei, the US administration has helped it become popular among new consumers. Also, when the US threatened to cut the supply of chips to Huawei, many Chinese consumers said the next smartphone they buy would be Huawei. Thus it would be fair to say Huawei's fan base has expanded after the US politicians targeted the company. More and more Chinese companies are now ready to help Huawei given that the US is intensifying the trade war against China. Even some US companies have been cooperating with Huawei within the US' legal framework, because fair business yields win-win results and trade war leaves no side unscathed. It is time for the US politicians to rethink their trade strategy, as it is failing. (China Daily Global 09/20/2019 page11)
