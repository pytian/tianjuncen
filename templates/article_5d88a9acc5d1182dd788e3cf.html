                Drone attacks on one of the world's largest oil processing plants and a major oilfield in Saudi Arabia on Saturday sparked huge fires and halted about half of the supplies from the country, sounding a warning to all countries that they beef up security in and around their oil facilities to prevent such attacks and avoid triggering a new round of blame game between the United States and Iran.The attacks on Saudi Arabia's Abqaiq oil processing facility and Khurais oilfield disrupted the supply of about 5.7 million barrels of crude oil — more than 5 percent of the daily global supply — which Riyadh said would be offset with stockpiles.It is not difficult to imagine the concern of the international community and the global anger against those behind the drone attacks.Yet it is irresponsible for countries such as the US to jump to conclusions without having any evidence whatsoever to prove their claims. Although the Iran-backed Houthis, who control the Yemeni capital of Sana'a and other areas in the Arab world's poorest country, claimed responsibility for the attacks, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted: "There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen."Still, Pompeo blamed Iran for the attacks, alleging that, "Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply".Is there a reason to believe Washington is simply using the attacks to vent its spleen against Teheran?Saturday's attacks were not the first on oil facilities in a Middle East country. Such facilities have been targeted, albeit on a smaller scale, over the past few months with the flaring up of tensions between Washington and Teheran.This is therefore the right time for the international community to give a clarion call to defuse tensions in the Middle East given that the global energy supply is at stake. With the US putting "maximum pressure" on Iran, the security outlook for the region, the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz in particular, has become increasingly bleak.Washington has already dealt a severe blow to the prospects of peace and stability in the Middle East by pulling out of the multilateral Iran nuclear deal last year. But contrary to its belief, it will not benefit by stoking conflicts in the Middle East. Instead, it will also be scaled by the fire it sparks in the region to fulfill its own narrow political and economic gains.

                Saudi Arabia: Drone attacks knocked out half its oil supply
            </a>
            <p>
                DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - Yemen's Houthi rebels launched drone attacks on the world's largest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia and a major oil field Saturday, sparking huge fires and halting about half of the supplies from the world's largest exporter of oil.The attacks were the latest of many drone assaults on the kingdom's oil infrastructure assaults in recent weeks, but easily the most damaging. They raise concerns about the global oil supply and likely will further increase tensions across the Persian Gulf amid an escalating crisis between the US and Iran over its unraveling nuclear deal with world powers.The attacks resulted in "the temporary suspension of production operations" at the Abqaiq oil processing facility and the Khurais oil field, Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said in a statement carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency. The fires "were controlled," the statement said, and no workers were injured.The fires led to the interruption of an estimated 5.7 million barrels in crude supplies, according to the statement, which said part of that would be offset with stockpiles. The statement said Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil giant, would provide updated information in the next 48 hours.The Iranian-backed Houthis, who hold Yemen's capital, Sanaa, and other territory in the Arab world's poorest country, took responsibility for the attacks in the war against a Saudi-led coalition that has fought since 2015 to reinstate the internationally recognized Yemeni government. But the US blamed Iran, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeting, "There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.""Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply," Pompeo added.In a short address aired by the Houthi's Al-Masirah satellite news channel, military spokesman Yahia Sarie said the rebels launched 10 drones after receiving "intelligence" support from those inside the kingdom. He warned that attacks by the rebels would only get worse if the war continues."The only option for the Saudi government is to stop attacking us," Sarie said.Houthi rebels have been using drones in combat since the start of the Saudi-led war. The first appeared to be off-the-shelf, hobby-kit-style drones. Later, versions nearly identical to Iranian models turned up. Iran denies supplying the Houthis with weapons, although the UN, the West and Gulf Arab nations say Tehran does.UN investigators said the Houthis' new UAV-X drone likely has a range of up to 1,500 kilometers (930 miles). That puts the far reaches of both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in range.First word of Saturday's assault came in online videos of giant fires at the Abqaiq facility, some 330 kilometers (205 miles) northeast of the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Machine-gun fire could be heard in several clips alongside the day's first Muslim call to prayers, suggesting security forces tried to bring down the drones just before dawn. In daylight, Saudi state television aired a segment with its local correspondent near a police checkpoint, a thick plume of smoke visible behind him.President Donald Trump called Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to offer his support for the kingdom's defense, the White House said. The crown prince assured Trump that Saudi Arabia is "willing and able to confront and deal with this terrorist aggression," according to a news release from the Saudi Embassy in Washington.Saudi Aramco describes its Abqaiq oil processing facility in Buqyaq as "the largest crude oil stabilization plant in the world."The facility processes sour crude oil into sweet crude, then transports it onto transshipment points on the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea or to refineries for local production. Estimates suggest it can process up to 7 million barrels of crude oil a day. By comparison, Saudi Arabia produced 9.65 million barrels of crude oil a day in July."This is one of the biggest central processing facilities in the world. The Iran conflict is going to be hitting the world in a new way," said Kevin Book, managing director, research at ClearView Energy Partners LLC.The Khurais oil field is believed to produce over 1 million barrels of crude oil a day. It has estimated reserves of over 20 billion barrels of oil, according to Aramco.There was no immediate impact on global oil prices as markets were closed for the weekend. Benchmark Brent crude had been trading at just above $60 a barrel.While Saudi Arabia has taken steps to protect itself and its oil infrastructure, analysts had warned that Abqaiq remained vulnerable. The Rapidan Energy Group, a Washington-based advisory group, warned in May that "a successful attack could lead to a monthslong disruption of most Saudi production and nearly all spare production." It called Abqaiq, close to the eastern Saudi city of Dammam, "the most important oil facility in the world."In a report published Saturday, Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, noted that although Aramco officials have indicated that exports will resume in the next few days, "there is nothing to suggest that this is a one-off event and that the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels will forgo further strikes on Saudi sites."The war has become the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The violence has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine and killed more than 90,000 people since 2015, according to the US-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or ACLED, which tracks the conflict.The rebels have flown drones into the radar arrays of Saudi Arabia's Patriot missile batteries, according to Conflict Armament Research, disabling them and allowing the Houthis to fire ballistic missiles into the kingdom unchallenged. The Houthis launched drone attacks targeting Saudi Arabia's crucial East-West Pipeline in May. In August, Houthi drones struck Saudi Arabia's Shaybah oil field.Associated Press

                Attacks on Saudi oil facilities cut half of kingdom's capacity, raise global concerns
            </a>
            <p>
                RIYADH -- Drone attacks on two Saudi Arabian oil production facilities on Saturday have halted about half of the supplies from the world's top exporter and raised global concerns over oil supplies.A "10-drone attack," for which Yemen's Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility, targeted Saudi state-owned oil company Aramco's facilities in Abqaiq in Eastern Province and the Hijrat Khurais oilfield on Saturday.Aramco's industrial security teams controlled and extinguished the fire before the flames spread.The attacks resulted in "the temporary suspension of production operations," Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said Sunday in a statement.After Saturday's attacks, Saudi Arabia saw production cut by 5.7 million barrels a day, according to Aramco.The country's total production hovers around 10 million barrels per day, with an average of 9.85 million barrels per day in August, data from the US Energy Information Administration show.An investigation has been launched, according to the Saudi Interior Ministry.The international community has voiced its condemnation of the attacks and concerns over the oil supply.On Saturday afternoon, US President Donald Trump spoke by phone with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, discussing the attacks and Saudi Arabia's self-defense, according to the White House.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran on Saturday, saying "there is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.""Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply," Pompeo said in a tweet.King Abdullah II of Jordan, in a phone call with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, expressed his condemnation of the drone attack, saying "the national security of Jordan and Saudi Arabia is one.""The security of the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and Saudi Arabia is inseparable. Any threat to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is seen as a threat to the stability and security of the UAE," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the United Arab Emirates said in a statement.The Houthis have recently stepped up drone attacks on Saudi Arabia, but most of the drones were intercepted by the kingdom's air defense systems.On Aug 17, Saudi Arabia said that a Houthi drone attack on its Aramco plant in Shaybah Oil Field caused a minor fire.In May, a Houthi drone attack damaged two oil pump stations of Saudi Aramco, according to the Saudi authorities."We promise to widen our attacks as long as the Saudi regime's aggression and economic blockade against our country continue," Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea was quoted as saying after Saturday's attacks.

                Trump authorizes release of oil from strategic petroleum reserve after attacks on Saudi oil facilities
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he has authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve after attacks on Saudi Arabian oil production facilities."Based on the attack on Saudi Arabia, which may have an impact on oil prices, I have authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed, in a to-be-determined amount sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied," Trump tweeted."I have also informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in Texas and various other States," the president added.The move came after drone attacks on Saudi Arabian oil production facilities on Saturday have raised global concerns over oil supplies.The drone attacks were reported at dawn of Saturday with several explosions on Saudi Aramco plants in Khurais and Abqaiq in the east of the country, resulting in fires that were later controlled.Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud announced on Sunday that the drone attacks caused temporary suspension of production at targeted oil plants.According to Aramco, after Saturday's attacks, Saudi Arabia saw production cut by 5.7 million barrels, or about 50 percent of the company's daily production.The country's total production hovers around 10 million barrels per day, with an average of 9.85 million barrels per day in August, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show.

                US 'locked and loaded' after oil attack
            </a>
            <p>
                Iran rejects 'baseless' claims following Trump warning; Crude prices jump 19%WASHINGTON - Tensions are flaring in the Persian Gulf after US President Donald Trump said the United States is "locked and loaded" in response to a weekend drone assault on Saudi Arabia's energy infrastructure that his secretary of state blamed on Iran. Teheran on Monday called the accusation "unacceptable" and "baseless".The attack, which cut Saudi Arabia's oil production in half and sent crude prices spiking, led Trump to authorize the release of US strategic oil reserves should they be necessary to stabilize markets."There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!" Trump said on Twitter.Earlier in the day, a senior US official told reporters that evidence from the attack, which hit the world's biggest oil-processing facility, indicated Iran was behind it, instead of the Yemeni Houthi rebel group that had claimed responsibility.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also said there was no evidence the attack came from Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Houthis for four years in a war widely seen as a conflict between Saudi Arabia and Shiite Muslim rival Iran."Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply," Pompeo said.Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi dismissed the US allegations that it was responsible as pointless."These allegations are condemned as unacceptable and entirely baseless," Mousavi said in remarks carried by state TV.A senior Revolutionary Guard commander warned the Islamic Republic was ready for "full-fledged" war."All American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometers around Iran are within the range of our missiles," the semiofficial Tasnim News Agency quoted Commander Amirali Hajizadeh as saying.China urges restraint Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday that it was irresponsible to blame others for the oil attack without a conclusive investigation."The Chinese side's position is that we oppose all actions that enlarge or intensify the conflict," Hua told a news conference in Beijing."We call on relevant parties to avoid taking actions that will escalate the current tensions. We hope all sides can exercise restraint and jointly maintain the peace and stability of the Middle East," she said.Tensions between Washington and Teheran were already running high because of a long-running dispute between the two nations over Iran's nuclear program that led the US to impose sweeping sanctions more than one year ago.Oil prices surged as much as 19 percent in early Asian trade on Monday on worries over global supply and soaring tensions in the Middle East.Brent crude posted its biggest intraday percentage gain since the start of the Gulf War in 1991.The US government produced satellite photos showing what officials said were at least 19 points of impact at two Saudi energy facilities, including damage at the heart of the kingdom's crucial oil processing plant at Abqaiq.Officials said the photos show impacts consistent with the attack coming from the direction of Iran or Iraq, rather than from Yemen to the south.Iraq denied that its territory was used for an attack on Saudi Arabia.The US officials said additional devices, which apparently didn't reach their targets, were recovered northwest of the facilities and are being jointly analyzed by Saudi and US intelligence. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, did not address whether the drone could have been fired from Yemen, then taken a roundabout path, but did not explicitly rule it out."There's no doubt that Iran is responsible for this. No matter how you slice it, there's no escaping it. There's no other candidate," a US official told reporters.The attacks and recriminations are increasing heightened fears of an escalation in the region, after US Senator Lindsey Graham suggested striking Iranian oil refineries in response to the assault, and Iran warned of the potential of more violence.Actions on any side could break into the open a twilight war that's been raging just below the surface of the wider Persian Gulf in recent months. Already, there have been mysterious attacks on oil tankers that Washington blames on Teheran, at least one suspected Israeli strike on Shiite forces in Iraq, and Iran's shooting down a US military surveillance drone.Agencies - Xinhua - China Daily

                Hangzhou reflects millennia of China history, change
            </a>
            <p>
                China is a country with at least 5,000 years of history. China has seen many changes in its long history from ancient kingdoms to dynasties to the founding of the People’s Republic of China. Perhaps the most rapid and dramatic changes have taken place more recently. Today, the once faraway and cloistered land has become a hotspot for foreign investors, businesses, and visitors from all around the world. The easiest and best way to see these rapid changes is to visit a Chinese city, like Hangzhou.Hangzhou was once the capital of the Song Dynasty (1127-1279). Today it is the capital of East China’s Zhejiang province, just south of Shanghai. Much has changed in Hangzhou since the Song Dynasty. In more recent years, Hangzhou has grown into a world-class city. Foreign trade and investment, as well as business sectors, have seen robust expansion. Hangzhou is home to international trade expos, international investment centers, and the Zhejiang World Trade Center. It is also home to numerous tech start-ups, retail companies, internet developers, and the global e-commerce giant Alibaba. All of this growth and change has greatly improved the local economy and China’s overall GDP.The physical shape of Hangzhou, like most of China, is also changing. Like every major city in China, construction is a constant 24/7 occurrence. The physical alteration of the land has been extraordinary. I currently work in an office in Binjiang district, which five years ago was a rice paddy. Now it is filled with bars, restaurants, cafes, Japanese sushi joints, foreign language schools, water parks, and even a park with a replica of Venice. Also, when I first lived here in 2016, there were only metro Lines 1 and 4. Now there is Line 2, part of Line 5 is open, and 6 additional lines are either planned or under construction. The city and the country show no signs of slowing down the current lightning pace of progress.But perhaps the most striking and visible change China is undergoing can be seen in the faces of its people. Long ago, Chinese cities were top destinations for travelers and traders. Hangzhou was even visited by Marco Polo. Today, China and Hangzhou are enjoying a bit of a golden age when it comes to welcoming foreign visitors and workers. Hangzhou has become a melting pot over the past few years and has high hopes of becoming an international city like its neighbor, Shanghai. I personally have met people from such diverse places as Russia, Yemen, the UK, USA, Ukraine, Madagascar, Zambia, South Africa, Canada, Iceland, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, among countless others. Many come to Hangzhou to either attend university or contribute actively to the work force. When they are not hard at work or studying, many expats are playing a role in Hangzhou’s up and coming arts scene. Expats have been getting together to express themselves at local open mics and art events, adding their flavor to Hangzhou’s creative scene. Groups such as the Hangzhou Writer’s Association or Screaming Lemur Theatre offer a place for writers and performers at all levels and abilities to express themselves. Hangzhou also enjoys local arts festivals, such as Tribe Fest, which is organized almost entirely by expats. It also sponsors the Hangzhou International Theatre Festival, which includes performances from all over the world. In time, Hangzhou’s arts scene might even rival that of Shanghai.In conclusion, China has been undergoing a staggering amount of change and development over the past few years. Hangzhou with its rapid construction, economic development, increasing diversity, and rising and vibrant arts scene, provides an excellent microcosm for the rest of the country. Today’s China is a whole new world compared to its ancient past. Everyday China is evolving and expanding. What China will look like in five years, or even one year is impossible to tell. However, whatever the result, it certainly will be an interesting place to visit and a key player on the world stage.The author is the current administrator and editor for the Hangzhou Writers’ Association International.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                Iran rules out talks with US as tensions rise
            </a>

                Supreme leader digs in after Teheran blamed for attacks on Saudi oil facilitiesTEHERAN - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei announced on Tuesday that "there will be no talks with the United States at any level", as tensions mount between the two countries after Washington blamed Teheran for attacks on Saudi oil installations, which Iran has denied.Iranian state TV quoted Khamenei as saying this is the position of the entire leadership of the country and that "all officials in the Islamic Republic unanimously believe" this.Khamenei said the US wants to prove its "maximum pressure policy" against Iran is successful."In return, we have to prove that the policy is not worth a penny for the Iranian nation," Khamenei said. "That's why all Iranian officials, from the president and the foreign minister to all others have announced that we do not negotiate (with the US) either bilaterally or multilaterally."There had been reports about a possible meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, during the upcoming United Nations General Assembly this month in New York.But tensions roiling the Persian Gulf have escalated following a weekend attack on major oil sites in Saudi Arabia that the US alleged Iran was responsible for - a charge Iran has denied.The attack on Saudi Arabia, which set ablaze a crucial Saudi oil processing plant and a key oilfield, was claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebels, who are at war with a Saudi-led coalition that is trying to restore Yemen's internationally recognized government to power.Around 3 million barrels per day of Saudi oil will remain offline for a month, about half the production halted by the devastating attacks, S&P Platts said on Tuesday.Trump said on Monday it looked like Iran was behind the attacks on the oil plants but stressed he did not want to go to war, as the strikes sent oil prices soaring and raised fears of a new Middle East conflict.The strikes damaged the world's biggest crude-processing plant and triggered the largest jump in crude prices in decades.Rouhani said the drone attacks were a "legitimate defense and counterattack" against the Saudi-led war in Yemen."Regarding the drones' attack, this problem has its root in invading Yemen. They (the Saudi-led coalition) are bombing Yemen on a daily basis," he said during a summit in Turkey to discuss Syrian crisis with the Russian and Turkish leaders.Raising concernsIn Riyadh, officials said on Monday initial investigations indicate that Iranian weapons were used in the attacks and it "will invite UN and international experts to view the situation on the ground and to participate in the investigations".A statement from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: "The kingdom will take the appropriate measures based on the results of the investigation, to ensure its security and stability."It called Saturday's attack that resulted in the suspension of approximately 50 percent of Saudi Aramco's production "an unprecedented act of aggression and sabotage" and an "egregious crime which threatens international peace and security".Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, who currently chairs the UN Security Council, said the attacks on the Saudi oil installations were "unanimously and unequivocally condemned" by all 15 council members.As for Trump's statement that the US is "locked and loaded" to respond if necessary, Nebenzia said: "We are very concerned that incidents similar to this may provoke larger conflicts in the Gulf."Agencies
