                Luo Zhaohui, director-general of Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Department of Asian Affairs, hosted an interview with People.com.cn on Thursday, reviewing China's Asia diplomacy in 2011 and exchanged views with netizens on China's relations with its neighbors.Luo Zhaohui, director-general of Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Department of Asian Affairs, poses for a photo as he hosts an interview with People.com.cn on Jan 5, 2012. [Photo/People.com.cn]Topic: DPRK and ROKQ: How do you look at the situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and Northeast Asia after the death of the DPRK’s top leader Kim Jong-il? What is your expectation on the development of China-DPRK relations? Do you have confidence in maintaining the stability and peace of Northeast Asia and resuming the Six-Party Talks? Do you think there will be a war between the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the DPRK?A: China and DPRK are friendly neighbors. China has expressed its condolence after the death of Kim Jong-il and extended its sincere comfort to the people of the DPRK. Kim Jong-il was the leader of the people of the DPRK and also a close friend of the Chinese people. Kim had made important contributions to developing the socialist cause of the DPRK and the Sino-DPRK friendship, good neighborliness and cooperation.Related readings: Biography of Luo ZhaohuiIt is China's constant policy to continuously develop and consolidate the traditional friendly bilateral relations. We will continue adhering to the spirit of "facing the future, inheriting the tradition, strengthening cooperation and good neighborliness" to develop Sino-DPRK relations.China's determination on maintaining the Korean Peninsula's stability and peace is unshakable. The peace and stability of the region is in accordance with the common interests of all relevant parties. The Six-Party Talks are an effective mechanism to realize the denuclearization of this region and maintain the peace and stability of the peninsula and Northeast Asia. Despite new changes to the regional situation, I still believe that the Six-Party Talks will definitely restart and make positive progress as long as the related parties hold the confidence, show their political sincerity and continue dialogue and contact.I think it is totally unnecessary for netizens to worry about war. Pursuing the peace and development is the general trend of the international community. We have noticed the DPRK-ROK relations have experienced some twists, but the overall trend is still featured in dialogue, contact, cooperation and reconciliation. We hope and support the two sides to improve their bilateral relations through talks, promote cooperation and maintain the peninsula's peace and stability.
