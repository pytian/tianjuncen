                    FOCAC 2018 concludes on high note

                The third Forum on China-Africa Cooperation summit has concluded, and there are many takeaways as African leaders head back home. It presented a perfect opportunity for China and Africa to reaffirm their relationship amid a hostile global environment — one not only against multilateralism, which is fundamental to the two partners' growth, but also bitterly critical of the cooperation.From President Xi Jinping's keynote speech, it’s obvious China is quite aware of these dynamics, in addition to Africa's expectations for continued cooperation. In the recent past, many African governments have adopted a stance of looking east, establishing firm diplomatic relations with China. This year's summit was held under the theme "China and Africa: Toward an Even Stronger Community with a Shared Future through Win-Win Cooperation" and saw Xi welcome three new participants: the Gambia, Sao Tome and Principe, and Burkina Faso.African governments, therefore, need to return to the drawing board and implement reforms that would significantly improve investment environments. It is interesting to note despite the rising wages in China, Africa is yet to witness the relocation of millions of jobs from China as widely predicted. This has been largely blamed on complex policies that are not clear and in many cases unfavorable for Chinese investors. Moreover, many Chinese businesses have been disappointed by the size of markets and have encountered restrictions when attempting cross-border trade. It is imperative Africa accelerates the implementation of the Continental Free Trade Area agreement signed in Kigali, Rwanda in March that aims to harmonize policies and facilitate cross-border trade of finished products.In addition, to capture Chinese private investments, Africa will have to reform policies regulating investment models that hold great potential for increasing private participation in large projects. The public-private partnership model has barely taken off in Africa compared to Asia and Latin America, because of unclear regulations and a lack of bankable projects. The FOCAC 2018 commitments therefore bring new momentum to make this investment model popular in Africa.The move also shifts focus, from piling more debt on Africa to pushing for more foreign investments into the continent. It does not only create opportunities for Chinese private investors, but also widens the field for other investors while boosting the continent's efforts to diversify their economies. In 2017, weak oil prices and a sluggish global commodity market saw foreign direct investment flows to Africa slump to $42 billion, a 21 percent decline from 2016 according to the UN Conference on Trade and Development.It was also notable President Xi highlighted industrial promotion, infrastructure connectivity, trade facilitation, green development, capacity building, health care, people-to-people exchanges, peace and security. These are issues that have grabbed headlines in the recent past as the two partners implement the Belt and Road Initiative while prioritizing sustainability.Most importantly, China pledged to boost skill capacity, especially in agriculture, in a bid to strengthen food security in the continent. Xi said 50 agricultural assistance programs will be implemented, provide one billion yuan of emergency humanitarian food assistance to African countries affected by natural disasters, send 500 senior agriculture experts to Africa and train young researchers in agricultural science and entrepreneurs in agribusines. This would go a long way in cutting down Africa's burgeoning food import bill that has reached $35 billion annually, and is estimated to jump to $110 billion by 2025.The writer is a senior economic researcher at Smartcomm Communications, a think tank based in Kenya.

                    FOCAC strengthens global peace and spirit of brotherhood

                The third-round of Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, hosted by China last week, added further weight to the mutual ties between two parties and was a heartwarming story for China and Africa and for the world. The two-day summit strengthened the spirit of brotherhood between China and Africa and left no room for doubt or misunderstandings.The two sides, which form roughly 2.6 billion population, approved an action plan for bilateral cooperation in the next three years and pledged to step up building a community with shared future as President Xi Jinping pointed out in his keynote speech, “The over 1.3 billion Chinese people have been with over 1.2 billion African people in pursuing a shared future.”In this forum, in addition to pledging to respect the principle of non-interference, providing $60 billion in support which includes free aids, loans and special funds for African development, promote the Belt and Road Initiative with international partners, Xi illustrated the criteria of building a community with shared future for China and Africa and for mankind. For example, to build a peaceful, harmonious and prosperous community, Xi reiterated win-win cooperation and common development denying the “only my backyard” or “winner take all” mentalities. He said China would pursue “the principle of giving more and taking less, giving before taking and giving without asking for return.”As a peace-loving member of not only China-African family but also human family, Chinese side reaffirmed its intention to support global peace and China’s peacekeeping mission. In other words, the objective of the forum went beyond protecting bilateral interests as Xi maintained to “make the world a place of peace and stability and life happier and more fulfilling for all.” In his key note speech, Xi reiterated safeguarding global peace in general and peace in Africa in particular. To reinforce peace and stability in Africa, Xi said, “China decided to set up a China-Africa peace and security fund to boost our cooperation on peace, security, peacekeeping, and law and order.” He went on to say, “A China-Africa peace and security forum will be established as a platform for conducting more exchanges in this area.”If 2.6 billion people on earth live peacefully and support global peace with genuine intention, it will put a highly positive impact on the global security and stability. On the contrary, if even a small state plays a destructive role and violates the principle of “live and let live”, it will have a horrible consequence on the world and will put all nations at risk. Hence, when a nation is seeking to play its role constructively in the current global era, this nation deserves global praise and support.The objective of this forum was in line with the UN Charter, the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Universal Declaration of Human Rights as all these international instruments are in pursuit of global peace and prosperity, freedom from fear and want, promoting “social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom”, exercising the spirit of brotherhood and promoting peaceful coexistence, backing the principles of justice and international law, combating terrorism, developing friendly relations among nations, and building an open, just and inclusive society. These issues are the highest aspiration of all nations around the world.So far China has taken significant steps in building a community with shared future for mankind. For example, its role in combating terrorism and peacekeeping as it dispatched more than 37,000 peacekeepers to 24 UN peacekeeping missions, contributing to global economy, sending humanitarian aid to the countries in need, brokering peace talks among nations and pursuing mutual respect and win-win result are highly essential for building such a community.The third-round Forum, where three African countries Gambia, Sao Tome and Principe and Burkina Faso were new members, was comprehensive and productive. It is believed that not only the participating countries, but many other nations will taste the fruit of this forum. It is because China has always shared the fruit of its development with the world. In the community with share future, no nation is intended to be left behind. Through such forums, the two sides seek to follow international principles and build an inclusive, open and moderately prosperous society so that all could have their role and their share.Instead of exercising zero-sum game or “only my backyard” mindset, trampling upon the rights and territorial integrity of other nations or countries, disregarding or humiliating other nations or menacing them, all countries must play a positive role and respect the rights and dignity of people and practice upon international principles so as to build a community void of fear, want and violence.The author is an Afghan journalist and freelance writer based in Beijing.

                    FOCAC, BRI reshaping Sino-African cooperation
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Intertwined initiatives will bring additional impetus to help drive an economic surge, rather than a crawl, for the entire continent The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and the Belt and Road Initiative surely have something to do with the renaissance of economic growth across much of the African continent. According to Margaret McMillan, a professor of economics at Tufts University in the United States, the average annual GDP growth in 38 African economies was 4.9 percent between 2000 and 2015. As such, African economies with better policies will tend to benefit more from FOCAC and the BRI. But a redoubling of effort will be required to sustain and translate the benefits of both initiatives into broad welfare gains. Having said that, FOCAC marks the start of a new era in China-Africa relations this year, with President Xi Jinping welcoming three new members: Burkina Faso, Gambia, and Sao Tome and Principe. For the past 18 years, FOCAC has been a pragmatic and efficient vehicle propelling China-Africa cooperation. As such, FOCAC and the BRI are two significant vehicles in the 21st century, and they are reshaping China-Africa cooperation and making it a unique example of South-South cooperation. Through FOCAC, China aims to set a new path for building a closer Sino-Africa community with common development and further join together the BRI and African development. As a result, FOCAC will dovetail with the BRI to promote innovation, coordination and subregional cooperation, which, in turn, will benefit all participating members. As such, FOCAC's future aim is to connect the BRI with the United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development, the African Union's Agenda 2063 and individual economies' development plans to explore novel territory for the revitalization of African economies. Notably, FOCAC has proved to be an effective platform for pragmatic China-Africa cooperation, and the BRI is a vital public product that China is sharing with the world. Therefore, entwining FOCAC and the BRI will assist China-Africa cooperation, increasing it from a crawl to a leap, as well as raising cooperation to a greater height. Given the complex and changing global situation and the development of individual economies, China-Africa wisdom and solutions that can be supportive to worldwide governance are anticipated from both FOCAC and the BRI. As a result, FOCAC and the BRI, along with the African Union's Agenda 2063, will set a new path for a higher level of China-Africa cooperation, deeper people-to-people exchanges, a reshaping of Sino-African ties by broadening consensus, and strengthened friendship through Africa's development. In his speech at the opening ceremony of the FOCAC Beijing Summit on Sept 3 and 4, President Xi highlighted eight major initiatives for future China-Africa cooperation: industrial promotion, infrastructure connectivity, trade facilitation, green development, capacity building, healthcare, people-to-people exchanges, and peace and security. What is common throughout the eight initiatives mentioned by Xi is an expanded focus on strengthening and building up local capacity. Since Africa is yet to climb the value chain of mineral processing and manufacturing, the assistance in building up local capacity could have a much greater impact on developing skills in African economies if it were closely aligned with African economic potential and priority sectors, such as manufacturing. This could help African economies acquire the skills needed to add value to their natural resources and commodities, which would help the region unlock its full potential of natural resources, which could be exported to China on a value-added basis. Furthermore, China has pledged to help bolster agricultural productivity and increase imports - particularly of nonresource products - from Africa, as well as provide 50,000 government scholarships, offer exchange programs and provide vocational training. President Xi said China will set up 10 Luban Workshops in diverse African economies. Luban Workshops are named after the father of Chinese architecture, who lived around the 4th century BC. The program is designed to offer technical and vocational training, promote modern vocational education reforms and enhance collaboration among vocational schools worldwide.Trainers will travel from China to African nations to run practical skills training for crafts work, which signifies a new development in China-Africa cooperation. Both FOCAC and the BRI have helped advance China-Africa cooperation significantly in recent years, in various fields, with bilateral cooperation expanding to broader frontiers, such as trade, infrastructure development, skills transfer, security cooperation, industrialization, technical management and scientific research. Both initiatives have enabled Chinese investment and loans in Africa to give priority to development projects and, through Chinese loans, have for the first time enabled African governments to turn the continent's resources advantage into a development advantage. This priority has enabled Chinese leadership to pump billions of dollars into development projects such as Kenya's standard-gauge railway and the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway. In order to sustain and ensure the smooth operation of these development projects, China, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya have adopted a new model that will sustain these projects for years to come. For the railway projects, China is transferring skills to local employees who can progressively take over the operational tasks from their Chinese counterparts. This shows that skills development, too, is part of the agreement. Meanwhile, construction activity has assisted in propelling trade between Africa and China recently. According to recent data from the Ministry of Commerce, import and export volume between China and African economies increased to $116 billion in the first seven months of 2018 - up by 18.7 percent year-on-year. The surge was propelled by the construction sector, which was driven by FOCAC and the BRI. In addition to establishment in 2015 of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, designed to render assistance to low- and middle-income economies in paying for infrastructure improvements, China enlisted the aid of other emerging economies, such as Brazil and South Africa, to establish a development bank of their own, similar to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. This bank, the New Development Bank, is increasingly investing in African countries through aid, loans and direct investment. As a result, FOCAC and the BRI will be a good way for African governments to further engage China regarding development projects. Africa is also likely to benefit from China's newly created China International Development Cooperation Agency, which is designed to coordinate China's foreign aid program. The CIDCA institutionalizes a mutually beneficial, win-win concept of development coordination that is strongly connected with the BRI and FOCAC. China and Africa have once again come to a crossroads, since both sides are undergoing economic and social transformation. Numerous African economies are looking forward to fully participating in the BRI to reverse Africa's anti-industrialization process due to their failed adjustment, which was guided by Western "structured reforms" in the 1980s. The final goal is to accelerate technology transfer, employment creation and Africa's comprehensive transformation. At present, China is continuing diversified high-technology, labor-intensive and capital-driven industrial capacity cooperation with economies across the entire continent. It is certain that adhering to the two intertwined initiatives will bring additional impetus to accelerate China-Africa cooperation, driving an economic surge rather than a crawl for the entire African continent.

                It has been only 21 months since China and Sao Tome and Principe resumed diplomatic relations, but the agrarian country in the Gulf of Guinea has already seen significant changes.Thanks to the newly introduced cultivation technology from China, the output of maize there went up nearly 70 percent per hectare. New strains of Chinese cabbage, cucumber and tomato are growing larger than previous strains, and there are fewer parasites on goats that underwent the Chinese sterilization process.These are just a few of the achievements Chinese agricultural technology has yielded in the country.China and Sao Tome and Principe resumed diplomatic ties in December 2016. Shortly after, a team of four Chinese agricultural experts arrived at the launch of Chinese agricultural technical support project in the island nation, one of the 47 least developed countries listed by the United Nations.According to Yang Yang, an official in charge of the project with China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, nearly 20 Chinese agricultural specialists have been involved in the project, which continues to progress smoothly.In the rural areas of the country, Chinese experts are seen from farmhouses to pastures and fields, working tirelessly on improving local agricultural conditions. By devoting themselves to the project, they won the trust and praise of local people.Helder Menezes, an official with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Sao Tome and Principe, wrote a letter applauding the fine work of the Chinese experts.A local farm owner asked for a Chinese national flag to hang on his farm with that of Sao Tome and Principe to demonstrate the friendship between the two countries.Other Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa are experiencing the same benefits of the Chinese helping hand.Valdemar Morais, an official in charge of food safety with the Angolan Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, participated in a training session on agricultural technology in China's Shaanxi province in July.African countries are seeking development, and technical assistance from China is a golden opportunity, said Morais.Agricultural experts from Mozambique and Sao Tome and Principe also received training sessions on agricultural technologies in Guizhou and Hunan provinces.In keeping with the China-Africa cooperation principle of sincerity, real results, affinity and good faith, China proposed in 2015 that cooperation in 10 areas including agriculture would be carried out in the following three years.As the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation last month added further weight to the mutual ties, China-Africa relations will soon embark on a new journey. "We will step up efforts in promoting China-Africa cooperation in agricultural modernization so as to benefit more African countries," said Yang.

                    Defeating malaria in Comoros
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Eradicating the once prevalent disease in the African country is one of the 60 cooperative projects with China that have helped bolster ties Comoros, an African country located in the southwest Indian Ocean, is known as the Islands of the Moon. It is a mysterious country with beautiful natural scenery, where kind and hospitable people have created a profound culture. But malaria was a major public health problem in Comoros, causing huge losses and hindering local economic and social development. However, the Chinese government, a good friend of Comoros, has provided assistance to improve public health in this country, and combating malaria is one of the 60 cooperation projects that the Chinese government has launched and supported in the country over the past 44 years. China was the first country to recognize the independence of the Union of the Comoros, as the country is officially called. Since diplomatic ties were established on November 13, 1975, bilateral relations have developed smoothly, with expanding exchanges and increasing cooperation. The malaria project is a good example of this. In Comoros, malaria was regarded as a demon bringing pain and torment. Fonad Muheji, former vice-president of Comoros, once mentioned that three members in his family suffered from malaria and had to go to hospital each month. Two to four people in every family were found infected with malaria. In 2006, malaria was detected in 108,000 of the 800,000 people in the country. In other words, 142 out of every 1,000 people had malaria. In hospitals, malaria patients accounted for over 38 percent of outpatients and 60 percent of inpatients. Since 2004, anti-malaria experts from China have analyzed the previous anti-malaria efforts and innovated concepts and methods based on the actual situation in the islands, such as serious infection areas, and the life cycle and transmission characteristics of mosquitoes. The experts then launched the anti-malaria project with medication combining artemisinin and piperaquine, which can flush out parasites and block the source of infection. Initially, the Chinese experts encountered many difficulties, namely a lack of cooperation from the authorities and of understanding among residents. However, they did not flinch. The experts visited local governments to win their support, and put great effort into training and educating the population about malaria prevention and nationwide medication, using the media as a channel of communication. Posters and banners about malaria prevention can now be seen across the nation. This has helped generate a good atmosphere while motivating all parties. "We conducted field research day and night, going to each household to publicize the knowledge about malaria prevention," said Deng Changsheng, one of the Chinese experts. "We also helped to set up special teams composed of local people to visit villages and persuade prestigious elders to support our work. Taking the Island of Moheli as an example, we visited its 27 villages, some of which even the president has perhaps not visited." These efforts have won the support of the relevant authorities and people's trust in Comoros. It also dispelled doubts and worries of primary medical institutions. In November 2007, after more than two years of preparation, the anti-malaria project was introduced into the Island of Moheli. The then president of Comoros gave a speech and took the drug as a demonstration to others. Such efforts were also promoted in the other islands, Anjouan and Grande Comore, in 2012 and 2013, respectively, achieving huge success. The infection of malaria was eliminated in Anjouan and the basic control has been realized in Grande Comore. According to statistics, the antimalarial team has sent 200 people to Comoros, trained 236 personnel for malaria prevention and control and nearly 4,000 anti-malaria workers at village-level. By 2014, the country finally achieved zero deaths from malaria, with the number of people infected declining 98 percent and the new infection rate 0.28 percent. "ZERO PALU, JE M'ENGAGE! (ZERO MALARIA, START FROM ME!)" This slogan has appeared frequently in the major news media and is popular among the public now. The Chinese team is preparing for another round of island wide medication in Grande Comore from September to October. The anti-malaria campaign has lasted 12 years, proof that the Chinese plan finally won acceptance with its excellent results. The anti-malaria project has grown into a highlight of cooperation between Comoros and China. Reported by the international media, its experience and approach have caught the attention of the world. The fruits of the project were reported by Clinical Infectious Diseases, a leading international journal of infectious diseases. The nationwide medication of artemisinin combined with piperaquine was recorded by the World Health Organization. At present, the experience has been promoted in Sao Tome and Principe, Papua New Guinea, Kenya, Togo and Gambia. In 2018, in order to help Comoros clear the remaining malaria sources on Grande Comore and fulfill the commitment of zero malaria to the Comoros government by 2021, the Chinese government again offered help by setting up an expert team for the project. It has been strongly supported by the Comoros government, which equipped it with local technical strength. The government also took the initiative to mobilize the public and enhanced exchanges with local residents. The project was also supported by the World Health Organization, which actively participated in the assessment at all stages during implementation, together with urging Comoros to establish and maintain an effective anti-malarial system. Through the joint efforts of China, Comoros and international organizations, it is believed that zero malaria can become a reality in Comoros. And once the country shakes off the stigma of malaria, it can once again showcase its unique charms to the world. The author is the Chinese ambassador to Comoros.
