                At NYC's tallest luxury-condo tower, discounts come in millions
            </p>

                Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel. [Photo provided to China Daily]Buyers at Manhattan's tallest ultra-luxury condo tower are getting discounts worth millions, a sign of the times in a market that's swamped with costly homes.At 432 Park Ave, buyers who signed contracts and completed those purchases this year got price reductions averaging 10 percent, according to an analysis by appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. In one of the most recent big transactions to close, a penthouse on the 88th floor sold for $60.9 million, a 20 percent markdown from what developers initially sought, city property records made public on Dec 2 show.As new high-end projects mushroom across the skyline, developers of ones that came to the market earlier are cutting deals to unload units before competition gets even more heated. Sales at 432 Park, a 426-meter tower on 57th Street off Park Avenue, started in 2012, when the building was just an idea on paper. Now, with construction finished, purchases are able to close and the developers are highlighting that, along with price cuts, as ways to seal a deal with buyers who have many choices."I think it's smart," said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel. "This is a recognition of the product that's coming up behind this one."Sanders' penthouseThe $60.9 million penthouse was purchased by Lewis Sanders, the former chief executive officer of AllianceBernstein Holding LP. His price for the 748-square-meter home was down from the $76.5 million initially sought by developers Macklowe Properties Inc. and CIM Group.A wave of luxury condos is coming to Manhattan just as interest from investors slackens. More than than 3,500 newly built units were expected to be listed for sale this year, according to a September estimate by brokerage Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group. More than half are considered luxury, or priced at more than $25,800 per square meter.Sanders, now CEO of Sanders Capital, didn't return a phone message seeking comment on his purchase, for which he signed a contract in May. Joey Arak, a spokesman for the building, said Macklowe Properties declined to comment on sales at 432 Park.The tower, whose record-setting height will eventually be topped by two other buildings rising nearby, also sold its highest unit at a discount. The purchase of the full-floor penthouse on the 96th story closed for $87.7 million in September, public records show. It was listed for $95 million.Price breaksThat transaction was among nine deals at 432 Park in which the buyer signed a contract this year and received a discount, according to city records of completed sales.On the 73rd floor, the buyer of a 373.8 sqm, three-bedroom apartment who signed a contract in June paid $30.1 million, or 11 percent less than the apartment's official listed price. A deal agreed to in July for a 245 sqm three-bedroom on the 82nd floor, came with a bigger discount. The owners of unit 82A paid $18.6 million－a 14 percent markdown－when the purchase closed in September.The recent sale prices at the tower－usually ending in odd, non-round numbers－also suggest the developer is covering those buyers' transfer taxes and other fees, Miller said. Sanders' full purchase price, for example, was $60,893,873.The building isn't the only recently completed ultra-luxury tower that's lowered prices. A few blocks away on 57th Street, a 390 sqm at Extell Development Co's One 57 sold in October for $21.6 million, or 24 percent off the last asking price, according to listings website StreetEasy.Newer towersDiscounting is also happening at Manhattan projects that are still under construction－only less visibly because transactions at those properties, which haven't closed, aren't reflected in public records.At the Kent, rising on 95th Street near Third Avenue, 5 percent discounts were being offered as a way "to incentivize people to pull the trigger," Extell President Gary Barnett said in September. At 111 W. 57th St, where a penthouse with Central Park views will be listed for $57 million, the earliest buyers were given price cuts as a way to log a few deals before the beginning of a formal sales effort, co-developer Kevin Maloney said earlier this year."Every building is implementing some sort of negotiability," Miller said. "It's a sharp change from peak new development in 2014, when there wasn't that opportunity for buyers."

                China, EU reaffirm commitment to Iran nuclear deal
            </a>
            <p>
                BRUSSELS -- China and the European Union (EU) on Tuesday reaffirmed their commitment to the continued, full and effective implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal.The reaffirmation came as China and the EU issued a joint statement after their 21st leaders' meeting held here on Tuesday afternoon.The two sides recalled that the JCPOA is a key element of the global non-proliferation architecture and a significant diplomatic achievement endorsed unanimously by the UN Security Council in its Resolution 2231, the statement said.The two sides "reaffirm their commitment to its continued, full and effective implementation, as well as their efforts to preserve economic benefits for Iran," it said.China and the EU recalled the importance of the Arak modernization project, and the need to continue their common efforts in this regard, it said.Both sides welcomed the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed in 14 consecutive reports the continued adherence by Iran to its nuclear-related commitments, it said.On the situation in Venezuela, the statement said China and the EU are following closely the evolving situation in Venezuela and are willing to work with other parties on a political, peaceful and democratic solution decided by the people of Venezuela.The statement also said that China, the EU and its member states are parties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and respect the maritime order based on international law and uphold freedom of navigation and overflight enjoyed by all states in accordance with international law.The EU welcomes the ongoing consultations between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) aimed at the conclusion of an effective Code of Conduct (COC) for the South China Sea.China and the EU call upon all relevant parties to engage in dialogue, to settle disputes peacefully, and to refrain from actions likely to increase tensions, the statement said.

                Iran stops implementing parts of nuclear deal: report
            </a>
            <p>
                TEHRAN - Iran has stopped implementing parts of its commitment to the 2015 nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an informed source told Tehran Times daily on Wednesday.The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Iran has stopped complying with the limitations on its stockpiles of enriched uranium and production of heavy water in the Arak site.On May 8, Iran announced that the Islamic republic upholds its rights to stop implementing some parts of its obligation under the JCPOA in line with protecting the national interests.Iran also gave Europe 60 days to ensure that Iran's interests are protected under the agreement. Otherwise, Tehran said it is ready to take steps towards suspending further commitments to the deal.In order to raise public awareness about Iran's measures pertaining to the JCPOA, there will be programs in the coming days for some journalists to visit Natanz and Arak nuclear sites, the unnamed source, at Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), told Tehran Times.Iran says its moves to withdraw from parts of its nuclear obligations are reactions to the US quit from the JCPOA last year, as well as a reaction to the Europeans' slow measures to protect Iran's economic interests under the accord.

                TEHRAN - Iran will release "important" details about the measures it has taken after recent suspension of some of its commitments under a 2015 nuclear deal, Press TV reported on Sunday.On Monday, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) would release "very important information" regarding the "limitless increase of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile" as well as measures it has taken to prepare for the second phase of the scaling back of its obligations, according to the report.The briefing will be held at the Arak heavy water reactor facility in central Iran on Monday.Also, Iran's latest measures to re-design the Arak reactor and to increase the production of heavy water at the facility would be detailed in the event.On May 8, Iran withdrew from implementing part of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal and threatened to take more actions in case Tehran's interests under the pact cannot be guaranteed.Accordingly, Iran spared a 60-day deadline for the signatories of the nuclear deal to address Iran's interests under the deal.The move by Iran comes after US President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the nuclear deal in May last year and resumed energy and financial sanctions on the Islamic republic.

                Iranian president says Iran to drop more of nuke commitments
            </a>
            <p>
                TEHRAN - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said here Wednesday that the Islamic republic will abandon more of its nuclear commitments in the coming days if the parties to the Iranian 2015 international nuclear deal fail to observe their commitments.Iran will increase the percentage of its enriched uranium to higher purity from July 7 on, Rouhani was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency."As of July 7, our uranium enrichment will not be limited to 3.67 percent of purity," he said. "We will increase it based on our needs."After one year of US unilateral exit from the Iranian landmark nuclear deal, Iran withdrew from implementing part of the nuclear deal on May 8 and threatened to take more actions in case Tehran's interests under the pact cannot be guaranteed. At that time, Iran set a 60-day deadline for the Europeans to help the Islamic republic reap the economic benefits of the deal.Rouhani, who was talking in a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, also said that Iran's Arak heavy water nuclear reactor, which was agreed to be redesigned under the 2015 nuclear agreement, will resume its previous activities after July 7 if the other signatories to the deal fail to uphold their end of the deal, according to Press TV.Under the Iranian nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran agreed to redesign the 40-megawatt Arak research reactor to cut its potential output of plutonium.Rouhani said Iran's imminent move concerning the Arak reactor could only be reversed "if they (the other signatories) act on all of their commitments concerning the facility."Moreover, the Iranian president slammed the EU-designed payment channel as an "empty" mechanism."Empty Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX) is of no use to us ... it is void and nothing is in it" to protect Iran's interests under the 2015 nuclear deal, he said.However, if the INSTEX becomes operational and supplies Iran with petrodollars, it will be acceptable for Iran despite its shortcomings, he added.The INSTEX, EU's special payment channel with Iran, was announced by the EU in January to secure trade with Iran and skirt US anti-Iran sanctions after Washington pulled out of the 2015 landmark Iranian nuclear deal in May 2018.Iran has been cynical to the EU's "seriousness" and feasibility of the mechanism and has threatened that it will no longer wait for the Europeans under the US pressures.On Monday, Iran's Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said that Iran's low-grade enriched uranium stockpile has exceeded 300 kg for the first time since Iran reached an agreement with the world powers in 2015 to curtail its mass product.Zarif also blamed the European signatories of the Iranian nuclear deal for their "insufficient" measures to ensure Iran's benefit from the accord after the US exit in May 2018."European measures have not been enough and as Iran has announced, we will carry out the second phase of reducing commitments," Zarif noted.On Wednesday, Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, also warned the European countries against what he called the risks of Europe's "inaction" concerning the US administration's unilateral policies, according to Tasnim.

                Iran to exceed uranium limit
            </a>
            <p>
                 Teheran urges Europe and US to 'go back to logic and the negotiating table'Iran warned on Wednesday that it will boost uranium enrichment beyond the limit set in a landmark 2015 nuclear deal, further inflaming tensions with the United States.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that after this Sunday, Iran would enrich uranium beyond a fissile purity of 3.67 percent, the maximum allowed by the deal."As of July 7, the Arak reactor would be restored to its former condition, which they (other parties) used to claim was 'dangerous' and could produce plutonium" if the other deal partners fail to fully act on their commitments under the accord, Rouhani said.He said the commitment under the 2015 deal reached with the US, China, Russia and European nations "will be set aside" and Teheran will enhance the enrichment level to "whatever amount, which we deem necessary and need".Rouhani said Iran's decision concerning the reactor could only be reversed "if they (the other signatories) act on all of their commitments concerning the facility", according to Iran's PressTV."All of our actions can be returned to the previous condition within one hour, why are you worried?" he said, adding that Teheran has no intent to develop nuclear weapons.Keyvan Khosravi, spokesman for Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said on Thursday that "by exiting the nuclear deal, Trump has wounded the path of diplomacy, ...the best antidote to all threats is active resistance".US President Donald Trump tweeted in response to the announcement, warning Iran to "be careful with the threats"."Iran has just issued a New Warning. Rouhani says that they will Enrich Uranium to 'any amount we want' if there is no new Nuclear Deal. Be careful with the threats, Iran. They can come back to bite you like nobody has been bitten before!"Yin Gang, a researcher from the Institute of West-Asian and African Studies of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said Iran may break through the limitation as progress in negotiations is unlikely within several days.However, Yin said that if Iran resumes operating the reactor, the possibility of war is still small, "but sanctions will be increased.""Iran wants to intimidate in negotiations with Europe and the US by not complying with the nuclear deal, rather than fighting with anyone," he said, emphasizing that Iran is the one that really wishes to hold talks.Rouhani said the advice to Europe and the US is "to go back to logic and to the negotiating table"."Go back to understanding, to respecting the law and resolutions of the United Nations Security Council,... all of us can abide by the nuclear deal," he said.Mahmoud Alavi, Iran's intelligence minister, said Teheran and Washington could hold talks only if the US ended its sanctions and Iran's top authority allowed the talks between the arch foes, Iran state news agency IRNA reported on Thursday.Reuters and AP contributed to this story.

                Iran announces increase of uranium enrichment concentration
            </a>
            <p>
                TEHRAN -- Iran announced Sunday that it is raising its uranium enrichment concentration beyond the limits set by the landmark 2015 international nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).Earlier on the day, Ali Rabiee, the spokesman for Iranian government, said in a live broadcast from state TV that "today, we will start enriching uranium beyond 3.67 percent, and its level of purity depends on our needs. This will happen officially."The announcement was immediately confirmed by the Spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) Behrouz Kamalvandi, who said that the rise of the purity of uranium enrichment from current 3.67 percent to the higher level aims at "meeting the needs of fuel for Iran's power plants."On Saturday, Ali Akbar Velayati, an advisor to the Iranian supreme leader, said that Iran might increase the purity of its enriched uranium to five percent as a part of Tehran's decision to reduce its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal.Iran needs five-percent uranium enrichment for its Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant and 20-percent enrichment for Tehran research reactor, according to Press TV.However, Kamalvandi said on Sunday that "we do not need to enrich uranium for the Tehran reactor for the time being."Earlier this week, Iran announced that it had stepped up the production of low-grade enriched uranium and had exceeded 300 kg in its stockpile, more than the amount permitted under the accord.On Sunday, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi ruled out any measure regarding the resumption of previous activities of Iran Arak heavy water nuclear reactor, which was agreed to be redesigned under the nuclear agreement.He said that over the past months, satisfactory steps have been taken, with the cooperation of some members of the nuclear deal, to redesign the research reactor.On May 8, a year after the US unilateral exit from the nuclear deal, Iran stopped implementing some of its commitments subject to the deal and set a 60-day deadline for the Europeans to help the Islamic republic reap the economic benefits of the deal.It threatened to take more actions in case its interests under the pact cannot be honored.Iran has complained that the Europeans have failed to take "practical" steps to ensure Iran's economic interests under the deal.On Sunday, Araqchi blamed European countries for failing to live up to what he called "their own commitments."However, he said that the telephone conversation between French President Emmanuel Macron and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Saturday was a "constructive" dialogue.Araqchi stressed that Iran will spare opportunity for diplomacy as a means to salvage the deal.He also said the United States can attend the new round of nuclear talks that Iran and the remaining parties to the Iranian 2015 nuclear deal plan to hold in future, urging Washington to lift banking and energy sanctions against Tehran before attending the talks."There is no obstacle for the presence of United States in the talks between Iran and P4+1 (namely, Britain, China, France, Russian and Germany)," Araqchi said in a live TV broadcast.However, it does not mean that Washington is part of the negotiations between Iran and the remaining parties to the nuclear deal, Araqchi said, adding that "in our eyes, P5+1 no longer exists, and the United States has already exited the Iranian nuclear deal."Araqchi, also a senior Iranian nuclear negotiator, said that "the JCPOA is a done agreement, meaning that it is not negotiable."The talks will be conducted on the mechanisms for its implementations, he added.Iran has insistently urged the signatories to the deal to help Tehran cushion the economic impact of the U.S. sanctions after the latter's unilateral exit from the deal last year.It has also said that in case the US re-endorses the deal or the Europeans take concrete steps to relieve the impact of U.S. economic sanctions, Iran's actions are reversible.

                China reiterates supports of JCPOA
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING -- The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Friday reaffirmed its efforts to uphold and implement the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.Spokesperson Hua Chunying made the remarks at a press briefing when asked for comments about the US decision to extend its waivers on projects including the Arak heavy water reactor renovation project."The JCPOA is a multilateral agreement endorsed by the UN Security Council. It should be implemented fully and effectively as it is vital for the international non-proliferation regime and peace and stability in the Middle East," Hua said, adding that the arrangements regarding nuclear projects in the JCPOA reflect a balance of Iran's obligation on nuclear non-proliferation and its right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, which serves the interests of all parties including the United States.As an important part of the JCPOA, the Arak heavy water reactor renovation project is co-chaired by China and Britain. According to the Hua, relevant parties including Iran have spoken highly of China's efforts in promoting the implementation of the project and have voiced their support.China always firmly opposes the unilateral sanctions and so-called "long-arm jurisdiction," she said, adding China will continue to work with all parties to uphold and implement the JCPOA and will resolutely safeguard its own legitimate rights and interests.
