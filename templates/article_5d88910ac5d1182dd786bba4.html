                Photographs capture spirit of China's reform and opening-up
            </p>
            <p>
                Fascinated by the dramatic positive changes brought about by China's reform and opening-up policy, visitors to a photo exhibition on the subject that was unveiled in London on Tuesday said they believe China that is continuing to open up will bring even more opportunities to the world.The exhibition in the landmark Central Hall Westminster comprises 40 photographs taken during the first 40 years of China's reform and opening-up process that showcase the tremendous development that has taken place, in both the political landscape and people's daily lives.Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador to the United Kingdom, said in his keynote speech that China is now the second-largest economy in the world and accounts for 15 percent of global GDP, a huge change from the 2 percent it contributed 40 years ago."These achievements are not a handout from others. They are the results of 40 years of hard efforts by the Chinese people," he said. "When we assess the achievements of reform and opening-up, we must not only look at how much the Chinese people have gained; it is also important to recognize the hard efforts they have made."A Miao ethnic seamstress was invited to showcase Chinese traditional embroidery skills at the event. Liu said the woman, who hails from a poor and remote mountainous part of Guizhou province, wasa representative of the millions of people in China who make persistent efforts to not only get rid of poverty but also have the opportunity to shine on the world stage."As a result of these efforts, poverty is being gradually replaced by moderate prosperity. Per capita disposable income has risen by 22.8 times, and 740 million people have been lifted out of poverty," Liu said.Martin Albrow, a British sociologist and author of China's Role in a Shared Human Future, noted China's reform and opening-up process was not derived from Western globalization."It has always been based in socialism with Chinese characteristics, in ongoing reform of every sector of society, and in win-win relations with other countries," he said.Stephen Perry, chairman of the 48 Group Club, recalled his story and the story of his family in their interactions with China, which extend back to the early 1950s. As an "ice breaker" between China and the UK, he spoke positively about the future relationship between the nations under China's further reform and opening-up.GengJinhai, CEO of China Taiping (UK) and chairman of the China Chamber of Commerce in the UK (CCCUK), said both China and the world have benefitted from the developments of the last 40 years."The next 40 years will see China opening up more, reaching out further, and taking more global responsibilities than ever before," he said.Around 150 guests from British and Chinese political, business, and academic sectors participated in the exhibition's opening ceremony, which was titled A Glorious Journey.Contact the writers at hanbaoyi@mail.chinadailyuk.com

                Business sectors celebrate Chinese New Year in London, discuss 'Golden Era' opportunities
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON - The China Chamber of Commerce in the UK (CCCUK) and the 48 Group Clubs have jointly held the 2018 New Year's Gala Dinner in London, bringing together over 400 guests from the business sectors of China and Britain to discuss the cooperation opportunities between both countries after the upgrading of the "Golden Era" in bilateral ties.Addressing the event on Monday night, China's Ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, said that both China and the UK now stand at the entrance to a new historic stage, "Each embraces a new era, and each has a new dream.""Our converging new eras set the stage for our two countries to explore opportunities and achieve common development. Both the Chinese Dream and the British Dream point to broader and more dynamic cooperation. China is committed to building a modernized economy and an open economy of higher standards. This means that China will open its door wider to the world. And this will create more opportunities for the UK," he said.Liu said it is important that both China and the UK should seize these historic opportunities in the new era to advance bilateral relations and promote common development.Sun Yu, chairman of the CCCUK said, "This year is very special. Developing the golden era as the UK changes its place in the world. The UK is a very important market for China, and increasing source of goods, and two-way investment is expanding fast, London is increasingly a hub for the internationalisation of the RMB and the UK and China can have great cooperation in professional services as China further opens up."Stephen Perry, chairman of the 48 Group Club, said, "Some 65 years on from the original 'Icebreakers' ground-breaking trip to China, we continue to work with UK business and other organisations to help them understand, and benefit from, the opportunities offered by a resurgent China."Organizations judged to have made outstanding contributions each year to China-UK relations have been recognized at the dinner in the annual KPMG-sponsored 48 Group Club CCCUK Business Awards. AstraZeneca and China State Development & Investment Corporation (SDIC) were this year's winners.Douglas Flint, chairman of HSBC (2010-2017), recently appointed by the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer as the UK Treasury's Belt and Road Envoy, was awarded The 48 Group Club CCCUK Lifetime Award.

                Young Sino-UK entrepreneurs break the ice
            </a>
            <p>
                Network can forge path to economic growthChina’s Ambassador to the United Kingdom Liu Xiaoming told young British and Chinese business leaders that their efforts were needed to “pave the way for global economic growth” during an event held in London on Tuesday.More than 200 business people, politicians and diplomats gathered in the UK capital to discuss the future of China-UK relations at the 10th annual Young Icebreakers gala dinner, jointly hosted by China Chamber of Commerce in the UK, also called CCCUK, and business network the 48 Group Club.Set up by the 48 Group Club a decade ago, the Young Icebreakers is a network for young Chinese and British entrepreneurs dedicated to improving business ties between the two nations.“China and the UK are natural partners in development,” Liu said. “I urge our Young Icebreakers to get down to business and be innovative. The opportunities for China-UK cooperation in financial services, energy, artificial intelligence and digital economy are out there for you to explore. Your efforts could not only add building blocks to China-UK cooperation but also pave the way for global economic growth.”At the event, Stephen Perry, chairman of the 48 Group, presented an award to Sun Yu, chairman of CCCUK and Bank of China's UK chief executive, in recognition of his contribution to China-UK financial and business relations.“We thought it was appropriate to give an award to Mr. Sun Yu for his special contribution to the relationship between Britain and China, not only in relation to his work at Bank of China, not only in his work as chairman of the Association of Foreign Bankers in the UK, but also with CCCUK, where he and his colleagues have pulled together an organization of which China can be proud,” Perry said.Established in 2001, the CCCUK is a non-profit organization comprised of more than 200 Chinese enterprises and representative offices in Britain. The body recently held the China-UK Economic and Trade Forum where government and business representatives explored collaboration on the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure development plan.“The chamber is committed to work with our partners to fully support the internationalization of our members and help them seize the new opportunities emerging in this new era,” Sun said upon accepting the award.

                National Day reception in UK highlights 'golden era' ties
            </a>
            <p>
                The Chinese embassy in the United Kingdom held a reception on Thursday to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, gathering together more than 600 British and Chinese officials, dignitaries and key practitioners of the China-UK "golden era" relationship.China's ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming underscored the dramatic achievement of China's reform and opening-up as he praised Chinese people's unswerving determination and hard efforts to realize national development and rejuvenation after the founding of the PRC, especially during the 40 years of reform and opening-up."Thanks to the 40 years of persistent efforts," said the ambassador, China has gone from getting on its feet to becoming prosperous and strong. In this process, the relations between China and the rest of the world have also experienced historic and fundamental changes.China's GDP has increased by a factor of 56, and the ambassador said "we have lifted more than 700 million people out of poverty, contributing to more than 70 percent of the world's total poverty reduction", underlining China's tremendous achievement in building a community with a shared future for mankind.During the past 40 years, China's GDP has grown by an average of nearly 10 percent a year, making it the fastest-growing economy in the history of the world's major economies, and one that has contributed more than 30 percent of the world's economic growth for many years.China's achievements are made possible through the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, the development path that suits the country's national condition, and the hard efforts of the Chinese people."These achievements are not accomplished by stealing wealth or technology from any country," the ambassador noted.Moreover, he said China will continue to embrace the world with open arms, safeguard world peace, contribute to global growth and uphold the international order.China's continuing reform and opening-up can be translated into more growth opportunities and potential for the world through new momentum such as the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.

                Remarks by Ambassador Liu Xiaoming at launch dinner of China-UK Charity Initiative
            </a>
            <p>
                Build the Bridge of Open Cooperation for AllLord Mayor Peter Estlin,Chairman Geng Jinhai,Ladies and Gentlemen:Good evening!It is a real delight to join you at the launch dinner of the China-UK Charity Initiative co-hosted by the City of London and China Chamber of Commerce in the UK (CCCUK).Let me begin by expressing my warm congratulations on the launch of the Initiative. I would like to pay sincere tribute to the CCCUK and the Lord Mayor's Appeal Charity.I have great admiration for The Lord Mayor's Appeal, which is aimed at building "a better City for all". And I am proud that the China-UK Charity Initiative will be an important part of the Appeal. I hope and believe that, in the spirit and with concrete actions of building a better city for all, this Initiative will help build three "bridges" between China and the UK.First, I hope it will build a bridge of love to promote charities.Britain has a long tradition of philanthropy. It is the birthplace of the world's first law on charities, the Charitable Uses Act of 1601.In China, people believe in "seeking happiness in good deeds." In the words of the sages, "He is a man of virtue who offers financial help to many," and "To establish oneself, one should help others establish themselves."With the promulgation of the Charity Law of the People's Republic of China and the introduction of relevant policies in recent years, charities have thrived in China. In 2017, donations of all kinds topped $10 billion.I am happy and touched that the fund raised by the China-UK Charity Initiative will be donated to both British and Chinese charities. I believe that with the joint efforts of the City of London and the CCCUK, China-UK cooperation on public welfare and charities will be enhanced and will greatly facilitate the development of charity work in both countries.Second, I hope the Initiative will build a bridge of responsibility for upgrading China-UK cooperation.Businesses are basic economic units as well as main entities shouldering social responsibilities. Thriving China-UK trade and economic cooperation in recent years has brought tangible benefits to the people of our two countries.As of today, there are more than 500 Chinese companies in the UK. Together with the CCCUK, they have not only contributed to the local economy but also fulfilled their corporate responsibilities.In 2017, Chinese companies in the UK paid $260 million in tax and created more than ten thousand jobs.China Taiping Insurance sponsored London Symphony Orchestra's tour in China in recent years.The Bank of China has taken part in the City Giving Day for three years in a run.Huawei has been an important Patron of the Prince's Trust since 2007.Tonight, with the launch of the China-UK Charity Initiative, Chinese businesses in the UK are making yet another significant effort to fulfill their corporate responsibilities and serve the people of our two countries. This Initiative will help strengthen the ties between Chinese companies in the UK and the City of London. It will also boost China-UK trade and economic cooperation.Third, I hope the Initiative will build a bridge to the bright future of open cooperation.Charity work is not just about providing aid. It is more about connecting hearts. It is not just about "handing out fish". It is more importantly about "teaching people how to fish".I sincerely hope that the China-UK Charity Initiative will not only provide donations but also advocate openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation. This is the only road leading to development and prosperity in the world. This is also the irreversible trend of the times.This year marks the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening up. China is committed to promoting a new round of high-level opening up on all fronts. The first-ever China International Import Expo last month displayed China's sincerity and resolve to open up its market further and promote open development around the globe.Here in the UK, thanks to open cooperation, the City of London has drawn the biggest and most influential financial companies from around the world.Both China and the UK are participants, beneficiaries and facilitators of open global cooperation. In face of surging anti-globalisation and looming protectionism and unilateralism, our two countries must join hands to advocate open cooperation. Together we can continue to contribute to a brighter future of open world economy.Two days ago, President Xi Jinping and President Trump had a successful meeting during the G20 Summit. They reached consensus on not imposing new additional tariffs. They also agreed to instruct the economic teams of the two sides to step up negotiations toward the removal of all additional tariffs and a concrete agreement leading to win-win results.This is a positive signal. Sound China-U.S. relations serve the fundamental interests of the Chinese and American people. They also contribute to world peace and prosperity, and meet the general expectation of the international community.Ladies and Gentlemen:Let me quote from the Confucian classic The Commentary of Zuo to conclude my remarks. The book says:"A benevolent person loves others from his heart; and this love will in turn boost his own cause".I would like to give my best wishes to the China-UK Charity Initiative. I wish you success, and I hope that you will spread love, light up hope and contribute to the China-UK "Golden Era"!Thank you!

First, He hoped it will build a bridge of love to promote charities, to enhance the China-UK cooperation on public welfare and charities and to facilitate the development of charity work in both countries. Second, he hoped it will build a bridge of responsibility for upgrading China-UK Cooperation, to encourage Chinese businesses in the UK to fulfil their corporate responsibilities, to serve the people of two countries, to strengthen the ties between Chinese companies and the City of London and to boost China-UK trade and economic cooperation.

                CCCUK chairman calls for Brexit certainty
            </a>
            <p>
                The Chairman of the China Chamber of Commerce in the United Kingdom has called for British authorities to reach a Brexit deal as soon as possible, so as to reduce any negative impact of uncertainty on Chinese companies operating in the UK.Ahead of the 2nd China-UK Economic and Trade Forum in London, Fang Wenjian, Chairman of the chamber, which is also known as CCCUK, and General Manager of Bank of China London Branch, said Chinese businesses in the UK are also actively seeking solutions to address challenges that arise from Brexit."It is hoped that Britain can deal with the EU as smoothly as possible during the negotiation process and transitional period, and at the same time continue to provide policy support to maintain the openness and inclusiveness of the world-class business environment of London," Fang said. "This will reduce the impact of uncertainties on the UK's economy, and can benefit Chinese enterprises in the UK."Established in 2001, with more than 200 corporate members, the CCCUK has grown into a prominent business body that plays a pivotal role in connecting and communicating between Chinese businesses and UK authorities.The UK has become the second-largest investment destination for Chinese companies in Europe. In 2018, the average revenue growth of the 750 largest UK-based Chinese-owned companies increased by 11.6 percent, with employees totaling 80,000 and with a combined turnover of 68 billion pounds ($86 billion).In addition, Chinese companies are showing new trends with their investments in the UK."Types of Chinese investments are more diversified than before, and more and more Chinese private enterprises have increased their investments," Fang said.The CCCUK is making continuous efforts to help dovetail the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative with the UK's future development plan, especially in the financial and banking sector, in which the UK has leading advantages."The finance industry and manufacturing industry used to dominate the market in the early stage. Now it has gradually extended to industries including communication, energy, infrastructure, and technology," Fang said."Chinese-owned companies in the UK commonly regard the UK as a bridgehead, from which they can expand their business model to Europe," he said. "But Brexit can change it. That's why a considerable number of enterprises are still adopting a wait-and-see approach, during which the cost burden is increasing," he added.Amid this, the chamber will help UK-based Chinese companies to predict and analyze the possible risks and try to reduce business uncertainty."Many consultation seminars have been held, with local well-known law firms and consulting companies hired and invited, to provide Chinese companies with the latest legal policy interpretations and assist them to optimize their business plans," Fang said.In addition to helping Chinese companies, the chamber also facilitates British businesses seeking to invest and expand in China, by promoting mutual understanding, communication, and business cooperation.Fang highlights the financial industry as an example. As of 2017, foreign banks only accounted for 1.3 percent of China's banking assets, while in the UK it is 50 percent. "This means that the Chinese market has huge potential," Fang said.With a theme of openness, cooperation and mutual benefit, the 2nd China-UK Economic and Trade Forum also celebrates the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
