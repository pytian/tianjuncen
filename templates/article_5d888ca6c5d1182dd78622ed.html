                During the China-Africa Water Forum held in July in Windhoek, Namibia, the Chinese ambassador to Namibia noted the importance to Africa of having a partnership in overcoming its persistent water shortages.Indeed, resolving the water crisis in Africa is part of the Beijing Action Plan (2019-21) under the umbrella of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.The plan outlines measures to build and develop a China-Africa Research Center for cooperation in scientific research and training of professionals in water-related disciplines geared toward treatment and production of clean and safe drinking water. The program aims at research and dissemination of knowledge in creation of artificial rainfall, desalination, rainwater purification, water recycling, and water-saving irrigation technologies, among others.The United Nations World Water Development Report 2019 estimates that more than 2 billion people worldwide lack access to safe and clean water. In 2010, the UN General Assembly resolved that inability to get safe and clean drinking water and sanitation is part of the growing body of human rights concerns, and therefore countries have an obligation to try to achieve "universal access to water and sanitation for all, without discrimination".Despite this resolution and adoption of the UN's 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, many countries have not met the objective of reducing the number of people living without adequate clean water and sanitation. In 2015, individuals living without clean and safe water stood at 2.1 billion, more than a half being in sub-Saharan Africa, where only 24 percent of the population have access to the vital resource. Similarly, UNICEF established that nearly 500 children die each day in sub-Saharan Africa due to lack of access to universal sanitation and clean water, and that West and Central Africa needed about $30 billion annually to meet the universal requirements for water.The water shortage has hit South Africa hard, especially Cape Town, where rationing was adopted to prevent the city from completely running out of water. Water rationing is common in numerous cities across Africa, including Nairobi, Kenya; Accra, Ghana; Bulawayo and Harare, Zimbabwe; and Mapu-to, Mozambique.To overcome water shortages, the African Development Bank projected that the continent will need $66 billion per year to build adequate dams, pipelines, pumping stations and purification plants.China offers an opportunity for an exchange of ideas that would help Africa overcome its water problem. For instance, in 2011, China had the capacity to desalinate about 600,000 metric tons of water per day and is projected to push the figure to about 3 million tons of desalinated water a day by 2020.In the Horn of Africa, China funded a cross-border water project between Ethiopia and Djibouti. The project involved the drilling of wells and reservoirs and the installation of pipeline.The importance of water as a resource is not limited to sanitation and drinking, since it is crucial to many activities, including agriculture, electric power production, transportation and mining.In Uganda, China International Water and Electricity Corp built a dam costing $568 million. The Isimba Hydropower Dam was launched in March and is expected to add 184 megawatts to the national grid. China is also financing Karuma Hydropower, a 600-MW dam costing $2 billion in northern Uganda.It is important that more African countries take the opportunity offered by China and create a cooperative environment through which ideas can be shared and implemented. The scope of cooperation should also focus on areas such as energy and food security, which require water as a key input.The author is a senior policy analyst at the Africa Policy Institute in Nairobi, Kenya.

                China National Uranium Corp Ltd, a subsidiary of China National Nuclear Corp, announced that it has purchased 68.62 percent of the Rossing uranium mine in Namibia from mining giant Rio Tinto, the company said on Thursday."This cooperation will contribute substantially to Namibia in tax contributions, employment, business opportunities and in-depth cooperation for future China-Africa cooperation," said He Zixing, the vice-president of CNNC which is one of the country's largest nuclear power companies.Zhu Yi, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said the cooperation could help the Chinese company's overseas expansion, as the deal allows CNUC access to the market of the Rossing mine in Namibia, the fourth largest uranium mine worldwide in capacity and also the world's longest-running open pit uranium mine.

                Poaching, habitat destruction and conflict the drivers blamed for lossLOISABA, Kenya - For most of his life as a Samburu warrior, Lesaiton Lengoloni thought nothing of hunting giraffes, the graceful giants so common a feature of the Kenyan plains where he roamed."There was no particular pride in killing a giraffe, not like a lion. ... (But) a single giraffe could feed the village for more than a week," the community elder said, leaning on a walking stick and gazing out to the broad plateau of Laikipia.

                    Road warrior Dong facing world-class test in Africa
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Qingdao welterweight, ranked No 15 by WBO, could vault into title contentionIt's roughly 7,500 miles from China to Namibia in southwest Africa, but for Qingdao welterweight Dong Youli, the intercontinental journey could end up being a shortcut to global boxing glory.On Saturday, in his first fight outside China, the 24-year-old Dong (13-1-1, 9 KOs), ranked No 15 by the World Boxing Organization, is challenging No 5-ranked WBO Africa champion Mikka Shonena (14-0, 3 KOs) in the northern Namibian city of Ongwediva, with the winner in line for a shot at the world championship next year.With just three stoppages on his record, Shonena - aka 'The Silent Assassin' - isn't known as a big puncher, but the 31-year-old has been very vocal in telling anyone who will listen that Dong will be "ironed out" if the Chinese challenger chooses to turn their bout into a slugfest."I know that Dong is strong and world rated, but I have a perfect record and will have the home crowd advantage. I promise to give the fans the best performance of my career so far in order to remain undefeated," Shonena told The Namibia Sun last week."When I promise to give the fans my best, it means I'm promising to iron out that Chinese boy. I think it will be easy work, and I will make them proud."Saturday's bout will be Dong's first since he captured the vacant WBO Asia Pacific title with an eighth-round TKO of India's Pardeep Kharera in Chongqing last December, but the long layoff doesn't faze him."I am going to Namibia to win. I know I will be fighting far away from home, but I also know that my Chinese brothers and sisters will come out in their numbers to support me," Dong said earlier this month."I am super prepared for this fight and I'm looking forward to taking a big step upwards in the world rankings."While Dong hovers on the periphery of world title contention, another Chinese boxer is bracing to battle for a unified version of the world light heavyweight championship in the coming months.No 1-ranked contender Meng Fanlong, a 31-year-old from Inner Mongolia who represented China at the 2012 London Olympics, has been named mandatory challenger for the winner of an Oct 18 title unification bout in Philadelphia between WBC champ Oleksandr Gvozdyk (17-0, 14 KOs) of Ukraine and IBF titleholder Artur Beterbiev (14-0, 14 KOs) of Russia.After Meng (15-0, 9 KOs) became the IBF's top contender by beating Germany's Adam Deines in an eliminator on June 1 in Macao, Beterbiev opted for the unification bout rather than face the 6-foot-3 Chinese southpaw, who packs a KO wallop with both fists."I respect Beterbiev's choice," Meng told boxingscene.com. "I would have done the same if I was him. The best deserves to fight the best in this sport. My dream has always been to challenge for the world title, but the rule allows the unification fight to take place first."I will get to fight the winner to fulfill my mandatory obligation, and I'm excited about that opportunity."Meng's promoter, Roc Nation's Dino Duva, wasn't quite so accommodating."It was disappointing to get word of the Beterbiev-Gvozdyk match because Fanlong has worked so hard to earn his shot," said Duva."We were in negotiations with Top Rank for Beterbiev and they said he had no problem fighting Fanlong, but then they decided to make a unification match. We will respect the unification concept, but only for this match."One thing I can assure you - we will fight to enforce Meng Fanlong's rights against the winner. Hopefully, whoever wins the fight on Oct 18 will have the courage to put both titles on the line against Fanlong, which will make the wait even sweeter."

                    Visiting astronauts inspire Namibian youngsters

                SWAKOPMUND, Namibia-"Who was the first astronaut in space? Who was the first astronaut landing on the moon? Who was the first Chinese astronaut?" a group of visibly excited students asked.These were just some of the questions raised by students at a recent aerospace science and technology interactive event with visiting Chinese astronauts at Namibia's Space Telemetry, Tracking and Command Station in the coastal town of Swakopmund.Metumu Nomvula Tjimune, a grade 12 student at Westside High School, said she was very pleased to see the astronauts from China."I like Liu Yang. As a woman, she can match any man. She shows what she can do, which means we can make it, too," Tjimune said.Liu Yang, China's first female astronaut in space, and her colleague Chen Dong arrived in Namibia's port town of Walvis Bay on Aug 19, starting their five-day visit to the southern African nation at the invitation of President Hage Geingob.Chinese Ambassador to Namibia Zhang Yiming said the visit was aimed at enhancing communication and cooperation on astronautics between China and Namibia.Zhang said that during the Namibian president's state visit to China last year, Geingob had visited the Beijing Aerospace Control Center, interacted with three Chinese astronauts and invited Chinese astronauts to visit Namibia."During the visit, the delegation will pay a courtesy call to President Geingob, meet local middle school learners at Space TT&C Station, and talk with students face-to-face at the Namibia University of Science and Technology," according to Zhang.Although this is her first trip to Namibia, Liu said she is no stranger to the country."When I was serving on Tiangong-1, I flew over Namibia many times. I knew there is a Space TT&C Station based here, and I'm grateful to be here," said Liu.

                    Opera show wows audience in Cairo

                At Cairo's renowned Citadel of Salah ad-Din, the Chinese performance of the Gaojia Opera was well received by an Egyptian audience at the 28th edition of Cairo Opera House's Citadel Music Festival, which kicked off on Aug 18."I'm amazed by these wonderful Chinese performers. The artists are very professional and the music is awe-inspiring," says Wael Gamal, a sales manager at a computer company.The 39-year-old says he liked the way the artists played the musical pieces, adding: "I don't have to speak about how the audience reacted to the performances. The applause for the artists proved how much everyone liked the shows."The festival, which runs through Sept 1, featuring 41 concerts, including performances by Egyptian artists, has shows by artists from China, Algeria, Tunisia, India, Venezuela, Germany, Guinea and Namibia.Mohammed Rezq, an employee at a local tourism agency, says: "This is one of the greatest shows I have attended. I was really moved by the performance and I will always remember this show."The young man says the show was the first time he had watched a live Chinese performance, adding that the concert would encourage him to listen to Chinese music.The Gaojia Opera, an art form of Quanzhou city, Fujian province, originated from a masquerade parade popular in rural areas of southern Fujian in the late Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and the early Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) where people dressed up as Liangshan heroes (from the Chinese classic Outlaws of the Marsh) and performed martial arts.On May 20, 2006, Gaojia Opera was approved by the State Council, China's Cabinet, to be listed as a national intangible cultural heritage.Wu Jiasong, head of the delegation of the Quanzhou Gaojia Opera Heritage Center to Egypt, says Gaojia Opera is famous for its clown roles. "We have chosen some parts of the most famous clown play to be performed at the show."He says art transcends national borders, adding that Egyptian audiences "really understood our performance".

                    Trade in wild African elephant to be heavily regulated
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Trade in wild African elephant will now be heavily regulated and only allowed in "exceptional" circumstances across the globe.This follows a vote to adopt the new regulation at the 18th Meeting of the State Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, also referred to as CITES, on August 17-28 in Geneva, Switzerland.Representatives voted to adopt a proposal banning export of elephants by Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa to overseas zoos and entertainment venues.The vote obtained the required two-third majority after being approved by 87 votes in favor, 29 against and 25 abstentions.Zimbabwe and Botswana, which have the largest elephant population, will only be allowed to export the wild animals in "exceptional circumstances", in consultation with relevant CITES and International Union for Conservation of Nature bodies, and only if they provide "conservation benefits."Although animal welfare groups and conservation organizations lauded the decision, some southern African countries objected to the vote, while the United States and European zoo associations expressed reservations.The Humane Society International, an animal protection charity, applauded the decision saying it will save countless elephants from being snatched from their families and natural environment.Audrey Delsink, wildlife director at Humane Society International, said even though the decision is not an outright ban on trade in live elephants, it adds vital independent oversight and scrutiny."Speaking personally as an elephant field biologist, I am jubilant that we have secured this victory for all the elephants who will now be spared the ordeal of being ripped away from their families," Delsink said.He said the capture of wild African elephants for export to zoos and other captive facilities is incredibly traumatizing for individual elephants as well as their social groups.African elephants in Zimbabwe and Botswana are currently listed in the second appendix of CITES with an annotation that allows live elephants to be exported to "appropriate and acceptable" destinations.Under the definition, Delsink said Zimbabwe has been capturing live baby African elephants in the wild and exporting them to zoos in other countries.He said the practice has been highly controversial, drawing the condemnation of animal protection and conservation groups as well as elephant scientists who note that elephants are complex creatures who suffer both physically and psychologically as a result of captivity.He said the definition of what is an appropriate destination is key, and independent oversight by elephant specialists is critical."We will remain vigilant as that discussion develops and fight against any attempts to justify or prolong trade in live baby elephants for captive purposes. We are extremely grateful to Kenya and the African Elephant Coalition for their efforts to protect wild African elephants," he said.Dr Jane Goodall, founder of the Jane Goodall Institute, a global wildlife and conservation organization, said that the thought of capturing young elephants, taking them from their families, and sending them off to a future that will inevitably involve a great deal of trauma and suffering, is shocking.She said the bonds between infant elephants and their mothers are as strong and enduring as those between human children and their mothers."To break that bond is cruel and inhumane. I cannot imagine any caring person agreeing to such an unethical proposal and I hope with all my heart that the EU will not vote against the provisional decision taken in CITES with a two-thirds majority," she said.Ian Redmond, a tropical field biologist and conservationist who is renowned for his work with great apes and elephants, also expressed his opposition to the live elephant trade."Having studied elephants, I know how important an elephant's childhood is. Every elephant child learns how to thrive in their family's habitat and that habitat benefits from the elephants," he said.He said to separate a young elephant from his or her family for a life of social and sensory deprivation in captivity is bad for the captive as well as the grieving family left behind.
