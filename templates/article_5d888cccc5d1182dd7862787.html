                How Beijing turns its sky blue
            </p>
            <p>
                Scientific knowledge application, curbs on vehicle use and promotion of clean energy have helped Years of efforts have paid off. Beijing now breathes in better quality air. Following President Xi Jinping's ecological civilization concept, the capital city has defended the blue sky with all its strength. By the end of 2018, the annual average concentration of the three major pollutants - PM10, SO2 and NO2 - had decreased by 59 percent, 95 percent and 43 percent, respectively, compared to 1998, even as the population, local GDP and the number of vehicles kept growing over the years. In 2018, Beijing's annual average concentration of PM2.5 dropped by 43 percent, compared to 2013, and by another 13 percent in the first half of 2019, registering the best level in history. UN Environment released a report on Beijing's 20 years' air pollution control process in March of this year, indicated that "no other city on the planet has realized that rapid air pollution reduction". Reviewing the air pollution control track, Beijing has made use of scientific support, combined with advanced experience at home and abroad, and local realities. First, Beijing issued the Opinions on Comprehensively Strengthening Ecological Environmental Protection and Resolutely Fighting the Battle against Pollution in Beijing, which formulates a division of responsibilities and strengthens assessment and inspection. Since 2013, support implemented A Five-year Clean Air Action Plan (2013-17), Beijing's Three-year Plan on Defending the Blue Sky, and various annual action plans, while focusing on dealing with governance, management, emergency response and regional coordination. Beijing's decision to apply legal, economic, scientific, and administrative means is also a comprehensive attempt to promote the coordinated management of multiple pollutants. Second, Beijing targets the focal point and tackles the problem precisely. Air pollution is fallout of development mode, economic structure and consumption pattern. The solution is to focus on major pollution sources and reduce emission with determination. In recent years, the municipal government has taken the help of scientific support to tackle pollution from coal combustion, vehicles, industry and dust, based on the results of PM2.5 source appointment results. For example, the municipal government has vigorously reduced coal combustion. To optimize the city's energy structure, the government has made efforts to replace coal with clean energy in the fields of electricity, industry and heating. At the same time, it has introduced subsidy and price reduction incentives to ensure that residents and enterprises can afford transition from coal to clean energy. At present, the total annual consumption of coal in Beijing is within 3 million metric tons, which is 90 percent lower than the peak amount. The plain area has basically achieved "no coal consumption". Beijing has eliminated pollution caused by burning coal in general. The municipal government also strictly controls vehicle emission pollution by integrated measures covering stringent emission standards, fuel quality standard, and on-road restriction, aiming to reduce pollution while also finding a solution to the traffic congestion problem. The government has planned for more extended metro and bus networks to reduce intense use of private cars. The city has always taken the lead in the country to implement the most stringent standards for vehicle emission and oil quality in order to alleviate the pollution from emission. It delineates the low-emission areas for motor vehicles. Up to now, about 2.2 million old motor vehicles have been eliminated and nearly 288,000 new energy vehicles have been put into use. Pollution control measures have been extended to off-road machineries. Law enforcement is strengthened to guarantee regulations and standards are respected. The municipal government also makes efforts to reduce emission and pollution from industrial development. To better play out the function of a capital city, Beijing came out with a new catalog of restricted polluting industries, after which it removed more than 3,000 polluting companies and regulated 11,000 companies that violating environmental regulation. The industries are asked to apply cleaner production and environment-friendly technical reforms, all of the city's industrial pollution sources have adopted technical renovation for desulfurization, denitrification, dust removal and volatile organic compound control. Integrated measures are taken to control dust raising in construction activities. Efforts are also made to increase the green coverage across the city territory to enhance the ecosystem capacity. Tackling air pollution is a complex issue. It needs to be accompanied by a sound governance system and continuously improved capabilities. In recent years, Beijing has formulated the most comprehensive, systematic and strict air pollution control regulations. It implements the stringent Beijing Air Pollution Prevention and Control Ordinance and formulates over 40 local emission standards. It offers economic support for air quality improvement and has introduced more than 40 financially supported incentive policies, including subsidies for old vehicle elimination. It establishes a differentiated gas and electricity price mechanism, offering favorable electricity prices to residents who accept transition from coal to electricity heating. It levies the national highest limit of environmental tax, which forces the pollutant discharge units to actively control emission reduction. With the help of Beijing's scientific and technological resources, the municipal government carries out scientific research and development to prevent and control air pollution. It has carried out two rounds of PM2.5 source appointment studies, and has built an integrated air quality monitoring network, which covers satellite, in the air and ground monitoring stations, to carry out real-time monitoring of coarse and fine particles up to town level. Any city in the region cannot isolate itself from the battle against air pollution. In recent years, Beijing has precipitated in joint prevention efforts with Tianjin and Hebei to promote synergized reduction of regional air pollutants and achieve simultaneous improvement of air quality. Even encouraging improvement has been realized, air quality in Beijing still fails to meet national air quality standards, and there is big gap with WHO guideline. There is a long way to go for Beijing in fighting air pollution. Further plans are under development for achieving the air quality standards.

                White paper traces PRC's progress on human rights
            </a>
            <p>
                China on Sunday published a white paper on its progress in the field of human rights over the past 70 years. The white paper, titled "Seeking Happiness for People: 70 Years of Progress on Human Rights in China", was released by the State Council Information Office. "Living a happy life is the primary human right," the document said, adding that China regards the rights to subsistence and development as the primary and basic human rights and has been improving the rights of its people in a coordinated manner since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, especially after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012. Seventy years ago, under the leadership of the CPC, the people of China were emancipated and became masters of their country. Over the past seven decades, the Chinese nation has stood up and grown prosperous and is becoming strong; all basic rights of the people are better respected and protected; and China has made regular contribution to the international cause of human rights, the white paper said. China has opened a new path of human rights protection based on its national conditions, and increased the diversity of human civilizations, it said. In the future, the Chinese people will certainly enjoy to the full more extensive rights and realize well-rounded development at higher levels, it said. The white paper noted that, in the new era, China will continue to uphold cultural diversity, communicate with and learn from other civilizations and work with the international community for common development and prosperity, for progress in human rights worldwide, and for building a community with a shared future for humanity.

                China, EU join hands in effort to fight global warming
            </a>
            <p>
                Ahead of the UN Climate Action Summit in New York on Monday, two high-level groups－one from China and the other from the European Union, within the framework of the Task Force on Carbon Pricing in Europe－met in Paris to jointly promote a China-EU initiative to fight global warming.No challenge is more compelling than climate change. Across the world, people are aware, and worried, about its imminent dangers. This summer, the consequences of climate change on nature and livelihoods were visible at several places on our planet.It is now clear that the efforts to curb carbon dioxide emissions are insufficient to keep global warming below the 2C target agreed to in the Paris Agreement in 2015.The pace of climate change is accelerating. The Chinese and European groups, aware of the gravity of the situation, are considering strong measures to face up to the challenge.The reason that the world is confronted with this situation can be attributed to the working of our market economies. When companies make decisions to produce and sell their products, they don't take into account its impact on society. The ever-increasing economic activities will lead to increases in carbon emissions, which leads to global warming at an exponential pace.The measures that have already been implemented in many countries to curb carbon emissions should not be discouraged. But they are not enough. We should introduce carbon pricing that makes our market economies stabilize carbon emissions to a sustainable level.Carbon pricing is a method adopted to penalize for CO2 emissions. The penalty, for example, is the amount to be paid for the right to emit CO2 into the atmosphere.This method has already been adopted with success in many countries. The World Bank has backed it through the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition, which brings together leaders from government, private sector, academia, and civil society to expand the use of carbon pricing policies.The EU and China have already taken steps in the right direction. The EU has implemented an emissions trading program under which companies that emit large amounts of CO2 should report their emission levels.Companies that need to emit carbon have to obtain a permit. European authorities have control over the volume of carbon emissions permits, which determine the price of carbon. Today this price is £25 a ton. But the price remains volatile. Over the past few months, it has fluctuated, rising to nearly £30 a ton and again going down to£25 a ton.We cannot rule out a further decline in the carbon price in the future. During the 2008-09 recession, within a span of a few months, the price of carbon dropped from £30 pounds a ton to £3 a ton.China launched the world's largest carbon emissions trading market on December 19, 2017. Yet the price of carbon has remained low.The two high-level groups in Paris are working closely to arrive at a consensus on the price of carbon between the EU and China.A predictable and rising price of carbon is the best signal to all economic agents to stop global warming. For example, when the cost of carbon emissions becomes higher, then little by little, companies or power utilities will make efforts to bring down carbon emissions, which would eventually result in carbon-free production of electricity. The same logic applies to all activities that lead to greenhouse gas emissions.That is why it is important for the EU and China to look at a higher price for carbon. In the EU, there is an urgent need to stop volatility in the price of carbon. In China, it would be desirable to ensure carbon pricing fully plays its role in mitigating carbon emissions.Climate change being a global challenge, the world needs a global strategy based on carbon pricing.That is why China and the EU, in line with their Common Commitments on Climate Change and Clean Energy－which they made public on July 16 last year in Beijing－should work together to arrive at a consensus on carbon pricing.By doing so, it would send a strong message that the two main economic blocs are working hand in hand to avert the threat to life on this planet.Zhang Jizhong is secretary-general of the International Finance Forum. Edmond Alphandery is chairman of the Task Force on Carbon Pricing in Europe and former finance minister of France. The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.

                TV documentary on music brings old classics to life
            </a>
            <p>
                When renowned songwriter Qiao Yu was taking a train departing from Shanghai to Changchun in Jilin province, he saw through the window of Yangtze River, a symbol of Chinese civilization.The scenery aroused his patriotism and spawned the song My Motherland, which was composed by Liu Chi and sung by soprano Guo Lanying. Released as the theme song of 1956 war movie Shang Gan Ling, the song became a classic that has been etched into collective memory ofl generations.Now more than 60 years later, the story is unveiled in The Melody of Time, a music documentary series which has run its second season on Hunan Satellite TV and Hunan Economic TV since Sept 16.In the 16-episode documentary, My Motherland alongside other 15 classic songs are featured , sung by 16 young singers, mostly born in 1980s or 1990s.The young musicians also visited some famous figures who shot to fame for or were influenced by the 16 songs, including Li Guyi, Yan Weiwen and Cai Guoqing, all popular singers in their eras.In the episode of My Motherland, singer Zhou Shen visited late composer Liu Chi's Liu Xinxin, who recalls that his father "locked" himself at home for several days to focus on composition as he was so excited to read the lyrics written by Qiao Yu.Recently in Beijing, the National Library of China announced that it had collected the video footage and a book of The Melody of Time for its historic value.

                LONDON - Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel firm, collapsed on Monday, stranding hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers around the globe and sparking the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history.The UK's Civil Aviation Authority said Thomas Cook had now ceased trading and the regulator would work with the government to bring the more than 150,000 British customers home over the next two weeks."Due to the significant scale of the situation, some disruption is inevitable, but the Civil Aviation Authority will endeavour to get people home as close as possible to their planned dates," it said in a statement in the early hours of Monday."Thomas Cook has ceased trading so all Thomas Cook flights are now cancelled," it said.The firm runs hotels, resorts and airlines for 19 million people a year in 16 countries. It currently has 600,000 people abroad, forcing governments and insurance companies to coordinate a huge rescue operation.Pictures posted on social media showed Thomas Cook planes being diverted away from the normal stands, and being deserted as soon as they had landed.Reuters
