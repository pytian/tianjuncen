                Turkey receives second shipment of Russian S-400 components
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                ANKARA -- Turkey on Saturday received second shipment of components of Russian S-400 air defense systems, the Defense Ministry said.Local TV footage showed an Russian aircraft landing at Murted Air Base near the Turkish capital Ankara.The Defense Ministry tweeted that the fourth Russian cargo plane carrying the missile system components arrived at the air base early Saturday.The first shipment of S-400 air defense system parts started on Friday, with three huge Russian cargo planes arriving at the base, local media reported.The third shipment "containing more than 120 guided missiles of various types" will be shipped by sea, according to Russia's state-run TASS news agency.Turkey signed a contract with Russia in April 2017 to purchase the advanced S-400 systems. Tensions between the United States and Turkey have escalated in recent months over the deal.Washington has repeatedly threatened to halt Turkey's purchase of F-35 fighters if Ankara goes ahead with the delivery of the S-400s.

                    Russia preparing delivery of S-400 system

                The Russian-made S-400 air defense system is ready to be shipped to Turkey as the air defense system is being loaded onto a cargo plane, according to Turkish President Recep Erdogan.The first S-400 system is expected to be delivered this week and will be deployed in Turkey, Erdogan said in a news conference on Monday. Site section for the deployment is also underway, he said.Turkey started to negotiate with Russia for S-400 missiles in 2017. The United States has strongly opposed the deal and acting US Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan set out the ultimatum last month, warning that it might deny the purchase of F-35 fighter-bombers by NATO member Turkey, if Ankara pressed ahead with the S-400 deal, BBC reported.Russia's state defense conglomerate Rostec said that Turkey's S-400 purchase involved four missile systems at a combined value of $2.5 billion.Erdogan said he was sure that the S-400 would have a positive effect on the security of both Turkey and the entire region.S-400 is the latest Russian long-range anti-aircraft missile system that went into service in 2007. It is designed to destroy aircraft, cruise and ballistic missiles, including medium-range missiles, and surface targets.It can hit aerodynamic targets at a range of up to 400 kilometers and tactical ballistic targets flying at a speed of 4.8 km/s at a distance of up to 60 km.Turkish TV Channel Haberturk had reported that nine Russian technical specialists would arrive in Turkey before Monday to help deploy the S-400 system.During the first stage, one S-400 set will be delivered to Ankara, the TV channel reported.Head of Turkey's Defense Industries Directorate Ismail Demir confirmed that the S-400 deliveries might begin this week. Russia is yet to disclose the date for delivery.Analyst Frank Gardner said the Pentagon clearly believes that Turkey's purchase of both the F-35 fighter jet and S-400 missile will help Russian technicians to access the plane's vulnerabilities, putting US pilots at additional risk.US, Turkish and Russian forces already operate in the same region in northern Syria.But a senior Turkish diplomat, who asked not to be named, told BBC that Washington had raised no objections while Turkey was negotiating the deal with Russia, only doing so after it was signed.

                    US not to sell F-35 jets to Turkey as Russian S-400 arrives
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON -- US President Donald Trump said Tuesday that his administration would not sell Turkey F-35 fighter jets because of Ankara's purchase of Russian S-400 air defense system."We are now telling Turkey...we're not going to sell you the F-35 fighter jets," Trump told the media in the White House.He also blamed the Obama administration for refusing to sell US Patriot systems, which finally led to Turkey's S-400 deal with Russia.Pentagon, however, has long rejected the assertion that Turkey purchased the S-400 because it could not get a comparable air defense system."We offered the opportunity to them to buy the Patriot (air defense system) numerous times in a more generous package than we've offered anybody else, and they did not sign up for it," Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs Katie Wheelbarger said in a statement last week.Trump's nominee for defense secretary Mark Esper reaffirmed Tuesday that Turkey could either have the S-400 or the F-35, but not both."They have been a long-standing and very capable NATO ally, but their decision on the S-400 is the wrong one and it is disappointing," Esper said while testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee.Turkey began taking the delivery of Russia's S-400 system last Friday. Washington has argued that the Russian S-400 systems jeopardize sensitive information of advanced F-35 stealth fighter jets, which Turkey is helping build and plans to purchase.In addition to the termination of Turkey's participation in the F-35 program, the United States would very likely impose sanctions on Turkey.In a letter last week, bipartisan senators urged the Trump administration to fully implement sanctions as required by law under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.In an interview with The Washington Post on Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo suggested that the sanctions against Ankara might be imminent. "The law requires that there be sanctions and I'm confident that we will comply with the law and President Trump will comply with the law," he said.However, Turkey has refused to bow to US pressure, insisting that choosing which equipment to purchase is a matter of national sovereignty and does not target any third country.In December 2017, Ankara and Moscow signed a 2.5-billion-US-dollar agreement for two batteries of the S-400 system, Russia's most advanced long-range anti-aircraft missile system. Turkey is the first NATO member country to acquire the system.

                    US removing Turkey from F-35 program after its Russian missile defense purchase
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - The United States said on Wednesday that it was removing Turkey from the F-35 fighter jet program, a move that had been long threatened and expected after Ankara began accepting delivery of an advanced Russian missile defense system last week.The first parts of the S-400 air defense system were flown to the Murted military air base northwest of Ankara on Friday, sealing Turkey's deal with Russia, which Washington had struggled for months to prevent."The US and other F-35 partners are aligned in this decision to suspend Turkey from the program and initiate the process to formally remove Turkey from the program," said Ellen Lord, the under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment."The United States is spending between $500 and $600 million in non-recurring engineering in order to shift the supply chain," she said.Used by NATO and other US allies, the F-35 stealth fighter jet is the world's most advanced jet fighter. Washington is concerned that deploying the S-400 with the F-35 would allow Russia to gain too much inside information of the stealth system."The F-35 cannot coexist with a Russian intelligence collection platform that will be used to learn about its advanced capabilities," the White House said in a statement earlier on Wednesday.Washington has long said the acquisition may lead to Turkey's expulsion from the F-35 program.The Pentagon had already laid out a plan to remove Turkey from the program, including halting any new training for Turkish pilots on the advanced aircraft."The situation with Turkey is a government-to-government matter and we'll comply with any guidance issued by the United States Government," said a spokesperson for Lockheed Martin Corp, the prime contractor on the jet. Reuters

                    Turkey blocked from F-35 program for accepting Russian S-400: White House
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON -- The White House confirmed on Wednesday that Turkey's purchase of Russian S-400 air defense systems has led to the termination of Ankara's involvement with the F-35 program."Turkey's decision to purchase Russian S-400 air defense systems renders its continued involvement with the F-35 impossible," the White House said in a statement.The statement noted the F-35 jets cannot coexist with S-400 systems, arguing that its intelligence collection platform would be used to learn about the advanced capabilities of F-35 stealth fighters."Much of the F-35's strength lies in its stealth capabilities. So, the ability to detect those capabilities would jeopardize the long-term security of the F-35 program," Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Ellen Lord told the media at the Pentagon later on Wednesday.The US and other F-35 partners are aligned in this decision to suspend Turkey from the program and initiate the process to formally remove Turkey from the program, Lord said.Turkey suppliers, which provide over 900 parts for F-35, would no longer receive 9 billion US dollars in projected work share over the life of the program, according to Pentagon."Turkey will certainly and regrettably lose jobs and future economic opportunities from this decision," Lord added.Turkey has ordered over 100 F-35 fighter jets, and a handful of them had been scheduled to transport to Turkey in the coming months. The arrangement of those F-35 was still under discussion, according to Lord.Ankara's acceptance of the S-400 not only has detrimental impacts on Turkish interoperability with the NATO alliance but also undermines the commitments all NATO allies made to each other to move away from Russian systems, the White House said.The Trump administration, at the same time, sought to reduce the repercussion for the bilateral relations.Washington still greatly values the strategic relationship with Turkey, the statement added, saying US-Turkey military-to-military relationship is strong and the two allies would continue to cooperate extensively.The United States has been actively working with Turkey to provide air defense solutions to meet its legitimate air defense needs, said the statement.The statement, however, made no mention of possible sanctions against Turkey as required by law under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).Pentagon officials also deferred all questions about possible sanctions to the Department of State.In December 2017, Ankara and Moscow signed a 2.5-billion-dollar agreement for two batteries of the S-400 system. Turkey began taking the delivery of the S-400 system Friday.

                ANKARA - The US decision to exclude Turkey from NATO's F-35 fighter jet program is a "unilateral" step and might bring "irreparable damage" to bilateral relations, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said Thursday."This unilateral move is neither related to the alliance spirit or based on legitimate foundations," the ministry said in a statement."It is unfair to remove Turkey, one of the partners in the F-35 program," the ministry added, rejecting Washington's claim that Turkey's purchase of the Russian S-400 system would weaken the F-35 program. The ministry statement came after the White House confirmed the exclusion of Turkey from the F-35 program, citing Ankara's decision to purchase the S-400 air defense system as the main reason.Moreover, the Turkish suppliers, which provide more than 900 parts for F-35, would no longer receive $9 billion in projected work share over the life of the program, according to Pentagon.Turkey has ordered more than 100 F-35 fighter jets, a handful of which had been scheduled to be delivered in the coming months.In December 2017, Turkey signed a $2.5-billion agreement with Russia on purchasing two batteries of the S-400 system.The first shipment of the S-400 parts arrived in Turkey on Friday.

                ANKARA - Turkish Presidential Spokesman Ibrahim Kalin held a conversation with US National Security Adviser John Bolton by phone on Thursday, discussing Turkey's exclusion from the F-35 fighter jet program.During the call with Bolton, Kalin expressed Turkey's unease over Washington's decision, said a statement by Turkey's presidential office.On Wednesday, the White House announced that it was removing Turkey out of the F-35 fighter jet program over Ankara's purchase of the Russian S-400 air defense systems.Kalin said that "unilateral impositions" would prevent the progress of Turkish-US ties.Despite the recent disputes, the two senior officials also discussed a possible date for US President Donald Trump to visit Turkey, the statement added.Early on Thursday, Turkish Foreign Ministry said that the US move is "against the spirit of alliance", and "might bring irreparable damage to bilateral relations".Last week, Turkey began taking the delivery of Russian S-400 missile components, which are set to continue through April 2020.Turkey planned buying more than 100 F-35 fighter jets and its defense companies were also involved in producing the modern jets.

                    Turkey not satisfied with US new proposals on safe zone in Syria
                </p>

                ANKARA - Turkey was not satisfied with a new proposal submitted by the United States on the issue of establishing a safe zone in northern Syria, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Wednesday."New US proposals are not satisfactory for us. We got the impression that they want to stall just like what happened with Manbij (deal)," Cavusoglu told reporters at a press conference, after talks between the American and Turkish delegations in capital Ankara."A deal on a safe zone has to be reached as soon as possible. Our patience has run out," he said, warning of a possible Turkish invasion in the east of the Euphrates in Syria.His remarks came after the two countries have held talks since Monday to discuss Syria, including the possibility of setting up a safe zone along the border with Turkey, which aims at preventing clashes between Turkish and Kurdish forces.The meetings came after Turkey advanced its military buildup on its border with Syria for a possible new incursion.Cavusoglu said in a recent discussion that his American counterpart Mike Pompeo asked him to wait for a military operation and offered to send a delegation with new proposals for the safe zone.The proposal has "new ideas on who will be included in the safe zone and joint patrols between soldiers," Cavusoglu said, but the offer failed short on the topics of the depth of the safe zone, the elimination of the People's Protection Units (YPG) forces, which Ankara sees as the Syrian branch of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) group, and the control of the safe zone.The United States has provided extensive support to the YPG forces in Syria since the group has led the fight against the Islamic State (IS) in Syria.The US proposal on the safe zone is a process similar to Manbij deal, whose phases will be extended overtime on a specified schedule, a Foreign Ministry official told Xinhua on condition of anonymity.Therefore, Ankara regards this offer as an attempt to stall Turkey's operation into Syria, the official added.The US proposal does not meet with the expectations of Turkey, as the new offer is far behind the 30-km-depth, which the US President Donald Trump expressed earlier, said the official.Furthermore, the new offer does not anticipate an elimination of the YPG from the area Turkey has determined.Ankara and Washington agreed on a roadmap on Manbij in June 2018, which involves the YPG's withdrawal from Manbij and the town's joint control by Turkish and US forces.Despite Ankara's pressure, the US and Turkish soldiers have so far only conducted joint patrols on the outskirts of Manbij while the town remains under US and YPG control.Ankara has often criticized Washington for much delay in the implementation of the roadmap on Manbij and expected the town to be clear of the YPG.The United States and Turkey are committed to "accelerated and concrete progress" on the roadmap agreed upon for the northern Syrian town of Manbij, the US Embassy in Ankara said on Wednesday.Parties "discussed detailed proposals to enhance Turkey's security along the Turkish border in northeast Syria," said the statement.In January, Trump proposed the establishment of the safe zone as a solution to ease tensions between Turkey and the US-backed Kurdish militia.This was the fifth meeting of a US-Turkey joint working group which aims to eliminate differences in Syria and to have progress on the issues of Manbij deal and a possible safe zone in northern Syria.Turkey and the US exchanged several proposals but the parties could not narrow the main differences so far. Ankara wants to have full control of the safe zone after all the YPG forces are withdrawn and all their facilities are destroyed.Turkey wants a 30-40 km depth of the safe zone under Turkish military control so that no YPG troops can attack the Turkish border.However, Washington earlier proposed around 10 km-deep safe zone with no permanent deployment of Turkish troops.

                    Washington and Ankara begin joint patrols in Syria
                </p>

                AKKALE, Turkey - The United States and Turkey on Sunday began their joint patrols in northeastern Syria, aimed at easing tensions between Ankara and US-backed Kurdish forces who battled the Islamic State extremist group.Six Turkish armored vehicles crossed the border to join US forces in Syria for their first joint patrol under a deal reached between Washington and Ankara, Agence France-Presse reported.Two helicopters flew over the area as the Turkish vehicles drove through an opening in the concrete wall separating the two countries.They then headed west with the same number of US vehicles, along with an ambulance and a pickup before crossing back into Turkey.The Turkish Defense Ministry said drones were also deployed.The agreement reached on Aug 7 aims to establish a "safe zone" between the Turkish border and the Syrian areas east of the Euphrates River controlled by the Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG.Syrian Kurdish forces began withdrawing from along the Turkish border in late August.The patrol allowed Turkish forces to observe "firsthand progress on destroyed YPG fortifications and areas where YPG elements voluntarily departed the area", said Colonel Myles Caggins, spokesman for the US-led coalition against the IS group.The YPG forms the backbone of the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF - a key partner of Washington in the fight against IS extremists in Syria.But Ankara sees the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which is outlawed in Turkey.The PKK, which has waged an insurgency against the Turkish government since 1984, is blacklisted as a terrorist group by Ankara, the US and the European Union.Washington's support for the SDF has been a major point of friction with fellow NATO member Turkey.Caggins said the patrol demonstrated the coalition's "continued commitment to address Turkey's legitimate security concerns, while also allowing the coalition and our SDF partners to remain focused on achieving the enduring defeat" of the IS group.Sunday's patrol drew sharp criticism from Damascus, which labeled it a flagrant "aggression" that seeks to prolong Syria's war.It also reiterated its "absolute rejection" of the planned safe zone, calling it a violation of Syria's sovereignty.The Turkish Defense Ministry said on Sunday the joint patrols were "ongoing as planned without any delay to destroy terrorist shelters, to collect their heavy weapons, (and) to ensure necessary conditions for withdrawal and the future return of our Syrians brothers and sisters to the area".Agence France-Presse
