            <p class="style-content">
                Rookie continues to close on coveted Korn Ferry spotBai Zhengkai is primed to continue his remarkable season on the PGA Tour Series-China at this week's Zhuzhou Classic at Xiangshui Bay Golf Club.Coming off his runner-up finish last week in Haikou, the 22-year-old from Shantou, Guangdong province, has jumped to sixth place on the order of merit and a strong showing this week could vault him into the top five.The top five finishers at the end of the season will earn tickets to next year's North America-based Korn Ferry Tour, while those finishing sixth to 10th will bypass the tour's early qualifying events and advance directly to the final stage.Considering he has played five fewer tournaments than any of the players ranked above him, Bai's progress in his first season on the PGA Tour Series-China marks a major breakthrough. He missed the first few events while attending classes at the University of Central Florida, but is now taking his courses online.If all goes well, Bai could be a college graduate playing alongside his compatriots and good friends Yuan Yechun and Dou Zecheng on next year's Korn Ferry circuit."I know all the Chinese players on the Korn Ferry Tour and the PGA Tour; we've all played and trained together in the US so I'm hoping to join them soon," said Bai, who takes lessons with renowned Canadian coach Sean Foley."I came to the PGA Tour Series-China to try to get on the Korn Ferry Tour, so I'm really happy with where I am right now. I've made some good scores and had some good results, but I still have a lot of work to do. I need to work harder and play better."Bai has recorded three top-10 finishes, including a victory at the Huangshan Championship, where he defeated American David Kocher by two strokes to earn his first professional triumph.With just the Macao Championship (Oct 7-13) and Hong Kong's Clearwater Bay Open (Oct 14-20) remaining after this week, Bai is less than 2,000 yuan ($282) behind France's Cyril Bouniol for fifth place on the order of merit."I'm hoping to have another good week. Zhuzhou is a very good course in great condition, and I think I have a good plan for it," said Bai."Hopefully I can get off to a good start. From now on, every tournament is very important so I need to have a couple more good ones to get into the top five. It would be nice if this week was one of them."Meanwhile, Bai plans to wait until after the tournament to sample some of Hunan's famous spicy food."I'm from Guangdong and we don't eat much spicy food there. Out here, the food is a little bit too spicy for me, so I probably will wait until after the tournament to try it," he said.shifutian@chinadaily.com.cn

                    SUSTech Physics Professor on verifying the 3D Quantum Hall effect

                Funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 11874193, 11474265), the research group of Associate Professor Zhang Liyuan from the Department of Physics at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) collaborated with Professor Qiao Zhenhua of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Professor Yang Shengyuan of Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), Professor Yang Kun of Florida State University (FSU), Professor Patrick A. Lee of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Professor Genda Gu of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, in confirming the prediction of the 3D quantum Hall effect. The research results were recently published in well-known international academic journal Nature. The paper was titled “Three-dimensional Quantum Hall Effect and Metal-insulator Transition in ZrTe5”, which was published online on May 8th in Nature.In 1987, famous physicist and Harvard professor Bertrand Halperin predicted the existence of the three-dimensional quantum Hall effect. After 32 years, Associate Professor Zhang Liyuan from the Department of Physics at SUSTech collaborated with Professor Qiao Zhenhua of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Professor Yang Shengyuan of Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), Professor Yang Kun of Florida State University (FSU), Professor Patrick A. Lee of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Professor Genda Gu of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, in confirming the prediction of the 3D quantum Hall effect. The research results were recently published in well-known international academic journal Nature.Dedicated to experimentingIn order to meet this demanding condition, Prof. Zhang’s team deliberately selected the high-quality bulk zirconium pentatelluride (ZrTe5) crystals as the research object. The ZrTe5 crystal is a new three-dimensional topological material with strong anisotropy and layered structure. It has low carrier density and ultrahigh mobility, which makes it easy to get into the quantum limit regime under the experimental limitation. Additionally, in order to avoid disturbing multiple electronic pockets that would complicate the experiment, the research team deliberately chose samples with single electronic pocket.The founder of topological order theory and member of the National Academy of Sciences Professor Wen Xiaogang specifically made a comment on their paper. “This new experimental observation has provided a new material system, which can also generate topological order.”Hard work pays off effort from overcoming difficultiesIn the beginning, Prof. Zhang Liyuan’s research group focused mainly on 2D material systems, which is a competitive research field. While conducting this research, Zhang Liyuan noticed the relatively “unpopular” research direction of 3D electron gas and decided to adjust the direction. The experiments first showed a lot of diversity, which brought great confusion to the team.After persevering and encouraging the team, Prof. Zhang Liyuan recognized a new rule which was neglected previously. The team soon worked together and successfully verified the rule, which proved the existence of the 3D quantum Hall effect. Postdoctoral researcher Wang Peipei said that this experimental breakthrough reflected the long-term perseverance and hardworking of the. He also pointed out that the research group focused on high quality zirconium pentatelluride (ZrTe5) crystals, in order to obtain the best results. “Only when the samples are of enough high quality is it possible to get good experimental results. This is the premise that the research team finally measures the three-dimensional quantum Hall effect.” Zhang Liyuan said: “Sometimes research is just like mining, make the target, and never give up easily… I can’t propose the impact of this achievement on future academic research and daily life. What I can do is tell everyone that there is a diamond mine beckoning to everyone in this place.”Rigorous and professional, multi-party cooperationThe research team needed to work with others in order to deeply understand their samples. After testing large amount of samples in the laboratory over the last four years, the first author Tang Fangdong said that it was crucial to understand the data and get its deeper physics. With that in mind, the team keeps working rigorously and efficiently, and received high praise from Prof. Zhang Liyuan.The importance of interdisciplinary teamwork has become more and more prominent in recent years, just as it does in this work. Research groups from the United States, Singapore and mainland China co-authored this breakthrough paper, providing all kinds of support for this research.It is also impossible to separate SUSTech’s support for the research. Prof. Zhang Liyuan noted that he had been working on this research since his arrival on campus in 2014, with the full support of SUSTech and the Shenzhen Municipal Government. President Chen Shiyi specifically allocated funds for the research at hard times, and subsequently the project received further support from the Guangdong Provincial Innovation Fund, led by Academician Yu Dapeng. Prof. Zhang Liyuan has seen the rapid rise of Department of Physics and SUSTech during the last five years, and has been deeply moved by the rich academic atmosphere of SUSTech.Despite all the challenges placed in front of them, the team persisted and finally is able to present their remarkable academic achievement to the world. When asked about the group’s future plans, Prof. Zhang Liyuan said that there are infinite possibilities in the three-dimensional system, as it is more complicating than two-dimensional case, and the group will continue to explore this new research direction. He will keep more patient and passionate to make more excellent academic achievements. He believes that as long as you work hard, the goddess of fortune will bless you.

                    Purdue Pharma makes tentative deal to settle
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Purdue Pharma, maker of the opioid painkiller OxyContin, and the company's owners, the Sackler family, have reached a tentative agreement with 23 states and thousands of local governments to settle lawsuits stemming from the nationwide US drug epidemic.The proposed deal will cost the company and its billionaire owners, the Sackler family, between $10 billion and $12 billion, according to multiple reports. That includes $3 billion from the family's personal fortune, according to The Washington Post. The drug company and its owners faced about 2,500 lawsuits filed by nearly every state as well as cities, counties and Native American tribes charging that the company fueled the use of the addictive drug through aggressive and misleading advertising.Under terms of the proposed settlement, the Sacklers would give up their interest in the company and trustees would operate the company through a bankruptcy hearing.In addition to the $3 billion to be paid by the Sackler family in the next few years, it could add another $1.5 billion depending on the amount raised from the sale of Mundipharma, a company the family also owns that sells drugs outside the US.Purdue could file for bankruptcy this Sunday and will urge other states to join the settlement. But the deal could fall apart if a bankruptcy judge decides it doesn't have enough support from creditors, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said the deal covers about half the states that are suing the company.Purdue, based in Stamford, Connecticut, has denied that its marketing of OxyContin, launched in 1996, contributed to the opioid epidemic. However, the growing number of lawsuits has pressured the Sackler family, which has donated to museums and the arts worldwide, to reach an out-of-court settlement.The Sacklers are one of the richest families in the US, with an estimated net worth of $13 billion, according to Forbes magazine. The lawsuits allege the family put profit above health by aggressively marketing OxyContin, the brand name for oxycodone, knowing it could lead to addiction and death by overdose. Purdue Pharma had offered up to $12 billion to settle pending state and federal lawsuits.Between 1999 and 2017, about 702,000 people in the US died from drug overdoses, including 399,000 from of all types of opioids, including oxycodone, heroin and synthetics such as fentanyl.In 2017, 68 percent of the 70,000 people who died from a drug overdose, or 47,600, were killed by a prescription or illicit opioid, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported.OxyContin is a brand name for oxycodone, a prescription opioid pain reliever. First synthesized in 1916, the drug wasn't available in the US until 1939. OxyContin is a time-released formula of the drug and provides up to 12 hours of relief to patients who suffer chronic pain from surgery, cancer, injury or severe arthritis.Oxycodone creates a euphoric high, which can lead some users with a prescription to crave the drug and others to obtain it illegally. It is used in other pain medications, including Percocet, a mixture of oxycodone and acetaminophen. The latter drug is available without a prescription. Acetaminophen is an analgesic used to treat headaches or fever and used as an alternative to aspirin.The CDC said use of opioid painkillers in the US rose steadily starting in 2006 and peaked in 2012 at more than 255 million prescriptions — a rate of 81.3 per 100 persons. The overall rate of prescribing oxycodone declined from 2012 to 2017, the most recent year comprehensive data was collected, falling to a total of 191 million prescriptions, or 58.7 per 100 persons.Nevertheless, the federal agency estimated the cost of prescription opioid misuse at $78.5 billion a year, including the cost of healthcare, lost productivity, addiction treatment and law enforcement.Use of oxycodone varies by region. Prescription painkiller sales per person are about three times higher in Florida, which has the highest usage rate nationwide and a large population of retirees, than in Illinois, which has the lowest. More men than women die of overdoses from prescription painkillers, and middle-aged adults have the highest rate, although deaths occur among teenagers and young adults who illegally obtain the drug and use it recreationally without a prescription.The number of people abusing opioids is lower in rural areas, but the death rate is higher than in cities. The disparity in death rates appears to be a function of proximity to emergency care. Whites, Native Americans or Alaska Natives are more likely to overdose than other demographic groups, the CDC said.In 2017, states with the highest death rates due to drug overdoses included West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Kentucky. Washington DC also ranked high, the CDC reported.Other manufacturers of opioid drugs have already settled, including a state opioid trial in Oklahoma. But the tentative deal struck with Purdue Pharma is the first "global" settlement. It was negotiated by a team of lawyers handling the cases in federal court as well as lawyers for the states.Much of the total amount in the proposed settlement depends on the future sale of OxyContin, Purdue's signature drug at the center of the controversy. Some states have declined to join the proposed settlement because they question its valuation.New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts have not joined the tentative deal and have urged the family to sell the company immediately and stop making drugs for international markets."Connecticut has not agreed to any settlement," Willian Tong, the state's attorney general, said in a statement. "Our position remains firm and unchanged and nothing for us has changed today. I cannot predict whether Purdue will seek bankruptcy, but all I can say is we are ready to aggressively pursue this case wherever it goes — whether it is in the Connecticut courts or through bankruptcy."The company is separately negotiating with the US Justice Department to resolve criminal and civil probes, the Journal reported last week.The apparent deal comes six weeks before the start of the first trial before a federal judge in Cleveland, Ohio. The judge has recently ruled against the company in several pretrial motions.Several of the states that have named the Sacklers as defendants allege that the family has drained billions of dollars from the company since 2007, the year Purdue paid a $635 million fine to settle federal criminal and civil cases charging that it has improperly branded OxyContin.The New York attorney general has filed subpoenas in an attempt to find out where the family deposited its money, suggesting possible legal action to recover all or some of it.

                That they have chosen to sing God Save the Queen before the United Kingdom's consulate-general in Hong Kong and wave the Stars and Stripes in front of the United States' consulate-general over the weekend to continue seeking outside help to perpetuate their frenzy shows the demonstrators are nearing their wit's end.By prolonging the violent demonstrations against a bill to amend the extradition law, which has already been withdrawn, and questioning China's sovereignty over the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, they have not only jeopardized the SAR's economy but also tarnished the image of Hong Kong as a global financial and shipping hub, and in the process also harmed themselves.Isolated, they have no choice but to turn to their former colonial masters and the self-proclaimed defender of freedom in search of something more than "moral support". And it seems the US — along with its "all-weather friend" across the Atlantic which cannot even manage to clear the Brexit mess of its own making — is hell-bent on doing something stupid, as usual, given the way it has rolled out the red carpet for secessionist Joshua Wong in New York and Washington.Add to that the newfound friendship between habitual rabble-rouser Marco Rubio and Wong, and you have a recipe for disaster, because it is the Republican senator who re-introduced in the US Congress the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act", which, if passed, would require an annual justification of the special treatment, including trade and business privileges, that for decades Washington has accorded to Hong Kong.But neither any of the US politicians nor Wong has Hong Kong's interests in mind. Since the Republican senator from Florida is a diehard China basher, he has readily seized the opportunity to join hands with Wong — who outrageously appealed to the White House to include a human rights clause in the trade talks with Beijing — to fulfill his agenda of targeting China to win some cheap brownie points.The fact, however, is neither the US nor the UK has any right to interfere in China's internal affairs, and more importantly, China will never allow them to do so.If the US lawmakers refuse to see the bigger picture and pass the bill, they would take a perilous step in the wrong direction, for which the US would have to pay a heavy price.

                Singaporean holds off Bai's charge to notch first tour winSingapore's Quincy Quek knows the value of patience.The 32-year-old said Sunday's final round of the Haikou Classic took "forever" to complete, but the wait for his first victory on the PGA Tour Series-China was well worth it."I think this win will hit me later. Now I'm just trying to absorb everything, but I'm very happy and very pleased with how the week has gone," said Quek."Today was a very long round. It felt like forever ... but I finally got across the finish line."Quek, who has been playing in the series since its inaugural season in 2014, had recorded three top-five finishes in 38 starts.In Haikou, he shot 65-67-63 over the first three rounds to give himself a comfortable lead heading into Sunday, but China's "Bobby" Bai Zhengkai made him work for the victory, finishing two strokes back of Quek, who ballooned to a 2-over 73 in the final round.For the 22-year-old Bai, now ranked sixth on the order of merit, his finish was a huge confidence boost. The top five on the order of merit at the end of the season will earn tickets to the Korn Ferry Tour next year, while those finishing sixth through 10th will bypass the early Korn Ferry qualifying tournaments and advance directly to the final stage.Cyril Bouniol of France currently sits fifth on the money list, but he's only 1,483 yuan ($210) ahead of Bai, who has a win, a second-place finish and a tie for 10th over his past four PGA Tour Series-China starts."I did really well this week. I think the first round held me back and there were some mistakes, but I was really pleased to be able to recover the way I did and I gave myself a chance to win today," said Bai."I'm really happy with my performance, and I think I'm in a good position with a few tournaments left."Bai, who turned pro in May and is still taking online classes at the University of Central Florida while he competes in China, is planning to graduate a semester early-at the end of this year-and concentrate on golf full time."There are a few events left and I want to focus on those. I'm getting more confident each week, and I'm excited to keep the momentum going next week in Zhuzhou (Hunan province) to try to reach the Korn Ferry Tour," he added.Six-stroke leadStarting the day with a six-stroke lead at Mission Hills Haikou, Quek managed to hold on to become the first Singaporean to win on the tour.Bai made it close by firing a 5-under 66 for the third consecutive round, but fell just short in his bid to capture a second tour title after winning the Huangshan Championship in June.Australia's James Marchesani shot a 68 on Sunday to tie for third with Chinese Taipei's Wang Weihsuan (66) and Lee Chieh-po (71), and American Brad Gehl (69), who played in the final group with Quek.Quek didn't make it easy on himself on Sunday. After dropping a shot on his second hole, he failed to generate any momentum, making nine consecutive pars before a birdie on 12 brought him back to even for the day.Quek then dropped back-to-back shots on holes 16 and 17 but closed with a par for a 16-under total."I felt today was quite challenging, and I didn't hit it as close as I did the first three days," he said."Trying to get some birdies was a little bit tough, but I kept my head in the game and kept making pars and tried to look away from the leaderboard as much as possible."After starting the week 32nd on the money list, Quek has jumped to ninth after pocketing 288,000 yuan for the victory."My goal this week was just to make the cut because I was sort of on the cut line to keep my card," he said."Coming into this week my game was looking not too bad, and I like this course and I've had good results here."I felt this was a good week for me to make a move."
