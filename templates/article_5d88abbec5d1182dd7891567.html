                Economic partnership expected to grow stronger
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                The economic partnership between China and Ethiopia is poised to grow further, following a recent visit to the East African country by Li Zhanshu, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Ethiopia was the destination of Li's first overseas visit since he assumed office in March, which he said showed the great importance that China attaches to the development of bilateral ties and China-Africa relations. The top Chinese legislator said China was willing to work with Ethiopia to deepen mutual political trust and strengthen practical cooperation, as well as constantly elevate friendship and cooperation between the two nations. "Ethiopia and China are at a new point of relations, and my visit to the country reaffirms China's interest in supporting the new Ethiopian government. The recent peaceful transition of power in Ethiopia shows wisdom and political capability in governance," he said. Li said Ethiopia was an important partner of China in Africa. He said the practical cooperation between the two sides had played an exemplary role in both China-Africa and South-South cooperation. "China firmly supports Ethiopia's development path in accordance with the African country's own national conditions and supports its efforts to develop its economy as well as maintain stability," he said. During his meeting with Li, Ethiopian President Mulatu Teshome said China-Ethiopia ties were now in their best period in history. "Ethiopia is ready to make joint efforts with China to develop a comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation and better benefit the two countries and their citizens," he said. Li also shared views on China's political system and path of development with the newly elected Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. They spoke about China's governance experience and practices. Li said that five years ago President Xi Jinping put forth the principles of sincerity, real results, affinity and good faith - and the notion of upholding justice while pursuing shared interests when advancing cooperation with Africa. Abiy said friendly relations between Ethiopia and China were as solid as a rock, adding that President Xi's thoughts on governance provided important guidance and reference for the development of Ethiopia and other African countries. He said implementation of the 10 major plans for China-Africa cooperation and the Belt and Road Initiative had brought tangible benefits for Africa, and Ethiopia was willing to continue deepening cooperation with China in the fields of infrastructure construction, finance, tourism and human resources. Muferiat Kamil, the speaker of Ethiopia's House of People's Representatives, said it was vital to further strengthen the relationship between the Ethiopian Parliament and the National People's Congress of China, as well as reinforce people-to-people exchanges. Kamil called on China to support and encourage Ethiopia's commitment to bring political stability to the Horn of Africa and to restore peace and stability in South Sudan and Somalia. Keria Ibrahim, speaker of the Ethiopian House of Federation, said the relationship between China and Ethiopia was very comprehensive and was strengthening periodically. She said Ethiopia was ready to learn from China's development experience, as well as work with China to step up trade cooperation and people-to-people exchanges. Li said the Chinese side would work with the Ethiopian Parliament to improve the legal environment to better facilitate ties. He said the NPC would open a seminar for legislators from developing countries in Africa this year, and he invited Ethiopian delegates to participate. During his stay in Addis Ababa, Li, together with Abiy, witnessed the signing of cooperation documents between the two sides, and he inked a memorandum of understanding with the Ethiopian Parliament. China and Ethiopia enjoy a high level of economic engagement. Trade volume between the two countries is currently at $6 billion, according to the Ethiopian Investment Commission, and between 2012 and 2017, 28,391 jobs were created in Ethiopia by 279 Chinese companies. Out of these jobs, over 19,000 were created in the manufacturing sector, which is leading its African peers by attracting frims from China in terms of numbers and financial capital. Li also made an official visit to Mozambique from May 12 to May 15 to promote friendship and cooperation between the two countries. edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 05/18/2018 page3)

                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                WINDHOEK - China's top legislator Li Zhanshu paid an official friendly visit to Namibia on May 15 to 17 at the invitation of Speaker of the Namibian National Assembly Peter Katjavivi, calling for closer cooperation between the two countries.In the capital city of Windhoek, Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), met with Namibian President Hage Geingob and former President Sam Nujoma, and held talks with Katjavivi and Chair of the Namibian National Council Magreth Mensah-Williams, respectively.During the meeting with President Geingob, Li conveyed Chinese President Xi Jinping's sincere greetings and briefed on China's historic achievements since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) as well as the formation, content and significance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.Reviewing Geingob's visit to China in March, Li said it has opened a new era for China-Namibia relationship that the two heads of state decided to elevate the bilateral ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation.Li voiced China's hope that the two sides will work together to step up communication on policy and alignment of development plans within the frameworks of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), and boost cooperation on infrastructure construction and industrial capacity to better benefit the people of the two countries.The top legislator said the Chinese side appreciates Namibia's push to safeguard the unity of Africa and stands ready to enhance communication and coordination with Namibia in international and regional affairs.Li expounded China's principles and stance on some of today's hot-spot issues in the world, and introduced in detail, as requested, President Xi's efforts to alleviate the tensions on and to help realize denuclearization of the Korean Peninsular.Referring to the vision of a community with a shared future for humanity, Li said all the countries in the world are inter-dependent against the backdrop of globalization, and that they should treat each other equally and work together to safeguard peace and development, and address various challenges that all human beings are faced with.China is willing to work with Namibia to continuously release new vigor of the friendship forged by the elder generation of leaders of the two countries, and the Chinese side will support and assist Namibia and other African countries in their push for developing economy and improving people's livelihood along a path suitable for their own national conditions, with a view to realizing the rise of Africa, a development miracle in history, according to Li.President Geingob said Namibia and China not only enjoy deep traditional friendship, but also treat each other equally as partners.The Namibian people are very clear that China is a true friend and good partner, Geingob said, noting that the Namibian side looks forward to maintaining close high-level interactions and boosting practical cooperation on trade and investment, infrastructure construction and exploitation of energy resources to ensure the road of comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation will get broader and broader.When meeting with Nujoma, Li extended President Xi's greetings to the founding father of Namibia. The top legislator spoke highly of Nujoma's consistent commitment to Namibia-China friendship as a senior statesman in Africa.Recalling his friendly interactions with Chinese leaders, Nujoma said the brotherly friendship has remained unshakable and become even firmer as time goes by.During the talks with Speaker Katjavivi and Chairperson Mensah-Williams, Li briefed them on the people's congress system in China.Li said the system, combining upholding the CPC's leadership, ensuring that the people are the master of the country and ruling the country by law, fits well China's national conditions.He advocated cooperation between the legislatures of the two countries should be first and foremost focused on implementing the important consensus reached by the heads of state, creating favorable legal environments for practical cooperation including trade and investment, increasing experience sharing on governance, and advancing sub-national cooperation and people-to-people exchanges, especially those among the youth and women between the two countries to lay a solid social foundation for the bilateral friendship.Speaker Katjavivi and Chairperson Mensah-Williams expressed gratitude for China's precious support for Namibia's independence. They told Li that the Namibian side is willing to further enhance friendly interactions with the NPC at various levels in line with the memorandum of understanding inked between the two countries' legislatures to help advance the bilateral relationship.During his stay in Windhoek, Li visited the local patients that have undergone cataract surgeries in Brightness Journey campaigns, as well as the Chinese and Namibian medical workers.He said the removal of medical gauze pieces from the patients' eyes embodies the deeply-rooted friendship between the two nations and epitomizes China's medical assistance to Africa.The top legislator encouraged the Chinese medical team to work and contribute to make the local people benefit substantially from medical cooperation between the two countries.Li also witnessed the delivery of aid materials on wildlife protection to the Namibian side and visited the control and command center of Telecom Namibia.Namibia was the last stop of Li's three-nation trip to Africa.

                    Gezhouba Group inks $40m accord with Ethiopia's grand hydro-dam project
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                ADDIS ABABA - Chinese construction and engineering company, China Gezhouba Group Co Ltd (CGGC), has signed a contract agreement with the Ethiopian government to take part in the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD).According to the contract agreement involving $40.1 million, CGGC will take part in pre-power generation activities of Ethiopia's grand hydro-electric dam, which will be regarded as Africa's largest hydro dam upon completion with a total volume of 74,000 million cubic meters, the Ethiopian Electric Power (EEP) revealed on Tuesday.Ethiopian Electric Power head, Abrham Belay, said during the signing ceremony in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa that the agreement with CGGC is expected to speed up construction of the dam.EEP also on Tuesday revealed that it signed another agreement with Voith Hydro Shanghai, which is part of the Voith Hydro that headquartered in Germany with specialization on manufacturing of turbines and turbine generator sets, for the installation and commissioning of six turbine generators at the GERD.The energy sector is one of Ethiopia's priorities as the country envisaged to become a light manufacturing hub in Africa together with a middle-income economy by 2025.Officials at the Ethiopian Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Energy (MoWIE) recently told Xinhua that the East African country is working to reach 17,300 MW of energy by the end of 2020, from the current 4,280 MW of energy through energy projects in hydro, wind, geothermal and biomass energy.Another Chinese company, Poly-GCL Petroleum Group Holdings Limited (Poly-GCL), last week also signed an agreement with the Ethiopia Ministry of Mines and Petroleum (MoMP) to construct the 767-km Ethiopia-Djibouti natural gas pipeline.In April, the Ethiopian government announced plans to generate $1 billion annually from the extraction of natural gas and crude oil deposits.The company is expected to install a pipeline to transport gas from the fields in landlocked Ethiopia up to ports in neighboring Djibouti in two years. Around 700 kilometers of the natural gas pipeline will be located in Ethiopia, while the rest of the natural gas pipeline will be located in Djibouti.

                    Why Belt and Road Initiative is anything but debt trap
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                NAIROBI, April 13 — Almost six years after President Xi Jinping proposed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the grand vision for promoting common development through better connectivity among countries and regions has been morphing into a solution for speeding up global cooperation for greater prosperity.This is evidenced by the fact that 125 countries and 29 international organizations have so far signed cooperation agreements with China on jointly building the Belt and Road, according to data published in March on China's official Belt and Road web portal.But as global enthusiasm for and confidence in the BRI grow, some noises ensue, often with ill intentions to discourage its wide adoption and send misleading messages to nations who seek to benefit from BRI participation. One such message claims that the BRI pushes some countries into a "debt trap."PALE NOISESThe situation on the ground, however, has shown that such noises are ill-founded.Researchers, economists, and policymakers in Africa, a region that has been warned to be wary of a so-called "debt trap" for participating in the BRI, regard such claims as mere negative speculations that seek to undermine the initiative, saying these claims should not be taken seriously.Firstly, developing countries apparently aspire to improve their dilapidated infrastructure and the BRI well meets such needs.Taking transport as a key example, Prof. Damian Gabagambi, managing director of Tanzania's National Development Corporation, said the BRI is highly strategic because transport networks in a country are like blood vessels in a human body."If the blood vessels are blocked, the whole body would paralyze. Likewise, without an efficient transport network, the economy paralyzes," he said."Development of transport network contributes to lower cost of distribution of goods and services among regions and increase in productivity through the availability of access to a diversified set of resources," he said.In Ethiopia, a new Chinese-built and funded terminal at its capital airport was inaugurated in January this year with an annual capacity to serve about 22 million passengers. It tripled the airport's capacity, contributing to Ethiopia's efforts to become a key aviation hub of the African continent.In Kenya, the Chinese-built and funded Nairobi-Mombasa railway has ferried more than 2.5 million passengers and nearly 3.9 million tons of cargo since its launch in May 2017. In his State of the Nation Address on April 4, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta praised the grand project, saying it has been listed among the top 13 most magnificent railway tours for 2019.Developing countries need these, and if China is willing to provide support, it should be a welcomed move, Gabagambi said."Accusation by some Western countries of China letting some countries fall into a debt trap due to their cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative is a matter of perception," he added.Secondly, the so-called debt trap diplomacy language is highly questionable. In fact, taking Africa for instance, its debts owed to China only make up a small share of the total, and such language was highly likely coined by some Western countries that seek to rein in China's growing global role.Zitto Kabwe, an economics analyst in Tanzania, said between 2000 and 2016, Africa owed China $115 billion which were only 2 percent of loans that Africa owed other foreign countries."Why is the world making noise to China with such a minimal amount of debt?" he said."It should be remembered that the construction of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway in the 1970s by China was protested by the World Bank and other Western countries. Some quarters claimed that Chinese were invading Tanzania, but to date, we don't see Chinese invading Tanzania," he said."I believe that Tanzania and Africa in general should define how their cooperation with China should be. Western countries should stop dictating to Africa how the continent should collaborate with China. This amounts to insulting African countries and it's a continuation of colonial mentality," he said.Gabagambi said that it is normal for countries to become indebted because countries borrow to finance different development projects. "Fortunately, African countries are not in the list of most indebted countries in the world," he said.Noting that blaming China for the BRI is unfair, Gabagambi said: "In my opinion, Western countries are envious of Chinese success in transforming the economies of developing countries in a big way that they and their Bretton Woods institutions have failed to achieve for decades."Benard Ayieko, a Kenya-based economist wrote an article earlier this year, describing the so-called China debt trap rhetoric as "farcical."Ayieko said that the saying that Chinese loans are the largest component in the debt matrix of borrowing countries is a misconception. "What Chinese loans have done is to diversify these countries' loan portfolios to avert any risk associated with overreliance on one borrower," he said.Thirdly, BRI cooperation follows the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits, which demonstrates BRI cooperation is based on negotiations among parties and is never unilateral. Hence, the "debt trap" rhetoric is highly unfair.Zambia-based economist Kampamba Shula said China was not trying to dupe participating countries into a debt trap because China does not force itself on any country."To insinuate that African countries were being duped into a debt trap is not to be taken seriously," he said.Leonard Munyandamutsa, a Rwanda-based trade and investment policy expert who specializes in emerging markets investment and trade negotiation, said: "We cannot simply blame China for the increasing debts of some countries because the loans are negotiated by African representatives and given on mutually agreed terms."Ladislas Ngendahimana, a political analyst and the secretary general of the Rwanda Association of Local Government Authorities, said that business, trade and investments are neutral. The so-called debt trap is more a matter of accountable and responsible leadership on the part of the recipient countries, but China is doing a good thing for Africa.Ngendahimana said the BRI contributes to economic cooperation and economic development, which is the best way to prevent conflicts and a driver of modern international relations as well.KEEPING POPULARITY AMID ATTACKSDespite accusations by detractors, the BRI has remained popular, which once again proves the "debt trap" labeling is wrong.During President Xi's visit to Italy in March, China and Italy inked a memorandum of understanding on jointly advancing the Belt and Road construction. Rome's endorsement of the BRI makes Italy the first G7 member to do so.In a joint communique issued by the two countries, Beijing and Rome agreed that the BRI boasts huge potential in promoting infrastructure connectivity.There is nothing sinister about China giving out loans to other countries, said Isaac Mwaipopo, executive director of the Center for Trade Policy and Dialogue in Zambia, adding what matters is that recipient countries ensure that the loans are used for the intended purpose of uplifting the welfare of citizens."There is no doubt that the initiative has left an indelible mark of impact on the participating countries as reflected in various infrastructure projects such as schools and hospitals which have not only helped improve social service delivery but resulted in economic development as well," he said.Mwaipopo looks forward to the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation scheduled to be held in China later this month and anticipates that the forum would highlight the BRI's progress in achieving certain objectives, while allowing countries to further consolidate their cooperation and understanding.

                BEIJING - The China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative has not only brought opportunities to Chinese companies but also benefited countries and local residents along the two routes.Chinese companies are finding new ways of going global while contributing to the development of relevant countries, thanks to new business opportunities brought about by the implementation of the BRI.China International Marine Containers (Group) Ltd, the world's largest container manufacturer, is reaping early rewards of the initiative as soaring railway freight along the two infrastructure-and-trade routes boosted demand for railway containers.Last year, it added over 12,000 containers tailored to railway transportation to its product inventory.The oversized open-top 20-foot containers tailored to railway shipping were developed and manufactured by its subsidiary located in the city of Zhangzhou, East China's Fujian province.Zhang Tao, general manager of Zhangzhou CIMC Containers, said the company will attach more importance to railway containers as the booming China-Europe rail service is creating new business opportunities.China-Europe freight trains made 6,363 trips in 2018, surging 73 percent from 2017, connecting 59 cities in China with 49 cities in 15 European countries. The freight service, a crucial part of the BRI, began operations in March 2011.Shanxi, an inland province, now eyes more trade and cultural ties with the BRI economies, thanks to the development of the initiative.Chen Hecai, chairman of Shanxi branch of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, said he made business trips to nine countries along the two routes in 2018 alone, inking contracts and letters of intent worth 45.33 million yuan (about $6.75 million).The BRI has delivered fruitful outcomes in boosting economic growth and improving people's lives in participating countries.Residents of countries participating in the BRI have benefited from improved infrastructure and more job opportunities as Chinese enterprises expanded their overseas businesses in Belt and Road regions.In eastern Africa, a 130-km road that traverses the drought-stricken savanna in north Kenya was completed in 2017 by China Wu Yi Co Ltd. which is headquartered in Fuzhou, capital of Fujian province.Apart from providing more economic opportunities for the whole country, especially the underdeveloped north, the Turbi-Moyale road, that connects Kenya and Ethiopia, has changed the lives of thousands of local residents.Yang Dong, a project manager responsible for supplying water for construction needs, was soon surprised to find that local residents and their livestock frequently visited their ponds.As more residents benefited from the project, the Chinese construction workers were welcomed there. One day, Yang received six sheep as gifts from a local villager.Then, more ponds were dug to meet the demand of local residents.More than 200 households have chosen to settle near the ponds, and herdsmen from Ethiopia cross the border to get water from the ponds, according to Wan Dongsheng, deputy general manager of China Wu Yi Co Ltd.Meanwhile, as the BRI keeps injecting impetus into China's trade links and cultural exchanges with other countries, and as China advances all-round opening-up, foreign enterprises gained more confidence in the Chinese market.Austria Technologie & Systemtechnik AG, which tapped into the Chinese market in 2001, expanded its investment in China by introducing high-end semiconductor package substrate technology into China and opening a new production site in Southwest China's Chongqing municipality in 2016.Andreas Gerstenmayer, CEO of the world's leading printed circuit boards maker, said the BRI opened up new horizons for the company's development as sales volume from the Chinese market is expected to account for half of its global sales."The Chinese market is the key revenue driver for AT&S and is vital to our future," said Gerstenmayer.Xu Hongcai, an economist with the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, said the project has not only brought opportunities to Chinese companies but also benefited residents and countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.According to this year's Government Work Report, China will continue to "promote the joint pursuit" of the BRI, aiming at "shared growth through discussion and collaboration".

                    Sino-African cooperation on development path
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                At the recent coordinators' meeting in Beijing to evaluate the implementation of programs agreed at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in September 2018, China and Africa agreed to build a community of shared future, jointly pursue a development path under the Belt and Road Initiative framework, and safeguard multilateralism and the spirit of equitable and open cooperation.The Coordinators' Meeting on the Implementation of the Follow-up Actions of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation was another important example of China-Africa friendly engagement and practical cooperation, which will elevate the China-Africa Comprehensive Strategic and Cooperative Partnership to a higher level.Thanks to rising unilateralism, protectionism and bullying, economic globalization is facing various counter-currents including growing uncertainties in international relations, which have become the major barriers constraining the development of developing countries. China as the biggest developing country and Africa as the continent with the largest number of developing countries remain true to their original aspiration, and have joined hands to promote a community with a shared future for mankind, and usher in a new chapter of global unity, coordination and mutual benefits.Cooperation based on equality, mutual respectMoving forward by working together is the eternal principle of China-Africa cooperation. Sino-African engagement features reciprocity and bears no mark of colonization and invasion. China believes in equality among nations regardless of their size, wealth or strength, seeks no political self-interests in cooperation, fully respects the sovereignty of African countries, and supports African countries to independently explore the development paths that suit their own conditions.Africa is an important cornerstone of China's foreign policy. President Xi Jinping has visited Africa many times, and met with leaders of different African countries on multiple occasions, forging unbreakable friendships with his counterparts. And the 29-year-old tradition of China's foreign minister visiting Africa on his first overseas trip in the new year bears testimony to the affinity between the two sides.China and Africa have been mutually supportive on issues of core interests. They share the common goal of promoting democracy in international relations, safeguarding multilateralism, equality and justice, and protecting the common interests of developing countries. The two sides have developed a model South-South partnership despite the ever-changing global situation.Joint development is an important mission of China-Africa cooperation. China and Africa are committed to realizing the dream of national prosperity and people's happiness, and promoting common development through practical cooperation.New development opportunities for bothChina supports Africa's development and has always been true to its word. By implementing the follow-up actions of the 2018 FOCAC summit in Beijing, aligning with Agenda 2063, and working under the Belt and Road framework, the two sides are creating mutual development opportunities.China has been Africa's top trading partner for 10 consecutive years, and its overall investment in Africa is more than $110 billion. Twenty-four African countries have forged strategic partnerships or comprehensive cooperative partnerships with China. And more than 3,700 Chinese businesses have invested in African countries. China does not rely on hyped-up ideas or pay lip service to cooperation with African countries; it believes in putting its words into action. The follow-up actions of the FOCAC summit in Beijing last year are proof of that.China will be implementing more than 880 cooperation projects in Africa. Major projects such as the Maputo-Catembe Bridge in Mozambique, Africa's longest suspension bridge, and Guinea's Souapiti hydropower plant have been either completed or put on the fast track for early completion. The first Luban Workshop (China's vocational training workshop) has already opened in Djibouti. The China-Africa Institute has been established in Beijing, and China and the African Union have inked an agreement to build the Africa Center for Disease Control and Prevention. And the Dialogue on the Implementation of China-Africa Peace and Security Initiative was held in Addis Ababa.Turning advantages into development driversAll this shows China is taking actions to transform Africa's advantages into development drivers, making significant contributions to Africa's peaceful development on a mutually beneficial basis.Keeping up with the times is an essential feature of China-Africa cooperation, both in terms of quality and efficiency, in this age of economic globalization. In fact, China-Africa cooperation is expanding to new areas such as information and communications technology, digital economy and renewable energies.Public-private-partnership and invest-build-operate projects, as well as investment and financing projects are developing fast. And the use of renminbi to settle crossborder trade has made great headway.China is also making efforts to improve Africa's business environment so the continent can attract more foreign investment. China lays emphasis on indigenization of business operations, supports the continent's capacity-building and promotes regional economic corridors and development centers to facilitate industrial relocation and technological transfer, generating employment, taxes and foreign exchanges for the host countries.For example, the Eastern Industry Zone built with Chinese investment is Ethiopia's first industrial zone. It houses 81 businesses with a combined investment of $370 million, and has generated more than $60 million in tax revenue and created over 10,000 jobs, making significant contributions to Ethiopia's economic and social development.China remains committed to the idea of sincerity, real results, affinity and good faith and the righteous vision of justice and interests, and pursues green development according to transparent market principles in order to ensure the high-quality development of China-Africa cooperation.China-Africa cooperation is known for its openness and inclusiveness, and does not seek to form exclusive groups or spheres of influence. No wonder international investment in Africa has been growing rapidly in recent years.Sino-African cooperation is not about one partner being superior to the other. What matters is the substantive work China does for Africa's development. China believes that international cooperation with Africa should stick to the "Africa First" principle, and China is willing to work with all countries and play a complementary role to promote peace, stability and development across the continent.In this regard, it is pertinent to also say that the Belt and Road Initiative is not China's solo show, but a choir involving other parties for its implementation.Africa can accommodate all development partnersIn fact, China has conducted meaningful trilateral cooperation with Western countries including the United Kingdom and France, proving that Africa has enough room for all countries to cooperate and facilitate the continent's development. Africa is not a racetrack or hunter's arena for external powers. Countries that still have a Cold War mentality and continue to play zero-sum games should make room for the principles of "African Initiative, African Consent and African Ownership" to chart the right path for cooperation and win-win partnerships. China-Africa cooperation is exhibiting new vitality and a brighter future for development. Despite the complicated and profound changes in the global situation, China-Africa cooperation and win-win partnership are deepening. China will continue to abide by the principle of equality, fair play and transparency in Sino-African cooperation to build a closer community of shared future, strengthen bilateral communication and cooperation in international and regional affairs, and step up efforts to align different countries' development strategies so the fruits of cooperation can benefit more people and keep Sino-African cooperation on the stable track of development.The author is head of mission of the People's Republic of China to the African Union.
