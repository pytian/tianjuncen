                    Blast kills 31 as Pakistan holds general elections
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                LAHORE/PESHAWAR, Pakistan - A blast near a polling station killed 31 people as Pakistanis voted on Wednesday in a knife-edge general election. "(The bomber) was trying to enter the polling station. When police tried to stop him he blew himself up," said Hashim Ghilzai, a local administration official in Quetta. The incident and toll were confirmed by a second senior local official. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack. A witness who was waiting to cast his ballot, Abdul Haleem, said he saw a motorcycle drive into the crowd of voters just seconds before the explosion. Haleem's uncle was killed in the blast. "There was a deafening bang followed by thick cloud of smoke and dust and so much crying from the wounded people," he said. Earlier this month, a suicide bomber killed 149 people at an election rally in the town of Mastung, also in Baluchistan province. That attack was also claimed by the IS group. About 371,000 soldiers have been stationed at polling stations across the country to prevent attacks, nearly five times the number deployed at the last election in 2013. Several dozen parties are taking part in the elections, but the contest will be mainly among the three major parties, including Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehrik-i-Insaf and former president Asif Zardari's Pakistan Peoples Party. The latest opinion polls put Khan and Sharif's parties in front, but neither is likely to win a clear majority, with the Peoples Party expected to be at number three. About 106 million people are registered to vote in the election, with polling stations scheduled to close at 6 pm. Results will start trickling in within hours, and the likely winner should be known by around 2 am on Thursday. Voters believe that the election will serve as a game-changer for the country and the new government will work better than the previous ones as the people of the country are more aware about the "power of their vote" than before. "The last five years were very challenging for Pakistan's economy and the forthcoming years will be even more crucial, so we will select the party who will complete the projects initiated by the CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor) and other programs," said businessman Sabir Chaudhry while waiting for customers at his store in a busy market in Islamabad on the eve of the election. Chaudhry, 30, who is voting for the first time, said he never took elections seriously before, but now he believes that he should play his part to elect a candidate who is sincere with the country and will work to bring a positive change.

                    PTI party leading in Pakistan elections
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Imran Khan declares victory despite results delay due to software crash ISLAMABAD - The Pakistan Tehrik-i-Insaf party, or PTI, of cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, is leading in the country's general elections, according to initial results received by the Election Commission of Pakistan, or ECP, on Thursday. Despite results still being tallied on Thursday, Imran Khan declared victory for his party, promising a "new" Pakistan. The country held general elections on Wednesday to elect the members of the National Assembly, the lower house of the country's parliament, and members of four provincial assemblies. The ECP said the results received so far showed that the PTI has won 55 seats of the National Assembly, well ahead of its rivals - the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, or PML-N, and Pakistan Peoples Party, or PPP. The PML-N of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif is emerging as the second largest party with 14 seats followed by six seats of PPP led by former president Asif Zardari. The PTI has won all three seats of the capital Islamabad. Chairman of the PTI, Imran Khan, who was personally contesting five seats in the lower house, has won three seats and is waiting for the outcome of the rest where he is also in a leading position. According to the initial results, former prime ministers Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Yousuf Raza Gillani, and former interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan have lost the elections. The ECP has received the results from about 48 percent of the total 85,000 polling stations. The PTI is ahead mostly in Punjab, the country's most populated province and also the stronghold of the PML-N, and in the northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The trend shows that the PTI might not get a simple majority in the lower house, so it will need the support of independent winning candidates and other small parties to get a majority and to form the government. The election body said it will announce the final party position after receiving the complete vote count. Ecstatic supporters PTI supporters were ecstatic at the projected results. First time voter Fahad Hussain, 21, said the party had successfully lured the country's massive youth population. "He motivated the youth," Hussain said of Imran Khan in Islamabad as he hit the streets to celebrate with friends. Out of 272 seats of the 342-member National Assembly, elections were held in 270 constituencies as two seats remained uncontested due to death and disqualification of the candidates. Pakistan's lower house has a total of 342 members, of which 272 are directly elected by the people, whereas 60 seats are reserved for women and 10 for religious minorities. These seats will be allocated to the political parties according to their proportional representation in the house. The country's law binds the ECP to finalize results within 10 hours after the polling is concluded, but the outcome of the results slowed down due to the failure of the Result Transfer System. The RTS is online software designed to transfer the votes' counting from polling stations to the election headquarters. Following the technological glitch in the system, the ECP directed all the polling officers to transfer the results to district control rooms manually. However, the rainy season and polling stations being in far-flung areas caused further delay in compiling the final results. About 800,000 military and police had been deployed to provide security on the election day on Wednesday. But as voting got underway in the southwestern city of Quetta, the Baluchistan provincial capital, militants sent a suicide bomber to a crowded polling station to carry out a deadly attack, killing 31 people. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Wednesday's suicide attack. The United Nations stands in solidarity with and supports the efforts of Pakistan in the fight against terrorism, Guterres said. In mid-July, a suicide bombing killed 149 people at an election rally in the town of Mastung in the same province. Both attacks were claimed by the Islamic State terror group.

                    CPEC: A health corridor between China and Pakistan
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a framework of geographical connectivity linked through the Belt and Road Initiative, which is not just for the benefit of China and Pakistan but for all the countries involved in the initiative. CPEC will provide regional development, economic growth and peace through a win-win model. CPEC is a long-term project which was initiated in 2014 and is planned to be completed by 2030. A total investment of $46 billion has been allocated for the corridor. CPEC is linking Kashgar in northwest China with Gwadar Port on Arabian Sea coastline in Pakistan. The package includes building infrastructure, that is road, rail, pipeline links, hospitals and much more, between the Arabian Sea and China’s northwest. There are three routes of CPEC passing through Pakistan namely eastern route, central route and western route. Through CPEC, the current distance for China to reach the Arabian Sea will be shortened from 16,000 km to less than 5,000 km. Although, CPEC is advantageous in a number of fields for both Pakistan and China, but being a medical student, I will focus on medical field.Pakistan has the seventh-largest pool of scientist and engineers, second-least expensive country and the manufacturer of 50 percent of all soccer balls in the world. However, much more has to be done on health sector in Pakistan. Statistical data from 2014-2015 showed that population per doctor and population per bed did not improve much over than previous years. Access to healthcare services remains inadequate because of insufficient human resources and medical infrastructure. Recent pharmaceutical industrial data of Pakistan shows that both national and multinational companies have contributed in growth of pharmaceutical industries. Domestic companies fulfilled 58 percent of the local demand and multinational manufacturers fulfilled the rest.The healthcare system of China assures the provision of basic facilities to each individual through healthcare insurance. Out of top 25 pharmaceutical manufacturers in China, 22 are domestic companies. CPEC could play a key role in mutual cooperation between Chinese and Pakistani pharmaceutical industries. Availability of cheaper raw materials to manufacturers in Pakistan can be of mutual benefit for both countries.More than 200,000 students from 64 countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative were studying in China last year. More than 10,000 medical students have already graduated and are working in respective fields. Currently, Pakistan has risen to top 4 in number of students in China. There is an intense need to construct state-of-the-art hospitals and pharmacies at port city of Gwadar, where such students along with Chinese professionals might continue their practice. Recently, Vice-Chairman of Chinese Red Cross Foundation Liu Xuanguo announced plan to set up second emergency care in Quetta in Balochistan.Currently, 90-95 percent of all the big machines for pharmaceutical industries in Pakistan and raw materials are imported. CPEC and Belt and Road Initiative can help in the development of this sector. As 42 percent of the total local demand of finished medicines is met by multinational companies in Pakistan. Thus, it can be a breakthrough for both Pakistani and Chinese manufacturers to get collaborative trade benefits through mutual cooperation. Through CPEC, Pakistan’s pharmaceutical industrialists will get quick access to China, Middle East and Europe. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a vast field of treating all ailments. Effectiveness and utility of TCM can be exported to the world through the initiative and CPEC.Other than hospital and pharmaceutical industries, there is a need to build medical colleges and universities, state-of-the-art research laboratories, drug stores and pharmacies along the CPEC. In order to polish the medical skills of the personnel, the doctors, pharmacists and other medical staff exchange programs can be initiated. For health and knowledge corridor, experts from both China and Pakistan will be needed to bring revolutionary changes in health sector. Health corridor will bring drastic changes which in turn will improve the basic health facilities in Pakistan. Once the project completed successfully people of even rural areas will be able to get quality treatment without traveling to major cities.A large number of entrepreneurs from Pakistan and China have already invested and showed their huge satisfaction in CPEC. Multinational investors are also showing their interest to invest in Pakistan now, thanks to CPEC. Currently, many Chinese companies are working in Pakistan and more are thinking to work in future because of more trade benefits in Pakistan as compared to China. There is a need to encourage and assist investors from China and Pakistan to invest in medical sector.The newly elected Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan in his victory speech said that CPEC has brought many positive changes in Pakistan’s economy. Talking to a Chinese newspaper, Khan said that direct involvement in the construction and operations of various projects under the CPEC framework has opened a lot of opportunities for a large portion of the population. In the future, the CPEC will receive wide support from all sectors of Pakistani society.Muhammad Ijaz is a doctoral student at Shandong University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences and a China Scholarship Council recipient.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                    3 militants among 8 killed in SW Pakistan's hotel attack

                ISLAMABAD -- At least eight people including three militants, four civilians and a navy person were killed and six others injured when three militants stormed a five-star hotel in Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province on Saturday, a military statement said Sunday.The suspects attempted entry into Pearl Continental Hotel located in Gwadar district of the province with an aim to target and take hostage the guests in the hotel, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Pakistani military's media wing, said in the statement."Security guards at the entry challenged terrorists denying them the entry into main hall and terrorists went to staircase leading to upper floors," the ISPR said, adding that the militants kept on firing indiscriminately while moving to staircase, killing and injuring hotel staff.Quick reaction forces of the army, the navy and the police immediately reached the hotel and evacuated guests and staff present in the hotel besides restricting the terrorists within the corridor of the fourth floor of the five-storey hotel."After ensuring safe evacuation of guests and staff, clearance operation was launched to take on terrorists. Meanwhile, terrorists had made CCTV cameras dysfunctional and planted IEDs (improvised explosive devices) on all entry points leading to 4th floor," said the statement.Security forces made special entry points to get into 4th floor, shot down all terrorists and cleared planted IEDs, the statement added.A few hours after the attack on Saturday, Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist organization of Baloch militants, claimed the attack in a tweet from an unverified Twitter account.The BLA also released a picture of four people clad in security forces uniform, claiming them as the miscreants who attacked the hotel.Prime Minister Imran Khan condemned the attack, saying that the attempt is an effort to sabotage the country's economic projects and prosperity, and vowed that they will not allow such plans to succeed.Saturday's attack was the fourth major attack in Balochistan in less than a month. BLA and its allied groups claimed two of the four attacks that hit the province during the period.The earlier attack happened at Makran coastal highway in Gwadar district last month when about 15 to 20 militants stopped five passenger vehicles and killed 14 security personnel after identifying and off-loading them from the vans and letting the vehicles to leave with other civilian passengers.Following the attack, militant group BRAS, formed with the alliance of BLA and two other Baloch nationalist groups warned of more attacks on the economic interests of Pakistan.Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said that the BRAS militants have their settlements including training camps across Pakistan-Iran border, in Iran, and they escaped back to the country after carrying out the attack in Balochistan.He said that his country shared actionable intelligence with Iran and is awaiting positive response from Iranian authorities, who assured them to take action against the militants after investigations.The other attack that hit Balochistan during the last one month targeted an ethnic community of minority Shiite Muslims in provincial capital of Quetta. The attack left 20 people killed and scores others injured.In a separate explosion in Balochistan earlier this week three people including a tribal elder were killed in a remote-controlled explosion.

                    Chinese doctors finding success at Pakistan center
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                On the edge of the Gwadar port that juts out into the Arabian Sea sits a low-rise building in bright red paint that is distinct from the complex of dusty adobe houses surrounding it.Each day, a number of local Pakistanis clad in traditional clothing and Chinese workers based in the southeastern port city of Pakistan visit the establishment, a medical center built by the Chinese Red Cross Foundation, the public fundraising arm of the Red Cross Society of China.Since its inauguration in May 2017, three teams of Chinese medical workers have served in the center, with each group consisting of eight to 13 doctors and nurses from two hospitals affiliated to Fudan University in Shanghai and the Beijing Red Cross Emergency Rescue Center.While each group of medical personnel is usually stationed for six months, Hu Cheng'en, a general surgeon from the Huashan Hospital of Fudan University and the captain of the third team that arrived in mid-January, has delayed his scheduled departure from Pakistan for several months."The fourth group of medical workers had to postpone their planned trip due to uncontrollable circumstances and will not come in until later this month," said Hu, 44. "I have chosen to stay longer along with another colleague so that healthcare services at the center won't be halted, and I can help with handing over operations to our successors."Over the past two years, the center has gained increasing significance as one of the three pillars of the healthcare system in Gwadar, a city of 80,000 residents that has drawn investment into its burgeoning port while constantly suffering from armed conflicts."Before the China-funded medical center was established, there were two major medical institutions in the city-one situated in the city center and staffed by about 10 medics, and the other under the administration of the local military," Hu said."The first group of Chinese doctors had to start from scratch and cope with scarce medical equipment and drugs," he said, adding that language barriers and the stagnant flow of information had resulted in low attendance of local Pakistani people.The second phase of medical assistance, from May 2018 through the end of last year, drew a larger number of patients thanks to improved infrastructure, word-of-mouth promotion and the addition of three interpreters appointed by the Pakistan Red Crescent Society, according to Hu.The proportion of Pakistani patients increased from less than 10 percent during the first phase to more than 80 percent, according to the Red Cross Society of China.As of the third stage that officially wrapped up in early July, nearly 4,000 patients had visited the center. "We were also glad to see that more female Pakistani residents had overcome stereotypes and stepped into the center to seek diagnoses and treatment," Hu said.The medical center has also initiated regular programs to conduct physical examinations for primary school students and employees hired by businesses in Gwadar.The latest plan, according to Hu, is to build connections with the hospital located in the city center."We will provide the hospital with medications that are in short supply, especially the pediatric drugs, and assist them in diagnosing patients with complicated illnesses," Hu said. "In return, the hospital will share its clinical laboratory to help us conduct tests that are currently unavailable at the center."According to the Red Cross, the medical center in Gwadar marks the starting point of a long-term initiative known as the China-Pakistan Emergency Corridor, a thread of medical units along the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor stretching about 3,000 kilometers from Gwadar to Kashgar in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.The organization added that it envisioned setting up a command center in Kashgar to coordinate emergency responses along the first-aid route.The second center after Gwadar will be positioned in Quetta, near Pakistan's border with Afghanistan, and preparation work is underway, according Hu."While foreign projects in Pakistan are always susceptible to unexpected incidents, such as security threats and communication difficulties, we will continue to accumulate experiences and accelerate progress in the future."
