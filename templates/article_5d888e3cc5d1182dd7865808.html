                Players hope 'Dream Gap Tour' can help revitalize women's professional sceneGrowing up, Kendall Coyne Schofield recalled how her dreams of playing hockey ended at college, or maybe the Winter Games - something the two-time US Olympian forward eventually would achieve.Playing professionally was never part of the equation, which is something Coyne Schofield remembers once mentioning to former American star Cammi Granato, noting how girls can only win gold medals while boys can win Stanley Cups."You always grow up and hear boys say, 'I want to be a pro hockey player one day.' You don't hear little girls saying that. They say, 'I want to go to the Olympics,'" Coyne said. "That's the pinnacle of our sport. I can't make a living playing this sport. So when I graduate college, I either go to the Olympic Games or get a job."Coyne Schofield and more than 200 of the world's top female players who have pledged to not compete in North America this season are determined to change that notion.They're launching what's being called the Dream Gap Tour, announced by the newly formed Professional Women's Hockey Players' Association (PWHPA) last month. The gap represents the missing link young girls have in their dreams of playing professionally.The tour's first stop will be in Toronto from Sept 20-22, followed by an event in Hudson, New Hampshire, from Oct 4-6, and Chicago from Oct 18-20. The union also announced its members will play exhibition games against Boston College on Sept 21 and against the Sharks alumni in San Jose on Sept 22.Additional tour stops are being considered but not yet finalized, including Southern California and Buffalo, New York. Among the sponsors already on board are Adidas, and the players are also backed by Billie Jean King Enterprises.The stops will feature about 80 players split into four teams playing a three-game round-robin tournament followed by a championship game. The circuit will also include youth clinics.It's essentially a barn-storming tour made up of PWHPA members seeking to bring the sports' stakeholders - including the NHL, USA Hockey and Hockey Canada - to the table to establish a single league with a sustainable economic model, featuring the world's top talent, and pay a livable wage and include health care.The boycott and the union were born out of the demise of the Canadian Women's Hockey League, which folded due to financial reasons last spring. That left the US-based, five-team National Women's Hockey League as North America's only pro women's league. It is privately backed and has endured financial struggles since being established in 2015.The tour is considered the union's coming-out party, and feature players wearing jerseys with PWHPA logos."We're not talking about millions of dollars here. We just want to be able to live and train full time, and see how far we can take this game," said defenseman Alyssa Gagliardi, who has played in both the CWHL and NWHL. "For so long, it's only been limited to the girls on the national team that can truly do that full time, so this is kind of broadening that."Growing up in Raleigh, North Carolina, Gagliardi had no role models to look up to except for tuning in to the Winter Games every four years. She's looking forward to making a positive impression on young female hockey players during the tour."This is what we're fighting for," Gagliardi said. "I think we want to really make sure this stays with them for the rest of their lives, and by the time they're graduating college there's a place for them to play."Billie Jean King entered the picture to provide guidance. On Aug 26, she was joined by five female hockey Olympians, including Coyne Schofield, at the US Open, where they posed for a picture posted on King's Twitter account.Having blazed a trail in starting women's professional tennis in 1970, King sees an overlap in other sports."We envisioned a world where any girl, if she is good enough would have a place to compete, would be appreciated for her skills and accomplishments, and could make a living playing professional tennis," King said."Today, almost 50 years later, the women of professional hockey, soccer and other sports are facing the same situation, and our vision has not changed. Everyone should be able to have the dream and the opportunity to earn a living playing the sport they love."Coyne Schofield was so excited to meet King that she took in her exhibit at Arthur Ashe Stadium and even bought a King doll at the gift shop.King's message, however, is what resonated most."She always says, 'If you see it, you can be it,'" Coyne Schofield said, reflecting on watching Serena Williams compete and seeing the picture of the original nine professional tennis players including King who formed the first women's tour. "For me, that was the moment when I saw it. She built this and we're literally living in it. And you know what, we have the opportunity to do that."She said it's long past time the best female players from around the world have the opportunity to showcase their talents in one league."We can't just keep accepting the fact that we're grateful for an opportunity," Coyne Schofield said. "We're done being grateful, and we need to stand up for what we know is right. Because if we don't stand up today and fight for what's right, we're setting up the future to fail."Associated Press

                Survey: two-thirds in US want good ties with China
            </a>
            <p>
                Two in three Americans prefer friendly cooperation and engagement with China, and a vast majority of the US public favors trade with the world's second-largest economy, according to the 2019 Chicago Council Survey, released on Monday.The survey, a detailed look into Americans' views on the vital issues the US faces, including the value of trade and military alliances and the threats from rivals, also found that majorities across political affiliations oppose selling arms to Taiwan."While a growing number of Washington insiders perceive China as a grave military and economic threat requiring confrontation, the American public prefers cooperation," it said.As has been the case since the council first asked the question in 2006, two-thirds of Americans, or 68 percent, say they prefer to undertake friendly cooperation and engagement with China, rather than working to limit the growth of China's power, according to the survey.This is also the case regardless of party affiliation, for 74 percent of Democrats, 69 percent of independents, and 58 percent of Republicans say they prefer a policy of friendly cooperation and engagement with China, according to the survey.The Chicago Council survey has been conducted every four years since 1974, biennially since 2002, and annually since 2014. It was conducted from June 7-20 this year among a representative national sample of 2,059 adults.It found that Americans are more likely to see trade as win–win rather than zero-sum.More than in any previous Chicago Council Survey, the public says that international trade is good for the US economy (87 percent) and American companies (83 percent), according to a survey report."These results are a stark change from 2016, when just 59 percent said that international trade was good for the US economy," it said.Furthermore, the survey found that more Americans now (63 percent) than when last asked in 2017 (51 percent) believe that trade deals benefit both the United States and its trading partners, a deviation from the perception of the hawkish in Washington who believe that the US has been "taken advantage of" by its trading partners.Nearly three-quarters of the responders said they favor engaging in trade with China, just 2 percentage points shy of those who say they favor trade with South Korea, according to the survey.Only 30 percent of Democrats support placing tariffs on products imported from China, far fewer than the Republicans, who follow the lead of the US president.The two countries have slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of each other's imports since early 2018, with the latest round of duties taking effect on Sept 1.The two sides have agreed to resume high-level trade talks in Washington early next month, after 12 rounds of such meetings failed to reach an agreement acceptable to both countries.US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that the US and China have a "conceptual" agreement on enforcement concerns, emphasizing positive progress already made in trade talks, CNBC reported.The Chicago survey also found that majorities across political affiliations support negotiating arms-control agreements between China and the United States and cooperating on international development-assistance projects, and that Americans across partisan lines oppose selling arms to Taiwan.Late last month, the US State Department approved a potential $8 billion arms package, including F-16 fighter jets, to Taiwan, according to a statement by the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency.A spokesman for China's Ministry of National Defense said the Chinese military strongly opposes the US arms sale, calling the action a "complete mistake" and "very dangerous".

                Hainan Airlines to start flight service between Chengdu, Chicago
            </a>
            <p>
                CHICAGO - A new nonstop passenger flight between the O'Hare International Airport of Chicago and Shuangliu International Airport in Chengdu in Southwest China's Sichuan province will start from Sept. 16.This will be the first nonstop scheduled passenger flight from the US Midwest to China's southwest hinterland.Hainan Airlines will offer the nonstop flight service with a 213-seat B787-8 aircraft twice weekly, on Tuesdays and Saturdays. The flight takes 16 hours and five minutes westbound and 14 hours and 50 minutes eastbound.With the opening of the new air route, passengers flying from Chicago to Chengdu will have easier access to Chengdu's neighboring cities such as Guiyang and Kunming.The Chicago-Chengdu air service is expected to bring $35 million in annual economic impact to the Chicago region. And it will benefit Chicago's growing global business and trade partnerships across China, where more than 150 Chicago-area companies have operations.In late 2014, the city of Chicago signed Gateway Cities Agreement with eight Chinese cities, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shenyang, Hangzhou, Wuhan and Chengdu.On July 15-23, 2019, World Business Chicago led a business mission to China to continue to strengthen economic ties and further implement the Gateway Cities Agreement. The mission stopped in Chengdu and Beijing, and met with Hainan Airlines leadership.China has for many years remained one of the top trade partners for US Midwestern states, as well as an important source of investment.In the first 11 months of 2018, Chinese tourists visiting Chicago increased by 2.1 percent over the same period of 2017, according to Choose Chicago statistics.Hainan Airlines now operates 12 air routes between China and the United States. Besides such metropolitan cities as Beijing and Shanghai in China and New York, Los Angeles and Chicago in the United States, the company has extended its presence to China's Chengdu and Chongqing cities, and Seattle, Boston and San Jose in the United States.
