                US House panel votes to ramp up Trump impeachment probe
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - The Democratic-led US House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted to intensify its investigation of Republican President Donald Trump on Thursday, as lawmakers edged closer to deciding whether to recommend his impeachment.The 41-member panel adopted a resolution allowing it to designate hearings as impeachment proceedings, subject witnesses to more aggressive questioning and quicken the pace of an investigation that is expanding into areas that could prove politically explosive for both Trump and Congress."With these new procedures, we will begin next week an aggressive series of hearings investigating allegations of corruption, obstruction and abuse of power against the president," House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler told reporters after a 24-17 vote along party lines.A more aggressive probe could also increase pressure on House Democratic leaders including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has resisted impeachment of Trump as a politically risky step for moderate Democratic freshmen from swing districts where ousting the president is an unpopular idea."Democrats have never gotten over the fact that I won the Election very fairly," Trump said in a statement posted to his Facebook page hours after the vote."If they go down the path of impeachment they will be dividing the nation! So ridiculous to even be talking about this subject when all of the crimes were committed by the other side," the president said.Trump and his Republicans allies charge that former US Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the Trump campaign's possible collusion stemmed from an earlier effort to sink his candidacy, and later his presidency, by former officials at the Justice Department.LEWANDOWSKI TESTIMONYRepublican lawmakers rejected the notion that the panel was pursuing an impeachment inquiry and dismissed the resolution as a "fantasy" intended to distract from Democrats' unwillingness to have the full House authorize a formal impeachment inquiry, as occurred during the Watergate era and the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton.Republicans said Democrats lacked the votes to obtain formal House authorization and denounced Thursday's action as a show intended to pander to Democratic voters who want Trump removed from office.Representative Doug Collins, the panel's top Republican, said the resolution simply reiterates powers that the committee has had all along."These rules are not new," he said. "This is to make you believe something is happening, more than what's actually happening."Nadler said that during the Watergate era, the House Judiciary Committee was already considering impeachment charges against then-President Richard Nixon and conducting a related probe when the House voted to authorize a formal inquiry.Committee Democrats plan to use the new tactics that allow an hour of questioning by committee lawyers of Corey Lewandowski, a close Trump confidant and one of his campaign managers in 2016. Lewandowski is due to appear before the panel next Tuesday for what may be a contentious hearing.Democrats expect his testimony to help lay out a charge of obstruction of justice. But they are also pursuing allegations of campaign finance violations, witness tampering and unlawful self-enrichment through his business ventures.Democrats aim to decide by the end of the year whether to recommend articles of impeachment against Trump to the full House. If approved by the chamber, the Republican-controlled Senate would be left to hold a trial and consider the president's ouster.A Reuters head count shows that 135 House Democrats back an impeachment inquiry. While that is a majority of the caucus, the number is well short of the 218 votes needed to pass a resolution.Only two American presidents have been impeached by the House: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Clinton in 1999. Neither was convicted by the Senate.Nixon resigned in 1974 after the House Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment against him, but before the full House voted on the matter.Reuters

                    Huawei CEO proposes negotiations with Washington
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei has proposed negotiations with the US Justice Department to resolve all outstanding issues between Washington and the telecom giant, according to New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman. In a column published online on Tuesday, headlined Huawei Has a Plan to Help End Its War With Trump, Friedman wrote that Ren made his comments during an interview with Friedman. "If the United States reaches out to us in good faith and promises to change their irrational approach to Huawei, then we are open to a dialogue," Ren told Friedman. "The US shouldn't try to destroy Huawei over something trivial. If the US feels we have done something wrong, then we can discuss it in good faith and find a reasonable solution." "There are no restrictions on what we would be willing to discuss with the Department of Justice," Friedman quoted Ren as saying. If the US still doesn't trust Huawei to install its equipment across the US at scale, said Ren, then he is also ready, for the first time, to license the entire Huawei 5G platform to any US company that wants to manufacture, install and operate it completely independent of Huawei. Ren said that Huawei is "open to sharing our 5G technologies and techniques with US companies, so that they can build up their own 5G industry. That would create a balanced situation between China, the US and Europe". But he added: "The US side has to accept us at some level for that to happen." US companies "can also modify our 5G technologies to meet their security requirements". They can even "change the software code. In that case, the US will be assured of information security". Microsoft President Brad Smith told Bloomberg Businessweek magazine on Monday that when his company pressed regulators for an explanation of the Huawei ban, "oftentimes, what we get in response is, 'Well, if you knew what we knew, you would agree with us.' And our answer is, 'Great, show us what you know, so we can decide for ourselves.'" "If Huawei really is a bad actor, let's get the proof out there and blacklist the hell out of it. If it's not so clear, the (President) Trump team should at least explore Ren's offer to see if there is a pathway for Huawei to assure American intelligence experts and demonstrate good behavior," Friedman wrote. aiheping@chinadailyusa.com (China Daily Global 09/12/2019 page6)

                    US Supreme Court backs Trump administration's tough asylum restrictions
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON -- The US Supreme Court late Wednesday permitted the Trump administration to enforce its tough asylum restrictions nationwide prohibiting migrants from seeking asylum in the United States.The rule, put forward by the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security on July 15, will disallow asylum application by migrants entering the United States through a third country without seeking protection there.The Trump administration said it was necessary to limit the number of Central American migrants crossing the US southern border via Mexico, citing "an unprecedented surge of" people enter the United States "illegally" and seek asylum when they are caught."BIG United States Supreme Court WIN for the Border on Asylum!" Trump tweeted after the Supreme Court announced the order.Among the nine Supreme Court Justices, Associate Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented the order. "Once again the Executive Branch has issued a rule that seeks to upend longstanding practices regarding refugees who seek shelter from persecution," Sotomayor wrote in her dissent.Sotomayor said asking green light to the rule is "an extraordinary request" from the administration to the Supreme Court. "Unfortunately, the Court acquiesces."The American Civil Liberty Union (ACLU), a nationwide non-profit organization that claims to defend the individual rights and liberties, also challenged the rule.The ACLU wrote in response to the Supreme Court's order, the current ban would eliminate virtually all asylum at the southern border, even at ports of entry, for everyone except Mexicans, who did not need to transit through a third country to reach the United States. "The court should not permit such a tectonic change to US asylum law."
