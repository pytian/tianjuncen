                China to play important role in meeting climate challenges: report
            </p>
            <p>
                NEW YORK - China would play an important role as the climate challenge looms, a report published this month shows.Named Guide to Chinese Climate Policy 2019 and authored by David Sandalow, an inaugural fellow at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, the report examines Chinese carbon dioxide emissions, domestic and foreign policies regarding climate change in 2018.It says that China has already played an important role in bringing down dramatically the cost of solar power and engaged in making electric vehicles. In 2018, China led the world in deployment of renewable energy, electric vehicles and nuclear power plants."The way China integrates climate change into economic development has the potential to be a model for many countries around the world" as many countries would like to emulate China's economic miracle with eyes closely on its development model, according to the report.At a panel discussion on Wednesday evening marking the release of the report, Sandalow said it is exciting to see China's announcement of the green projects at the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in April.

                California vows to fight Trump administration for clean air
            </a>
            <p>
                LOS ANGELES - On a fundraising stump through California on Wednesday, US President Donald Trump escalated his contentious relationship with the Golden State by authorizing the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to revoke California's waiver that allows it to establish its own safer standards for clean air and water.The political fallout was instantaneous.California Governor Gavin Newsom characterized Trump's latest decree-by-tweet as a "political vendetta" against California and deplored his attempt to threaten the health of Americans everywhere and interfere with California's right to protect their residents with safer air and water standards.The governor said in a statement that Trump's move "could have devastating consequences for our kids' health and the air we breathe, if California were to roll over. But we will not.""The Trump Administration is revoking California's Federal Waiver on emissions in order to produce far less expensive cars for the consumer," Trump said in a tweet on Wednesday.Newsom, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, and California Air Resources Board (CARB) Chair Mary Nichols and other civic leaders have vowed to fight this destructive move, contending that California's clean air and water standards are essential to protecting the health and safety of millions of Californians and addressing the escalating climate crisis."As President Trump arrives in California to rake in campaign cash, his Administration is preparing to announce his desperate plan to rob our state of its long-standing authority to set vehicle emissions standards," warned Becerra. "To those who claim to support states' rights -- don't trample on ours."Under the federal Clean Air Act, California is the only state permitted to set their own emissions standards, subject to a waiver from the EPA. Other states may elect to follow California's stricter standards or the less stringent federal standards, but may not set their own. To date, thirteen US states, the District of Columbia, and the province of Quebec in Canada have chosen to adopt CARB standards.Becerra added: "We can't afford to backslide to the days of dirty air and unregulated emissions. For us, this is about survival. When you endanger our people, our economy, or our planet, we rise with the full force of the law behind us."Historically, smog has been a uniquely challenging problem in California cities due to the state's unusual combination of geography, weather systems, automotive culture, and dense population growth. As far back as 1943, residents of Los Angeles and San Francisco experienced episodes of smog that caused burning lungs, nausea, and eyes ailments and forced many residents to wear masks to protect them from the toxic air.California Air Resources Board, California's clean air agency, was formed in 1967 to be responsible for researching and establishing the state's vehicle emissions standards, attaining and maintaining healthy air quality; protecting the public from exposure to toxic air contaminants; and providing innovative and affordable approaches for complying with air pollution rules and regulations."For the first time in its 50-year history, the US Environmental Protection Agency is trying to stop states from taking reasonable actions to cut smog," said CARB Chairperson, Mary D. Nichols."Shame on the Trump Administration for putting the health of millions of its citizens at risk for absolutely no reason," she admonished.For Dan Jacobson, director of the Environment California Research and Policy Center, the outlook was grim. He told Xinhua that the roll-back will mean, "More kids with asthma, more premature deaths caused by air pollution, and more global warming ..."He was more optimistic about a win for California in the courts, noting "it is a fact that the environmental argument, the public health argument and most of the business arguments are on our side."A scientific study published last year in America's leading medical publication, the Journal of the American Medical Association, predicted that Trump's roll-back of environmental protections were likely to "cost the lives of over 80,000 US residents per decade and lead to respiratory problems for many more than 1 million people."A recent survey by the Public Policy Institute of California on Californians and the Environment showed that a whopping 72 percent of California adults and likely voters favor the new state law mandating reductions in greenhouse gases."While the White House is abdicating its responsibility to the rest of the world on cutting emissions and fighting global warming, California is stepping up," said Governor Newsom.

                Foreign companies still eye China for business growth
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - Foreign-invested companies voice optimism about the Chinese market, stressing its irreplaceable role in their businesses and pledging further investment in the world's second-largest economy.In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Rachel Duan, president and CEO of General Electric's Global Growth Organization, said China has always been the company's key strategic market since it started doing business here as early as 1906."No matter in the early 20th century or now, the Chinese market has long been an important part of the global economy and will become a key engine for GE's future development," Duan said."For any company, China is a strategic market that cannot be ignored," she declared, noting that "it is a privilege that GE is a participator, witness and beneficiary of China's social and economic development."Despite US-China trade tensions, the value of orders that GE received in China exceeded $8 billion last year. The company has also announced it will open a new offshore wind factory in the city of Jieyang and establish a new operation and development center in Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong province, in a bid to meet China's growing demand for offshore wind energy.GE is just one of the many foreign companies that remain bullish about the Chinese market. Vanguard Group, the world's biggest provider of mutual funds, considers China as one of the most crucial and indispensable markets worldwide."Vanguard has firm confidence and determination about taking root in China in the long run, and the company is committed to participating in the opening-up of China's financial markets," said Charles Lin, CEO of Vanguard Asia and chairman of Vanguard Investment Management (Shanghai) Ltd.Despite a short history of a little more than 30 years, China's capital market has developed rapidly and demonstrated great potential. "China is currently the world's third-largest stock and bond market, so we are very optimistic about China's capital market and we will grow alongside its development," Lin told Xinhua.He said he believes that China's financial markets will become more and more open and the current pace of opening-up is much faster than expected."China's financial and asset management markets are full of vitality and opportunity. As individual investors' demand for wealth management keeps growing and regulatory authorities continue to introduce proactive and open policies, the markets will be provided even bigger boosts," Lin noted.The latest statistics reinforced the view that China remains a magnet for foreign direct investment (FDI). FDI expanded 6.9 percent year on year to 604 billion yuan in the first eight months. In US dollar terms, FDI inflow grew 3.2 percent year on year to 89.26 billion dollars.These gains were hard-earned given the global FDI flows had declined for three consecutive years. In 2018, global FDI went down 13 percent, and developed countries saw the lowest FDI inflow since 2004, according to the World Investment Report 2019 published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai said in its recently-released 2019 China Business Report that more than 47 percent of the respondents to a survey expect to increase their investment in China this year.The respondents also reported an improving regulatory environment and significant signs of progress in the country's operational environment for foreign companies.

                Escalating violence in SAR reveals Western media's ill intentions: China Daily editorial
            </a>
            <p>
                Violence has continued unabated in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region even as Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor is actively building a platform for dialogue in a bid to foster cohesiveness in society and find ways to bring the city back to the development track.That the demonstrators refuse to end the violence and some Western media outlets continue to ignore their unlawful acts shows there is more to the demonstrations than meets the eye.Although the numbers of demonstrators and riots have declined over the past few weeks, probably because of the public fury over the serious disruption of normal life and economic activities, the intensity of the violence has been on the rise.Recent weeks have seen a surge in gasoline bomb attacks on police officers. The situation worsened over the weekend when the radical demonstrators targeted police vehicles with more such bombs. Some even tried to snatch the service revolvers from the police officers.Yet law enforcement officers are not the only targets of the insurrectionists. On Sunday, the demonstrators again vandalized a subway station, smashing closed-circuit cameras and electronic sensors.Such has been the impact of the demonstrations and violence on residents' lives and livelihoods that the silent majority in the SAR has decided to speak out against the mayhem. Saying enough is enough, many among the silent majority are openly protesting against the demonstrators and their unlawful behaviors.The demonstrators' outrageous acts have been captured in photographs published in those local newspapers that still adhere to professional ethics and in news video clips posted online.Such visual evidence speaks louder than words about the crimes committed by the radical demonstrators. Which makes one wonder how some foreign media outlets, eschewing their conscience and journalistic ethics, could still publish biased news reports and commentaries claiming the rioters are fighting for "freedom" and "democracy" when they are doing exactly the opposite — by violating other Hong Kong residents' rights and freedom.On Friday, the Hong Kong Police Force briefed the foreign media about the grim situation they are facing and rebutted unfounded accusations against them.If some Western media outlets continue to disseminate their one-sided views even after this, they will only further expose their prejudice against China and "one country, two systems".Unfortunately, the fact is that the anti-China "ideology" is the underlying cause of the violent demonstrations, which some Western media outlets are encouraging to wreak havoc in the city and help the demonstrators seize the power to govern the Hong Kong SAR and thus curb China's rise.But if they believe they will succeed in their evil design, they are living in a fool's paradise.
