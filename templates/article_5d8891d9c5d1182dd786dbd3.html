                Philippine president says never allow US to deploy missiles in his country
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                MANILA - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte declared that his country would never allow the United States to deploy missile systems on its soil.Although there exists the Mutual Defense Treaty between the Philippines and the United States, Duterte said late on Tuesday that he would bar the entry of foreign weapons, including nuclear arsenal in the country since this is considered a violation of the Philippine Constitution."There's an item in the newspaper that they are going to place some ballistic mid-range (missiles). That can never happen," Duterte said before a gathering of Filipino-Chinese business leaders at Malacanang, the presidential palace."That will never happen because I will not allow (it) because it's also a violation of the Constitution. You cannot place nuclear arms in the Philippines," Duterte added.Moreover, he said he would not allow any "foreign troops" in the country.The United States formally withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with Russia on Aug 2, which was signed by the former Soviet Union and the United States back in 1987.Right after pulling out of the INF treaty, the United States is seeking deployment of its mid-range missiles in the Asia-Pacific region.On Friday last week, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters in Sydney that he wants to deploy an intermediate-range conventional missile in the Asia-Pacific region within months.

                    Protesters paralyze airport as HKSAR chief executive appeals for end to violence
                </p>

                HONG KONG - Protesters created chaos at the Hong Kong International Airport for the second day on Tuesday, causing cancellations of most outbound flights at one of the busiest airports in the world.All check-in services for departure flights were suspended starting at 4:30 pm, the Airport Authority Hong Kong said in a statement after protesters occupied the airport terminal and prevented passengers from departing.Footage aired by a local broadcaster showed some protesters grab passengers' arms, preventing them from passing through checkpoints.As of 3 pm, 188 arriving and 182 departing flights scheduled on Tuesday had been canceled due to the protests, according to the airport authority.It was the second day of chaos at the airport caused by protests, leaving many stranded passengers visibly annoyed."Unfortunately with the chaos, we are stuck here in the airport," said a Filipino passenger named Bennet. "No food and no drinks at all. Most of the restaurants are closed."A passenger from the Chinese mainland said she considered flying from Shenzhen instead. "I don't know when this will end," she said."They (protesters) are damaging Hong Kong's business environment and image," said the passenger surnamed Gao. "I love Hong Kong, but I feel sorry for those young people who have been incited and used."A heavy priceFrank Chan Fan, secretary for transport and housing of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government, said paralyzing the airport will make Hong Kong "pay a heavy price.""Amid fierce regional competition, it is very easy to destroy years of achievements the airport has accomplished, but rebuilding them would be very hard," Chan said.In 2018, the Hong Kong airport handled an average of 200,000 travelers each day, while trade via air accounted for nearly half of Hong Kong's total trade volume.In a joint statement on Tuesday, seven labor unions in the aviation industry of Hong Kong condemned the unpermitted demonstrations that have stained the international reputation of Hong Kong.The unions urged the protesters to stop all unlawful demonstrations and refrain from "gambling at the expense of Hong Kong's economic pillar."On Tuesday, HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the most urgent task now is to stop violence and safeguard the rule of law to prevent Hong Kong from sinking into "an abyss where it will be smashed to pieces."Lam said some people, in the name of freedom or justice, have been committing vandalism and damaging the rule of law, throwing Hong Kong into a state of panic.If violence persists, it will take a long time to restore the openness, freedom, inclusiveness and economic stability in Hong Kong, and the stable lives of seven million residents can not continue, Lam said.

                    Musical explores 'comfort women' plight
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                When Dimo Hyun Jun Kim proposed writing about "comfort women" in a playwright class in New York, he was surprised that no one had heard the term, which euphemistically describes young women forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II."No professor, no classmates [at the City University of New York] knew. They had never heard about the comfort women,'' he said.That's what made it more significant for the Comfort Women: A New Musical, directed and co-written by Kim, to reach a wide audience unfamiliar with the brutal experiences of some 400,000 women in Asia.From 1931 to 1945, the Japanese Army operated thousands of "comfort stations" that housed women from China, Korea and Southeast Asia. At least half of the victims were Chinese. Only one-fourth of the comfort women survived the war.The musical made a successful premiere in New York in July 2015, with the first all-Asian Off-Broadway cast led by an East Asian director, and a 2018 revival. It is being shown to West Coast audiences for the first time, from Aug 15-25 at the Los Angeles Theatre Center.Set in 1941, the story follows the plight of a young Korean woman named Goeun who is tricked into becoming a sexual slave under the false pretense of a good-paying job at a factory in Tokyo.Phyllis Kim is the executive director of Comfort Women Action for Redress & Education, a Glendale, California-based community organization that focuses on the advocacy for and education about "comfort women". She believes the play is a good way to explore a serious topic through music and performance."Of course, it's a creation and fiction, but the history itself was true," Kim said. "I think it's really important that we learn the history through great movies, like Schindler's List, about the Holocaust, or Anne Frank's diary. I think this is one of the ways to reach out to many different people who don't know about the history, a great way to learn about the history."Chinese scholars estimate that at least 200,000 Chinese women were kidnapped as sex slaves during the Japanese invasion of China in 1937.The women were subjected to "gang rape, forced abortions, humiliation, and sexual violence resulting in mutilation, death, or eventual suicide in one of the largest cases of human trafficking in the 20th century", stated a 2007 resolution introduced by former US congressman Mike Honda and passed by the US House of Representatives, which called on Japan to apologize to former "comfort women".Although Japan in 1993 acknowledged its role in the atrocities, some Japanese nationalists disputed that the women were forced into prostitution. A lot of surviving "comfort women", who are dwindling in number, said the apology by the Japanese government lacked sincerity.The matter has remained a sensitive one in foreign relations and the cause of friction between Japan and several Asian countries.Audience member Charles Smallwood, who attended a media preview of the musical on Aug 14, said he "had no idea they ("comfort women") were treated so harshly, and so disregarded as being humans"."It's a very difficult topic to a get across, but the way they did it was quite elegant and beautiful. It was quite disturbing at times, but it was also very beautiful at times, so I liked it very much," Smallwood said.Emma Magbanua, who plays Soonja Ma, a young woman captured with Goeun by the Japanese soldiers, said she was never exposed to the history while growing up until she heard about the musical and asked her aunt about it."I learned there was an entire group of people whose stories were neglected, who were left behind, who some people deemed as unworthy. … I think it's so interesting that because maybe it's censored because it has to do with sex, or maybe because of its involvement with different groups of people," said Magbanua, a Filipino-American."Something that really struck me was how in this situation, it's really about who do you acknowledge as important, ultimately, regardless of it being specifically about this Asian culture, even here, where we are now in, in our lives in America, currently, who are we deeming as less important, as less valuable, whose stories are we not listening to?" she added.Phyllis Kim said the musical is a "wonderful way" to teach younger generations about atrocities and to make sure that history doesn't repeat itself.The Japanese Consulate General in Los Angeles released the following statement, which was obtained on Aug 16 by LAist, a newsletter of events in Los Angeles:"The Government of Japan recognizes that the issue known as comfort women is one that severely injured the honor and dignity of many women. The Government of Japan has extended its sincere apologies and remorse to all those women known as comfort women who suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds."It went on to say that the Japanese government "will also continue its effort to ensure that Japan's views and efforts on the comfort women issue are properly recognized by the international community based on an objective understanding of relevant facts".

                    832 foreigners lose Japanese residency status
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                A record number of foreigners living in Japan were stripped of their residency status in 2018, data from the country's Immigration Services Agency showed, even as Japan is widening its doors to foreign workers.The immigration agency said on Wednesday that it revoked visas of 832 people last year, more than doubled the figure of a year earlier. Almost 70 percent of them were students and technical trainees who failed to follow visa requirements.By nationality, half of those who lost their residency status were Vietnamese. They were followed by 152 Chinese, 62 Nepalese and 43 Filipinos.Those who had their student status rescinded numbered 412, an increase from 172 in 2017. Meanwhile, 153 foreign workers had their technical trainee status revoked, up from eight in the year before.The number of residency revocations was the highest since 2005 when record-keeping began. According to the Japanese Justice Ministry, the most affected were people on student visas who quit their studies yet continued to work in Japan and technical trainees who abandoned their assigned jobs and were working elsewhere.Meanwhile, there were 80 cases in which a spouse or child of a Japanese national were deprived of their family member visas. Some had obtained their visas through fake marriages, the ministry said.As a nation with the world's fastest aging society coupled with a low birthrate, Japan adopted new immigration laws to attract foreign workers in certain sectors starting from April.However, with an increasing number of technical interns quitting jobs due to long-criticized "grim working conditions for foreigners", the government has also applied stricter standards for revoking visas since January 2017.The Japanese Justice Ministry can cancel a visa for a wide range of reasons, such as failure to report a change of address within 90 days of moving.Kazuyuki Motohari, an official from the Immigration Services Agency, said the Justice Ministry will further crack down on those who flout the law.Kyodo News contributed to this story.

                Melvin Chua, a 23-year-old Filipino boy, is awarded scholarship by the Chinese government this year and will leave for the Renmin University of China in Beijing to take up masters in business administration.

He has been doing this for 13 years and was given the nickname of "sponge boy."But soon, the "sponge boy" will walk the streets of China's capital city Beijing, after being awarded scholarship by the Chinese government this year. He and 79 other Philippine students will take up their study in several universities in China.Melvin got into the Renmin University of China, his first choice, to take up masters in business administration."Renmin University has a very good reputation so I really chose the university because I can feel in myself that Renmin can transform me personally and professionally," he told Xinhua.Aside from a chance to study abroad, Melvin is ecstatic to learn new things and also looks forward to getting to know China's culture and development which have impressed him for years."What really fascinates me and what influenced my decision to go there is because of the fast development of China. It will be very beneficial for other countries to take this opportunity to learn from Chinese people, how they transformed their lives", he added.Before his journey to China, Melvin once again took up a basket and hawked dish sponges on the streets of Pembo on Saturday. His perseverance and cheerful disposition endeared him to plenty of familiar customers.However, unknown to most of his customers, Melvin has a difficult childhood.Born into a poverty-stricken family, Melvin is the second of six children. He helped his mother, a single parent, put food on the table at a very young tender age.He started to sell dish sponges to support his family when he was 8. As a little boy, he would go alone to a large commercial center in Manila, to buy dish sponges in bulk which he would later sell to neighbors in the area, while also finding the time to study for school.

                    Where tradition and innovation go hand in hand

                I grew up with my early childhood memories of China consisting of images picked up from TV shows, movies, textbooks, and photographs seen in encyclopedias and National Geographic magazines. It was an exotic, picturesque and mysterious China in my mind. Most of the information I picked up showed me the vastness of the country, the beautiful imagery connoting an even more beautiful history and culture.Of course as a young and imaginative boy, China to me was also the land of kung fu and the homeof many martial arts. Who could ever forget Bruce Lee and those kung fu shows of old, where dialogue and storyline was just ten percent, leaving the remaining ninety percent of the film with pure, adrenalin-filled, action-packed fight sequences – everything a young boy could ever dream of watching!In the Philippines, there are also many Chinese influences, as Filipinos have traded with the Chinese since ancient times. Both the oldest and the biggest China Towns in the world are located in the Philippines. China to me was also synonymous with delicious Cantonese-style food- steamed buns (siopao) dumplings (siomai), noodles (pancit Canton), and spring rolls (lumpiang Shanghai). So you see, many Filipinos know at least a few Chinese words, even though many have been picked up due to too much eating of good-quality and savory Chinese food.When I crossed paths with China in 2017, this time, I was a diplomat coming to Shanghai, to live, work and explore. Shanghai is the perfect example of how a country can be two things at once – ultra modern, and yet still with bits and pieces of culture and history spread all over the place. One can be blown away with the tallest towers in the world at the Bund, and then visit the historical and picturesque Yu Garden just a few blocks away.Mostly a cashless society now (where Alipay and Wechat pay is the norm), one can still find small hole-in-the wall restaurants serving local cuisine–and then scan the QR code to pay your bill. It was something I was not expecting to see–a high-tech China, where life can be of the utmost convenience due to technology.Nowadays China is showing the world its side as a leader in future trends and technological innovation. It is not that China has turned its back on the image in many people’s hearts – that of a country deeply mired and rooted in its history–but it is now looking forward and has progressed to improve and innovate for the welfare of its people and to ensure that it can continue to forge a lasting legacy.Alibaba and Tencent Holdings are just two of the many innovative companies that have sprung up in China and contributed to technological advancements in ordinary, everyday, processes in people’s lives. Many more companies and startups are being built every day in China with their minds bent on improving products and processes and with the ultimate goal of improving societal gains.Truly China today is immensely different from the images gathered from my childhood. Some may disparagingly say that modern advancement may come at too steep a price, and development may hinder cultural and historical appreciation.However as long as China finds the right balance in sharing with the world both its technological advancements and the beauty of its culture, history and heritage, then it can assure itself of a place in people’s hearts.The author is the commercial consul at the Philippine Trade and Investment Center Shanghai.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.
