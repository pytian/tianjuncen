                LOS ANGELES - Chinese box-office juggernaut Ne Zha, the highest-grossing animated film ever by China, brought in more than $363,000 in its third weekend in North America, pushing its North American collections to $3.3 million.According to Box Office tracker Box Office Mojo, the film, adapted from an ancient Chinese myth, grossed $363,432 from 126 locations in the United States through Sunday with a modest $2,884 per-theater average, ranking the 23rd on the weekend box-office chart.Well Go USA Entertainment released the Mandarin-language film with English and Chinese subtitles in select 3D IMAX theaters across the United States and Canada on Aug 29, followed by other theaters on Sept 6.The film collected $1.49 million from 66 locations with a strong $22,528 per-theater average in its North American debut weekend.Jason Pfardrescher, executive vice-president of Well Go USA, told Xinhua News Agency earlier that the company had lofty expectations for the North American release of Ne Zha, adding that the film had the potential to reach $10 million at the box office in North America.Movie analyst Paul Dergarabedian at Comscore said that the success of the film in strategically planned limited release in its opening weekend was encouraging. He added that it would be hard to predict whether the film could win the hearts of nationwide audiences if expanded onto a significant number of screens.Earlier this year, Chinese homegrown science fiction blockbuster The Wandering Earth grossed $5.87 million in North America, the highest-grossing Chinese film in the region for the past five years.Ne Zha rose to No 2 in the box office earlier this month for all films ever screened on the Chinese mainland, second only to Wolf Warrior 2. Data from China's movie-ticketing platform Maoyan showed that Ne Zha grossed around 4.9 billion yuan ($691 million) to date since its July 26 debut on the Chinese mainland.Directed and written by Yang Yu (stage name Jiao Zi) in his feature film directorial debut, this homegrown animation features a popular young hero from ancient Chinese legends and classics such as Journey to the West.In the story, Ne Zha, born with unique powers, finds himself an outcast who is hated and feared; destined by prophecy to devastate the world, the boy must choose between good and evil to break the shackles of fate and become the hero he wants to be.In a video clip tweeted by Well Go USA, Jiao Zi shared his excitement with American moviegoers about the film's release in the United States."A hero from the East has come across the ocean," he said, encouraging animation fans to go and see the film.Reviews from a few local critics were quite positive. Michael Rechtshaffen, a film critic for the Los Angeles Times, wrote that the film brought "an empowering message to America"."Grafting familiar Disney and DreamWorks tropes onto a tapestry of traditional Chinese legend and lore, the adventure entertains with a title character who could be the spawn of Chucky and Stitch, from Lilo& Stitch," he added."Ne Zha leads up to a soaring finale, both with glorious large-scale action that may remind you of The Matrix Revolutions and with an emotional 'oomph' that makes sure that the fireworks matter. The whole thing is a visual spectacular (the dragons are amazing), with glorious imagery that popped on the IMAX 3D screen," commented film critic Scott Mendelson for Forbes.On the US review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Ne Zha held an approval rating of 82 percent and an audience score of 98 percent as of Tuesday.Liu Yukun contributed to this story.

                    Capital's goal to expand reform: boost science and technology
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Tourism, education, and healthcare will also benefit from new measures, officials say Beijing has recently released an action plan to expand reform and opening-up in the city's service industry for more foreign investment and international cooperation, according to the city's commerce bureau. The capital city will focus on expanding opening-up in major fields including science and technology, finance, education, cultural tourism and healthcare, according to the plan. "Beijing is the first and only pilot city to expand opening-up in the service industry nationwide," said Yan Ligang, head of the Beijing Commerce Bureau. It has attracted high-end international resources, which helped create an open environment and lay a solid foundation for the city to carry out a range of reforms, Yan said. The three-year action plan consists of eight major fields with 190 measures, instructing eight relevant departments to conduct pilot measurement. These departments include the Beijing Science and Technology Commission, the Beijing Bureau of Economy and Information Technology, the Beijing Local Financial Supervision and Administration, the Beijing Education Commission, the Beijing Culture and Tourism Bureau and the Beijing Commission of Development and Reform. In the next three years, the city will seek breakthroughs in policy reform and industrial innovation, which includes reforming institutional business registrations, optimization of the funding environment for companies and the rolling out of preferential policies. The action plan also features the launch of major projects and Beijing will promote the construction of international communities and establish a sound environment for the service industry following international standards, Yan said. In addition, the city will set up a one-stop service center for foreign professionals and establish an online platform for a national scientific research innovation center. Wang Jianxin, an official of the Beijing Science and Technology Commission, said the commission would engage in introducing overseas technological talents, offering customs conveniences for technology companies, supporting companies in building an automotive test and development center and rolling out regulations to promote the commercialization of science and technology. "We will cooperate with related departments to mobilize high-end scientific research resources and strengthen international exchanges to contribute more to the construction of an innovation center with a global influence in Beijing," Wang said. From January to June, 755 foreign-invested companies involved in the service sector opened for business in Beijing, and the amount of foreign capital utilized was $8.59 billion. The added value of the service industry accounted for 82.8 percent of the city's GDP during the period. Li Yan, deputy head of the Beijing Local Financial Supervision and Administration, said Beijing has an edge in expanding opening-up in the financial sector with many financial institutions, large markets and outstanding innovation capabilities. The city plans to ease market access of various financial institutions and conduct measures such as expanding pilot projects for cross-border investment and financing and launching international exchanges and cooperation in green finance and financial technologies. "We will take stronger financial measures to serve the demands of financial institutions in the next three years," Li said. Beijing will expand the supply of international education services, cultivate educational pilot projects and expand its educational scale by 2021. Beijing should further optimize the layout and structure of international education, said Huang Kan, deputy director of the Beijing Education Commission. By 2021, the city is set to build 11 new international schools in Chaoyang district, Haidian district and other talent concentration areas. It is expected to build 50 new schools qualified to accept foreign students, and there will 330 schools eligible to receive international students in 16 districts in the city. It will also support 40 local schools to establish national talent cultivation bases under the Belt and Road Initiative. liangkaiyan@chinadaily.com.cn   An intelligent robot developed by foreign high-tech enterprises is displayed at the 2019 World Robot Conference in Yizhuang economic development zone in Daxing district, Beijing.Provided To China Daily(China Daily 09/19/2019 page10)

                    Overseas study no longer only for the elite

                In recent decades, millions of Chinese have attended schools and colleges in other countries. Zou Shuo reports.Editor's note: To celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we will publish a series of stories reflecting on changes and developments in fields such as law, education, transportation and the environment. This is the third in the series."My son has been enrolled by a university in the United States.""I will go to a Canadian university as a visiting scholar next month." "It's so hard to find a job in Europe, so I will return to China after I graduate."Sentiments such as these have become increasingly common among Chinese students as the country's economic growth and rising income levels mean that going overseas to study is no longer only for the elite.As the country further opens up to the world, going abroad to study has become a common activity, with self-funded students accounting for the majority of those heading overseas.Last year, 662,100 Chinese went abroad to study, a rise of 8.83 percent from 2017, according to the Ministry of Education, which added that 90 percent of the students were self-supporting and only 65,800 received public funding.According to a report in May by Vision Overseas Consulting Co, a subsidiary of New Oriental Education and Technology Group, and Kantar Millward Brown, most parents whose children want to study overseas hold regular jobs, accounting for 43 percent of the total, a rise of 14 percentage points from 2015.Middle-level managers accounted for 35 percent of the parents, while 22 percent were high-level executives.It also found that the main reasons students choose to study overseas included expanding their horizons, enriching their life experience and improving their employment prospects and language skills.

                    Canada's Trudeau apologizes for dressing up in brown face, election chances could suffer
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                OTTAWA - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized on Wednesday for wearing brown face make-up in 2001 after an embarrassing picture emerged less than five weeks before an election in which he faces a tough fight.The image of a 29-year-old Trudeau with his face in dark make-up is a major challenge for a leader who often speaks about the need to fight racial discrimination and who has three prominent ministers of Indian descent in his cabinet."I should have known better then, but I didn't and I did it and I'm deeply sorry," Trudeau, 47, told reporters on his campaign plane in Halifax, Nova Scotia, after Time magazine published the image.Time said the image was provided by Vancouver businessman Michael Adamson earlier this month. Adamson was part of the West Point Grey Academy community where Trudeau, then 29, worked at the time, the magazine said. The picture was in the Vancouver private school's yearbook."I dressed up in an Aladdin costume and put make-up on. I shouldn't have done it," Trudeau said in comments carried live on Canadian television.The picture shows him wearing a turban and a white robe, with his face covered in dark makeup.Trudeau, questioned by reporters, also admitted he had dressed up in make-up when at high school and performed "Day O", a traditional Jamaican song about people loading bananas onto boats.Trudeau is locked in a tight battle with Conservative leader Andrew Scheer ahead of the Oct 21 federal election.Scheer said he was "extremely shocked and disappointed" by the photo."Wearing brown face is an act of open mockery and racism. What Canadians saw this evening is someone with a complete lack of judgment and integrity and someone who's not fit to govern this country," he told reporters in Quebec.Trudeau has seen his once sky-high popularity hurt by a series of missteps, including a ruling last month by a top watchdog that he had breached ethics rules by pressuring the former justice minister to ensure a major construction firm avoid a corruption trial. Reuters

                    Firm eyes overseas demand for better Chinese education
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                Zhuge Academy, one of the major Chinese education brands owned by Lanxum Inc, will quicken its overseas expansion to meet the rapidly growing demand for better Chinese education."We will consider entering the Asian and Middle Eastern markets after opening campuses in Canada and the US," said Shang Mei, head of international business for Zhuge Academy.The academy just opened a campus in Silicon Valley on Sept 8 (US time), its second one overseas after establishing the first in Canada in 2018. "Our quick overseas expansion is in line with the fast-growing demand for quality Chinese education overseas," Shang added.US demographic data as of 2018 shows that California is now home to a Chinese population of more than 1.8 million, of which 200,000 live in the San Francisco Bay Area.Many Chinese parents want to see their children gain proficiency in Chinese language and become acquainted with the great works of Chinese literature.Lanxum was the first Chinese learning organization to teach literary history to adolescents. And Zhuge Academy is Lanxum's overseas platform for its proprietary Mega Chinese study program. The approach for Mega Chinese is based on reforms in China's educational system, which has taken a much more holistic approach to how Chinese is taught in the country's schools."We are contacting partners in Singapore and Australia for possible cooperation but there are no specific details to disclose so far," said Zhu.The brand will provide professional and engaging Chinese education products to school-age children. In June 2018, the company announced a plan to set up an overseas subsidiary, Lanxum (USA) Limited, with operating capital of $10 million. Lanxum plans to focus on building its education portfolio around the Mega Chinese model, while continuing its exploration and development of additional markets throughout the world.Wang Jiaqi contributed to this story.
