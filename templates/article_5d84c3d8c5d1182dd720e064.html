                WELLINGTON - A photo exhibition on China's education development kicked off here Monday at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand.The exhibition covers four major areas of content, including the advancement of Chinese higher education, the current development of the selected Chinese universities, the international cooperation between overseas and Chinese universities, and New Zealand students' experience of studying in China.The exhibition, one of a series of celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, shows the great achievement of the higher education in China in the last 70 years, especially since the reform and open up in late 1970s, said Dong Zhixue, the counselor of the education office of the Chinese embassy in New Zealand.The exhibition shows the development on academic research and international education communication and cooperation of Chinese universities, said Dong, adding that more New Zealand students are encouraged to study in China to promote the communication between the two countries.Top Universities from China, such as Tsinghua University, Peking University and Xi'an Jiaotong University have participated in the exhibition.The exhibition is running from Sept 16 to Oct 4.

                Chinese artists bring joy of Moon Festival to New Zealand audience
            </a>
            <p>
                WELLINGTON -- The Ode To The Moon Festival Gala between New Zealand and China was held with high quality performances to celebrate this year's Mid-Autumn Festival at the New Zealand National Museum on Sunday night.The Gala, co-hosted by the China Cultural Center in Wellington, the Chongqing Municipal Commission of Culture and Tourism and the Chongqing International Culture and Tourism Exchange Center, was part of the China-New Zealand Year of Tourism.Artists from southwestern China's Chongqing Three Gorges Operatic Troupe presented the Wellington audience with Sichuan Opera Performance with Face-changing, Pipa Solo, classic songs, festive songs, dances, stunning magic show, as well as Bamboo Qin show, a national-rated non-material cultural legacy in China.The performances by the Chinese artists perfectly showed the charm of Chinese culture and art to the audience. During the performance, applause and cheers came one after another.Guo Zongguang, director of the China Cultural Center in New Zealand, stressed that this show was one the most important events in this year's cultural exchanges between China and New Zealand."Our Ode to the Moon series is one of the three "tentpole" events in our yearly calendar, along with Happy Chinese New Year at the beginning of the year and China Culture Week in the middle of the year. The Ode to the Moon series of events are simultaneously celebrated by nearly 40 other China Cultural Centres around the world, helping connect and bring us all closer," said Guo.Brett Hudson, a member of Parliament, acknowledged that China, now New Zealand's largest trading partner, provided New Zealanders "thousands and thousands of jobs.""Our relationship with China is extremely important. Our two-way trade now tops 28 billion New Zealand dollars (17.86 billion U.S. dollars) in 2018, that is thousands and thousands of jobs for New Zealanders to improve life styles for families, because we have a strong relationship, and it is strengthening even further through cultural exchange and better understanding of one another," Hudson said.The Moon Festival, or the Mid-Autumn Festival, is a harvest festival celebrated in China and usually falls in September or October, on the 15th day of the eighth month of the Chinese lunar calendar.

                China's export container shipping index edges up in August
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - China's index of export container transport saw an overall increase in August due to a favorable supply-demand relationship, according to the Shanghai Shipping Exchange (SSE).The average China Containerized Freight Index (CCFI) jumped 1.2 percent month-on-month to stand at 826.6 points last month, the SSE said in a statement.In the first eight months of 2019, the index averaged 826.42, up from 817.8 points for 2018.The freight rates of most routes were raised, buoying the container transport market last month.In August, the Australia/New Zealand route and Mediterranean route saw their sub-indexes soar by 9.1 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively.Bucking the upward trend, the sub-index for the Persian Gulf/Red Sea route dropped the most by 6.8 percent.The CCFI tracks spot and contractual freight rates from Chinese container ports for 12 shipping routes across the globe, based on data from 20 international carriers.The index was set at 1,000 on Jan 1, 1998.

                Mengniu in $1 billion Bellamy bid
            </a>
            <p>
                Chinese dairy giant aims to gain further access to lucrative overseas marketsChina's dairy giant Mengniu announced on Monday it had made an acquisition offer to Australian infant formula producer Bellamy in a deal valued at $1 billion, to further penetrate the infant formula and food market while expanding its reach overseas.Hong Kong-listed Mengniu said it proposed to acquire 100 percent of the issued share capital of Bellamy Australia Limited.Under the proposed deal, Mengniu would pay A$12.65 ($8.69) per share plus a shareholder dividend, marking a 59 percent premium on Bellamy's closing price.Bellamy's share price soared by 54.9 percent on Monday to a peak of A$12.98.Bellamy Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Cohen, said: "Mengniu is a preeminent dairy company in China and an ideal partner for our business. It offers a strong platform for distribution and success in China, and a foundation for growth in the organic dairy and food industry in Australia."Mengniu Chief Executive Officer Lu Minfang said: "Bellamy's leading organic brand position and Bellamy's local operation and supply-chain are critical to Mengniu."According to Euromonitor International, China's milk formula market is growing steadily and fast from $23.9 billion in 2018 to a forecast of $32 billion in 2024.Nestle, Feihe International Inc and Danone are top three in the sector in 2019, while Mengniu and Bellamy ranked 12th and 24th respectively.Song Liang, an independent dairy analyst, said the move shows Mengniu's strong ambition to penetrate into the organic dairy market, which is booming in China and it is also a chance to build an infant and baby nutrition and food system.The possible takeover of Bellamy is also an entry ticket for Mengniu to expand its supply chain and capital operations in Australia.In July, Mengniu agreed to sell all of its 51 percent holding in baby formula and yogurt maker Shijiazhuang Junlebao Dairy Co Ltd as it seeks to concentrate on its core business. In 2018, Junlebao contributed 13.6 percent of Mengniu's revenue and 9.58 percent of its profits.For Bellamy, the deal is vital for entry into China's formula market, as the Australian brand has not been eligible for infant and baby formula registration in China. It means it cannot manufacture or sell such formula in China. Its 2019 fiscal report shows that Bellamy's revenue was A$266 million, down 19 percent.Bellamy is likely to benefit from the acquisition of dairy manufacturer Burra Foods in 2016 by Mengniu. Bellamy and Burra are both Australian companies and the latter can provide OEM service to the former, said Miranda Zhou, an analyst at Euromonitor International.China's dairy industry has been expanding its reach to global markets in recent years.Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group－the largest dairy producer in China and Asia－has prioritized global dairy resource security capacity and a management team with global vision, covering areas including raw materials, global cooperation and overseas dairy source development, as well as an international management team.In August, Yili acquired New Zealand's second-largest dairy cooperative Westland Co-operative Dairy Co Ltd after finally clearing all the regulatory hurdles.Yili products are sold under more than 1,000 brands and Yili owns more than 130 branches or subsidiaries. Yili acquired Oceania Dairy Group of New Zealand in 2013. It has since invested approximately $660 million in establishing milk powder, infant formula and UHT production lines for Oceania.

                Global businesses to thrive and benefit from CIIE
            </a>
            <p>
                SHANGHAI－In a small town with a population of less than 320,000 in Northwest China, Wang Gang was surprised to find the same imported milk brand he saw at the first China International Import Expo (CIIE) last November.The milk was produced by New Zealand brand Theland, having taken only three months to go from the CIIE to local supermarkets in the otherwise remote area."Thanks to the CIIE, imported commodities, especially food, now have access to more Chinese residents in small cities and towns," said Sheng Wenhao, chairman of the board of Theland New Cloud.During the mid-year sales promotion of Tmall, the online shopping platform of Alibaba, nearly 80 percent of consumers of Theland's UHT Protein 4.0 were from China's third-to fifth-tier cities."China's consumption has huge potential," Sheng said.On Saturday, the countdown to the second CIIE stood at 50 days. As China steps up its promotion of the fruitful results in the first CIIE, global enterprises are looking forward to fresh opportunities brought on by a more open and freer market.As one of the star exhibitors at the first CIIE, LEGO opened its first certified store in Northwest China in July to expand business in the country's inland and lower-tier cities.Paul Huang, senior vice-president of the LEGO Group and general manager of LEGO China, said China was an important strategic development market for the group."We are confident in the future development of our business in China and expect to have around 140 retail stores in more than 35 cities by the end of this year," Huang said.The huge market potential was not the only attraction for global enterprises, given the country has introduced more opening-up policies in several fields and industries.This could be seen in the fact that in just 72 hours, a batch of fresh milk from a New Zealand farm can reach Chinese breakfast tables."Customs clearance time has been greatly shortened. It used to take eight days, more than half of the milk's shelf life," Sheng said.Thanks to such favorable policies, the import volume of Theland fresh milk has expanded to 30,000 bottles per week from 3,000 bottles, with the highest weekly sales reaching 80,000 bottles after the first CIIE.The acceleration of reforms has also been seen in the field of medical devices and pharmaceuticals.The Leksell Gamma Knife Icon by Swedish medical equipment producer Elekta made its debut in China at last year's CIIE. The cutting-edge instrument has been put into use in Shanghai since February, serving more than 2,000 patients so far, said Pan Li, vice-president of Shanghai Gamma Knife Hospital."The CIIE brought the world's top medical technologies and professional procurement groups together," said Li Bin, a senior official with Shanghai Shen Kang Hospital Development Center, a State-owned institute responsible for the investment, management and operation of State-owned medical assets.So far, 28 of the 33 pieces of imported large-scale medical equipment purchased at the first CIIE have been installed and put into use in Shanghai's public medical institutions.Rounds of new opening-up policies this year provided more impetus for foreign companies to upgrade their investment in China.In June, China rolled out a revised negative list for foreign investment market access, introducing greater openness in the manufacturing and service industries.China issued an overall plan last month for the new Lingang area of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone, which will be built into a special economic zone to better serve the country's overall opening-up strategy.

                Affordable solutions better than exaggerations
            </a>
            <p>
                Ahead of the Climate Action Summit that will bring together world leaders in New York on Sept 23, exaggeration about global warming is greater than ever. While some pundits continue, incorrectly, to insist that global warming is a made-up story, far more insist, also incorrectly, that we face an imminent climate crisis.Adding to the polarization on the topic makes it impossible to engage in sensible policy discussion. For example, we are constantly told that climate change is to blame for an increase in extreme weather conditions such as flooding, droughts and cyclones. But the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has found the evidence does not support claims that floods, droughts and cyclones are increasing.The scientists have said, "there is low confidence in a global-scale observed trend" in drought, a "lack of evidence regarding the sign of trend in the magnitude and/or frequency of floods on a global scale" and "no significant observed trends in global (cyclone) frequency over the past century."
