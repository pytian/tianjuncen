                            In a nutshell I just want to say that, after working in the hospital and attending so many local and international conferences here in China, one thing that just comes to my realization is that in spite of having some language barriers, China is definitely doing awesome work in the health sector, which can easily make some other countries envious of China. So, I believe China is doing great in this sector as well and we are also getting used to how we can improve ourselves, which only became possible by coming to China. The Chinese government is making it possible for us by offering thousands of government and local scholarships every year in almost every field, which is eventually a golden chance for us

In an article published in July 2018, I stated that the "trade war" that the US administration was going to start would put in peril not only the economies of both the US and China, but the economies of the entire world. In this sense, the International Monetary Fund had already predicted in October that a full-blown trade conflict between the US and China would put a significant dent in the global economic recovery

                            The New York Times reported in April that as many as 30 Chinese professors regarded as experts in China-US relations, had their visas to the US cancelled in the past year, or put on administrative review.The top US journal for the sector, The Chronicle of Higher Education, has said that anxiety over a so-called "Trump effect", linked to his travel bans and anti-foreigner rhetoric, could block top students and scholars from going to the US and damage the standing of its higher education.President Donald Trump's protectionist trade conflict with Beijing has recently spilled over into academia with the dismissal and even detention of scientists with Chinese links who have long worked and studied in the United States

According to the Japanese Justice Ministry, the most affected were people on student visas who quit their studies yet continued to work in Japan and technical trainees who abandoned their assigned jobs and were working elsewhere.However, with an increasing number of technical interns quitting jobs due to long-criticized "grim working conditions for foreigners", the government has also applied stricter standards for revoking visas since January 2017

Both initiatives have enabled Chinese investment and loans in Africa to give priority to development projects and, through Chinese loans, have for the first time enabled African governments to turn the continent's resources advantage into a development advantage. Since Africa is yet to climb the value chain of mineral processing and manufacturing, the assistance in building up local capacity could have a much greater impact on developing skills in African economies if it were closely aligned with African economic potential and priority sectors, such as manufacturing
