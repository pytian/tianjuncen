Often compared to Romeo and Juliet, The Peony Pavilion is one of the most famous love stories in all of Chinese literature. A story of lovers pitted against impossible odds, the ballet features an eclectic and original score by Guo Wenjing and sumptuous costumes by Academy Award-winning designer Emi Wad.

            <p>
                When 25-year-old Chun Wai Chan was named principal dancer by the Houston Ballet late last year, a dream came true far sooner than he had expected."I was named first soloist in June 2017, and I thought it would take me a couple of years before I made it to a principal," said Chan.Born in Huizhou, Guangdong province, Chan began dancing in elementary school at the local Children's Palace. Gifted, he was encouraged to apply to Guangzhou Arts School and was admitted in 2004 when he was 12. He later moved to Hong Kong with his family.

                Ballet dancer has made it ahead of schedule
            </a>
            <p>
                When 25 year-old ballet dancer Chun Wai Chan was named principal dancer by the Houston Ballet in the just ended holiday season, his dream of becoming a principal dancer in an elite group had come true sooner than he had expected."I was named first soloist in June 2017, and I thought it would take me a couple of years before I made it to a principal," said Chan.Born in Huizhou, Guangdong, he later moved to Hong Kong with his family. Chan began dancing in elementary school at the local Children's Palace. Gifted, he was encouraged to apply to Guangzhou Arts School, the best in the province. He was admitted in 2004 when he was 12."That meant I had to leave home and go to Guangzhou. My family did not want me to be away and all voted against this. I wrote three long letters to my father, explaining why I wanted to do this. Eventually my family was convinced that this was truly my passion and let me go. I went, I missed home, and I cried," Chan said.Chan said he's grateful that a teacher focused his attention on training when he was homesick, and he trained hard. "I had my dreams. I wanted to win prizes and I wanted to study overseas."He wouldn't rest or eat unless he finished the daily 50 leg kicks, and he exercised his stomach muscles and leg muscles in bed at night. He took photos of his own movements to improve.In 2009, Chan won second place of Taoli Cup, the most prestigious competition dedicated to professional young dancers in China. By 2010, he had won international competitions, including the 2010 Prix de Laussanne, and received multiple invitations to dance from all over the world.He joined Houston Ballet II on full scholarship in 2010, and he had improved greatly by the time he finished his two-year training.Chan believed that his goal to become a principal dancer was too distant when he first came to Houston. "I figured the only thing I could do was to try my best at what I was doing," he said.His best effort earned him the Houston Ballet Academy Promising Student Award in 2011.Chan joined the Houston Ballet in 2012. As a world-class dance troupe, Houston Ballet puts on more than 70 performances a year. It gave Chan opportunities to perform various roles in Houston and around the world. He was invited to collaborate with dance groups in other cities.In the summer of 2016, when the assigned principal couldn't perform, Chan became the main character in Serenade."I did a total of seven performances. My knee was inflamed at that time, I had a fever, my head hurt, but I persevered and did all that was requested of me," he said.Chan's skill and dedication impressed Houston Ballet. He was promoted to soloist in June 2016.When Houston Ballet was preparing for La Bayadere, it saw how well Chan danced and gave him the leading role for one performance. Then he was promoted to first soloist in June 2017, and became one of five principal male dancers in December 2017."Although I wanted to become a principal, I did not expect it to really to come true, and certainly not this quick. Dreams do come true after all, and 2017 was a perfect year for me," said Chan.In December 2016, US Dance Magazine named Chan one of the "Top 25 to Watch", a list of rising star dancers in the US. "Chun Wai Chan oozes confidence — and has the technical chops to warrant it,"wrote the magazine.Chan said he has six dreams related to dance: winning prizes, going abroad, becoming a principal dancer, playing the lead role in Swan Lake and Giselle, and performing a leading role in China in front of his family and friends.He has realized three dreams, and a fourth one is near – playing Prince in Swan Lake this spring.Chan believes that before he retires from dancing, he will get to play Albercht in Giselle, and he will be on stage in China.Chan is also interested in modeling and becoming an actor. He created Chunner Studio to make dance-related videos and put them on various social media outlets, including Youtube and Meipian. His video usually gets more than 10,000 views in China and has more than 2,600 subscribers on Youtube."Dance has been an integrated part of my life. It's my career, my passion and my hobby. In the future, no matter what I do, it will be something related to dance. If I do some acting, I want to incorporate my dance into that too," Chan said.

                Zhang helps to celebrate Houston Ballet
            </a>
            <p>
                About 30 dancers with the Houston Ballet gathered at the company's practice hall on the fifth floor in the city's downtown on a Friday afternoon in mid-August. Under the guidance of Zhang Disha, a Chinese dancer and choreographer, the dancers repeatedly practiced a five-minute segment.It was the toward the end of Zhang's three weeks working with the Houston Ballet. Invited to choreograph a dance piece for the ballet's 50th anniversary celebration, Zhang was trying to achieve as much as she could to perfect her chosen piece, Elapse.With translation help from Thea Liao, a former member of the Houston Ballet, some sporadic changes were made, and by the end of one hour, the later rehearsal looked markedly improved from the first one."This is the shortest time I have ever had to choreograph a new piece. It's has been challenging. However, this has been a wonderful opportunity and experience for me. It has improved my skills," said Zhang, who usually has had at least four weeks to create a new piece.Elapse is a 16-minute music piece that moves her, said Zhang. From the music, she created a dance to express a sense of loss and passing-away – passage of time, loss of loved ones."We are always losing something living our lives. I believe different people will feel different about my work depending on their ages and personal experiences," said Zhang.She found the music beautiful but challenging. There were only two climaxes in the music that lacked major structural change. "However, it also means that any possibility is possible."Zhang has always tried something new in her work. "I don't want my next piece to be an imitation of my last work. Under the pressure of time constraints here, I feel that I have improved my skill through the experience," she said, adding that she might have done better if given another week.Zhang was spotted by Houston Ballet's artistic director Stanton Welch, who had been watching her for some time."I saw Disha's emotional heart-pounding movement, How Beautiful Is Heaven, years ago in Hamburg and knew we needed to bring her here," said Welch.The 50th anniversary seemed to be a perfect time to do just that, and the invitation was extended to Zhang to create any piece she desired."It is an honor to be the first American company to present her work," Welch said.It's no wonder that Zhang caught the eyes of Welch.A graduate of the Beijing Dance Academy in 2002, Zhang was a member of the Beijing Modern Dance Company from 2002 until 2007. Her 2003 work Temporary Residence Permit in collaboration with Hu Lei established her as a choreographer in China.In 2007, Zhang left to explore a career as a freelance choreographer. In the past decade, she has made a name for herself in the modern dance world with her groundbreaking works and has won dozens of awards.Her Three Points in 2009 won first prize in the No-Ballet International Modern Dance Choreography Competition in Germany and first prize in the Masdanza International Modern Dance Choreography Competition in Spain. In China, she won the prestigious Wenhua Award in 2010.In 2013, legendary dancer and choreographer John Neumeier invited Zhang to perform her award-winning work Linen Braids at the Nijinsky Gala in Germany.At the 2018 USA International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Mississippi, her Sad Bird received the Choreography Award.Zhang considers the invitation from Houston Ballet the highest professional honor she has received so far."The Houston Ballet dancers are very professional and diligent. They paid close attention to my instruction and quickly grasped what I wanted to express. If they are not sure about certain things, they would ask and discuss with me until they fully understood. They are the best dancers I have ever worked with," Zhang said.Elapse will make its world premiere with the Houston Ballet on Sept 19, as part of the ballet's mixed repertoire program. It is scheduled for six performances."I have always wanted to work with US dancers. I feel incredibly honored to have my first US work to be performed by such a world-class ballet company," Zhang said.
