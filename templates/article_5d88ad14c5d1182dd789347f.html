                Election speculation mounts in Britain on eve of 'last chance' Brexit battle

                LONDON - Prime Minister Boris Johnson summoned ministers to a meeting on Monday, stoking speculation he could call an election if parliament defeats the government over a Brexit plan opponents fear could push the United Kingdom into a ruinous no-deal exit.Johnson's promise to take the country out of the European Union on Oct 31 with or without a divorce deal has propelled the United Kingdom towards a constitutional crisis and a battle with the 27 other members of the bloc.An alliance of opposition lawmakers are plotting with rebels in Johnson's Conservative Party to take control of parliament and tie the government's hands with legislation that would block a no-deal exit, fearing leaving without a deal will be ruinous to the economy.Just 24 hours until parliament returns on Tuesday from its summer break, Johnson's enforcers warned rebels that if they voted against the government they would be kicked out of his Conservative Party.With little clarity on whether the deadlocked British parliament might be able to come up with a resolution to the three-year Brexit crisis, talk turned to a possible election."We want a general election," opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said, to oust Johnson's "phony, populist cabal".He added: "We must come together to stop no deal - this week could be our last chance."However, former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair warned Corbyn, a veteran socialist, to avoid what he cast as an election "elephant trap" Johnson had laid for Labour."Boris Johnson knows that if no-deal Brexit stands on its own as a proposition it might well fail but if he mixes it up with the Corbyn question in a general election he could succeed despite a majority being against a no-deal Brexit because some may fear a Corbyn premiership more," Blair said.Johnson has called a cabinet meeting for later on Monday. The BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said Johnson could ask lawmakers to vote on calling an election if they vote against his government on Brexit.Reuters

                    UK govt considering snap election

                Speculation mounts that PM Johnson to seek vote if Brexit delay bill is passedUnited Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson called an emergency Cabinet meeting on Monday afternoon, reportedly to talk over with his team the pros and cons of attempting to call a snap general election.He is understood to be eager to fatten the slim majority of his ruling Conservative Party and take full control of the nation's pending departure from the European Union.Under British parliamentary procedures, the prime minister cannot call an election unilaterally, such a move must be supported by two-thirds of the nation's 650 lawmakers, which means he would need the support of other parties should he make such a call.The BBC said he was considering the move to counter anticipated efforts by members of Parliament to pass legislation this week that would block him from taking the UK out of the European Union without a divorce deal in a so-called no-deal Brexit.The corporation's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said the prime minister could call for a snap general election as soon as Wednesday and, if Parliament supports the idea, the House of Commons could be closed on Friday and an election held as soon as Oct 11.She said the most likely date for nationwide polling is Oct 17.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly said he favors an early general election because it "would give the people a choice between two very different directions for the country".But former Labour Party prime minister and pro-EU campaigner Tony Blair warned in an earlier speech at the Institute for Government that Johnson appeared to be maneuvering toward making such a call, and that it was an "elephant trap" that might catch out the less prepared Labour Party."We're numb to the state of our politics," he lamented. "What is happening is shocking, irresponsible and dangerous."Parliament reconvened on Tuesday after having been closed for several weeks for summer recess.With the clock ticking down to the Oct 31 date by which the UK is scheduled to leave the EU and with a divorce deal guaranteeing tariff-free trading apparently out of reach, returning lawmakers opposed to a no-deal Brexit had been expected to try to rush through legislation blocking such a scenario.Now, with a general election on the short-term horizon, the maneuvering has become moot and all of the major parties will likely be thinking about how they might win enough support for their vision of the future to prevail.If there is an election, parties are likely to campaign from markedly different standpoints, with the Conservative Party championing an exit from the EU on Oct 31, with or without a deal, the Labour Party saying it will deliver a delay to the Brexit deadline and a second referendum, and the Liberal Democrats saying they will keep the UK in the EU.The drama came on a busy day for Brexit watchers in the UK in which the government launched a public information campaign aimed at preparing citizens for life outside the European Union.The 'Get Ready for Brexit' initiative started on Sunday with a new website featuring official information about Britain's exit from the bloc and ways in which the reinstatement of hard borders and trading tariffs might affect people.Michael Gove, the minister in charge of the UK's preparations for a no-deal Brexit, said the campaign, which will also play out on billboards, online, and on television, will encourage people to share in the responsibility of being ready.At the launch of the gov.uk/brexit website, he said being ready is "not only a matter of national importance, but a shared responsibility".The campaign will also make use of leaflets, online seminars, and information stands and is targeted at British citizens intending to travel to Europe and businesspeople who export to the bloc.Gove, meanwhile, was roundly criticized by the British Retail Consortium after he claimed there will not be shortages of fresh food in the event of a no-deal Brexit.And Jane Golding, a Berlin-based lawyer who co-chairs the British in Europe organization, said on Radio 4's Today program that a no-deal Brexit would mean "27 separate contingency plans" in each of the remaining EU member states and that there would inevitably be a raft of problems affecting not only the availability of fresh food in the UK but the rights of expat British people living in mainland Europe.She said many are worried about a lack of coordination on healthcare, social security, and even whether they will be allowed to stay in their homes.

                    PM Johnson loses control of the agenda as Tory rebels oppose him
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced he would seek to trigger a snap general election after defeat in a key House of Commons vote meant he lost control of the Brexit process.The defeat means members of Parliament were due on Wednesday to vote on a bill that would delay Britain's departure from the European Union if a new withdrawal deal cannot be agreed before Oct 19.Tuesday's Commons defeat by 328 votes to 301 gave control of Wednesday's parliamentary agenda to MPs who seek to block a no-deal Brexit and force the prime minister to seek an extension from the European Union.MPs that favor remaining in the EU drafted the bill that would force Johnson to delay Brexit until Jan 31, if he cannot agree a withdrawal deal with the EU.Labour and the Liberal Democrats have said they will block an early election until the threat of a no-deal Brexit is removed.It was Boris Johnson's first significant parliamentary vote as prime minister, and after three hours of debate it ended in a decisive defeat when 21 Tory rebel MPs, including two former chancellors, joined opposition parties to vote in favor of taking control of business in the Commons, with the aim of passing legislation to prevent a no-deal Brexit.The 21 rebels, including several former cabinet ministers, were subsequently told by Johnson's government that, as a result of their actions, they will "lose the party whip" and can no longer represent the Conservative Party.In response to the defeat, the prime minister said he would table a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act to call an election.Johnson told the House of Commons: "The consequences of this vote tonight means that Parliament is on the brink of wrecking any deal that we might be able to get in Brussels. It will hand control of the negotiations to the EU. I don't want an election but if MPs vote tomorrow (Wednesday) to stop negotiations and to compel another pointless delay of Brexit, potentially for years, then that would be the only way to resolve this."Johnson and his government want a general election before Brexit, in the hope they can win and go back to Brussels with a mandate to leave — deal or no-deal.The government's motion that could trigger an election was expected to be voted on later, possibly also on Wednesday, but it would need a two-thirds majority to pass and that would require the support of opposition MPs.Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn made clear on Tuesday evening that Johnson would only get what he seeks when a no-deal Brexit option was removed.Corbyn said: "He wants to table a motion for a general election — fine — get the bill through first, in order to take no-deal off the table."While Labour's refusal to back it would limit the likelihood of Johnson's motion succeeding, other avenues remain open to the prime minister to push for a snap election — including triggering a confidence motion in his own government.

                    British parliament to be prorogued Monday night: Downing Street
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                LONDON - The British parliament will be prorogued at the close of business on Monday night until Oct 14, Downing Street confirmed.The move came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson requested the Queen to allow such a suspension, from a date this week until Oct 14.On Oct 14, a new parliamentary session will be opened with a Queen's Speech.Meanwhile, the prime minister's official spokesman also said while the British government would obey the law, Johnson would not be requesting another extension of the latest Brexit deadline of Oct 31.The upper and lower houses of parliament have passed a bill designed to block a no-deal Brexit and direct Johnson to request a delayed Brexit from the European Union, a job which the prime minister vowed not to take. The bill is waiting for royal assent before it becomes law.The bill would compel Johnson to ask the European Union for a three-month Brexit extension if he has not struck a new agreement with the European Union by Oct 19.Johnson is expected to present his bid for a snap election on Oct 15 to parliament for a second time after his proposal was voted down last week by MPs.Opposition parties said they will not back the vote, meaning no election in mid October as Johnson had hoped."The Prime Minister is not going to seek an extension," the spokesman said. "If MPs want to resolve this there is an easy way -- vote for an election today and let the public decide."However, the prime minister has signalled to cabinet ministers that his government would have to accept a further three-month delay to Brexit if it was forced on him by courts.The official confirmation came as Johnson was meeting with the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, in Dublin for the first time since he entered Downing Street in July.The two discussed the issue of backstop, which, a sticking point in the Britain-European Union negotiations on Brexit, aimed at avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland after Britain's departure from the regional bloc.In Dublin, Johnson said he believed a deal was still possible by the European Union summit next month, and a no-deal Brexit would be a failure that both the British and Irish governments would be responsible for.But the Irish leader said there was no such thing as a clean break between Britain and the European Union.
