            </p>
            <p>
                Elegantly designed bookstores with unique cultural features are emerging in China's remote ancient villages, creating cultural spaces for locals as well as so-called cultural brands that attract urban residents.Cheng Sanguo, director of the Bookdao New Publishing Institute, a consultancy for the domestic publishing and book selling industry, said that in recent years bookstores have become "brands" for some relatively unknown villages located deep in mountains and forests."We have seen that some bookstores in rural areas have developed quite well, based on the natural scenery and characteristic culture of remote villages. This has also greatly enriched rural cultural life," he said.

                Historic Monuments of Dengfeng in the Center of Heaven and Earth
            </a>
            <p>
                Category of site: Cultural SiteBrief introductionThe historic monuments of Dengfeng in "The Center of Heaven and Earth", which include the ancient architectural complex at Songshan Mountain and the site of the Xia Dynasty capital, are situated in and around Songshan Mountain in Henan.The mountain is considered to be the central sacred mountain of China. At the foot of this 1500 meter high mountain, close to the city of Dengfeng in Henan province and spread over a 40- square-kilometer circle, stand eight clusters of buildings and sites, including three Han Que gates , remains of the oldest religious edifices in China - Zhong yue temples, the Zhougong Sundial Platform and the Dengfeng Observatory. Constructed over the course of nine dynasties, these buildings are reflections of different ways of perceiving the centre of heaven and earth and the power of the mountain as a centre for religious devotion. Other sites registered include the Songyang Academy (484 AD), the 1,500-year-old Pagoda of Songyue Temple as well as the country's oldest existing ritual structures; three pairs of towers (Taishi, Shaoshi, and Qimu) built during the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD).The historical monuments of Dengfeng include some of the best examples of ancient Chinese buildings devoted to ritual, science, technology and education.Dengfeng was considered the center of ancient China, and therefore it served as the capital and cultural center of many dynasties. Disciples of Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism settled here to advance their religious cultures. Because of this historical background and architectural significance of Dengfeng, it is called "The Center of Heaven and Earth".The Center of Heaven and Earth was added to the list on August 1, 2010.Zhongyue TempleThe Zhongyue Temple, listed by the State Council as a key national temple of Taoism, is located on Songshan Mountain in Dengfeng county, Henan province. Songshan Mountain is a famous beautiful scenic spot. Many religious sites have been constructed there since ancient times. The famous Shaolin Temple is located there. In addition, there are many Taoist buildings, among which the Zhongyue Temple is extremely well preserved.The Zhongyue Temple is situated at the foot of Huanggai Peak, which is at the southern side of Taishi Mountain of Songshan Mountain. It was first established in the 3rd century BC. After Empress Wu Zetian came there for worship in 688, the Zhongyue Temple began to flourish. The temple had been repaired many times and had 900 rooms in various buildings by 1013, but subsequently declined to a certain extent.Now, there are over 400 rooms, covering an area of 100,000 square meters. It is the extant ancient Taoist architectural complex that is the most complete and has the largest scale. The main buildings include the Zhonghua Gate and the Tianzhong Pavilion, etc., spanning 6,500 meters from south to north. There are many precious cultural relics in the temple. Especially, its numerous inscriptions on tablets are now the important materials for calligraphic research. The principal building is the Main Hall, which displays very delicate craftsmanship and is the most grandiose building in the Zhongyue Temple. At present, the Zhongyue Temple can receive 1.5 million person-times of tourists and disciples every year.Dengfeng Astro ObservatoryThe Astro Observatory, located at Gaocheng town, to the southeast of and 15km away from Dengfeng, is the largest ancient observatory now existing in China. It is the cultural relics of significant value for scientific research and has the functions of measuring the shadow cast by the sun, observing celestial bodies, and telling time.The observatory was in 1961 listed among the Key Cultural Relics under State Protection. At the request of the imperial order, the observatory was built by Guo Shoujing and Wang Xun in 13th year of the Emperor Zhiyuan (1276 AD), Yuan Dynasty, and was one of the then 27 observation stations in China. The observatory, of masonry construction, consists of the body and the stone gnomon (or the night blooming cereus, unofficially).As the plane is square, the observatory has smaller upper part and larger lower part, and is 12.62 meters in overall height. At the north of it are designed with two symmetrical step entrances for observation. The center of the northern wall is built into a hollow groove that is perforated through from top to bottom, so the higher gnomon at the groove's straight wall and the stone gnomon at the bottom constitute a series of gnomon apparatus for measuring the length of shadow cast by the sun. The stone gnomon at the bottom of the groove is connected with 36 blocks of blue stone from south to north, and is 31.2 meters in length and 0.53 meters in width. The gnomon is carved with two parallel two-way watercourses. To the south of the watercourses is a suction sump, and to the north a discharge sump. Each sump has scales for measuring the levelness.Songyang Academy of classical learningSongyang Academy is located at the south foot of the Songshan Mountain, 3 kilometers north of Dengfeng county seat. Embraced by hills to the east and west, Songyang Academy enjoys a beautiful view with two brisk clear springs joining in front of it into a river and fertile fields extending far away to the south. Standing at the academy gate, visitors can see all the peaks of the Songshan Mountain and overlook the Dengfeng county seat. Being an ideal place for study, it is laurelled as one of the Four Academies of the Song Dynasty (960–1729 AD), together with the Suiyang Academy in Suizhou (also named "Yingtian Academy"), the Yuelu Adacemy in the Hunan province and the Bailudong Adademy in Jiangxi province.In history, Songyang Academy was jointly dominated by Buddhism and Daoism at first, later by the Confucianism exclusively. During the ages from the Later Zhou Dynasty (951–959 AD) of the Five Dynasties Period (907–959 AD) to the Song Dynasty (960–1279 AD), Chenghao and Cheng Xi, two great masters of the Luo School of the Confucianism, spread their theories here with hundreds of students. First built in 484 AD, it had been renovated and extended for several times in different dynasties, later developed into an academy of a large scale with an air of simplicity and elegance.General Cypresses of the Western Han Dynasty and the Great Tang Stele of the Tang Dynasty are the feature cultural relics of the Songyang Academy. Legend has it that more than 2,000 years ago, when Liu Che, or the Emperor Hanwudi of the Han Dynasty, came to visit the Songyang Academy, he was much impressed at the grand flourishing cypress standing in front of him on his stepping into the courtyard. Looking up for a while, he called it "the Greatest General" out of appreciation. Stepping further into the second court, however, an even more majestic cypress appeared. Regretful as he was, he could only name this cypress "the Greatest General No 2", as every word spilt out by Chinese emperors would never be taken back.Cultural heritageThe astronomical idea of "The Centre of Heaven and Earth" is closely related to the idea of imperial power, with the propitiousness of establishing capitals at the centre of heaven and earth, and with its natural attribute, Songshan Mountain and the ceremonies and ritual associated with it. The serial property demonstrates the significance of the area in terms of prestige and patronage.The concentration of sacred and secular structures in the Dengfeng area display the strong and persistent tradition of "The Centre of Heaven and Earth" linked to the sacred mountain which sustained imperial sacrifices and patronage over 1,500 years and became of great importance in Chinese culture. The Buddhist structures began to have a symbiotic relationship with the sacred mountain.

                UN hails China's rural development model that reduces poverty
            </a>
            <p>
                NAIROBI -- The UN on Monday hailed China's rural development model that has reduced poverty as well as reversed rural urban migration.Remy Sietchiping, head of the regional and metropolitan planning unit at UN-Habitat, told Xinhua in Nairobi on Monday that the development in Songyang County in the southwest of Zhejiang province has transformed the rural area by adopting low cost innovations."The rural transformation model has indicated that villages can have a high standard of living," Sietchiping said during the international guidelines on urban and territorial planning and health event at the first UN Habitat Assembly.Songyang is a mountainous county that has preserved all the practices of agricultural civilization.Sietchiping said that through value addition of locally available resources, Songyang County has become one of the most livable regions in China.He noted that farmers in the rural areas have also been linked to global consumers through the use of an e-commerce platform.The UN-Habitat official noted that life in rural areas is also more desirable in China because it has less pollution and rural residents tend to have more disposable income as compared to their urban counterparts.Wang Jun, Mayor of Songyang County, said that rural revival in Songyang seeks to equilibrate urban and rural relationships through building healthier human settlements.He observed that in recent years Songyang has adopted the notions of active protection and organic development, noting that the county aims to alleviate pressure associated with cities by putting in place a number of innovative measures.Wang said that Songyang county hopes to revitalize the rural economy by implementing ecologically-friendly agriculture and cultural tourism in order to integrate all levels of development.

                Songyang's architectural acupunctures impress experts
            </a>
            <p>
                The architectural acupuncture strategy of Songyang county in East China's Zhejiang province was highly praised by experts on the sidelines of the ongoing UN-Habitat Assembly in Nairobi, Kenya.The experts termed the strategy as an innovative and successful rural revitalization method that can be replicated in other parts of the world, even as rethinking of rural development remains a pressing global challenge.Franz Gatzweiler, executive director of Urban Health and Wellbeing Program of the International Science Council, said the acupuncture idea is exciting and wonderful because it starts with the thought of a city, urban and rural area being able to activate flows by leveraging on certain nods."It means putting a "needle" in a certain area where energy, economics, and values start flowing again and improving the health of the system's organism. It's basically about activating flows. I love the idea," he said.The architectural acupuncture strategy aims at using local materials and construction techniques to renovate houses integrated with historical context. This is in addition to restoration of the rural identity and stimulating economic development in the area.Basically, the architecture projects serve as small-scale, yet long-term catalysts for rural revitalization. The projects range from economic and cultural development to utilizing abandoned infrastructure, and the creative use of natural resources.Remy Sietchiping, unit leader of the regional and metropolitan planning unit at UN-Habitat, said the Songyang experience on rural revitalization will make people think twice, because it's cost-effective, the impact is huge and it has transformed the lives of many people."They call Songyang county a rural area but it looks like a city. The projects are low cost and short-term and they use local materials. The outcome has been a link between ecology and economy," he said.Sietchiping said it's exciting that the villagers sell their products via Taobao."The system has reduced rural urban migration and poverty. It is attracting people to the village, where they have more disposable income and the environment is cleaner than cities," he said.Due to rural revitalization, Sietchiping said the life expectancy in the villages has improved significantly. Job opportunities also have been created, there has been transfer of skills from older people to the young, tourism has increased in the rural areas and people are adding value to their produce."African countries can find their own rural revitalization ways that will address their specific challenges," Xu Tiantian, principal architect from Beijing DnA Design and Architecture, said since the launch of Songyang county's rural revitalization program in 2013, rural residents are healthier and have gained confidence of their own villages.She said rural revitalization has produced a better countryside, provided alternative living for urban residents and created interaction between urban and the rural areas."People are happier and are earning better incomes and the village is welcoming more tourists," she said.Wang Jun, Party secretary of Songyang county, said the new rural model has provided a healthier ecology and lifestyle for urban residents that has in turn induced interactions between the county's urban and rural regions."Over the last three years, 3,900 new residents have resettled in the villages. Most of these people are young entrepreneurs who choose to live in the villages and start new businesses with the assistance of internet facilities and modern technologies," he said.Wang said Songyang has witnessed a shift from a singular economic form based on agriculture to multiple economic forms based on high-quality agriculture and in-depth integration of agriculture, industry, trade and cultural tourism."We have adopted tourism as an important driving force for economic development on the county level, and promoted the county's standardized production base for green food, leisure, the rural museum, and folk festivals on all county levels," he said.Wang said almost 120 villages in the county have implanted new forms of private enterprises, such as bed and breakfast accommodations, farmhouses, ecological agriculture, and cultural industries.For example, the brown sugar workshop in Xing village not only serves as a production workshop but also a space to exhibit rural-specific crafts and heritage. Combining tourism to increase the price of brown sugar and population growth, the annual number of tourists has grown from 200 visitors to 15,000 visitors in two years.Wang said Songyang is becoming a healthy garden city for quality living, with a balanced development of the rural and urban.He said the increasing need to build an ecological and civil society has increased the prominence of the economic, ecological, social and cultural values of the rural areas."Let's place the rural in the same position of importance as the urban and integrate developments in both, so that urban prosperity and rural revitalization can complement and benefit each other," he said.Wang hopes that rural revitalization in Songyang over the years could offer solutions and provide new visions and perspectives for the future.He said Songyang has preserved all the agricultural practices and is known as "the county specimen of classical China".In addition to the brown sugar factory, other architectural acupuncture projects in Songyang county include a tofu factory, the Wang Jin Memorial Hall, Hakka Indenture Museum, Bamboo Theatre, Water Conservancy Center, Damushan Teahouse, Shimenxu Bridge, and Dushan Leisure Center."In the tofu factory in Caizhai village, the average household income increased by 20,000 yuan ($3,000) in the first quarter alone.

                UN meeting addresses global challenges on urbanization
            </a>
            <p>
                A meeting of the world's highest-level decision-making body on sustainable human settlements and urbanization, UN-Habitat, opened on Monday in the Kenyan capital. Running through May 31, the assembly is expected to be attended by more than 3,000 delegates from 116 countries, including four heads of state and more than 40 ministers.With more than 70 percent of the world's population projected to live in cities by 2050, Maimunah Sharif, UN Habitat executive director, said extreme poverty, socioeconomic inequality, slums, social exclusion, gender-based discrimination, humanitarian crises, conflicts, air pollution, climate change, and high unemployment, will be increasingly concentrated in urban areas."Understanding the key trends in urbanization and how they will likely unfold is crucial to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development," she said.Sharif called on the participants to position sustainable urbanization at the center of their development priorities through deliberate efforts to implement the New Urban Agenda.Sharif said the world needs to leverage innovations to improve living conditions in cities. "Cities are the incubators of innovation, industry, technology, entrepreneurship and creativity. They drive national economies by creating prosperity, enhancing social development and providing employment," she said.Joyce Msuya, the acting executive director of the UN Environmental Programme, said there is need to fuel green and sustainable growth, protect the environment, ensure equality for all, and keep the social fabric of the communities intact."We need to build in circularity into the DNA of our urban systems. This means fundamentally rethinking how our cities function, from waste disposal, clean mobility to urban planning," she said.On the sidelines of the meeting, the architectural acupuncture strategy of Songyang County in China's Zhejiang province was praised by experts as an innovative and successful rural revitalization method.Franz Gatzweiler, the executive director of Urban Health and Wellbeing Program of the International Science Council, said the acupuncture idea is exciting and wonderful because it starts with the thought of a city, urban and rural area, being able to activate flows by leveraging on certain nods."It means putting a needle in a certain area where energy, economics, and values start flowing again and improving the health of the system's organism. It's basically about activating flows. I love the idea," he said.Msuya said smart and sustainable urban planning represents a tremendous opportunity to reduce the strain put on the planet, while also improving the quality of the life of billions of people, especially in low-income countries, which will account for 90 percent of the predicted urban growth.She said adopting circularity and resource efficiency could reduce greenhouse gas emissions in some sectors by up to 99 percent, while decreasing the cost associated with achieving the targets of the Paris Agreement.Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said societies are currently ill-prepared to plan for rapid urbanization, resulting in proliferation of slums and informal settlements, urbanization of poverty and increased environmental degradation."Addressing these challenges calls for collective international action, informed by scientific research and technological innovations," he said.Xinhua contributed to this story.

                Xi sends letter to World Environment Day celebrations in Hangzhou
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - Chinese President Xi Jinping has sent a congratulatory letter to the World Environment Day celebrations Wednesday in Hangzhou city, Zhejiang province, calling for joint efforts to promote green, low-carbon and sustainable development."We only have one Earth. Protecting ecological environment and pushing sustainable development are our joint obligations," Xi said in the letter.While the international community is actively pushing for the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, countries are facing severe challenges including environmental pollution, climate change and declining biodiversity, Xi noted.He stressed that China has attached great importance to environment protection, acted on the understanding that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets, and sought harmony between human and nature.Remarkable progress has been made as China included the building of an ecological civilization in the country's overall development plan, Xi said, adding China is willing to work with other countries on the path of green growth and make positive contributions to the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.China is the global host of the 2019 World Environment Day celebrations, and the main event is being held in Hangzhou in East China.

                Weaker typhoon going north
            </a>
            <p>
                Liaoning, Jilin still face heavy rains, threat of deluge as Lekima moves onA weakening Typhoon Lekima continued to hit the northeastern regions, forcing over 130,000 people to evacuate and damaging 6,020 hectares of farmland as of noon on Tuesday in Liaoning, but no casualties have been reported, said the provincial flood control authority.Forecasts from the National Meteorological Center show that Lekima has been moving northward from Shandong to Liaoning provinces since Tuesday morning, bringing torrential rains and gusts.The local meteorological department predicts that heavy rains will continue to drench Liaoning until Thursday, and the risks of flooding remain high in both Liaoning and Jilin, flood control authorities from the two provinces said.Liaoning province has asked all schools and tourist attractions to stop operating for safety reasons. All 1,860 rescue teams are on standby.The Liaoning provincial government warns that the current priority is to pay close attention to the situation in the Liaohe River Basin, especially the debris flow and evacuation of dangerous areas."Although the intensity of the typhoon has been downgraded from tropical storm to tropical depression, the typhoon prevention and flood control in Liaoning has reached the most critical turning point," said Yang Qingguo, deputy director of the office of Liaoning Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.Because the main river basins and soil in Liaoning have been basically saturated with water while the rainfall continues, a high risk of flooding remains, Yang said. In addition, heavy rainfall in Jilin province will exert extra pressure on the upper reaches of Liaohe River, which runs through the two provinces.This has been confirmed by information from the Jilin provincial government.Rainfall began to increase in Jilin province on Tuesday afternoon. Jilin has raised its emergency response to flood control to Level III. The local government warned that Lekima may cause flooding."Liaoning is carrying out reservoir flood control work according to real-time rainfall to ensure flood control safety. At the same time, 63 reservoirs with excess floodwaters have been discharged," said Yu Songyang, deputy director of the dispatching center at Liaoning Water Resources Management Group.Information from local authorities shows most of the 1,561 meteorological stations in Liaoning province have monitored rainfall in the past two days. Huludao city saw the largest rainfall of 129 millimeters on Monday.Lekima, the strongest typhoon to date in China this year, has wreaked havoc in eastern coastal regions including Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces as well as Shanghai, inundating the areas with torrential rains, gusts and floods after making landfall on Saturday in Wenling, Zhejiang. It has left 49 dead and 21 missing in Zhejiang, Shandong and Anhui provinces as of Monday night.There were growing concerns about the price of vegetables rising after flooding hit Shandong's Shouguang city, China's major vegetable production base and distribution center.The large-scale rainstorms brought by Lekima recently raised harvesting, shipping and storage costs of vegetables, especially top-quality ones, thus driving up the prices.The rising price also contributed to lower production of local vegetables, which had been mostly harvested to get greenhouses ready for the next cultivation season, and an increase in demand as the rain cooled the summer weather.Liu Xueming, village Party secretary of Suqin village in Shouguang, said the price would gradually drop as Shouguang vegetables are sold mainly from October to May."After this typhoon, farmers can plant vegetables again if there is no more extreme weather. Eggplants and chili peppers may go for sale a little bit late," he said.Liu Mingtai, Xie Chuanjiao, Zhao Ruixue and Xinhua contributed to this story.
