                    Malawi awaits result of tight presidential election
                </p>

                Millions of voters in Malawi cast ballots on Tuesday in a closely-fought election, as the incumbent president battled to hold off two rivals in a race focused on economic development.President Peter Mutharika, who is seeking a second term under Democratic Progressive Party, faces a stiff challenge from his deputy, Saulos Chilima of United Transformation Movement Party, and Lazarus Chakwera, the main opposition leader who ran under Malawi Congress Party.The official results should be announced in eight days.The voting process took place peacefully with polls closing at 6 pm on Tuesday.Cavince Otieno, a political analyst in Nairobi, Kenya, said Malawians demonstrated a high level of organization and respect of the electoral integrity. "Being the first elections under the new Political Parties Act where bribery was outlawed, the candidates were judged by the quality of their ideas instead of the depth of their pockets," he said.Mutharika, 78, campaigned on a pledge to continue improving the country's infrastructure and agricultural subsidies. Malawi has struggled with infrastructure development due to economic and natural disasters.Mutharika's government has also been praised for a subsidy program aimed at enhancing food self-sufficiency by increasing smallholder farmers' access to agricultural inputs. However, opposition parties claim the program has been fraught with corruption.Chakwera, 64, a former preacher, campaigned on a pledge to crack down on corruption and nepotism. He hopes that his party will reclaim power, especially because former president Joyce Banda joined it.Chakwera's Congress Party is the country's oldest. It ruled for 30 years starting from independence in 1964.Chilima, 46, mounted a strong social media campaign that enabled him to capture the youth vote. He promised to create 1 million jobs in his first year in the office.A total of 6.9 million Malawians registered as voters, 54 percent of them aged between 18 and 34. Additionally, 56 percent of the registered voters were female. Seven candidates vied for the top job.According to International Labour Organization, youth unemployment in Malawi stood at 7.8 percent in 2017. Additionally, more than 70 percent of young Malawians aged between 15 and 29 are employed in informal sectors.The organization states that Malawi has one of the highest rates of working poverty, which stands at around 60 percent living on $2 per day.

                    UN-Habitat Assembly pledges to address urbanization
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The first session of the UN-Habitat Assembly concluded Friday with a pledge from delegates to accelerate implementation of the New Urban Agenda (NUA) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).More than 3000 delegates who attended the five-day event, held at UN offices in Nairobi, Kenya, adopted ministerial declarations, five resolutions and one decision to promote sustainable urbanization.Speaking during the closing ceremony, Martha Delgado, UN-Habitat Assembly president, said delegates adopted guidelines on safer cities and a strategic plan for 2020-2023.Delgado said delegates agreed to prioritize the NUA and the urban dimension of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.She said delegates also resolved to promote gender equality through UN-Habitat to support inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements."The delegates also resolved to enhance urban-rural linkages for sustainable urbanization and human settlement," she said.Maimunah Sharif, UN-Habitat executive director, said the assembly represented the beginning of a story of transformation and change."We have laid strong foundations this week. Now it is time to build on them and create a world where no one is left behind," she said.She said UN-Habitat will continue to explore the best ideas and practices to achieve its vision of a better quality of life for all in an urbanizing world.Sharif called on stakeholders to put sustainable urbanization at the center of their development priorities through the NUA, as well as strengthen their urban governance structures and institutions.She called for policy solutions that promote science, technology and innovation in fulfilling the promises of the 2030 agenda.This includes using artificial intelligence to support decision-making processes and to efficiently and inclusively deliver basic and social services that transform lives in cities."I call for the development, transfer, dissemination and diffusion of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries," she said.Sharif also called on stakeholders to work with UN-Habitat and to bring their ideas, solutions, expertise and resources to the organization."We are committed to working with you. While we sincerely appreciate earmarked contributions, it is core non-earmarked contributions that will reduce fragmentation in our work, enable us to achieve impact, while increasing predictability and flexibility in the implementation of the priorities agreed together in the Strategic Plan," she said.The ministerial declaration recognized that increasing urbanization constitutes both a challenge and an opportunity to sustainable development.It called for the "promotion of sustainable patterns of consumption and production" though various methods including smart technologies, sustainable lifestyles and resource efficiency.The declaration said the ministers recognize and support the role and expertise of UN-Habitat as a focal point for sustainable urbanization and human settlements and as a center of excellence and innovation.During Wednesday's partnership and pledging conference, $152 million was pledged by 21 countries, namely: China, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, France, the Gambia, Germany, Ghana, India, Japan, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Morocco, Nigeria, Norway, Poland, South Africa, South Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland and Zambia.The assembly's theme, innovation for a better quality of life in cities and communities, was reflected throughout the week with 90 exhibitors showcasing new solutions.These included using the computer game Minecraft for inclusive urban planning, recycling food waste for fuel, and using spatial data to effectively respond to urban incidents.The assembly confirmed that the second session of the UN-Habitat Assembly, which is to take place every four years, will be held June 5-9 in 2023.

                    Suning 'sisters' shining bright

                African aces form twin threat in Jiangsu's attackNANJING, Jiangsu province - Tabitha Chawinga and Elizabeth Addo refer to themselves as "twin sisters" - and together they're making waves in Chinese women's soccer while also helping each other acclimatize off the pitch.The Africans are instrumental to the ambitions of Chinese Women's Super League team Jiangsu Suning, with Chawinga banging in the goals up front and Addo pulling the strings in midfield.Chawinga is already captain of the Malawi national team and Jocelyn Precheur, Jiangsu's French coach, is convinced the 23-year-old is destined for the very top.But it hasn't been an easy path.Chawinga grew up playing soccer with boys in her village and was often verbally abused by onlookers.The 25-year-old Addo is Ghana's skipper and a quiet but steely presence who was raised in an area on the outskirts of the capital Accra known as "Survival City" because it is so tough.Compared to that, being professional players in China and living in the bustling city of Nanjing, where Jiangsu Suning is based, is a breeze.As the only foreign players in the club's women's team, and with just a few words of Mandarin between them, Addo and Chawinga lean heavily on each another.Neither will be involved in the Women's World Cup in France when it starts next week because Ghana and Malawi did not qualify, but they will be watching from afar."We spend a lot of time together, walking in the streets, eating in restaurants together if we don't want to cook," said Chawinga."We joke together. She's a nice girl to me, she's like my sister. It's the truth - we are the only the foreigners on the team, so we take care of each other like sisters. We are twins."Broken teeth Neither had been to China before joining Jiangsu, which has already lifted one domestic cup this season and is in the semifinals of the other.Chawinga arrived from Swedish soccer in early 2018 and has been prolific, scoring 51 goals in 34 games to solidify her reputation as one of the world's best female strikers.She was joined by attacking midfielder Addo in March this year, the two reuniting after playing together in Sweden for 18 months.Chawinga laughs at the reaction they get on the streets of Nanjing, where there are few black faces."Many people look at us and think that maybe we are from the same parents, same house. People look at us a lot, like, 'Hey, you look so similar,'" she said.Their soccer paths also have similarities because they competed against boys when they were younger and were taunted for their love of the game.Chawinga was a goalkeeper but at age 10 she got kneed in the mouth - "It broke my teeth!" - and decided to play as a striker instead.As good as she was, Chawinga was regularly targeted for insults."People talked a lot, 'Hey, she just plays football, look at her, she goes to sleep with the boys.' But I didn't care, I knew the truth myself," she said.There were also objections from her mother."She used to fight me and say, 'Girls can't play football with the boys, stop playing football'. But now she's very happy for me to play."In sync Addo has also enjoyed stints in several countries including Sweden, the USA and Australia.She and Chawinga have lined up together half a dozen times so far for Jiangsu, with Addo setting up three of her friend's goals and scoring three times herself."When I have the ball, she knows what I'll do next," said Addo."I know her movement - when she's 'flying' and when she'll stay."Addo paused when asked about the prospect of playing against Chawinga in an international.Then she said, smiling broadly: "That would be great, I can't wait for that day. But maybe I would mark someone else and I would tell my players, 'Hey, be careful with my twin sister'."Xinhua

                Beijing Normal University (BNU) on Wednesday and Thursday held the 2019 graduation ceremony and fifth anniversary of its master's program for developing countries.There are 53 students from 31 countries in the 2019 class of BNU's Emerging Markets Institute's (EMI) master's program."Belt and Road projects such as the China-Laos Railway, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and Hambantota Port are frequent research subjects in students' theses as most of them come from major Belt and Road Initiative-related countries," Hu Biliang, dean of EMI, told China Daily website."Young people who went through this program will be the best promoters of better futures in their own countries and be part of the global community where China is an irreplaceable, indispensable and inevitable partner for every serious future that we are looking forward to together," Zlatko Lagumdzija, former prime minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina, said during an interview with China Daily website."They're getting out of this program much richer than when they entered it. We, as people sharing this planet, are richer because of people like these," said Lagumdzija.At the commencement ceremony, Rosen Plevnaliyev, former president of Bulgaria, told graduates, "The success of a leader is only measured by the success of ordinary people and the progress of society."Ha Yu, director of the Planning and Building Office of Human Resource Development, Academy for International Business Officials, Ministry of Commerce, also expressed his wishes to graduates at the ceremony."I hope you can share your experience in China with your family, colleagues and friends, helping more people understand China.""I also hope you can help build a bridge of friendship and be a friendly envoy of bilateral cooperation," said Ha.Field studies in both poverty-stricken and developed cities have "provided students with a wealth of knowledge on topics concerning poverty alleviation and wealth utilization based on Chinese experiences," said Samuel Korsah, an EMI graduate from the Ministry of Youth and Sports in Ghana."This MBA has helped me enhance my management skills on how to manage people and manage the sources of a company, so as to increase productivity," Paul Phiri, a graduate working in the Zomba City Council of Malawi, told China Daily website.The International MBA program hosted by EMI, BNU, is an executive one-year master's program sponsored by the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China.Since 2014, EMI's master's program has educated 182 students from 61 countries, among which 50 percent are from Africa, 23 percent from Latin America, and 24 percent from Asia.
