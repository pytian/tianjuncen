                Climate change is taking a heavy toll, but minor tweaks, like how land is used for food, can help Climate change is undermining food security, says the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) after reviewing and comprehensively assessing the scientific understanding of entire climate change scenarios, land-climate interactions and the food system, a key component in the whole system. The new findings in the Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL), together with the IPCC's widely-quoted special report on limiting global warming to 1.5 C, will offer solid scientific information to help climate and environment negotiations, global policymaking, national decision-making and more. According to the SRCCL, as the new report is called, the way humans use land also accelerates climate change. Since pre-industry times, for example, the observed average land surface air temperature has risen considerably (1.53 C), higher than the rise of ocean surface temperature or even the global mean surface temperature. Such quick warming is mainly induced by human activities, including more emissions of greenhouse gases, changes in aerosols and land use. The most direct impact is food security, which gets undermined by quickened warming, changing precipitation patterns and more frequent occurrence of some extreme weather and climate events. Warming extends the growing season. The increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2 ) concentration has a fertilization effect on biomass. These two factors prove beneficial for some crop yields, especially over northern high latitudes. On the other hand, rise in extreme weather and climate events negatively affects food systems through decline and stagnation in yields, changes in sowing and harvest dates, increased infestation of pests and diseases, resource availability, and pollination services. Already there is a decline in maize and wheat yield in the lower latitude regions. Climate change is also affecting food security in dry land regions, particularly in Africa, Asia and South America. Warming can also exacerbate food safety risks during transport and storage. Based on the IPCC's assessment, climate change in future, depending on level of warming, is going to increasingly impact food security. The main drivers of global warming are greenhouse gas emissions consisting of CO2, methane and nitrogen oxide. The SRCCL finds that about 25 to 30 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to the food system as a whole, from food production to processing, transport, retail, consumption, loss and waste. To be specific, about 10 to 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission comes from crop and livestock activities within the farm gate, 8 to 10 percent from land use and land use change including deforestation and peat land degradation, and about 5 to 10 percent from supply chain activities. From the food system's perspective, between 2007 and 2016, the major source of GHG emissions, on the supply side, was agricultural production such as crop and livestock activities within the farm gate, and land use changes. On the demand side, food loss and waste contributed mainly to GHG emissions. Between 2010 and 2016, as data shows, global food loss and waste equaled 8 to 10 percent of total GHG emissions. The food system can partly help future climate change adaptation and mitigation. On the supply side, experts suggest increased soil organic matter and erosion control, improved cropland, livestock, and grazing land management, and genetic improvements to increase tolerance to heat and drought. Further, diversification in the food system is a key strategy to reduce climate change risks. On the demand side, adoption of healthy and sustainable diets, together with reduction in food loss and waste, can contribute to adaptation through reduction in additional land area needed for food production and associated food system vulnerabilities. As for mitigation, supply-side action options include reducing crop and livestock GHG emissions, sequestering carbon in soils and biomass, and decreasing emissions intensity within sustainable productions. Technically, the total mitigation potential of crop and livestock activities is estimated as 1.5 billion to 4 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year by 2030. From the consumption side, about 25 to 30 percent of food produced is lost and wasted. Reducing food loss and waste can greatly help reduce GHG emissions. Producing animal-sourced food (such as meat and dairy) emits larger amount of GHGs than growing crops and vegetables. Grains, nuts and vegetables have a lower carbon footprint than meat. Change to healthy and sustainable diets can help reduce GHG emissions. The total mitigation potential of dietary changes is estimated as 1.8 billion to 3.4 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year by 2050. Combining supply-side action with demand-side interventions such as modification of food choices and reduction of food loss and waste would not only reduce GHG emissions, but also enhance food system resilience. Appropriate design of policies, markets, institutions and governance are important to ensure the climate change response options are effective throughout the food system. Food security related climate change responses in China entail multiple dimensions. Agriculture, in China, is not only the foundation of the national economy but also a fundamental guarantee and priority field. Because of its huge population, limited land resource, the impact of climate change on agriculture and food security has become more challenging in recent years. Although global warming has benefited rice yields in northeastern China and wheat yields in northern China, it has been noticed that in the past three decades, increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather and climate events, such as drought and floods, and more frequent outburst of plant diseases and insect pests, has affected yield in many regions. Sustainable solutions are urgently required to address potential risks of climate change on food security in China. As an immediate action, an effective early warning system should be built, based on systematic monitoring and remote sensing technology to monitor and quantify the risks for broad-spectrum stresses such as droughts, heat waves, flooding and pests. From the supply side, many suggested on-farm adaptation options can be taken, such as increasing soil organic matter, enhancing erosion control in cropland, and improving land management and water management etc. From the consumption side, there is also a considerable potential to reduce GHGs by adopting low GHG-intensity food, and reducing food loss and waste.

                Artists call for structured African contemporary art market
            </a>
            <p>
                One day in 2008, Sisqo Ndombe, a Congolese artist and graduate of the Kinshasa Academy of Fine Arts, took to the streets of the Democratic Republic (DR) of Congo's capital, Kinshasa. His artwork in his hands, he braved the scorching sun as he looked for customers, eager for his first sale.Unfortunately, after walking several kilometers and trying to persuade people to buy his work, nobody expressed interest and he returned home a frustrated man."That is the day I realized that there is a big challenge in the artistic sector. I also discovered that many talented African artists who I knew were facing a similar frustration. They could not sell their artwork or even be recognized, because of the lack of diffusion spaces, professional galleries, and customers," Ndombe said.This didn't dampen his enthusiasm, but instead inspired his entrepreneurialism. On June 2018, Ndombe launched Bandombe Gallery, an online marketplace selling contemporary African artwork.The platform has registered over 400 artists from across Africa, of whom about 300 have displayed over 800 artworks at the gallery. The artworks cost $150-$20,000 and so far, 37 artworks have been sold through the platform."The advantage of the arts community is that you are judged on your talent and skills, not on your academic qualifications or experiences. Studying the works of great masters remains the best training," he said.Ndombe was among the African artists and experts who had gathered at a side event during the Makutano Forum in Kinshasa on September 6, 2019 to discuss how the contemporary African art market can position itself and find an audience.The participants agreed that contemporary African art is unable to compete internationally because of the lack of a structured market. They said there is a need to develop a system that will enable the sector to develop and that will also critique artworks.They also emphasized the need for art education to keep pace with market demands and to encourage creativity. They called on African governments to create national galleries where artists can exhibit their artworks.Henri Kalama, professor, painter and general director of the Kinshasa Academy of Fine Arts, spoke of the need for an African market able to compete internationally, which would give African artists inspiration from the works of artists across the globe.Kalama said there should be reinvestment in African culture, to make it more interesting and encourage people interested in supporting the art industry."African governments should create conditions to allow art to develop, like financing them directly or giving advantage to investors in the culture industry. In DR Congo, many people want to venture into art, but are hindered by a lot of taxes and customs," he said.Kalama said South Africa has professional galleries that have not only given artists international exposure but have also made their value known."In DR Congo, an artist will be selling a painting at $1,000 today, and unfortunately, it will be hard to sell the same painting at half the price the next day, because the market is not structured," he said.Kalama said African society should be educated that beyond enjoyment, art can also be a source of income."The future of art is in Africa. That's why the sector players and experts have been holding forums, an indication that people are looking for a solution," he said.Freddy Tsimba, artist-sculptor, said it's unfortunate that African artists' works are popular outside but unknown on the continent."When I heard the price of my artwork during an exhibition in Canada, I shed tears, not because of the amount of money, but because I had to travel outside the country to sell my artwork," he said.Tsimba's thought-provoking sculptures expose the trauma of war, bringing life out of death. He has expressed the tragedies of a woman during the events of conflict and war. He uses objects of war like bullets castings, machetes and discarded metals like spoons and keys.Tsimba said when he was starting off he received lots of criticism from people for taking such a career path, but he chose to follow his passion. Today, he has received numerous awards and distinctions in France and Canada and has participated in over 50 exhibitions in Africa, Europe, Canada and China.

                How the BRI is creating new-age entrepreneurs
            </a>
            <p>
                We are in the midst of the third wave of globalization that focuses on technology creation, trade, and cooperation among developing countries, especially in Eurasia and Africa.New transport infrastructure, partly financed through the Belt and Road Initiative and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, provides the hardware of this globalization. But, people-to-people links are the crucial software.The first post-WWII globalization wave, 1945-1975, boosted trade and growth among Western developed countries. Developing countries were mostly suppliers of raw materials to the then industrialized countries.The second wave, which ran roughly from 1975 to 2010, saw the industrialization of developed countries, but most of their exports flowed to developed countries.In the third wave, we are seeing sustainable trade flows between countries in Asia and Africa, leading to fast development with much less dependence on demand from the high-income countries.April 2019 World Bank research by Maryla Maliszewska and Dominique van der Mensbrugghe estimated that total world GDP will rise more than 0.7 percent by 2030 as a result of increased trade facilitated by the BRI infrastructure.That may not sound like much, but it's a significant percentage of a huge number, so it amounts to as much as $1 trillion and will contribute to lifting 7.6 million people out of extreme poverty and 32 million from moderate poverty, according to the study.Half of this GDP gain will likely flow to BRI economies apart from China. In percentage terms, the largest return accrues to Pakistan with an increase of 10.5 percent in overall real income and the Kyrgyz Republic with 10.4 percent.East Asian economies will also see sizable gains: Thailand (8.2%), Malaysia (7.7%), Cambodia (5%) and Laos (3.1%). About 20 percent of the gain flows to China, which is estimated to see a GDP increase of 0.7 percent. Other big beneficiaries are East African countries (Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Kenya) and Eastern Europe, especially Poland.The new trade made possible by the BRI infrastructure is creating a new generation of entrepreneurs.At the Bishkek summit on June 13-14, the heads of state of the member countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization called for "the development of technology parks and business incubators in the SCO region for the purpose of improving the regional business climate and supporting youth startup projects, including the International Youth Business Incubator of SCO countries within the framework of the SCO Youth Council."I've had the opportunity to meet with lots of young foreigners, mostly students at universities in Beijing, who are working to build new companies in China or that connect their home countries to the Chinese economy. It's exhilarating to see the dynamism of these young entrepreneurs.I accompanied the students on a "walk around Haidian", Beijing's high-tech region, organized by the Zhongguancun Belt and Road Industrial Promotion Association and also met with entrepreneurs through the Global Foundation for Youth Entrepreneurship, which is affiliated with the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. I also attended a Model SCO, in which young people simulated a meeting of the SCO.Many young people are building their lives around these new business opportunities.For example, Svitlana Kutia, an MBA-student from Ukraine, has set up a company called Tech Pool CEE that connects tech companies in Central and Eastern Europe to Chinese tech companies. "Five or seven years ago we heard about Chinese copycats, but currently they are completely different. They have unique projects, unique devices, and actually unique companies. That are going global and succeeding so fast. Foreigners have to pay attention to this and think about how we can succeed in China," she said in an interview with China Daily. She notes that the business climate is safer than in her home country: "I believe the policies here are working better and because of this we can do our business."Abdul Hadi Hanan, from Pakistan, who is working on a master's degree in electrical engineering at Beijing Jiaotong University, said that the BRI is very good for countries that are still developing. For example, in Pakistan, China is investing in energy and infrastructure and is building a road, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, linking the two countries. "China is investing a lot on the education side and the infrastructure side and, after some time, there will be a lot of opportunities and jobs for the people. I think it is a great initiative. So, trade becomes easy."An MBA student from Mexico, who preferred not to be named, said: "I think what Zhongguancun and the Haidian government are doing is just amazing. They use facilities that they already have to build incubators and to link students who have entrepreneurial aspirations. It is not just money. They provide mentorship facilities and help meet regulations. This should be replicated not only in other cities in China, but also in our own countries."And, Saman Pouyanmehr, from Iran, founder and CEO of the GFYE and a recent graduate of the UIBE with a major in finance, said: "China is a unique country that offers unique opportunities and values to entrepreneurs for realizing their goals. I'm very happy that I'm in China at the same time that the Belt and Road Initiative is growing. China soon will be an influential country in the digital economy era through integration of Chinese and foreign talents, and also by introducing world-class startups. The biggest opportunities for entrepreneurs are here."Olim Alimov, from Tajikistan, who is the head of the Beijing office of the United Center for Business Cooperation under the SCO Business Council Secretariat and who also runs a consulting company and imports Russian caviar into China, said: "The Chinese government understands that small and medium-sized businesses are driving the economy now. They understand that they need to boost entrepreneurship to bring innovation. They do everything in order to make it happen for all the entrepreneurs and startups."We feel this support for international entrepreneurs in government policies. For example, in the last year, the tariffs and the taxes for many of the product lists, including the caviar, have dropped significantly. We pay now 40 percent less to bring in caviar than we did two years ago."There is a lot of government support toward building entrepreneurship parks. For example, right here in Zhongguancun, Innoway (an information exchange platform set up by the Beijing and Haidian governments) hosts many international companies. It is basically a one-stop shop. It is one window toward all the resources you can get for a startup. That is a huge, huge boost."However, there is still a long way to go to create a system of easy trade and cross-border entrepreneurship in Eurasia. Delegates to the Model SCO identified visa issues as a major barrier to young entrepreneurs. The Pakistani delegation proposed that an "SCOyouth card" be established to allow young students and entrepreneurs to travel and work throughout the region.The Russian delegation to the SCO said that a key obstacle to entrepreneurship across the region is "lack of easy information and harmonization between national bureaucracies."Other delegates said that key barriers include protectionism and competition from established monopolies.Alimov summed up the view of many young entrepreneurs: "The Belt and Road Initiative is a true vision of connectivity of the Eurasian land mass - not only through infrastructure but also through connectivity of the minds."

            <p>
                The 5th Eastern Economic Forum took place Sept 4–6 in Vladivostok under the motto "The Far East – Development Horizons".   "We are still going to aim high. At the same time, if prior to the first EEF five years ago you would have asked me to guess the future – I don't think I would have said 1800 projects. Perhaps, I would have been ambitious enough to guess 300, and I would have thought that daring. 1800 projects launched in the Far East – it is simply amazing. I am confident: the preferential economic policy, initiated at the behest of the President of the Russian Federation works. It improves people's lives and the Far East is only going to keep getting better year after year. The economy will stay on the rise, there will be more theatres, schools, museums, libraries, and scientific centers," said Yuri Trutnev, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District.Business ProgramThe Forum hosted over 100 panel discussions, roundtables, and business breakfasts dedicated to the most relevant topics on the international and regional agendas. The discussions have been broken into 4 thematic areas:• New Solutions for Accelerating Economic Growth• Improving the Business Environment • The Far East and Asia Pacific: Fostering Collaboration • New Solutions for Improving Quality of LifeKey event of the business program took place Sept 5.

Let us create history together, let us pave the way."  Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Bin Mohamad: "It was great to hear that of all regions, Russia is going to develop the Far East.

                Hangzhou reflects millennia of China history, change
            </a>
            <p>
                China is a country with at least 5,000 years of history. China has seen many changes in its long history from ancient kingdoms to dynasties to the founding of the People’s Republic of China. Perhaps the most rapid and dramatic changes have taken place more recently. Today, the once faraway and cloistered land has become a hotspot for foreign investors, businesses, and visitors from all around the world. The easiest and best way to see these rapid changes is to visit a Chinese city, like Hangzhou.Hangzhou was once the capital of the Song Dynasty (1127-1279). Today it is the capital of East China’s Zhejiang province, just south of Shanghai. Much has changed in Hangzhou since the Song Dynasty. In more recent years, Hangzhou has grown into a world-class city. Foreign trade and investment, as well as business sectors, have seen robust expansion. Hangzhou is home to international trade expos, international investment centers, and the Zhejiang World Trade Center. It is also home to numerous tech start-ups, retail companies, internet developers, and the global e-commerce giant Alibaba. All of this growth and change has greatly improved the local economy and China’s overall GDP.The physical shape of Hangzhou, like most of China, is also changing. Like every major city in China, construction is a constant 24/7 occurrence. The physical alteration of the land has been extraordinary. I currently work in an office in Binjiang district, which five years ago was a rice paddy. Now it is filled with bars, restaurants, cafes, Japanese sushi joints, foreign language schools, water parks, and even a park with a replica of Venice. Also, when I first lived here in 2016, there were only metro Lines 1 and 4. Now there is Line 2, part of Line 5 is open, and 6 additional lines are either planned or under construction. The city and the country show no signs of slowing down the current lightning pace of progress.But perhaps the most striking and visible change China is undergoing can be seen in the faces of its people. Long ago, Chinese cities were top destinations for travelers and traders. Hangzhou was even visited by Marco Polo. Today, China and Hangzhou are enjoying a bit of a golden age when it comes to welcoming foreign visitors and workers. Hangzhou has become a melting pot over the past few years and has high hopes of becoming an international city like its neighbor, Shanghai. I personally have met people from such diverse places as Russia, Yemen, the UK, USA, Ukraine, Madagascar, Zambia, South Africa, Canada, Iceland, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, among countless others. Many come to Hangzhou to either attend university or contribute actively to the work force. When they are not hard at work or studying, many expats are playing a role in Hangzhou’s up and coming arts scene. Expats have been getting together to express themselves at local open mics and art events, adding their flavor to Hangzhou’s creative scene. Groups such as the Hangzhou Writer’s Association or Screaming Lemur Theatre offer a place for writers and performers at all levels and abilities to express themselves. Hangzhou also enjoys local arts festivals, such as Tribe Fest, which is organized almost entirely by expats. It also sponsors the Hangzhou International Theatre Festival, which includes performances from all over the world. In time, Hangzhou’s arts scene might even rival that of Shanghai.In conclusion, China has been undergoing a staggering amount of change and development over the past few years. Hangzhou with its rapid construction, economic development, increasing diversity, and rising and vibrant arts scene, provides an excellent microcosm for the rest of the country. Today’s China is a whole new world compared to its ancient past. Everyday China is evolving and expanding. What China will look like in five years, or even one year is impossible to tell. However, whatever the result, it certainly will be an interesting place to visit and a key player on the world stage.The author is the current administrator and editor for the Hangzhou Writers’ Association International.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

            <p>
                Jinan city's Mayor Sun Shutao issued a direct and exciting invitation at a dialogue with world famous enterprises on Sept 11, to explore new horizons in the metropolis' free trade zone."Companies from home and abroad are welcome to join in the development of Jinan, especially in the construction of the pilot free trade zone, to innovate and try and grow together with the city based on their respective advantages in scientific research, capital, talent, brands and management," he said.Jinan, capital city of East China's Shandong province, has been extending its opening-up to the outside world and encouraging companies to conduct international business by seizing the opportunities brought about by the establishment of the Jinan area of China (Shandong) Pilot Free Trade Zone.Early in August, approval was given for the founding of the pilot zone, marking the formation of an open coordinated development platform which consists of a pilot free trade zone, comprehensive bonded zone and several provincial-level development zones.To date, the Jinan area of the Shandong FTZ has attracted projects with investment of 25.3 billion yuan ($3.58 billion), 36 fund companies with management funds of 140 billion yuan and 10 banks with credit of 20 billion yuan, according to a news conference held in the city on Aug 31."These are just part of the many projects attracted to the Jinan area of Shandong FTZ," Zheng Deyan, vice-mayor of Jinan, told the news conference."More policies and regulations beneficial to economic and trade development will be enacted during the development of the area," said Zheng.Covering 37.99 square kilometers, the Jinan area will focus on the development of artificial intelligence, industrial finance, medical care, culture and information technology. It will carry out comprehensive trials on a new open economy system, as well as build Jinan into an important regional economic center, logistics center and science and technology innovation center in China.To attract more global investors and facilitate overseas business, the Jinan area will create a sound business environment with international competitiveness, Zheng added.

Since its inception, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has been struggling for women's liberation and gender equality. The founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 ushered in a new era for women in China, changing their social status from an oppressed and enslaved group in the past thousands of years to masters of their own fate.In recent 70 years, women's cause in China has been closely connected to the general growth of the CPC and the whole nation. Under the leadership of the CPC, the past few generations of women have contributed greatly to social construction, reform, and development. As the Chinese nation is rising and growing richer and stronger, Chinese women's social status has undergone enormous changes.Since the 18th CPC National Congress, guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, there has been a firmer belief in the future of women development based on Chinese socialism among Chinese women. In this background, women are able to exercise their democratic rights, participate in economic and social development, and benefit from the outcomes of reforms and development on an equal and legal basis. As masters of the nation, women now can find the best ways to fulfill themselves while gaining increasing senses of achievement, happiness, and safety, as witnessed by the historic accomplishments they have made so far.This white paper is issued specifically to the achievements of women's cause in the past 70 years since New China was founded fully known to the whole world.I. Women's Cause Remains High Priority and Is Actively Promoted in ChinaBoosting the comprehensive development of women and achieving gender equality have been perceived as important components of the socialism system with Chinese characteristics. China has always attached great importance to such development and equality. Among the concrete measures taken so far to accomplish these goals are reinforced CPC guidance for women's work, creation and improvement of women's rights protection legislations by the National People's Congress, establishment of practical mechanisms in favor of women's cause by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), setup and improvement of government working systems for implementation of national gender equality policies, and enhancement of the role of the Women's Federation as a bridge between the CPC, the government and the mass of women. Together these measures provide solid political and systematic assurance for the development of women's cause.The CPC has made earnest and persistent efforts in leading and improving the work concerning women in the past 70 years. With women's cause as an important part of its undertaking, the CPC has been striving toward women's liberation and gender equality. In the 12 sessions of the National Women's Congress concluded thus far, guidelines for women movement and work as well as main pertinent tasks were worked out in line with general CPC and government policies for nationwide implementation of relevant plans. With the coming of the new era, the CPC is now leading women's work more devotedly. "Adhering to the fundamental national policy of gender equality, and protecting the legitimate rights and interests of women and minors" were enshrined in the reports of the 18th and 19th CPC National Congress, and accepted as key concepts and parts of the CPC's governance and administration plans. The first conference on improving mass organizations organized by the CPC Central Committee in 2015 determined a direction for the work concerning women in the new era by showing how to promote reforms of the Women's Federation and how to make the organization and work of Women's Federation more politically responsive, up to date, and geared to the demands of the masses. For the CPC, women's cause always plays a significant role in Chinese reform, opening-up, and modernization. Full consideration has been given to actual gender differences and special interests of women in legislation, policy-making, planning, and policy implementation. There are also ongoing efforts in improving a legal system for protecting women's rights and building a firm legal foundation for gender equality and comprehensive development of women. Women development has been incorporated into general national economic and social development plans to facilitate high-level and long-term planning. Such incorporation makes the Chinese women's cause more reflective of modern trends.Enactment and revision of laws by the National People's Congress (NPC) for the protection of women's rights: The NPC is established as a fundamental political system that combines the leadership of the CPC, the running of the country by the people, and rule of law. When faithfully performing their legislation and supervision duties, the NPC and its Standing Committee put great stress on protection of women's rights and promotion of women development. A number of relevant organizations have been set up for these purposes successively, including Women & Children Working Group, Office of Communist Youth League, Trade Union, and Women's Federation under Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee, and Office of Communist Youth League, Trade Union, and Women's Federation under Social Development Affairs Committee. These organizations are established to vigorously promote and implement the gender equality principle stipulated in the Constitution, follow and collect opinions of the Women's Federation and women during legislative review and legal supervision, inspect the enforcement of laws protecting women's rights and other pertinent laws, hear related reports, organize thematic investigations, and take practical measures to protect legal rights of women.Creation and improvement of a working mechanism by the CPPCC for promoting women's cause: The CPPCC plays an important role in the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultations led by the CPC. The National Committee of CPPCC has successively established a number of women work organizations, including Women Working Group, Women and Youth Committee, Women, Youth, and Legal Affairs Committee, and Social and Legal Affairs Committee. These organizations make recommendations on key and difficult issues related to women development, and handle proposals regarding women's rights. Women's Federation is one of the 34 circles defined by the National Committee of the CPPCC. In China, a great number of women participate in political consultation, democratic supervision, and participation in the deliberation and administration of State affairs through consultation workshops, thematic investigations, and proposal submissions, thus promoting women development and gender equality on a continuous basis.
