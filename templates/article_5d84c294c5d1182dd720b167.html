                China condemns unsubstantiated claims of Huawei 'threat'
            </p>
            <p>
                China expressed opposition on Monday to fabricated claims telecoms giant Huawei's 5G poses a so-called security threat to others.Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily news briefing that Beijing opposes curbing Chinese companies undergoing normal telecommunication business and cooperation under the guise of "national security".The United States raised its concerns with Gulf allies over a possible security risk in using Huawei's technology for their 5G mobile infrastructure, Reuters quoted US officials as saying during their visits to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.However, according to a Bloomberg report on Friday, the US semiconductor industry urged US President Donald Trump to make good on his promise to ease the ban on sales to Huawei in a letter dated Sept 11 to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.The US has been abusing national power to suppress and smear certain Chinese enterprises recently, Hua noted, adding "such practices have violated market spirit and international rules, which are shady and immoral".Not a shred of evidence was presented by the US nor any other country, organization or individual to prove it faces threats from Huawei, the spokeswoman said.According to a Daily Mirror report in May no backdoors were found in Huawei's products, and 10 vulnerabilities were discovered in products made by US-based Cisco, Hua said, adding Facebook user accounts were also revealed to have backdoors."If all countries would like to ensure cybersecurity, it is US companies like Cisco and Apple they should be cautious about rather than Huawei," Hua said.Supply chain security issues are not unique to 5G or a single company; these always exist in information and communication technology, she said.She called on various countries to conduct in-depth discussions of security issues and propose feasible suggestions under the premise of fairness, justice and non-discrimination, and jointly safeguard the security of information technology products and services.

                California city tests giving 125 people $500 a month
            </a>
            <p>
                One of the Democratic presidential hopefuls says he'd give every American $12,000 a year. In Stockton, California, 125 people have been getting $500 a month free since February.Maggie Denang, a 63-year-old retired nurse, is one of the recipients of the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED), a pilot program to provide insights on whether a long-term basic income helps lift residents out of poverty."I was shocked. It has never happened to me in my life. It's a surprise, a good surprise," Denang told China Daily of her inclusion into the program.The stipend is distributed monthly to randomly selected residents — who earn at or below the median household income of $46,033 — through prepaid debit cards. There are no work requirements or restrictions on how the money can be spent.The extra money "means a lot to our family. It helps me a whole lot," said Denang. She and her husband, who is disabled, live in an apartment. They rely on her pension."It helps with my rent, electricity, medications and food," said Denang. "It's made my life a lot easier for the last few months."The privately funded SEED program was spearheaded by Stockton Mayor Michael Tubbs and partly financed by the nonprofit Economic Security Project, a network focused on basic income in the US.Two researchers, Amy Castro-Baker at the University of Pennsylvania, and Stacia Adams-West at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, also received a $680,000 grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to evaluate the US' first city-led guaranteed income pilot program."The nature of the American economy is changing, such that the average worker can no longer count on earning the same paycheck week to week. Our current forms of assistance only allow families to access specific resources at one time, like housing vouchers or food assistance," said Castro-Baker and Adams-West in a joint email to China Daily."Guaranteed income gives families the flexibility needed to respond to volatile financial situations and prioritize spending based on their needs," said the researchers. "Our goal is to determine if and how guaranteed income works so it may be scaled out. It is an exciting time for all forms of unconditional cash, including guaranteed income and universal basic income."Universal basic income is an idea dating back to the 18th century. In the 1960s and 1970s, the US and Canada conducted several guaranteed-income experiments. Since the 1980s, the concept has expanded to many countries around the world.The idea has new momentum thanks to the 2020 US presidential race. Candidate and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang advocates for $1,000 monthly universal basic income for all American adults over the age of 18, regardless of one's work status or income. He argues that automation is causing the loss of millions of jobs in the US.The idea of universal basic income has been embraced by the high-tech industry for fear that automation and artificial intelligence would take over human jobs and collapse the society. The supporters include Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who came out in support of basic income.But critics are concerned that the unconditional income would lead to less incentive to work. Barry Broad, chair of the California's Employment Training Panel, said the concept is "a surrender to a kind of grim Dickensian view of the future. It's naive to think universal basic income is going to pay the bills. It's going to at best give people a poverty wage," he said.Yang's plan has been estimated to cost $2.8 trillion per year. He would impose a new tax on businesses' goods and services, while shrinking some other government assistance programs. Yang did not respond to an interview request.The key difference between universal basic income and guaranteed income is that the former is available to everyone, whereas the latter may be targeted to a specific subpopulation, such as women with children, or a geographic area, according to Castro-Baker and Adams-West.Compared with "trillions and trillions of dollars", guaranteed income is more "doable", said Chris Hughes, co-chair of the Economic Security Project, during a discussion at Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics in 2018.Guaranteed income is "evidence based" and "what's still missing is the political will, so that people believe it's possible, doable and desirable to create an income floor", he said.Stockton, in California's Central Valley, has a population of 321,000. The city was once known as the foreclosure capital of America and the nation's largest city, before Detroit, to declare bankruptcy. It is now ranked the second most fiscally solvent city in the US."Unfortunately in the United States there is a long and horrible history of poverty being stereotyped, and there's a lot of gender and racial stereotype attached to it," said SEED director Sukhi Samra. "Our economy isn't working for anyone, particularly for the most marginalized, people of color, and women of color."

                Cyberstars in India get a lift from Chinese app
            </a>
            <p>
                An increasing number of amateur Indian performers are gaining both money and respect through a short-video social media app made in China. Gao Chen, a 30-year-old Chinese woman, has been leading a team in India for Vmate, an app owned by a subsidiary of internet giant Alibaba, to discover talented people and shoot short videos of them doing seemingly ordinary things - dancing, singing, joking or making handicrafts - in ways that grab attention. "We don't just discover these people. We also teach them how to grow their popularity and maintain their visibility on our sharing platform," Gao said. The team has cultivated around 4,000 Indian cybercelebrities in the past year. They include households, elderly women, laborers and street vendors. "I often go to talk with them to evaluate whether they can represent a group of people and get the public attention," she said. As the influence of short videos increases, they can change people's lives. For example, Komal Singh, a woman in northeastern India, started by uploading videos of herself dancing indoors. Gao's team discovered through big data analysis that app users tend to click on videos of women wearing traditional Indian clothes. So she suggested to Singh that she do her dances in colorful costumes, and that she find better backgrounds outside her home. After half a year, Singh has accumulated more than 1 million fans on Vmate, which has also brought her a respectable income of more than 20,000 rupees ($280) per month. Singh told Gao that she learned about videos from her husband, who now steps in to help with housework when she is busy recording her dances - unusual in an Indian family. "Many Indian women like Singh have achieved fame and money from Vmate, earning them new respect in their families," Gao said. "It's not just about their domestic status being raised. They become more independent overall." Predictably, not everyone is an instant fan of short videos. Take, for example, the business boss of Suresh Kumar, an employee who uses the stage name Suru to sell women's clothes at a sari store in Surat, Gujarat state. Kumar puts on saris to show them off through the online videos. A sari typically consists of a long swath of cloth that wraps around the waist, with one end draped over the shoulder, leaving one's bare belly exposed, so it's an interesting visual for Vmate followers. Kumar's boss was not a fan at first, worrying that the mini-shows would affect the business. Gradually, however, the videos brought more customers to the store. The number of Suru fans has been increasing steadily. Now the boss has changed his mind, and he's a Vmate fan, too, Kumar said. Launched in 2016, Vmate, owned by Alibaba's UC Web, initially offered full-length movies but later shifted to user-generated short videos. In May, Alibaba announced an investment of $100 million in Vmate, demonstrating how serious it is about the growing social video app market - something it missed out on in China. Many of the features Vmate offers parallel those offered by Byte-Dance's TikTok, which currently has more than 120 million active users in India. Other similar platforms, such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Snapchat, are also in the mix. Cheng Daofang, chief executive of Vmate, said the app now has 30 million monthly active users worldwide. The company's overseas strategy is "local innovation", a strategy being applied to India that has proved effective in China, but with a more local angle. "We will follow the Indian market closely to grasp the changes and opportunities," he said. Cheng believes that globalization will flow from localization. "We have Chinese employees working in India, cooperating with Indian staff to explore quality content," he said. "During this process, the key is to understand local users, cultures and young Indians' lifestyles and thoughts... We made correct decisions at the right time in India based on our preliminary studies of the market." At the end of 2017, as Vmate accelerated, India's 4G network was also developing rapidly. It has provided strong hardware foundation for data-intensive videos. From a cultural perspective, Indian people are said to be more outgoing than Chinese. They are not shy when facing cameras, Cheng said. "When you take pictures of Indians, they will grab you to take pictures together," he said. "The short videos can overcome the obstacles of language and culture and spread the happiness to whoever wants to watch."

                Housing costs send some in California to RVs
            </a>
            <p>
                Marvin and his family moved into a recreational vehicle on a street in Mountain View, California, two years ago, after their apartment rent became unaffordable.The 27-year-old Walmart employee, who gave only his first name, now lives with his mother, elder sister, younger brother and his sister's 4-year-old daughter in the RV, which has two beds, a sofa bed and a sofa.Despite the lack of personal space and the roar of trains whizzing by, Marvin said living in the RV is convenient, as the family can use bathrooms in a nearby park and shower at a gym. The biggest upside is the cost: the RV rental is only $500 a month."We can save up more money. I hope we can move into apartment and my niece can go to a kindergarten," he said.Dozens of camper vans and RVs are parked on Crisanto Avenue. Some are in a dilapidated state with rusted side panels; some of the windows are covered with aluminum foil; one van has a flat tire on the back.Another van, whose windows are not fully covered, is packed with so many items that one can hardly imagine there¡¯s any living space left.The people in vehicles parked on Crisanto Avenue and on other streets in several California cities are the fallout from the state's lack of affordable housing. California has the nation's steepest home prices and the highest state poverty rate once housing costs are figured in, according to officials.Not all those sleeping in vehicles are without a job. Some have been priced out of renting an apartment or house or somehow have economically been forced out of their homes.Maria, a woman in her 60s, recently became an RV resident after losing her job in a nursery due to knee problems."Her husband still works at the nursery. She relies on her husband now. I also take care of her sometimes," Rosario, Maria's niece, told China Daily, as Maria doesn't speak English.Rosario, who preferred to be identified by his first name only, said most of the RV dwellers there are experiencing similar situations. What makes the situation difficult is that they are often forced to move their vehicles by police or get parking tickets, she said.A similar scene took place along Church Street, outside Eagle Park, about a 30-minute walk from Crisanto Avenue. A resident said the street has been an RV park at least for the two years since he moved here.About two miles from the park in Mountain View is the sprawling headquarters of Google. The tech company, which has 45,000 employees in the region, has been criticized by activists for contributing to rising rents and a housing shortage.Google and other tech giants such as Facebook and Apple have been urged to accept responsibility and to address their impact on rents and housing prices. In June, Google announced it would invest $1 billion to develop affordable housing and address homelessness in the region.In Mountain View, rents have increased 50 percent since 2010, according to a report by activist group Silicon Valley Rising in April 2018."Unaffordable rents have pushed working people in Mountain View into the RVs that now line many city streets," says the report.In Santa Clara County, the center of Silicon Valley, the homeless population has increased by 31 percent since 2017, and now stands at about 9,706, according to the county's 2019 homeless census and survey.This year's survey found 18 percent of the respondents staying in a vehicle, a "substantial" increase from previous years. The number of individuals living in cars, RVs and vans has increased 146 percent since 2015, reaching 3,655 individuals in 2019.People are living in vehicles not just because of the high cost of housing but also because they have encountered personal events that led to financial challenges, or they prefer sleeping in an RV or car to long daily commutes, according to a recent report by Palo Alto's Policy and Services Committee."I stay here on weekdays only," said Andrew, who gave only his first name, while cleaning his trailer parked on El Camino Real, just outside Stanford University in Palo Alto.The plumber has been working on construction sites at Stanford University in the past few years. But his family lives in Sacramento, 120 miles away, for the low rents there.The round trip usually takes him six hours, so he chooses to sleep in the trailer during the week and go home on weekends to join his wife and son.He said he knew several construction workers living in RVs as well. "It's easy to find work but difficult to find a place to live," he said.The mile-long stretch of El Camino Real is lined with vans, RVs and cars. Residents have been complaining about safety, "blight caused by unkempt RVs", sanitation issues and parking impact, according to the city's Policy and Services Committee report.Many other cities in California have reported an increase in people living in RVs, small campers and cars on residential streets, in industrial parks and church parking lots.In San Francisco, 1,794 people live in vehicles, which accounts for 68 percent of the rise in homeless population between 2017 and 2019, according to the city's homeless count released in May.The city of Oakland found the number of people living in vehicles in 2019 almost doubled that of 2017.In the Greater Los Angeles area, more than 16,500 people were living in their cars, vans and RVs in 2019, almost 1,000 more than last year, according to the area's homeless count.California had about 130,000 homeless people as of 2018, according to the US Interagency Council on Homelessness. The number is second-highest in state history after the Great San Francisco Earthquake in 1906 left more than 200,000 people homeless.A recent survey by Quinnipiac University found that more than 80 percent of the 1,125 Californian voters say homelessness in California is a "very serious" issue and that nearly 60 percent of them say the cost of housing is a major cause.San Francisco is the most expensive rental market in the US, followed by New York and Boston, according to a June report by San Francisco-based rental platform Zumper. Average rent for a one bedroom is $3,700, and two bedrooms is $4,720, says the report.In San Jose, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $2,524 a month; in Mountain View, rents for a two-bedroom have reached nearly $4,000 a month, as Google has pursued aggressive expansion plans, according to the Silicon Valley Rising report.The affordable housing crisis, partly due to wages not keeping pace with low-wage families' housing costs, has forced the families to cram together in small apartments and make unhealthy trade-offs between rent and other essentials, according to the report.The cities, under the pressure to get RV dwellers off the street, are launching "safe parking programs". Mountain View has partnered with non-profit organizations to use a former light-rail stop as a parking site for vehicle-dwellers and eventually, an affordable housing project. Palo Alto is in the process of selecting potential sites.San Francisco also is taking action on opening a Vehicle Triage Center near a railway station, which would provide safe parking and basic services – bathrooms, sanitation and social services –to people living in vehicles.The proposal by Supervisor Ahsha Safai was met with strong opposition from local residents who consider the RV dwellers a nuisance or an eyesore that brings down the value of their communities.Despite the residents' protest, San Francisco has recently approved the proposal to transform a parking lot into a safe lot for vehicle-dwellers. The pilot program for 33 RVs and cars would last a year. After that, the land would be turned into affordable housing by the city.Those that are living in vehicles are not the "hardcore homeless" that people think about, such as those with drug addictions or mental health issues, said Safai. "They are a very different subset of the homeless population," he said.Dozens of RVs and vans parked along Crisanto Avenue, close to Rengstorff Park in Mountain View, California.

                Renzi strains Italy coalition in bid for new party
            </a>
            <p>
                ROME - Former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi announced on Tuesday that he was leaving the center-left Democratic Party, or PD, to form his own party, potentially destabilizing the days-old ruling coalition."I have decided to leave the PD and to build together with others a new house to do politics differently," Renzi wrote on Facebook, barely a week after the PD's coalition with the Five Star Movement won a confidence motion in parliament.Renzi is not himself part of the new government, formed through the unlikely alliance between PD and Five Star in order to thwart far-right leader and now ex-interior minister Matteo Salvini's bid to call snap elections he thought would make him premier.But Renzi, who was hailed as a reformer when he became Italy's youngest premier at the age of 39 in 2014, was a divisive figure within the PD, particularly for the party's left which is largely loyal to party leader Nicolas Zingaretti."After seven years of friendly fire I think we must take note that our values, our ideas, our dreams, cannot every day be the object of internal quarrels," Renzi wrote.He resigned as premier in 2016 and fraught relations within the PD prompted repeated speculation that Renzi would split to form his own, more politically centrist, party."The victory we got in parliament against populism and Salvini was important to save Italy, but it's not enough," Renzi wrote.Renzi said that around 30 lawmakers would announce loyalty to him but he said he would continue to support Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's government.He called Conte on Monday to reassure him that "I'm leaving the PD but (my) support for the government remains certain," the Corriere della Sera newspaper reported.Between 18 and 20 MPs will follow Renzi, out of the PD's 111 total. Twenty MPs are needed to form an autonomous parliamentary group. Around 10 senators out of the PD's 51 would also follow, the Corriere reported."Today the PD is a set of currents," Renzi told Tuesday's La Repubblica newspaper."And I fear that it will not be able on its own to respond to Salvini's attacks and to the difficult cohabitation with the M5S," he said, referring to Five Star."I believe that there is space for something new. Not from the center or the left, but from what has occupied the least-used space in Italian politics: the space of the future," he told the left-leaning daily."I won't tell you the name but it won't be a traditional party," Renzi said.PD leader Zingaretti lamented what he called "an error"."We are sorry. ... But now let's think about Italians' future, work, environment, business, education, investments. A new agenda and the need to rebuild hope with good governance and a new PD," Zingaretti tweeted.Agence France-Presse

In June, Google announced it would invest $1 billion to develop affordable housing and address homelessness in the region.In Mountain View, rents have increased 50 percent since 2010, according to a report by activist group Silicon Valley Rising in April 2018. "Unaffordable rents have pushed working people in into the RVs that now line many city streets," says the report.In Santa Clara County, the center of Silicon Valley, the homeless population has increased 31 percent since 2017 to about 9,706, according to the county's 2019 homeless census and survey.The survey found 18 percent of respondents staying in a vehicle, a "substantial" increase from previous years. The number of individuals living in RVs, cars and vans has increased 146 percent since 2015, reaching 3,655 individuals in 2019, according to the survey.People are living in vehicles not just because of high rents but due to financial problems, a preference for vehicle living or long daily commutes, according to a recent report by Palo Alto's Policy and Services Committee.Safety concernsThe mile-long stretch of El Camino Real, just outside Stanford University in Palo Alto, is lined with vans, RVs and cars. Residents have been complaining about safety, "blight caused by unkempt RVs", sanitation problems and the impact on parking spaces, according to the city's Policy and Services Committee report.In San Francisco, 1,794 people live in vehicles, which would account for a 68 percent of the rise in the homeless population between 2017 and 2019, according to the city's biennial Homeless Point-in-Time Count released in May.San Francisco is the most expensive rental market in the US, followed by New York and Boston, according to a June report by San Francisco-based rental platform Zumper. The average rent for a one-bedroom home is $3,700; for a two-bedroom unit, it is $4,720.In San Jose, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $2,524 a month; in Mountain View, rents for a two-bedroom apartment have reached nearly $4,000 a month as Google aggressively expands, according to the Silicon Valley Rising report.In the Greater Los Angeles Area, more than 16,500 people live in their cars, vans and RVs in 2019, almost 1,000 more than that of last year, according to the area's homeless count.The cities, under pressure to get RV dwellers off the street, are launching "safe parking programs". Mountain View has partnered with nonprofit organizations to use a former light rail stop as a parking site for vehicle dwellers. Eventually, it will be the site of an affordable housing project. Palo Alto also is in the process of selecting potential sites.San Francisco is opening a Vehicle Triage Center near a railway station, which would provide safe parking and basic services - bathrooms, sanitation, and social services - to people living in vehicles.The proposal by city Supervisor Ahsha Safai met with strong opposition from local residents who consider the RV dwellers a nuisance or an eyesore that brings down the value of their communities.Those that are living in vehicles are not the "hardcore homeless" that people think about, like drug addicts or mental health issues, said Safai."They are a very different subset of the homeless population," he said.

                Successful China-Kenya ties building shared future
            </a>
            <p>
                Bilateral friendship has strengthened since establishment of ties 56 years agoOn the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, it is worth hailing robust China-Kenya ties, which mark 56 years of existence this year. Just as China has come far, the partnership between the two peoples has overcome many challenges and is now headed toward greater prosperity.Chairman Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the PRC on Oct 1, 1949. At that time, Jomo Kenyatta, who later become Kenya's founding president, was leading the Mau Mau movement to take the Kenyan people on the road to national sovereignty. In 1963, when Kenya finally gained independence, China and Kenya established diplomatic relations. In 1978, China adopted the reform and opening-up strategy and signed a trade agreement with Kenya.Over the past 70 years, China has risen from a struggling agriculture-based economy to becoming the world's second-largest economy. Trade and economic cooperation between China and Kenya has also touched unprecedented levels.Since arriving in Kenya this March, I've felt the depth and breadth of China-Kenya friendship and cooperation. It is touching to read comments like "with your projects you've never disappointed us".This was on a post on the embassy's Facebook page about a Chinese company successfully completing the transmission line for the Lake Turkana Wind power plant within a record six months. The Kenyan government itself has hailed it as "engineering magic in Kenya's history".Equally delightful are stories of how Chinese companies have actively leveraged their equipment and human resources to help residents. China Wuyi invested over $20,000 and 508 hours of labor to build six water ponds that would help 3,000 residents secure water supply for their households, farming and animal husbandry. China International Water& Electric built water reservoirs and donated diesel-powered pumps and generators to benefit 1,200 residents in Bubisa.Even Kenyan staff of Chinese companies are involved in social responsibility. China Communication Construction Company (CCCC) set up a free medical camp in Suswa, providing basic physical examinations and free medication to about 1,000 people of the Maasai community. A Maasai employee at CCCC, named Elizabeth, served as an interpreter at the camp. From queue management, physical examination, consulting the doctors to distributing prescriptions and medicines, Elizabeth and her co-workers were needed at every step. Their faces beamed with joy as they helped their own people.The China-Kenya partnership is buzzing in over 100 major projects developed jointly by both countries in the past 56 years. The outstanding ones include the Moi International Stadium in Nairobi, the Thika Superhighway, the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway and the soon-to-be-launched Nairobi to Naivasha SGR.As of May 31, the second anniversary of its passenger train service, the Mombasa-Nairobi SGR had transported 300 million passengers and 440,000 twenty-foot equivalent units of cargo and maintained a safe operation record of 731 days. The railway provides the region with a fast lane to growth and prosperity. As one of the early success stories under the Belt and Road Initiative framework, it is a clear demonstration of the value generated by China-Africa industrial cooperation.Cooperation between China and Kenya is not defined by the SGR alone. Major projects invested by the Chinese side include laying of high-speed internet connectivity lines by Huawei, promoting industrial upgrading, job creation for Kenyans, and contributing to sustainable community livelihoods.For years, China has been one of Kenya's top trading partners, and a major source of foreign direct investment. Last year, China's non-financial direct investment in Kenya doubled to about $520 million.Today, there are more than 400 Chinese businesses operating in Kenya, creating nearly 130,000 jobs for residents. These companies have played an important role in accelerating advancement of President Uhuru Kenyatta's development blueprint - or Big Four Agenda - of food security, manufacturing, health and housing.China is helping Kenya grow through adding value to agricultural products for export. The two sides recently signed a couple of agreements to give the vast China market preferential access to Kenya's agricultural products.Thanks to mutual understanding on many international and regional issues, the two countries continue to expand and deepen cooperation in all fields. The China-Africa Joint Research Center and China-Kenya Laboratory for Crop Molecular Biology were established in Kenya. This year, over 180 Kenyans were awarded Chinese government-sponsored scholarships to study in China.During seven decades of relentless progress under the Communist Party of China, the country has cultivated a middle-income population of over 400 million and lifted some 800 million people out of poverty. By the end of 2020, China will have taken all rural residents living below the current poverty line out of poverty.As China moves forward, it will continue to boost bilateral exchanges to help Kenya achieve industrialization and modernization and bring tangible benefits to the people of both countries while striding toward a shared future.The author is Chinese ambassador to Kenya.

                New Zealand PM welcomes Facebook's action against extremism
            </a>
            <p>
                WELLINGTON - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Wednesday welcomed Facebook's initiative on technology improvement and policy shift to prevent the harm of social media."These are the kinds of efforts the Christchurch Call to Action was designed for as we try to eliminate the spread of terrorist and violent extremist content online," Jacinda Ardern said.Facebook announced on Wednesday that they were expanding a program that redirects people to extremism intervention sites in Australia and Indonesia."We plan to continue expanding this initiative and we're consulting partners to further build this program in Australia and explore potential collaborations in New Zealand," Facebook said in a statement.According to Ardern, when people search for terms associated with hate and extremism, they will be directed to local organizations in Australia and Indonesia, like EXIT Australia and ruangngobrol.id, which helps individuals leave the direction of violent extremism and terrorism.Ardern announced in April that New Zealand and France will bring together countries and tech companies in order to prevent social media from being used as platforms to promote terrorism.The act came in the wake of the March 15 terrorist attack in New Zealand city of Christchurch."Facebook's actions highlight some of the early success of the Christchurch Call and show real change is happening. There is more work to do, but we have made a good start," Ardern said.

                As rents rise, some opt for RVs in California
            </a>
            <p>
                Marvin and his family moved into a recreational vehicle on a street in Mountain View, California, two years ago, after their apartment rent became unaffordable. The 27-year-old Walmart employee, who gave only his first name, lives with his mother, elder sister, younger brother and his sister's four-year-old daughter in the RV, which has two beds, a sofa bed and a sofa. Despite the lack of personal space and the noise of trains whizzing by, Marvin said living in the RV is convenient as the family can use bathrooms in a nearby park and shower at a gym. The biggest upside is the RV rental is only $500 a month. Depending on the size and features, an RV can cost anywhere from $10,000 to $300,000. "We can save up more money. I hope we can move into apartment and my niece can go to a kindergarten," he said. Dozens of camper vans and RVs are parked on Crisanto Avenue. Some are in a dilapidated state. People in vehicles on Crisanto Avenue and other streets in several California cities are a fallout of the state's lack of affordable housing. California has the nation's highest home prices, according to officials. Maria, a woman aged about 60, recently became an RV resident after losing her job in a nursery due to knee problems. "Her husband still works at the nursery. She relies on her husband now. I also take care of her sometimes," Rosario, Maria's niece, said, as Maria doesn't speak English. Rosario, who preferred to be identified only by her first name, said most of the RV dwellers there are experiencing similar situations. They are often forced to move their vehicles by police or get parking tickets, she said. The same scene is along Church Street, outside the Eagle Park, about a 30-minute walk from Crisanto Avenue. About two miles from the park in Mountain View is Google's headquarters. The tech company with 45,000 employees in the region has been criticized by activists for contributing to rising rents. Google and other tech giants such as Facebook and Apple have been urged to address their impact on rents and housing prices.

The number of individuals living in cars, RVs and vans has increased 146 percent since 2015, reaching 3,655 in 2019. People are living in vehicles not just because of the high cost of housing but also because they have encountered personal events that lead to financial challenges, or they prefer sleeping in an RV or car to long daily commutes, according to a recent report by Palo Alto's Policy and Services Committee. Many other cities in California have reported an increase in people living in RVs, small campers and cars on residential streets, in industrial parks and church parking lots. In San Francisco, 1,794 people live in vehicles, or 68 percent rise in the homeless population between 2017 and 2019, according to the city's homeless count released in May. In the Greater Los Angeles Area, more than 16,500 people live in their cars, vans and RVs in 2019, almost 1,000 more than that of last year, according to the area's homeless count. San Francisco is the most expensive rental market in the US, followed by New York and Boston, according to a June report by San Francisco-based rental platform Zumper.
