                Move will help aviation industry get involved in global supply chain systemCommercial Aircraft Corp of China, the manufacturer of China's first home-built narrow-body passenger jet C919, said it will start manufacturing the first aircraft later this year and it aims to get airworthiness certification and deliver to China Eastern Airlines in two to three years.Now, four C919 test jets－the 101,102, 103 and 104 prototypes－are in intense flying tests, static tests and other ground tests at test bases including Yanliang district in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, Dongying in Shandong province, and Nanchang in Jiangxi province. Another two new test jets, the 105 and 106, will be put into tests within this year. So far, 815 orders have been placed for the C919 from home and abroad."The manufacturing of the C919 will help the Chinese aviation industry to be involved in the world's supply chain system of large aircraft, and China will be able to acquire valuable experience," said Wang Yanan, editor-in-chief of Aerospace Knowledge magazine."The C919 still needs to undergo several tests to showcase that it is a safe, fuel-efficient, and convenient aircraft. The Chinese aviation industry could transform from a manufacturing giant to an innovation power," he said.Meanwhile, the CR929 long-range wide-body aircraft, which is co-developed by China and Russia, has finished conceptual designs, and now it is in the stage of selecting suppliers."Aero engine makers General Electric Aviation of the United States and Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc of the United Kingdom, among others, are in the bidding process, and we will announce the result at a later stage," Yang Yang, deputy general manager of marketing and sales at COMAC, said at the ongoing Aviation Expo China in Beijing on Wednesday.The CR929 will mainly target markets in China, Russia and other Asia-Pacific countries. Its competing models include the Airbus'A330 and Boeing's B787.Besides, the ARJ21, China's first home built regional passenger jetliner, has already been put into use with 15 aircraft by Chengdu Airlines and Genghis Khan Airlines. In August, three major State-owned airlines－Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines－each ordered 35 new ARJ21 aircraft, indicating the model will start all-around commercial use in the country."The market for the ARJ21 is better than we expected. We have an order of 596 aircraft, and about 200 of them have been put into production plan. Now, we have two production lines in Shanghai," Yang said."With a growing demand from customers, we will be able to expand the annual capacity to about 50 in total. We are also looking at the opportunities to export the aircraft to Southeast Asian countries and Africa," he said.In late August, the ARJ21 aircraft undertook a three-day demonstration flight in Southwest China, to showcase its performance in plateau areas. COMAC said the plateau market would become an important growth segment for the aircraft, as the model is suitable to fly in highland areas.Separately, COMAC released its forecast for China's aviation market in the next 20 years on Wednesday. It predicted Chinese airlines would need 10,344 airplanes by 2038. Boeing released its forecast on Tuesday and raised its forecast for China, saying that over the next 20 years, Chinese carriers will need 8,090 new airplanes.

            <p class="style-content">
                Four C919s, large civil jet aircraft developed by China, are undergoing intensive test flights according to the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China Ltd as Chinanews.com reported on Sept 18.COMAC said the C919 has been developed in accordance with international civil aviation regulations, and COMAC owns independent intellectual property rights for the single-aisle trunkliner. The corporation plans to place six C919 in test fights, four of which have been underway in Shanghai, Xi'an, Dongying and Nanchang. The other two aircraft are in assembly and slated to be put into test flight this year.Development progress for CR929, a long-range widebody aircraft jointly developed by China and Russia, is also steady, and the Sino-Russian joint venture for the plane is in sound operation. The concept definition stage for the jet has finished. The joint venture is now carrying out work such as supplier selection and general planning. CR929 is designed with a flight range of 12,000 kilometers and a layout of 280 seats.COMAC added its self-developed regional jetliner ARJ21 has good performance in plateau areas and high temperature conditions, with outstanding anti-crosswind capability. The regional jet meets demands of airports with mixed take-off-and-landing conditions in central and western China. As of now, 15 of the ARJ21-700 have been delivered to Chengdu Airlines and Genghis Khan Airlines where they serve 28 routes, having transported more than 500,000 passengers in 31 cities.As per COMAC, it will enhance communication with its clients, providers and cooperators and beef up marketing for ARJ21, C919 and CR929 during the ongoing 18th Aviation Expo China, which opened on Sept 18 in Beijing.

                Nike has seen a rapid reduction in it's carbon footprint during manufacturing and transportation, as China leads the way in utilizing alternative energy, said the group's chief sustainability officer.During his recent visit to China, Noel Kinder said brands like Nike play a key role in driving positive change, as the company has replaced 75 percent of its energy consumption with renewable energy across its global operations this year alone.The company is also vowing to help its partners become more efficient and sustainable, and in China, such efforts have paid off, with factories reducing waste by 12 percent from the 2016 to 2018 fiscal year. From the 2015 to 2018 fiscal year, its strategic footwear suppliers in China reduced energy consumption used per pair of shoes by 19 percent."At Nike, we build long-term relationships with our contract manufacturing suppliers because we know having trust and mutual respect supports our ability to create products more responsibly," he said.As China has been accelerating its pace in adopting electrical vehicles to help lower environmental manufacturing impacts recent years, Kinder said the country has been leading the way in the use of alternative energy, giving Nike certain advantages in reducing its carbon footprint during transportation."Logistically, we have worked with some tracking companies that were thinking of adopting e-vehicles, so our carbon footprint would go down very quickly," he said.According to Nike, the company has been utilizing LNG (liquefied natural gas) for long-haul transportation in China on about 30 percent of its cross-province routes. Continuous efforts have also been placed on electric vans for in-city deliveries such as in Zhengzhou, where e-van deliveries have successfully reached 100 percent."With increasing emphasis placed on alternative energy in China, Nike has been motivated to adjust its focus in this aspect of moving our products," he said.
