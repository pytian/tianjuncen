                China at 70: Learning from a nation transformed
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                With China preparing to celebrate the 70th anniversary of its founding on Oct 1, 2019, China's worldview in the multipolar "Asian Century" is based on the twin pillars. One pillar focuses on promoting economic connectivity (through the Belt & Road Initiative) driven by energy and ecology, ports and pipelines, and roads and railways. And the other one considers cultural cooperation (via the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations held recently in Beijing) through forging people-to-people connectivity, particularly among youth, media, academia, think tanks and tourism.What is unique about China's remarkable transformation in a relatively short span of 70 years, which makes it a role model in the 21st century?Primarily, the nation's success with alleviating poverty stands out. Within a generation or so, China has lifted over 750 million people out of poverty, a feat without precedent in human history. Changing so many lives for the better in such a short span of time is indeed unique. This huge success in poverty alleviation on such a size, scale and speed is what has inspired and impressed the world about the China model. Three vital ingredients of this success story in poverty alleviation are noteworthy: leadership with vision based on stability and continuity of policy, opening-up the economy to foreign investment by slashing bureaucratic red-tape and eliminating cumbersome rules and tedious procedures, and establishment of special economic zones (SEZs) and industrial parks. Neighbors and steadfast partners of China, like Pakistan, are hoping to learn from the Chinese role model in poverty alleviation, a process which Pakistan, a country of 210 million, has already begun. Mutual learning is a key element of this development story. After all, it was Deng Xiaoping's visit to Singapore in 1978 that spawned the first industrial park at Suzhou.Pakistan is fortunate that the launching of the BRI, undoubtedly the most important diplomatic and developmental initiative of the 21st century, provided the opportunity to begin the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the flagship and pilot project of the BRI. Within five years, CPEC has launched Pakistan on the trajectory to a better future, generating 70,000 jobs, plus registering the highest growth in a decade (5.8 percent) in 2018, and, more importantly, instilling new hope, confidence and faith in the future for young Pakistanis who comprise 65 percent of the population. Nine of the 21 early harvest projects have been completed, dormant projects like the Gwadar Port have been revived, and Pakistan has witnessed the easing of its chronic energy shortages of the past three decades, all thanks to CPEC.However, with the initiation of the second phase of CPEC, announced last month in Beijing at the second Belt and Road Forum, the best of CPEC has yet to come. With a focus on socioeconomic development, six areas have been identified for people-centric investment: health, education, agriculture, water and irrigation, poverty alleviation, and vocational training. A total of 27 projects will be initiated in these six sectors in the less-developed and backward parts of the country for inclusive development, pushed by a generous Chinese grant of $1 billion, apart from the nearly $20 billion already invested in energy and infrastructure. Four SEZs are in the offing in different parts of the country, where relocation of Chinese small and medium-sized enterprises, plus joint ventures in specific areas, are planned. China has also offered 20,000 scholarships for Pakistanis in the next three years, on top of the 28,000 Pakistani students already studying in China. A key component of this growth strategy is making it environmentally friendly, with green development as its hallmark.Pakistan feels that the most important implication of the China model is the manner in which China has helped transform the lives of millions of its citizens for the better. This example is helping to shape Pakistan's quest for a better tomorrow through policies and initiatives beneficial to its people.Senator Mushahid Hussain, chairman of the Pakistan Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, first visited China in the early 1970s and since then has seen firsthand China’s transformation through nearly 90 visits over four decades.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                ISLAMABAD, Pakistan - At least one security guard was killed and several people were injured when three or four gunmen stormed a five-star hotel in the Gwadar district of Pakistan's southwest Balochistan province on Saturday, several official reports suggested. The Inter-Services Public Relations, Pakistani military's media wing, said in a statement that three terrorists attempted forced entry into Pearl Continental Hotel Gwadar, and were challenged by security guards who restrained them to a staircase. Balochistan Minister for Home Mir Zia Ullah Langau told local media that army and paramilitary troops were carrying out a joint operation against the militants. Langau said that the security forces took timely action to evacuate most parts of the hotel. Some local media reports said that Navy helicopters were used to shift hotel guests to safer places. Meanwhile, sharing initial reports with Xinhua on condition of anonymity, senior security sources from Gwadar said that four militants camouflaging as security personnel entered the hotel and engaged in a gunbattle with the hotel's private and public security personnel, leaving three of them dead. The dead included two private security guards and a soldier, the sources added. The militants were later cornered and killed on the first floor of the hotel by security forces, and a combing operation is going on which may take several hours to conclude, said the security sources. They added that three people including two security personnel and a civilian were also injured in the shootout, and had been shifted to a nearby hospital. The militants were using sophisticated weapons, and hurled hand grenades inside the hotel, the sources said. Separatist group Balochistan Liberation Army's (or BLA) Majeed Brigade faction confirmed the attack from an unverified Twitter account, warning to carry more attacks in the future. The BLA also released a picture of four militants wearing army uniforms and carrying weapons, claiming that they killed themselves after carrying out the attack at the hotel.

                ISLAMABAD -- At least eight people including three militants, four civilians and a navy person were killed and six others injured when three militants stormed a five-star hotel in Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province on Saturday, a military statement said Sunday.The suspects attempted entry into Pearl Continental Hotel located in Gwadar district of the province with an aim to target and take hostage the guests in the hotel, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Pakistani military's media wing, said in the statement."Security guards at the entry challenged terrorists denying them the entry into main hall and terrorists went to staircase leading to upper floors," the ISPR said, adding that the militants kept on firing indiscriminately while moving to staircase, killing and injuring hotel staff.Quick reaction forces of the army, the navy and the police immediately reached the hotel and evacuated guests and staff present in the hotel besides restricting the terrorists within the corridor of the fourth floor of the five-storey hotel."After ensuring safe evacuation of guests and staff, clearance operation was launched to take on terrorists. Meanwhile, terrorists had made CCTV cameras dysfunctional and planted IEDs (improvised explosive devices) on all entry points leading to 4th floor," said the statement.Security forces made special entry points to get into 4th floor, shot down all terrorists and cleared planted IEDs, the statement added.A few hours after the attack on Saturday, Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist organization of Baloch militants, claimed the attack in a tweet from an unverified Twitter account.The BLA also released a picture of four people clad in security forces uniform, claiming them as the miscreants who attacked the hotel.Prime Minister Imran Khan condemned the attack, saying that the attempt is an effort to sabotage the country's economic projects and prosperity, and vowed that they will not allow such plans to succeed.Saturday's attack was the fourth major attack in Balochistan in less than a month. BLA and its allied groups claimed two of the four attacks that hit the province during the period.The earlier attack happened at Makran coastal highway in Gwadar district last month when about 15 to 20 militants stopped five passenger vehicles and killed 14 security personnel after identifying and off-loading them from the vans and letting the vehicles to leave with other civilian passengers.Following the attack, militant group BRAS, formed with the alliance of BLA and two other Baloch nationalist groups warned of more attacks on the economic interests of Pakistan.Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said that the BRAS militants have their settlements including training camps across Pakistan-Iran border, in Iran, and they escaped back to the country after carrying out the attack in Balochistan.He said that his country shared actionable intelligence with Iran and is awaiting positive response from Iranian authorities, who assured them to take action against the militants after investigations.The other attack that hit Balochistan during the last one month targeted an ethnic community of minority Shiite Muslims in provincial capital of Quetta. The attack left 20 people killed and scores others injured.In a separate explosion in Balochistan earlier this week three people including a tribal elder were killed in a remote-controlled explosion.

                    Terrorism threat in South Asia must be met with joint action: China Daily editorial
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                There are clear and worrying signs that the Islamic State terrorist group is seeking to regroup in South Asia: On Friday, it claimed it has established a "province" in India. Prior to this, it claimed responsibility for the Easter Sunday bomb attacks in Sri Lanka that killed more than 250 people.In a separate development, the Balochistan Liberation Army, a separatist organization, claimed responsibility for an attack on a five-star hotel in Gwadar, Pakistan, on Saturday, in which at least eight people were killed.All these should sound the alarm for heightened counterterrorism measures in South Asia as the region now faces rising risks from the infiltration and reorganization of IS terrorists driven from Syria and Iraq, as well as the menace of local separatist elements which have long resorted to violence and bloodshed to pursue their political agendas.The IS group claimed it had set up branches in countries in Central and South Asia, including Afghanistan and Pakistan, during its heyday. After being defeated in Syria and Iraq in April, the terrorist group may see South Asia as a convenient location for it to regroup and bolster its ranks.The IS group's ambition should be throttled from the very beginning because it is not only related to the global anti-terrorism campaign but also presents a new, tangible threat to a region that is already afflicted with many security woes including those from the Taliban and various local separatist and extremist groups.Mutual trust among countries in South Asia remains low due to territorial disputes, security loopholes, underdevelopment and poverty. This has provided fertile soil in which terrorist and extremist groups can grow and instigate violence and bloodshed.To rid the region of the scourge of terrorism and extremism, countries need to show greater political will to work together to eliminate terrorism ad extremism. They also need to properly handle their territorial disputes so that terrorist groups such as the IS will not be able to take advantage of worsening security outlooks in some disputed areas to reorganize.In the long run, countries in South Asia should conduct security cooperation in a more efficient and effective way so as to improve the capability of the entire region in countering terrorism and extremism. They should jointly search for new solutions to address the new developments of terrorism in the region.

                As platforms for accelerating regional integration, more attention must be given to quality of Belt and Road port projects Ports are an integral part of the Belt and Road connectivity. At present, a pattern featuring improved local infrastructure supported by new industrial parks and free trade zones around ports has come into being along the Belt and Road routes. In Southeast Asia, South Asia, Africa, and Europe, this pattern, built by Chinese companies, facilitates logistics and the free flow of goods. As a result, trade has been promoted both on a regional and a global scale. The importance of ports in promoting trade along the Belt and Road routes is testified to in a series of Chinese government documents, including the 2015 Action Plan on the Belt and Road Initiative and the 2017 Vision for Maritime Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative, which make it clear that building ports overseas was a goal. Actually, Chinese companies began investing in overseas ports before the Belt and Road Initiative was proposed in 2013. But after the proposals for the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road were made, there was a surge both in the number of Chinese investors and an improvement in the scale and depth of the investment. Spurred by favorable policies, at the end of 2018, Chinese companies were involved in the construction and operation of 42 ports in 34 countries, and the number is growing. At the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation held at the end of April this year, the topic of overseas port investment attracted much attention and brought about more new achievements. For example, a memorandum of understanding on strategic cooperation was signed between the Liangjiang New Area of Chongqing and the Port of Duisburg in Germany. The two parties aim to work hand-in-hand in the planning and operation of logistics and hubs of communications in both areas. A framework agreement for strategic cooperation to revamp the old port in the downtown of Djibouti City was signed by China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone Holdings Co Ltd, China Merchants Port Holdings Co Ltd and the Great Horn Investment Holdings of Djibouti. Zhejiang Seaport signed an MOU with PT Pelindo I in Indonesia, in which they agreed to codevelop the Kuala Tanjung Port, and Ningbo Zhoushan Port Company signed an MOU on long-term friendly cooperation with PT Pelindo II in Indonesia. But on the other hand, problems in some China-invested ports are also becoming prominent, some of which have even misled the overall evaluation of the Belt and Road Initiative. A report on the strategic analysis of China's overseas port program was released by Grandview Institute on April 11, which surveyed 42 China-invested overseas port projects including the Hambantota Deep Sea Port, Gwadar Port, Djibouti Port, Port Darwin and the Port of Piraeus, and assessed the problems and risks during the investment, construction and operation stages. The report noted that external risks, especially security issues and cultural conflicts, need to be handled properly so Chinese workers can cooperate with the locals. Besides, problems around maintenance and operations have also arisen from time to time. For example, the classic model of Port-Park-City, which is widely used in China, cannot be simply copied and pasted overseas. Other problems such as the unsustainability of a project due to too much debt or the environmental issues caused by the construction also influence local people's understanding of the projects. Now, as the Belt and Road Initiative has entered a new stage, all parties have new expectations and higher requirements for port cooperation. The joint communique issued at the Second Belt and Road Forum on International Cooperation says: "We support the development of a sustainable blue economy and call for further strengthening of maritime connectivity and international maritime cooperation, including cooperation among ports and in shipping industries, while managing marine and coastal ecosystems in a sustainable manner." The key to achieving this goal lies in the following aspects. First, summarizing China's experiences in port development so far and adjusting its policies to local conditions. In the new era, ports act as a platform for opening logistics channels, reducing transaction costs and accelerating regional economic integration. Through the construction and operation of ports, China should empower the local people to develop their economy. Second, we should pay more attention to the quality of the projects. Since the inception of the Belt and Road Initiative, some Chinese enterprises advanced in a rash manner in order to get the right to invest and operate, but they underestimated the debt risks, thus leaving many operational problems. In the next stage, the relationship between strategic investment and business operation must be well handled to improve the sustainability of the projects. Third, more attention should be paid to the localized commercial operation of the ports. We need to strengthen ties with local organizations and social institutions, involve more local workers in the projects, absorb more local talent at the managerial level, and gain the support and trust of local people through charity or other social welfare work, as an effort to reduce our investment risk and facilitate China's trade and commerce there.

                    CPEC brings power, better life to Pakistan
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                ISLAMABAD - Pakistani surgeon Ali Haider did not worry about unstable power supply any more in his operation room at a Karachi hospital, though early summer temperature often soared to 40 degrees Celsius, driving demand for electricity high."The electricity shortage that Pakistan had been experiencing for some years has taken a toll on the economy, as well as affecting the life of each and every individual living in the country... Hospital work is actually affected and impacted drastically," he recalled.Thanks to the ample electricity supply brought about by the development of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which is known as CPEC, all medical equipment worked well, Haider said after performing a surgery at the Civil Karachi Hospital."The operation has gone smoothly and successfully," he said proudly.CPEC, a corridor linking the Gwadar port in southwestern Pakistan with Kashgar in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, highlights energy, transport and industrial cooperation.The corridor is a major pilot project under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.Only years ago, power outages often resulted in factory or production shutdown, even leading to scorching heat claiming people's lives, Haidar said."We were regularly hearing news about the shortage of the electricity supply to the factories, and you know how badly it would have affected the economy of Pakistan," he said.Since CPEC was launched five years ago, seven power projects have been completed and put into operation, which has met the needs of 8.6 million households and given a boost to Pakistan's economic development.In 2018, apart from others, the Port Qasim power plant and Sahiwal power plant generated 16 billion kilowatt hour of cumulative electricity, accounting for a quarter of the power generation in the country."Karachi now is a city of lights," Haider said, adding that the days when all local shops had to close before 10 pm due to power shortage have gone.Zohaib Arshad, a mechanical engineer in the Port Qasim power plant, is from an underdeveloped small village in Punjab. In grey and white uniform, the 26-year-old young man has deeper feeling about electricity and CPEC."We now have proper electricity in our village. Thanks to my good salary, my younger brothers are attending good educational institutions in my hometown. I also installed AC(air conditioner)... and I am helping my elder brother who helped me get education (when I was young). He is married now and I am helping him to a build a new house for himself," he said.In the past five years, since the inception of CPEC, 11 of the 22 early-harvest projects have been operational with the rest under development.CPEC has created 70,000 jobs for local Pakistanis so far and the average local per-capita income has risen 23 percent.The energy sector developed the fastest under the CPEC cooperation, breaking a bottleneck in Pakistan's economic development."Now Pakistan has a well-developed energy sector and it is moving to develop other sectors like health and education. And due to good infrastructure (like roads, highways and ports), people are getting access to big cities, and more opportunities to land good jobs in big companies," Arshad said."Many Chinese companies are working here and people in villages and elsewhere are working with them to improve their life... It is automatically helping children to get good education, good health and good opportunities for the future."

                 ISLAMABAD - Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said that the country's southwest Gwadar port, restored, developed and fully-functioned under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), has given a strategic position to Pakistan in the region, enabling it to attract investors from across the world, local media reported Tuesday.Talking to local Urdu TV channel ARY News, Khan said that it is the first time in Pakistan's history that a big number of investors are showing interest in seeking business opportunities in Pakistan because they know that they will be able to make money from the Gwadar port which has improved connectivity and shrunk distances.Khan said his country is facing several economic challenges and he believed that industrialization is the only answer to all economic woes of Pakistan because it will help the country generate capital through exports, create employment and lift people out of poverty."We are following China to strengthen our industrial base, by seeking their guidance and help in several sectors," said Khan, adding that his government is facilitating local and foreign investors through a board of investment working in the prime minister's office under his direct supervision.The prime minister said that due to the lack of industries, Pakistan's economy mainly depends on agriculture, but production in this sector is far less than that of technologically advanced countries as most of the Pakistani farmers use old techniques to raise their crops and animals.Khan revealed that his government is going to announce an agriculture policy soon to benefit farmers, under which the government will acquire modern technology from China to develop the sector."China's (per acre) production in the agriculture sector is three-times higher than that of Pakistan, we want to adopt their technology and for this, we have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with China," said the prime minister.Khan said that his government has set a revenue target of 5,500 billion Pakistani rupees (34.6 billion U.S. dollars) for the current fiscal year, which would help the government improve the balance of payments, decrease budget deficit and provide funds for development projects.

                China Red Cross humanitarian projects reach out to 27 countries in Asia, AfricaEditor's note: This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This is part of a series looking at the significant developments in various fields as China increases its interactions with the world.Gu Bin, a member of the Chinese Red Cross Foundation, has been to many countries, including Pakistan and Iraq, to help with humanitarian assistance projects, but she likes Afghanistan the most."I have been to Afghanistan four times," she said. "Although some areas are still in conflict and quite dangerous, we feel humanitarian workers like us are most needed there."One of her visits to the country was in April last year, to help carry out a joint program between the CRCF and the Afghanistan Red Crescent Society. Under the project, Chinese medical experts screen children in Kabul for congenital heart diseases. The experts choose the most serious cases and send these children, who are referred by local Red Crescent branches, for free treatment in China."I was shocked to see so many children waiting in line with their parents and relatives outside the clinics to see the doctors," she said.Although congenital heart diseases are usually identified and treated very early in China, some of the patients waiting for screening are more than 10 years old and had not been diagnosed previously, due to lack of access to healthcare services, Gu said."Though the diagnosis was free, many of the children recommended by local Red Crescent branches are from outside Kabul and did not manage to arrive due to problems such as transportation," she said.By November last year, 100 Afghan children with congenital heart disease had received free medical treatment in China through the project, according to the foundation.In May, a medical team of 13 organized by the Red Cross Society of China arrived in Kabul again, marking the beginning of second phase of the project. It is expected that an additional 150 Afghan children with congenital heart disease will be selected after screening in Kabul and then sent to hospitals in China for treatment, said Liu Xuanguo, vice-president of the CRCF.In addition to Afghanistan, the foundation has provided humanitarian assistance to 26 countries in Asia and Africa in recent years. Among the projects, it has established emergency centers in Pakistan, provided free diagnosis and treatment to children with congenital heart disease in Afghanistan and Mongolia, built a blood dialysis center in Bangladesh, constructed mobile hospitals for Syria and Iraq, and donated rescue vehicles in Cambodia and Laos, he said."Most of the programs were carried out since 2017, following the proposal (in 2013) of the Belt and Road Initiative," Liu said. "Humanitarian assistance is badly needed in many countries involved in the initiative. Although much smaller in scale compared with international assistance delivered by the Chinese government, China Red Cross humanitarian assistance has played a very important role in promoting friendship between China and these countries, and emotional connectivity between different peoples."For example, a foundation project that has provided free treatment in Chinese hospitals over the past two years to 100 Mongolian children under age 14 with congenital heart disease has won high praise from the Mongolian government and was recognized as one of the best humanitarian assistance projects in the country last year, Liu said.In June, another Chinese medical team arrived in Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia, to screen out around 100 of the most urgent cases of congenital heart disease for free treatment in Hohhot, the capital of China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region, and in Wuxi, Jiangsu province.In neighboring Pakistan, an emergency center established by the foundation in Gwadar in cooperation with the Pakistan Red Crescent Society has also won the praise of locals, Liu said.As of the end of April, three medical assistance teams sent by the Red Cross Society of China had been to the center in Gwadar since its establishment in September 2017. Large numbers of Chinese employees work there to assist with various projects.Liu said that after the center was set up, most of the patients were Chinese employees working at Chinese companies in Pakistan, but now more than 80 percent of patients are Pakistanis.The foundation also planned to build a similar center in Pakistan's Balochistan province last year, but the plan was delayed due to security concerns. However, the center is likely to be opened this year, Liu said.The foundation also plans to build additional such facilities to meet local demand for medical care and emergency services, but obstacles such as the threat of terrorism remain, he said.On May 11, a five-star hotel in Gwadar, Pakistan, was attacked by terrorists, resulting in four hotel employees and a soldier being killed. Yan Yibing, a member of the CRCF, said the attack occurred just a few hundred meters away from the emergency center where he and his Chinese colleagues worked."I had never heard gunshots before, and at first I thought it was firecrackers," he recalled. "Then we heard people shouting outside and realized an attack had occurred. We were very frightened, and none of us dared to make a sound."Liu said the emergency center has been reinforced to make it more secure for medical and Red Cross staff members working there.Gu Bin said security is also a concern for Chinese employees sent to engage in humanitarian assistance in other countries, some of which are constantly involved in wars and conflict.Liu, vice-president of the foundation, said global demand for humanitarian assistance is huge, so China will intensify its contribution.In Afghanistan, for example, the number of children with congenital heart disease registered with local Red Crescent societies exceeds 7,000. In Iraq, it is estimated that more than 10 million people, including 2 million displaced people, need humanitarian assistance, he said."We will intensify efforts and try our best to deliver more international humanitarian assistance to help more people," Liu said. "We may extend the assistance efforts to more countries, including Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam."

                    Chinese doctors finding success at Pakistan center

                On the edge of the Gwadar port that juts out into the Arabian Sea sits a low-rise building in bright red paint that is distinct from the complex of dusty adobe houses surrounding it.Each day, a number of local Pakistanis clad in traditional clothing and Chinese workers based in the southeastern port city of Pakistan visit the establishment, a medical center built by the Chinese Red Cross Foundation, the public fundraising arm of the Red Cross Society of China.Since its inauguration in May 2017, three teams of Chinese medical workers have served in the center, with each group consisting of eight to 13 doctors and nurses from two hospitals affiliated to Fudan University in Shanghai and the Beijing Red Cross Emergency Rescue Center.While each group of medical personnel is usually stationed for six months, Hu Cheng'en, a general surgeon from the Huashan Hospital of Fudan University and the captain of the third team that arrived in mid-January, has delayed his scheduled departure from Pakistan for several months."The fourth group of medical workers had to postpone their planned trip due to uncontrollable circumstances and will not come in until later this month," said Hu, 44. "I have chosen to stay longer along with another colleague so that healthcare services at the center won't be halted, and I can help with handing over operations to our successors."Over the past two years, the center has gained increasing significance as one of the three pillars of the healthcare system in Gwadar, a city of 80,000 residents that has drawn investment into its burgeoning port while constantly suffering from armed conflicts."Before the China-funded medical center was established, there were two major medical institutions in the city-one situated in the city center and staffed by about 10 medics, and the other under the administration of the local military," Hu said."The first group of Chinese doctors had to start from scratch and cope with scarce medical equipment and drugs," he said, adding that language barriers and the stagnant flow of information had resulted in low attendance of local Pakistani people.The second phase of medical assistance, from May 2018 through the end of last year, drew a larger number of patients thanks to improved infrastructure, word-of-mouth promotion and the addition of three interpreters appointed by the Pakistan Red Crescent Society, according to Hu.The proportion of Pakistani patients increased from less than 10 percent during the first phase to more than 80 percent, according to the Red Cross Society of China.As of the third stage that officially wrapped up in early July, nearly 4,000 patients had visited the center. "We were also glad to see that more female Pakistani residents had overcome stereotypes and stepped into the center to seek diagnoses and treatment," Hu said.The medical center has also initiated regular programs to conduct physical examinations for primary school students and employees hired by businesses in Gwadar.The latest plan, according to Hu, is to build connections with the hospital located in the city center."We will provide the hospital with medications that are in short supply, especially the pediatric drugs, and assist them in diagnosing patients with complicated illnesses," Hu said. "In return, the hospital will share its clinical laboratory to help us conduct tests that are currently unavailable at the center."According to the Red Cross, the medical center in Gwadar marks the starting point of a long-term initiative known as the China-Pakistan Emergency Corridor, a thread of medical units along the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor stretching about 3,000 kilometers from Gwadar to Kashgar in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.The organization added that it envisioned setting up a command center in Kashgar to coordinate emergency responses along the first-aid route.The second center after Gwadar will be positioned in Quetta, near Pakistan's border with Afghanistan, and preparation work is underway, according Hu."While foreign projects in Pakistan are always susceptible to unexpected incidents, such as security threats and communication difficulties, we will continue to accumulate experiences and accelerate progress in the future."
