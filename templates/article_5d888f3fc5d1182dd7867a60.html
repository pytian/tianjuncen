                Europe sizzles on sixth day of deadly heat wave
            </p>
            <p>
                PARIS/MADRID - Hundreds of firefighters brought wildfires under control in southern France on Saturday as Europe sweltered on the sixth day of a widespread, deadly heat wave that has fulled record-breaking temperatures, killing at least six people.In the worst-hit Gard region, where France's highest-ever temperature was registered on Friday at 45.9 C, scores of overnight fires burned about 550 hectares of land and destroyed several houses and vehicles."We came very close to a disaster," Didier Lauga, prefect of the Gard, told reporters. "There are still firefighters in place in case fires break out again."A mentally unstable man was arrested after starting a blaze in one village, but the extreme heat was likely to blame for many of the fires, Lauga said.Fifteen firefighters and several police officers were injured in the Gard, where 700 firefighters and 10 aircraft were mobilized to contain the flames, emergency services said.In the neighboring Vaucluse region, authorities said a man who had been cycling in a mountainous area had died after collapsing due to the heat.It is not only humans struggling in the heat.Winegrowers in the south of France said their precious crops have been badly burned."Some vines seem to have been hit with a blowtorch," Jerome Despey said, while Catherine Bernard likened it to the effects of a hair dryer. "I've been a winegrower for 30 years. I have never seen a vine burned by a sudden onset of heat like yesterday," Despey added.France is the seventh European country to ever register a 45 C temperature, along with Bulgaria, Portugal, Italy, Spain, Greece and North Macedonia, Meteo France said.In Germany, organizers of Sunday's Frankfurt Ironman race made contingency plans to keep athletes from overheating in temperatures expected to reach up to 38 C.The World Meteorological Organization said this week that 2019 was on track to be among the world's hottest years, and 2015-19 would then be the hottest five-year period on record.It said the European heat wave was "absolutely consistent" with extremes linked to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions.Temperatures soared in the United Kingdom on Saturday as the island country saw its hottest day of the year. A scorching 34 C was recorded at Heathrow and elsewhere in west London, making it one of the hottest June days for about 40 year, the Met Office said.The hot spell sparked several blazes, including in Spain where firefighters were again battling high flames in strong winds and blistering heat on Saturday just after they managed to contain another inferno after nearly 72 hours.A fire that started on Friday in the central Spanish town of Almorox burned at least 1,600 hectares, spilling over into the Madrid region and forcing the evacuation of a village, emergency services said.At least three people died in central and northern Italy, while hospitals in the financial capital, Milan, saw a 35 percent rise in emergency visits due to heat-related conditions, local media reported.Demand for power in the city surged as people cranked up air conditioning, leading to sporadic blackouts in stores and restaurants. Temperatures are forecast to ease in the coming days but it will remain hot.Reuters - Afp - Xinhua  (China Daily Global 07/01/2019 page7)

                A digital path to better health for all
            </a>
            <p>
                Global leaders at the recent annual gathering of the World Health Assembly in Geneva expressed worry and optimism in almost equal measure. Delegates at the assembly－the decision-making body of the World Health Organization－likened the scope of the world's health crisis to that of the threat posed by climate change. They also agreed, however, that digital technology and data will play a crucial role in accelerating efforts to achieve health for all.In many respects, the world's health has improved markedly in recent decades: average global life expectancy has increased by more than five years, while childhood mortality has declined by more than 50 percent since 1990. Yet half the world's population still lacks full access to basic health services, and health-related expenses drive roughly 100 million people into poverty every year. The problem is particularly severe in low-and middle-income countries, where the financial burden of the four most frequent non-communicable diseases alone (cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases) is expected to surpass $7 trillion from 2011 to 2025, according to WHO.At the same time, the world is just beginning to recognize the potential of digitally enhanced data to improve health. With increased use of digital technology, we can help people stay healthy, rather than waiting for them to get sick. We can make reactive healthcare systems proactive and－thanks to artificial intelligence (AI)－even predictive.Most cost-effective way to meet health-related SDGsIn our view, digital health is the most efficient, cost-effective way for the world to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals' health-related targets－particularly universal health coverage, whereby everyone can access the quality care they need without incurring financial hardship. This is also a high priority for WHO, which earlier this year created a Department of Digital Health and published its first set of guidelines on the subject.With several major global strategy-setting meetings ahead, including the UN High-Level Meeting on Universal Health Coverage in New York in September, the world must act now to realize the promise of digital health. We see three distinct opportunities for cross-sectoral partnerships: in prediction, prevention and healthcare delivery.Understanding－and, where possible, predicting－the health profile of populations is integral to providing better care. Digitalized data collection, including through the use of AI and machine learning, can help healthcare systems to detect risk factors in advance and respond quickly to prevent disease. Real-time data can inform planning and resource-allocation decisions, reduce costs, and improve the overall quality of care. Better processes for ensuring data security and privacy are also essential to implement predictive systems at scale.Exploring challenges and opportunities in healthcareTo explore further the challenges and huge opportunities in this area, the Novartis Foundation and Microsoft are co-chairing a new Broadband Commission working group that will make recommendations regarding how AI can safely improve health and strengthen healthcare systems. In a similar vein, health-advocacy organization PATH is working with the Tanzanian government to test machine-learning applications that promise to predict demand for vaccines more accurately and optimize their delivery.Digital health tools that inform and empower patients can also play a crucial role in preventing disease. Simple, existing, cost-effective technology, such as mobile phones and broadband, can make a huge difference in raising awareness of the causes and early symptoms of diseases. PATH and the Novartis Foundation, for example, are collaborating on the Communities for Healthy Hearts program in Vietnam, which uses digital technology to improve and accelerate control of hypertension－the leading cause of heart disease.Finally, digital technology can help to deliver healthcare to people in remote or underserved areas, thereby tackling one of the greatest obstacles to reducing disease. Using mobile phones, WhatsApp, and text messages can improve the quality and accessibility of care for millions of people. In this regard, the Novartis Foundation and PATH have introduced telemedicine in Ghana, which connects rural inhabitants with trained healthcare professionals, and digital dashboards that enable better, faster malaria care.Digital data must be made part of health systemsDigital data and technology must be fully integrated into national health systems, and should become as essential as hospital beds. Too many digital health pilot programs over the past decade have been uncoordinated and focused on single issues. Leadership from national governments is therefore critical to ensuring a coherent approach.Fortunately, global and country-led efforts are starting to move in this direction. Earlier this year, for example, the Democratic Republic of the Congo established its first digital health agency, with the aspiration of improving management of the healthcare system, providing better care, and making services more accessible.We can solve the global health crisis and achieve universal coverage, but only by making digital tools central to all countries' health systems. No single organization can achieve this on its own: we need the public, private and social sectors to work together. In fact, the goal must be to make these new technologies so widespread that we no longer need to refer to "digital" health, because that is what all health systems will be.Ann Aerts is head of the Novartis Foundation, and Steve Davis is president and CEO of the Seattle-based international nonprofit organization PATH.

                Some in Australia stuck in the Cold War: China Daily editorial
            </a>
            <p>
                In a highly inflammatory opinion piece in an Australian newspaper on Thursday, Andrew Hastie, the head of Australia's parliamentary intelligence and security committee, drew a comparison between China's rise and that of Nazi Germany.In a newspaper column, the federal member of Australia's Liberal Party, which leads the ruling coalition, likened the West's attitude to China to the inadequate French response to the World War II advances of Nazi Germany.Such remarks are deplorable, and risible.While they are so preposterous they do not merit refuting, they do shine a spotlight on the narrow-minded and problematic world view of some Australian politicians.Such a distorted and prejudiced view of China's development exposes a catastrophic failure of reason that prevents a just and objective perception of what that development means for Australia and the world.Although Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison distanced himself and his government from Hastie by claiming that those remarks were not the views of the government, it is no surprise that such biased comments should flare up in a country that is eager to strengthen its ties with the United States at a time when the US administration is doubling down on its trade war attacks against China and trying every means to contain China's development .It is surely not just happenstance that Hastie's remarks coincided with Mike Burgess becoming head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization. Burgess was previously in charge of the Australian Signals Directorate, which played a key role in Canberra's decision to ban China's Huawei from Australia's nascent 5G broadband network.Yet even the most biased Australians cannot deny how much their country has benefited from China's development in recent years. In fact, Australia sets an example of how a developed economy can benefit from its ties with China. And bilateral trade aside, Chinese tourists and students also play an important role in contributing to Australia's economy.Admittedly, the status quo of China-Australia ties is far from satisfactory mainly due to Australia's penchant for hyping up the so-called China threat in the past few years.To resurrect the development momentum of bilateral ties, Canberra should not tolerate such an ill trend continuing to poison bilateral interaction.

                China's UK ambassador likens unrest to 'neo-extremism'
            </a>
            <p>
                China's ambassador to the United Kingdom Liu Xiaoming said the radical movement in Hong Kong has become "neo-extremism" under the cover of a so-called pro-democracy movement and challenges the principled bottom line of "One Country, Two Systems".Liu reaffirmed that the central government of China firmly supports the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in quelling unrest in the city. He made the remarks at a news conference at China's embassy in London on Thursday."The neo-extremism is both highly deceptive and destructive," Liu said, referring to the violent protesters in Hong Kong that stormed the Legislative Council Complex, attacked the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government, assaulted police officers and brought Hong Kong airport to a standstill."Their moves are severe and violent offences, and already show signs of terrorism," he said.Following his remarks, a short video was played showing a citizen and a journalist from the mainland and the Hong Kong police being attacked by protesters."The violent offenders must be brought to justice in accordance with law," Liu said, adding that radical behavior which undermines rule of law and social order is unacceptable.Liu also said the SAR and central governments are fully prepared for the worst while hoping the unrest will end in an orderly way."Should the situation in Hong Kong deteriorate further into unrest (that is) uncontrollable for the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the central government would not sit on its hands and watch," said Liu. "We have enough solutions and enough power within the limit of the basic law to quell any unrest swiftly."The priority now is to support the SAR government in ending violence and restoring order," Liu said, and reiterated the central government's trust in the SAR and Hong Kong police to handle the situation.He said there was evidence that showed the situation in Hong Kong would not have deteriorated so much had it not been for the interference and incitement of foreign forces. "Foreign forces must stop interfering in Hong Kong's affairs," he stated."I want to reiterate here that Hong Kong is part of China; no foreign country should interfere in Hong Kong affairs," he said.He urged media to report responsibly and be objective. "There has been massive coverage on the so-called' right to peaceful protest' but few reports on violent offences by extreme radicals, such as disruption of social order, attacks on police officers and injuries to bystanders," he said while pointing to video showed during the news conference.

                1,183 arrested over violence in Hong Kong since June: police
            </a>
            <p>
                The Hong Kong police arrested 35 people in violent protests in different parts of Hong Kong on Tuesday, bringing the total number of the arrested since June 9 to 1,183, the police told a media briefing on Wednesday.Radical protesters committed violent acts in different parts of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon on Tuesday, including blocking roads, besieging the Mong Kok police station and damaging facilities at underground railway stations, said Chief Superintendent Tse Chun-chung of Police Public Relations Branch.A total of 30 males and 5 females, aged between 14 and 39, were arrested on Tuesday over offences including unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapons and criminal damage.In an operation in Kowloon East area on Tuesday night, the police stopped a bus carrying dozens of radical protesters who had caused extensive damage to Wong Tai Sin MTR station, and arrested 33 people.Senior Superintendent Foo Yat-ting of the police Kowloon East Region said these protesters were liable not only to the offense of contempt of court as they defied the injunction order for the MTR system, but also to offences such as criminal damage.Likening the ongoing violent protests in Hong Kong to an infectious disease, Tse said the disease is "spreading across the city and poisoning the minds of many young people.""There is certainly no quick cure to the disease. Every person in the society has a role to play in nursing Hong Kong back to health," he said, "We sincerely appeal to every member of the public to join us. Please make a clear break with all violent and criminal elements to put Hong Kong back on the right track."

                From PE struggler to superstar

                Serbia's Nikola Jokic was not exactly an obvious choice to make it in hoops, as his old teachers revealSOMBOR, Serbia - Nikola Jokic was always tall - as a teenager he had to lie down in school photos to fit inside the frame.Now the 24-year-old Serbian basketball standout is bigger than ever, spanning a huge mural on his former elementary school and living the dream of every youngster as an NBA All-Star with the Denver Nuggets.With a slightly doughy and lumbering physique, the seven-footer (2.13m) has entranced fans and analysts with his uncanny precision, especially laser-sharp passes that have seen him likened to an NFL quarterback on court.Serbs are hoping that their homegrown hero - who did not play in the 2014 World Cup - can fire the country at the latest edition in China.So far Serbia has justified its tag as one of the tournament favorites and possibly the biggest threat to reigning champion the United States, by easing into the quarterfinals with four wins from four. The Serbs were due to face their toughest opponent yet on Sunday night against fellow quarterfinalist Spain in Wuhan.In Jokic's native Sombor, a sleepy northern city where he returns annually, teachers remember a boy who always had a special knack for ball sports, even if physical exercise was not his strong suit."He loved playing with the ball more than anything. On the other hand, gym and athletics, he did not love... I always had to push him to do gymnastics," remembers his first physical education teacher, Robert Katona, from the humble court where Jokic honed his skills.Gordana Ralevic, his old English teacher, remembers "little" Jokic as an "excellent" academic student.As a heavier kid "he had problems with physical education... he really struggled", she said."But he fought - and succeeded, as we can see," she added with a smile.Undisputed MVP When Jokic arrived in Denver as a little-known second-round pick four years ago, the Serbian couldn't hold an abdominal plank for more than 20 seconds, the Serbian told ESPN in a recent interview.He has since been whipped into shape by trainers, shedding some pounds while still maintaining a bulkier physique.The work has paid off. Today, Jokic is the Nuggets' undisputed MVP, drawing praise for his creativity and exceptional statistics, blending the role of center and point guard.In addition to averaging 10.8 rebounds per game last season, he averaged 7.3 decisive passes and 20.1 points. He further excelled in the playoffs.According to his father, basketball was love at first sight."As a child, with his pacifier in his mouth, he would watch his brothers play (basketball) without moving, without making a sound, sitting on my lap," remembers Branislav Jokic, 61, a retired agricultural engineer.His gym teacher Katona says Jokic's talent for passing - the subject of many YouTube highlight reels - was also evident at a young age."Above all, he had a tendency to look for the decisive pass, he liked it more than scoring," he said.Love of horses With a contract worth nearly $150 million, Jokic is the highest-paid Serbian player in history.His popularity is beginning to match that of Serbia's other sporting king, world No 1 tennis player Novak Djokovic.Jokic prefers to keep a low profile when he returns to Sombor, a city of 40,000 people near the border with Hungary.He is still dating his high-school sweetheart and will often stop by his former school to talk to young players on the small court, beneath his mural.But most of Jokic's free time in Serbia is spent indulging his other passion: horses."He inherited this from me," explained his father while reaching a hand out to horses in the small stable their family owns, nearby a track where they compete in harness racing."As a child, he would clean the stables before going to school."Jokic still enjoys doing a few laps of the track "but only for training, he can't afford to participate in a competition", explained Branislav before walking over to one horse that matters more to Jokic than the rest."This is Dream Catcher, the first horse Nikola bought," said Branislav."He survived a severe tick bite and returned to competition, pursuing his dreams. Kind of like Nikola when he went to play in the States."Agence France-Presse
