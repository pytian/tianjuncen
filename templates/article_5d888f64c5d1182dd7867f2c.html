                Mascots unveiled for 2022 Olympics, Paralympics
            </p>
            <p>
                China unveiled the official mascots on Tuesday for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympic Games. After months of anticipation and secrecy, the official mascot for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games - a giant panda-inspired cartoon character - made its public debut amid cheers at Beijing's Shougang Ice Hockey Arena. The mascot was jointly unveiled by Vice-Premier Han Zheng, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach and Gou Zhongwen, executive president of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, at a ceremony attended by 1,600 people at a training venue for the 2022 Winter Games. The panda is named Bing Dwen Dwen in Chinese. Bing means "ice" in Chinese, while Dwen Dwen suggests "health and ingenuity" - characteristics also shared by pandas. Pandas are perhaps the most recognized animal species in China, organizers said. "Pandas combine China's traditional culture and its modern appearance together with winter sports elements in a compelling image that shows our great expectations for the Games and that we welcome the world," said Beijing Mayor Chen Jining, who also serves as an executive on the organizing committee. One of the five mascots for the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics was also a panda after Beijing selected the animal for the first time since it represented the 1990 Asian Games. "I have already seen the mascot and from what I've seen, it's a wonderful choice," Bach said before introducing it. "The mascot really incorporates the best elements and characteristics of China and the Chinese people. It will be a great ambassador for the country and the 2022 Winter Olympics." The halo surrounding the mascot's face is suggestive of ice and snow tracks, as well as the flowing "ribbons" on the exterior of the National Speed Skating Oval, one of two new competition venues in downtown Beijing expected to become a landmark of the Games, according to its chief designer, Cao Xue, dean of the school of visual communication at the Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts. Soon after the launch of Bing Dwen Dwen, Beijing organizers also introduced Shuey Rhon Rhon - a personification of a red lantern - as the mascot for the 2022 Beijing Paralympic Winter Games. Shuey Rhon Rhon does not easily translate into English but contains characters for both "snow" and "forbearance". Designed by a team from Jilin University of Arts, the lantern mascot emanates a glow from its heart that symbolizes warmth, friendship and the resilience of disabled athletes. The vivid red image is a perfect fit for the gala event, especially since the Games will coincide with China's Lunar New Year celebration in February and March 2022. "The mascot Shuey Rhon Rhon will become the face of the Beijing 2022 Paralympic Winter Games, lighting up the lives of billions around the world who will watch in awe as paralympic athletes inspire and excite the world," International Paralympic Committee President Andrew Parsons said in a video message. The unveiling of the mascots marks the culmination of a journey that began in August last year, when Beijing organizers launched a global design competition. A total of 5,816 submissions from 35 countries were reviewed by Chinese and international experts. sunxiaochen@chinadaily.com.cn  Bing Dwen Dwen (at left on screen) is introduced on Tuesday in Beijing as the official mascot for the 2022 Beijing Olympic Winter Games, while Shuey Rhon Rhon (right) will be the mascot for the Paralympic Winter Games.Zou Hong/china Daily(China Daily Global 09/18/2019 page1)
