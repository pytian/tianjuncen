Enjoying strong support from the stands, former world No 1 Osaka dominated the match with her powerful ground-strokes and broke Pavlyuchenkova's serve twice to take the opening set in 31 minutes. "Going into this tournament, World Rugby was very clear about contact with the head and what constitutes a red card," Kaplan said

                             [Photo/Agencies]LONDON - Prime Minister David Cameron called a June 23 referendum on membership of the European Union on Saturday as he sought to rally his divided Conservative Party behind a deal which he said would guarantee Britain's prosperity and security in the bloc. The cabinet meeting, the first to be held on a Saturday since the 1982 Falklands War, will formalise government support for staying in the EU and Cameron has said ministers will then be free to campaign on whichever side they want. Cameron hailed a deal clinched with other European Union leaders at a summit in Brussels as granting Britain special status, and said he would campaign hard to convince voters to stay in the bloc that Britain joined in 1973

The Press Trust of India news agency reported on Monday that the lander was unbroken but was lying tilted on the lunar surface, and that the chances of restoring communication were low. The fresh image of the crash-landed lander, called Vikram - after the founder of India's space program - was said to have been obtained by the onboard camera of the unmanned moon orbiter, which continues to be in a perfect condition

The campaign is now largely over, with little time left before election day. Shorten's Labor Party has enjoyed a lead in opinion polls, as it has done for much of the time since the last election in 2016. While being behind at the beginning of an election race is not fatal to a party's chances, it is always better to be in front, so the Labor Party will be feeling confident going into this election
