                New global survey shows Chinese most optimistic about their country
            </p>
            <p>
                LONDON - China is the most optimistic country in the world, with 91.4 percent of its citizens believing their country will become better a place in the next decade, according to a report released Monday.The report, "Priorities of Progress: Understanding Citizens' Voices," released by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) on Monday, is based on a global survey of 50 countries to examine how citizens feel about their country's progress.The report indicates a generally more positive sentiment in the emerging markets of Asia and Africa than the OECD countries: besides China, more than 70 percent of respondents in Indonesia and Vietnam believe their country is moving towards a better society; while the number in the United States is only 38 percent, and Germany and Italy 12 percent.Another highlight of the report is that developing countries are increasingly embracing science and technology for a better future. India and China have a strong science and technology ecosystem in areas like Artificial Intelligence and digital, and leapfrog innovation is helping people across Africa overcome infrastructure constraints.The EIU report also shows more positive views on technology in many developing countries. The percentage of respondents who strongly agree that technology has changed society for the better is largest in South Africa (38 percent), Indonesia (34 percent) and Thailand and Vietnam (both 32 percent), compared with only 5.7 percent in Canada, 6.9 percent in Germany and 11 percent in South Korea, a technology-intensive economy.Moreover, the report finds that healthcare remains the top priority, followed by social protections, access to education, public order, transport infrastructure and the environment.

                Waging changes in the job market
            </a>
            <p>
                China's GDP growth has stabilized but wages continue to rise rapidly due to the country's changing economy and, in no small measure, the ongoing industrial upgrading plan.The average annual wage in China has seen quite a transformation in recent years. From 29,229 yuan ($4,586) in 2008 it had reached 67,569 yuan by 2016.The wage increases, combined with a falling unemployment rate of around 5 percent in the first quarter of 2018, suggest a pretty good economic outlook. By all indications, this fair weather will continue."Higher rates of employment and levels of salaries are usually closely related to the performance of the economy," said Edward Hsu, managing director at global advisory firm Willis Towers Watson."Last year, China's gross domestic product growth was 6.9 percent while the projection for this year is at 6.7 percent. The economy is expected to be fairly stable but (growth) has a small drop compared to last year."Data from the National Bureau of Statistics show year-on-year GDP growth has been stable for the past 11 quarters, ranging between 6.7 and 6.9 percent. Growth in salaries, meanwhile, has been rising."The projection for salary increases for the overall market this year is 8.4 percent, higher than the 8.1 percent of 2017 and the 8 percent in 2016," said Hsu. "We can see that the salary rate is going up while the GDP (growth) is going down slightly.""In terms of the labor attrition rate, we have a more stable workforce in China than before. From 2000 to 2015, the turnover rate was about 25 percent each year. If we look at 2016, it was 19 percent. Then last year, the turnover rate was at 17 percent," he said.The actual situation is more nuanced, depending on the industry and type of job.'We observed a solid employment record and wage increase in retail sales, property, leasing and business services and delivery services," said Su Yue, an economist with The Economist Intelligence Unit.Salary growth for urban employment has dropped in recent times, she said."Growth of salary of urban employment has tapered since 2012… but the rising average wage rate will continue due to a decline of the working age population since 2012," said Su."The weakened wage growth for urban employment is mainly because of the cut in capacity at traditional secondary industries, such as mining and metal manufacturing," said Su, who added that laid-off workers have been quickly absorbed by rising tertiary industries.She attributed this to the initiative to move the country's economy up the value chain through manufacturing innovation and promoting homegrown products.Hsu from Willis Towers Watson said China is moving its economic direction away from "just being a big manufacturing country" because "it wants to be a powerful industrial force too"."The government has been placing the focus more on innovation, automation, artificial intelligence and intelligent production," said Hsu."It has basically been enhancing the high-end tech field. And with a focus on a higher value field comes the need and development for high-quality expertise."So, higher wages and a demand for talent are essentially changing the occupational landscape of the country."The younger generations are less interested in engineering works, because of a lower social status and poorer career development channel than graduates who work in a service industry such as finance," said the EIU's Su, who noted that this is contributing to "the biggest bottleneck" in China."China lacks skilled workers and technicians. The Ministry of Education estimates the country needs 30 million additional engineering talents by 2025," Su said. "The existing students in vocational school and university can only meet half of this need."Su said areas with large talent gaps include new advanced information technology, automated machine tools and robotics, power equipment and new energy vehicles and equipment."Engineering training and practice for students are still quite weak in school. As a result, sometimes graduates' skill sets cannot meet enterprises' demand," Su added.Sameer Khatiwada, an economist with the Asian Development Bank, agreed that education is key."The right set of skills is essential in bridging the gap between labor and technology. The urgency to close that gap is forcing us to rethink not just tertiary, secondary or primary education but learning at a foundational level," said Khatiwada."There's always been a lag between supply and demand. We need to stay ahead of the curve by supplying the future workforce with the skills to be agile enough to match the demands of the market and tech changes. An example would be coding, which is widely needed now."But, Su said, the current imbalance of labor supply and demand will benefit the highly skilled graduates with wage premiums."Talents who can work in an international background will also be in demand with the deepening of China's opening-up," she said.A side effect of the changes in China is that manufacturing jobs are moving to other countries throughout the region."Labor-intensive manufacturing such as textiles and footwear has been moving to other Asian countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, India and the Philippines due to their lower labor cost and large labor pool," noted Su.The model of transitioning from manufacturing to service industries has proven successful in places like the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Singapore."When you look at our region, a lot of the goods and services produced here are actually to meet the demand within. We are way more reliant on regional increases in income," said the ADB's Khatiwada."The rising wages in China have led to stronger buying power from consumers there. So, more and more Chinese companies are the ones seeking affordable manufacturing capabilities."Chinese capital is very mobile across the region, despite recent attempts to cap it. Investors will no doubt be drawn to where they might get better returns," Khatiwada added.Su suggested that China needs to forge comparative advantages in other industrial goods, either for export or for domestic consumption. But not everyone believes China will lose its appeal as a manufacturing hub just yet."China is an important market for many companies and they will likely want to maintain a presence there," said Khatiwada.Hsu at Willis Towers Watson believes China's tech advances will influence companies to keep manufacturing bases in the country."China provides a good ground base to experience future tech advances and develop future business models. It's likely they will use China as a testing ground for products before bringing the manufacturing and products to other places," Hsu said.

                Consumption upgrade powers firms offering services like high-end yogaIf you personify China's consumption upgrade, you could say she is striking a pose full of poise these days.And the posture, which seems to herald glad tidings for high-end lifestyle, wellness and fitness businesses, is in full evidence at lucrative yoga studios that are mushrooming across China, industry insiders said.Two figures illustrate well the evolution of consumption upgrade: China's per-capita consumer expenditure reached 18,322 yuan ($2,667) in 2017, up 5.4 percent year-on-year. And consumers such as Christina Zhang, 25, a Beijing-based housewife, are more than willing to part with 15,000 yuan or more for an annual membership at high-end yoga studios."Yoga" is Sanskrit for union－of body, mind and spirit, and well-heeled Chinese are pulling out all the stops to achieve that, egged on by new-age wellness startups that offer a variety of services and a range of yoga disciplines.For Zhang, a typical weekday afternoon is marked by an hour-long session at a high-end Bikram Yoga studio in downtown Beijing. The class sees her stretching herself in a variety of postures called asanas.As the inventive poses gradually wring sweat out of her shapely, supple frame, she disappears for a quick shower, and emerges from it radiating beauty that seems to arise from an equanimous mind anchored in a contented soul.Zhang reenergizes herself with some pastry, washing it down with a cup of refreshing black tea, while allowing her mind to float with the soothing soft music flowing out of invisible hi-fi speakers embedded in the studio walls."I think what I get here is worth the price," Zhang said. Her 15,000 yuan per annum membership contrasts with around 2,000 yuan yearly fee at traditional gyms that also offer yoga classes. But exclusive yoga studios offer a quieter environment and professional, experienced instructors.And rising demand for such exclusive services and high-end products is a clear sign that China's consumption upgrade is gathering steam, experts said.That steam is propelling new businesses such as Pure Yoga, a high-end yoga center that opened shop at WF Central, a premium shopping mall in Beijing, on Aug 5. Pure Yoga is operated by Pure Group, a Hong Kong-based owner of a popular lifestyle brand.The Beijing studio is the group's third venture on the Chinese mainland. Spread over 12,000 square meters and well decorated, the Beijing studio adheres to Pure Yoga's aesthetic style and incorporates unique natural elements that inform its design philosophy.The eco-friendly materials, including sustainable bamboo flooring, non-volatile paint, latest lighting devices, as well as the cutting-edge air-and water-purification systems, appear to create an oasis amid the concrete jungle."With world-class facilities and thoughtful use of space, Pure Yoga inspires people of all ages and abilities to make yoga part of their lives and enjoy the best yoga experience in a pure and healthy environment. We want to offer busy urban residents a space to relax and reenergize their soul," said Connie Chou, business development manager of Pure Group.The studio in Beijing boasts four group yoga rooms and one private chamber. This layout offers room for private coaching. To make sure every student gets the best out of their yoga experience, the certified, experienced teachers offer all members more than 125 premium classes each week, covering more than 20 types of yoga. The facility also provides bilingual teaching assistance."Practising yoga with professional yoga instructors, and in such pleasant environment, I felt my body and soul relax," said a practitioner after a yoga class taught by Italian instructor Dario Calvaruso.Founded in 2002, Pure Group opened its first yoga studio in Hong Kong. Seeing growing demand in first-tier cities, the company marched into the Chinese mainland.Colin Grant, CEO of Pure Group, said, "We mainly target medium-to high-income individuals in first-tier cities, such as bankers and lawyers."He said people's sports-related consumption is growing continuously, and the consumption levels of Beijing and Shanghai are comparable to that of Hong Kong."People's income is going up. Plus, their mindsets have shifted to 'I want a healthier lifestyle'. In the past, they may have wanted to spend money on buying fancy clothes and shoes. But now, they want to eat healthier, buy sports apparel, and live healthier. People are prioritizing consumption related to health."The company sees the rising demand on the mainland as a big opportunity. "The percentage of the population having a gym card in first-tier cities on the mainland is 1 to 2 percent, while the figure for Hong Kong is roughly 5 percent. Therefore, huge opportunities lie on the mainland. We aim at increasing our penetration rate in first-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai," Grant said.Agreed Qu Jing, a sports analyst at Beijing-based market research consultancy Analysys. "High-end yoga can be viewed as the upgraded version of the normal one, and demand for that can be seen in the increase in the number of studios.

                Central Chinese cities pose strong growth potential: report
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING, Jan. 26 -- Central Chinese cities hold the most promising prospects for growth and business thanks to quickening urbanization and industrial development, reported a British think tank.Central provinces of Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi dominated the top performers of the latest ranking of Chinese emerging cities by British think tank Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).Suzhou City in eastern China's Anhui Province came first thanks to strong gains in urbanization and metropolitan population, followed by Yueyang City in central China's Hunan Province.The two cities have made steady progress in developing industrial economies as the Chinese government's plan to promote city clusters has provided policy tailwinds, the report said."Beyond the traditional megacities along the coast, third- and fourth-tier cities in central China are rising in economic importance and should be on the radar of China-focused businesses," said Wang Dan, a China analyst at the EIU.The EIU's China Emerging City Rankings are based on a variety of indicators to measure growth, including real GDP, metropolitan population, urban consumption expenditure, foreign direct investment, fixed-asset investment, the urban built area and policy support.

                HONG KONG SEES TALENT AS KEY
            </a>
            <p>
                City tackles high cost of living and families in poverty Hong Kong, which lures tourists with its skyscrapers and breathtaking views, is also home to one in 10 people living below the poverty line in one of the most expensive cities in the world. This is despite a raft of cash and noncash aid from the authorities. Hong Kong was named one of the three most expensive cities in the world this year, together with Singapore and Paris, in an annual survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit. The survey, released last month, found that the cost of living in Hong Kong was 7 percent higher than in New York. Every year, the EIU examines the prices of 160 products and services in 133 cities worldwide. It examines the cost of food, clothing, basic commodities, private schools, domestic helpers and daily necessities. Such surveys offer a picture of living costs and are useful for international corporations relocating staff members. But the high costs threaten Hong Kong's appeal to foreign talent, even as the city hopes to become a leading center for innovation and technology. Hong Kong has also been named the least affordable housing market in the world for the ninth consecutive time by the annual Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey. It takes an average family nearly 21 years, without spending, to buy a modest home in the city. According to the Demographia findings, updated to January, such a home costs nearly HK$7.17 million ($914,200), while the average annual household income remains stagnant at HK$343,000. The 20.9 years taken to buy such apartments - the longest ever recorded globally - actually follows a decline in the residential market, but Hong Kong held the previous record of 19.4 years, set last year. The global standard for a "severe lack of housing affordability" is 5.1 years of total family income. Surveys such as these are good yardsticks for general information about living costs. They are aimed primarily at international corporations relocating staff members around the world. A large corporation cannot afford to go into a city blindly looking for office space and relocating employees whose salaries might put them on a subsistence level. Real estate prices and living costs must be factored in as part of compensation packages. The globally recognized IMD World Talent Ranking for 2018 downgraded Hong Kong by six places year-on-year to 18th among 63 countries and regions worldwide for attracting professionals. The city's appeal to overseas talent dropped three places to 14th, and its investment in homegrown talent and professional development also fell, by seven places to 31st. These two critical indicators warn of potential problems ahead. Talent is the bargaining chip for Hong Kong amid global competition. Many observers consider it the key to the future if the city hopes to win the innovation and technology race, an emerging market to which it had remained almost willfully indifferent until a few years ago. As a result, the city is now trying to recover lost ground in the hope of becoming a leading center for innovation and technology. Chong Tai-leung, an economist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, suggested the government should support this emerging sector by providing land for a leading tech giant to establish itself in the city. For example, if Google set up a base in Hong Kong, other smaller tech companies would follow. Chong said that Shenzhen, just across the border in Guangdong province, profited handsomely after becoming the home of telecom giant Huawei's flagship operations. To date, the Hong Kong special administrative region government has focused on accommodating small startups in the city's Science Park, but Chong believes this misses the point. Such startups cannot afford big-money talent and are not likely to attract the best available from overseas. Even the most enterprising homegrown talent will pursue careers in the city's financial sector. Rival cities Expatriates are being joined by people born in Hong Kong in looking for greener pastures, including lifeguard Herman Lam, 37. He went to Zhuhai, Guangdong, to visit a friend, where he noticed clean streets lined with upscale homes, and the pleasant climate. Lam, who works at a private residence in Hong Kong, thinks he might find a better future in Zhuhai. "I have been paying attention to the concept of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area," he said, referring to the cluster encompassing nine cities in Guangdong, plus Hong Kong and Macao. The Bay Area is being developed as a world-class trading and technology area to rival Silicon Valley in the United States, and to surpass other major bay area trading hubs such as Tokyo Bay, San Francisco Bay and New York. Chong, the economist, predicts that the nine Greater Bay Area cities in Guangdong will rival Hong Kong in terms of economy and lifestyle. The Bay Area may ultimately remove some of the pressures of overcrowding and limited developable land in Hong Kong, and as the Bay Area evolves, the city is looking forward to being relieved of its tag as the one of the world's most expensive. A case in point is Central district on Hong Kong Island, the city's premier business address, where corporate office space has been ranked the world's most expensive for three consecutive years by commercial real estate services and investment company CBRE. High real estate costs are not confined to Central, however. Rentals on Russell Street, Causeway Bay, which is also on Hong Kong Island, have been tagged as the world's most expensive commercial real estate. Sohail, a German-born pilot who works for a private airline, is confronting these high costs. According to Payscale.com, a self-reporting survey company, the average salary for a pilot in Hong Kong is HK$1.2 million a year plus bonuses. But Sohail said "affordability" is a significant factor governing how long he is prepared to stay in Hong Kong. He enjoys the city's distinctive architecture and iconic images of Victoria Harbour. "It (the skyline) is unique and very beautiful, especially at night, both on the Kowloon and Hong Kong Island sides," he said. He lives in Central, where rent swallows up 30 percent of his salary. "Property prices are high and rising. At this point, it is difficult to think beyond five years," Sohail said. Food, entertainment and utilities take another 30 percent of his income, while 15 percent goes on travel. According to Rent Cafe, a statistics site, the average rent for a one-bedroom 55-to 85-square-meter apartment is HK$21,506 - 40 percent higher than a comparable home in Beijing. In 2017, Hong Kong was ranked by Rent Cafe as the fourth most expensive city among the world's top 30 financial centers, which also included New York, London, Tokyo, Singapore, Seoul, Sydney and Toronto. More than 20 percent of the population in Hong Kong was living below the poverty line in 2017 - the second-highest proportion since the poverty line definition was introduced in the city nine years ago. The proportion was lowered to 10.5 percent after government intervention, including cash handouts and benefits such as public housing. Images of accommodations - known as "cage homes" and "coffin houses" - in which many people live have become a blight on Hong Kong. In 2017, about one in four children in the city were living below the poverty line, according to the nonprofit Society for Community Organization. Ming Wong, a 14-year-old secondary school student, is among the 230,400 Hong Kong children living in poverty. He lives in a SOCO-sponsored subdivided apartment with his mother in Mongkok, Kowloon. The apartment is occupied by three families who share a living room, kitchen and two toilets. In 2017, Sohail, the pilot, saw some cage homes in Hong Kong and volunteered to mentor Wong in English and life skills. Sohail takes Wong to museums and other places of interest, and sometimes they go to watch movies. They are friends who chat through instant messaging when Sohail is flying. Makeshift home There are many conditions attached to renting SOCO-sponsored shared apartments. Daily habits and routines for families who qualify must be staggered to prevent conflict over the use of facilities - and the children must be of the same sex. Wong and his mother met these conditions and joined the first beneficiaries who were helped to move out of their cramped living conditions into a makeshift home. For the first time, the boy has his own room. It occupies just 5.57 square meters, about half the size of a typical parking space, but is nearly twice as big as the space he previously shared with his mother in Sham Shui Po, one of Hong Kong's poorest areas. That apartment was subdivided into living space for six families. Lam, the lifeguard, is considering moving from Hong Kong, as he does not see much of a future for him in the city after having a number of different jobs over 20 years. Housing is his biggest worry. He has been on a waiting list for subsidized public housing since 2014, but he is single and that gives him low priority on the list. At the end of last year, there were 117,400 single-person applicants and another 150,200 family and elderly people on the list. Government records show that the average waiting time for single applicants such as Lam is five years and five months. Lam is trying to save money, and five years ago he moved into a coffin house in North Point on Hong Kong Island. The house accommodates 15 people living in spaces bordered by planks. Tenants pay HK$2,300 a month for a space - more accurately described as a box. Lam, who is 1.75 meters tall, has to bend to get in. Once in bed, there is barely room to sit up to read, so he only uses the space at night. So, why is there this huge disparity between wealth and dire poverty in Hong Kong? Chong, the scholar from CUHK, said the answer lies in desirability and demand. When there is high demand, prices always rise Chong said, and this has helped create the city's wealth gap. Hong Kong, one of the world's most rapidly aging cities, needs to attract overseas talent to avoid stagnating. It has many things going for it such as climate, lifestyle, country parks and beaches. Boasting one of the most buoyant economies in the world, it is also the gateway to the huge market on the Chinese mainland. In addition to their salaries, most expatriates sent to the city by international companies are given allowances by their employers to shield them from the high cost of living. Chong said professionals free to work anywhere are frustrated by the cost of living in Hong Kong, along with the city's middle-class population. He cites the low tax rate as another reason people are willing to work in the city, but asks whether they will stay. He also thinks that Hong Kong is failing in its efforts to attract available talent. stushadow@chinadailyuk.com  From left: "Cage homes" still house many people in Hong Kong.

                Tokyo ranks as world's safest city, Hong Kong falls to 20th
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON -- Tokyo was named the world's safest city for the third time in a row, while Hong Kong plummeted to the 20th place, said a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).Overall, six Asia-Pacific cities are among the top ten, but geographic region does not have a statistical link with results, according to the EIU's 2019 Safe Cities index released on Thursday.The index ranks 60 cities across 57 indicators covering digital security, health security, infrastructure security and personal security.Other cities in the top ten include Singapore, Osaka, Amsterdam, Sydney, Toronto and Washington.Singapore was the best performer in infrastructure and personal security, but Tokyo and Osaka were the front runners in digital and health security respectively.Hong Kong, on the other hand, plummeted to 20th after ranking 11th in 2015 and 9th in 2017.Urban management will play a fundamental role in defining the quality of life of most human beings in the coming years. A key element of this will be the ability of cities to provide security for their residents, businesses and visitors, the report said.The results in individual index pillars show the importance of getting the basics right. A look at the top five cities in each pillar yields a similar message."In each area, leading cities got the basics right, be it easy access to high-quality healthcare, dedicated cyber-security teams, community-based police patrolling or disaster continuity planning," researchers said.Tokyo, Singapore and Osaka lead because of their specific strengths, not because they happen to be in Asia."The research highlights how different types of safety are thoroughly intertwined ... it is rare to find a city with very good results in one safety pillar and lagging in others," said Naka Kondo, senior editor of the EIU.At the other end of the spectrum, Lagos, Caracas, Yangon, Karachi and Dhaka were the five least safe cities, according to the index.
