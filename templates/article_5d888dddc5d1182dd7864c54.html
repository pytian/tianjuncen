                Official names shooter who killed 3 at California festival
            </p>
            <p>
                GILROY, Calif. — A shooter cut through a fence and opened fire on a crowd eating and listening to music at a popular food festival in California, killing three people, including a 6-year-old boy, and wounding about 15 others before police quickly shot him dead, authorities said.A law enforcement official said the gunman was identified as Santino William Legan and believed he was 19. The official wasn't authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Monday.Police searched the Legan family's two-story Gilroy home and a dusty car parked outside before leaving the house Monday with paper bags and what appeared to be other evidence.The shooter appeared to randomly target people when fired with a rifle Sunday afternoon, the end of the three-day Gilroy Garlic Festival that attracts more than 100,000 people to the city known as the "Garlic Capital of the World," Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee said.The shooter sneaked in through a fence that borders a parking lot next to a creek. Police responded within a minute and killed the suspect, Smithee said.Some witnesses reported a second suspect, Smithee said, but it was unclear whether that person was armed or just helped in some way. A manhunt continued Monday.Six-year-old Stephen Romero was among those killed, his father said."My son had his whole life to live and he was only 6," Alberto Romero told San Francisco Bay Area news station KNTV. "That's all I can say."The boy's grandmother, Maribel Romero, told Los Angeles station KABC-TV that she searched several hospitals before learning he had died. She said he was "always kind, happy and, you know, playful."The wounded were taken to multiple hospitals, and their conditions ranged from fair to critical, with some undergoing surgery. At least five were treated and released.The Gilroy Garlic Festival features food, cooking contests and music. It's a decades-old staple in the agricultural city of 50,000 about 80 miles (176 kilometers) southeast of San Francisco. Festivalgoers pass through metal detectors and their bags are searched at the event.The band TinMan was starting an encore Sunday when the shooting started. Singer Jack van Breen said he saw a man wearing a green shirt and grayish handkerchief around his neck fire into the food area with what looked like an assault rifle. He and other members of the band dove under the stage.Van Breen, from nearby Santa Clara, said he heard someone shout: "Why are you doing this?" The reply: "Because I'm really angry."The audience began screaming and running, and the five members of the band and others dove under the stage.Bandmate Vlad Malinovsky said he heard a lot of shots and then it stopped. Later, law enforcement told those hiding to come out with their hands up.Taylor Jackson was working at a booth drawing caricatures when she heard gunfire, saw people running and "ran for the hills." She said her boss ran in the opposite direction. Several hours later, Jackson was at a reunification center trying to get information on her whereabouts.Donna Carlson of Reno, Nevada, was helping a friend at a jewelry booth when "all of a sudden it was pop, pop, pop. And I said, 'I sure hope that's fireworks.'" She got on her hands and knees and hid behind a table until police told her it was safe to leave.President Donald Trump condemned the "wicked murderer.""We express our deepest sadness and sorrow for the families who lost a precious loved one in the horrific shooting last night in Gilroy, California," Trump said before an event at the White House.In a tweet, California Gov. Gavin Newsom called the bloodshed "nothing short of horrific" and said he was grateful for the police response.Video posted to social media showed people running in terror as shots rang out.Evenny Reyes of Gilroy, 13, told the Mercury News in San Jose that she spent the day at the festival with her friends and relatives."We were just leaving and we saw a guy with a bandanna wrapped around his leg because he got shot. And there were people on the ground, crying," Reyes said. "There was a little kid hurt on the ground. People were throwing tables and cutting fences to get out."Reyes said that she didn't run at first because the gunshots sounded like fireworks."It started going for five minutes, maybe three. It was like the movies — everyone was crying, people were screaming," she said.AP

                Alibaba rolls out welcome mat to US businesses
            </a>
            <p>
                Alibaba.com has begun a program that could help US small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) become big, really big.The world's largest global online business-to-business (B2B) marketplace announced on Tuesday that it is opening up its platform to manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors in the US to help them access a $23.9 trillion global B2B e-commerce market, one that is six times larger than the business-to-consumer (B2C) market.It also means Seattle-based Amazon.com just picked up some major competition.Alibaba, based in Hangzhou, in East China's Zhejiang province, is aware of any political considerations amid the ongoing trade dispute between the US and China, although the two countries will resume trade talks on Monday in Shanghai."Despite all of the geopolitical tensions that exist in the world, between China and the US, we continue to build our US business carefully," said Michael Evans, president of Alibaba, reported Yahoo Finance. Evans said he has been to Washington to talk about the e-commerce giant's business plans in the US, so "we don't surprise them".The B2B e-commerce market in the US will be worth $1.1 trillion this year, compared with the B2C market at $480 billion, according to Yahoo Finance.Previously, US SMBs could only source, or buy, goods on Alibaba.com because the objective was to connect suppliers in China with buyers in overseas markets, largely in the US.Now the US merchants will be able to sell to other US-based businesses. The change will open up markets to American merchants in countries served by Alibaba, including India, Brazil and Canada.Roughly one-third of buyers on Alibaba.com are US-based. More than 95 percent of sellers are based in China.For now, US sellers won't have access to the massive Chinese market."Most small businesses are not digital, and they trade locally with their customers," Alibaba's President of North America B2B John Caplan said on CNN. "If you're a Washington state-apple grower, if you're a baseball bat-maker in Louisville, those businesses want customers around the US, and we've got millions on the platform."You get to compete and act like a multinational company in a way you've never had the tools or technology to be able to do so," he said.Alibaba has launched new features to support the on-boarding and marketing efforts of new US suppliers, or sellers, on the site."With 10 million active business buyers in over 190 countries and regions, we are reshaping B2B commerce by providing the tools and services needed for US SMB companies to compete and succeed in today's global marketplace," Caplan said in a press release Tuesday.Sellers will get an interface for building and managing a digital store on the platform, along with tools on customer-relationship management (CRM), communications and digital marketing. Online payments will commence Wednesday, but won't be immediately available to sellers in New York and Nevada, the company said.Alibaba said "anchor sellers," such as US companies Office Depot and Robinson Fresh, the produce division of logistics company C.H. Robinson, launched stores on Alibaba.com on Tuesday.Alibaba.com representatives are currently touring the US to meet with business owners and explain how things work on the platform.The first of the educational and networking events, called Build Ups, was held Tuesday in Brooklyn, New York, with upcoming events in Los Angeles (Friday) and Chicago (July 30).Shares of Alibaba, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, rose $4.09, or 2.35 percent, to close at $178.09 in Tuesday trading.Reuters contributed to this story.

                California shooting leaves town in shock
            </a>
            <p>
                Neighbor says 19-year-old gunman's family is 'friendly' and 'very popular'What makes a "normal" young man pick up an assault rifle and carry out a killing spree? Larry Scettrini, a longtime Gilroy resident, couldn't understand what changed his neighbor into a relentless gunman."It was terrible. It happened too close in our city and the person (the gunman) lived on the same street," Scettrini, a retired mental health worker of Santa Clara County, told China Daily in his living room.Several media vans had been parked along his street since early Monday morning, while the police were investigating the family home of the shooter, 19-year-old Santino William Legan.On Sunday evening, Legan opened fire with an "AK-47-style" assault rifle at people attending the Gilroy Garlic Festival in a park, about 30 minutes' walk from his home.Before he was shot dead by police, Legan killed a 6-year-old boy, a 13-year-old girl and a man in his 20s, and injured at least 12 others. Police and FBI investigations are trying to determine a motive for the shooting.Scettrini said Legan, the youngest of four sons, appeared "very normal" though he had never spoken with him. "His parents are very hardworking. They seem to be devoted to the family, and they are very popular in the neighborhood. They are always talkative and friendly," he said.Gilroy, 50 kilometers southeast of Silicon Valley with a population of 55,000, is known for its garlic industry. Entering its 42nd year, the garlic festival is described by many residents as a "family friendly" event which is about "food, drinks, music and volunteering"."People from all over the world come here - 'Garlic Capital of the World' - that's what we are known for," Ben, who gave only first name, told China Daily.At the time of the shooting, Ben was volunteering at the festival's "Gourmet Alley". "I heard multiple shots coming from the other end of the park. It was maybe a dozen or more shots. Then it stopped for a few moments, and then it started up again. Very rapid shots," he recalled.At first, Ben said he thought it was fireworks. But when he saw people running from the direction of the sound, he realized it was gunfire. "For a moment I feared for my own life, but then I feared for the life of others. So we started to get people to evacuate, get down and hide," he said.Among those Ben and his team helped was a woman badly injured by gunshots. They performed chest compressions on the woman and transported her out of the area in a golf cart."Even though we are starting to branch out to bigger areas, at a core, we are still a small, close-knit community - the majority have gone to school with each other. People who grow up here have become teachers, families know each other," he said.HeartbrokenIn contrast with the young festival volunteers, Legan posted photographs from the festival on Instagram shortly before the shooting, with captions of "Ayyy garlic festival time" and "Come get wasted on overpriced shit"."It's broken our heart. It's dreadful. He's a local kid, and many people have known him," Rose Barry told China Daily while helping set up a prayer vigil for the victims at St. Mary's Church.She recalled that the last major violence of Gilroy Garlic Festival was a stabbing incident 15 years ago. "We've learned a lot since then about crowd control and reaction," she said.The event's website says "weapons of any kind are prohibited". Police said Legan cut through a fence at the festival to evade metal detectors and other security measures at the front entrance. Although the rifle he used is outlawed in California, Legan bought it in he neighboring state of Nevada, police have said."Guns like the one the shooter used and many of the shooters have used have no business with civilian hands. They should not be sold to individuals," said Barry. "That's a weapon of war; that belongs with the armed forces and only the armed forces."

                California city tries to figure out mass shooting
            </a>
            <p>
                What makes a "normal" young man pick up an assault rifle and go on a killing spree?Larry Scettrini, a longtime resident of Gilroy, couldn't understand what changed the boy next door into a relentless gunman."It was terrible. It happened too close in our city, and the person (the gunman) lived on the same street," Scettrini, a retired mental-health worker in Santa Clara County, told China Daily in his living room.Meanwhile, another American town was hit by gun violence on Tuesday as a recently fired Walmart employee was charged in the fatal shooting of two men at the store in Southaven, Mississippi.Martez Tarrell Abram, 39, of Southaven was recently fired from the Walmart after an incident in which he showed a knife to a fellow employee, according to DeSoto County District Attorney John Champion.Abram is accused of shooting and killing Brandon Gales of Hernando and Anthony Brown of Olive Branch, both Walmart employees.Champion says Abram remains hospitalized in neighboring Memphis, Tennessee, after he was shot twice by a police officer Tuesday morning outside the store.In Gilroy, outside Scettrini's house, several media vans have been parked along the street since early Monday, when police were investigating the home of the shooter, 19-year-old Santino William Legan.On Sunday, at around 5:40 pm, Legan opened fire with an AK-47-style assault rifle at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in a park, about a 30-minute walk from his home.Before he was shot dead by police, Legan killed a 6-year-old boy, a 13-year-old girl and a man in his 20s and injured at least 12 others. Police and FBI investigations are underway to determine a motive. Authorities say that Legan legally purchased the rifle in Nevada on July 9."It's a big loss for everybody. I feel bad for the victims and their families," said Scettrini. "I think it will be hard for the family (of Legan) to continue living here. I don't know what they are going to do after that. Hopefully, we can help them adjust or make it easy for them to keep their residence here."Scettrini said the young man looked "very normal", though he never spoke with him. "His parents are very hardworking. They seem to be devoted to the family, and they are very popular in the neighborhood. They are always talkative and friendly," he said.Gilroy, a city of about 59,000 people 30 miles south of San Jose in Northern California, is known for its garlic industry. Entering its 42nd year, the garlic festival is described by many residents as a "family-friendly" event about "food, drinks, music and volunteering"."People from all over the world come here — 'Garlic Capital of the World' — that's what we are known for," Ben, who gave only his first name, told China Daily after retrieving his pickup truck in the park from the prior night's lockdown.When the shooting started, Ben, a volunteer at the festival, was working in the "Gourmet Alley". "I heard multiple shots coming from the other end of the park. It was maybe a dozen or more shots. Then it stopped for a few moments, and then it started up again. Very rapid shots," he recalled.At the outset, Ben said he believed it was fireworks. But when he saw people running from the direction of the sound, he realized it was gunfire."For a moment I feared for my own life, but then I feared for the life of others. So we started to get people to evacuate, get down and hide," he said.Among those Ben and his team helped was a woman badly wounded by gunshots. They performed chest compressions on her and transported her out of the area in a golf cart.Ben and others remained in the park under a lockdown until midnight, when they were bused to a junior college, where their families picked them up."I feel it (the shooting) might affect the attendance (of future festivals)," said Ben, who has been volunteering at the festival for 17 years."Even though we are starting to branch out to bigger areas, at a core, we are still a small, close-knit community. The majority have gone to school with each other; people who grow up here have become teachers. Families know each other," he said.Unlike Ben and other young people in Gilroy who embraced the festival, Legan, the youngest of four sons in his family, appeared to disdain the event.He posted photographs from the festival on his social media account shortly before the shooting, with the captions: "Ayyy garlic festival time" and "Come get wasted on overpriced shit"."It's broken our heart. It's dreadful. He's a local kid, and many people knew him," Rose Barry of St. Mary's Parish told China Daily while helping set up a prayer vigil for shooting victims at the church."Like a friend of mine was saying, how did they have four boys, and we don't know this family? All of our kids were involved in community sports and school sports, cheerleading and all that kind of stuff, but not them," said Barry, who has been living in Gilroy since 1987. "We don't know them from that, which is puzzling in such a small town."She recalled that the last major violence at the festival was a stabbing 15 years ago. "We've learned a lot since then about crowd control and reaction," she said.The event's website says "weapons of any kind are prohibited".Police said Legan cut through a fence at the festival to evade metal detectors and other security measures at the front entrance.Legan's actions have prompted Gilroy residents to face the reality of gun violence."Guns like the one the shooter used and many of the shooters have used have no business within civilian hands. They should not be sold to individuals," said Barry. "That's a weapon of war; that belongs with the armed forces and only the armed forces."Scettrini said he has always believed that there should be more gun control in the US. "People argue we should have more guns to be safe. I don't buy that. I think we should have fewer guns. Even if you are armed, you are not safe," he said."And I don't like the fact that it's too common here in the United States. People say it's terrible, but nobody will make any changes in the laws," said Scettrini. "We are locked up in this gun issue, and no way can we move forward."The Associated Press contributed to this story.

                California can’t stop interstate gun flow
            </a>
            <p>
                The mass shooting in Gilroy, California, is fueling renewed debate in the state and across the country about interstate gun trafficking, especially when bordering states have comparatively weak gun laws.The shooting on Sunday at the Gilroy Garlic Festival left three people dead and 12 others wounded before police shot and killed the 19-year-old gunman, Santino William Legan.Authorities said that on July 9 in Fallon, Nevada, he legally bought the military-style semiautomatic rifle used in the shooting. Fallon is a six-hour drive from Gilroy.California is among the states with the most stringent gun laws in the US. It's illegal to sell handguns to anyone under age 21, while the federal minimum age to purchase a firearm is 18. The state also has banned assault weapons since 1989, which inspired a 10-year federal assault weapons ban that expired in 2004.A new law, which went into effect on July 1, makes California the first state to require background checks for every ammunition purchase.But state officials can't stop firearms flowing into the state from neighboring Nevada and other places where gun laws are less stringent, said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra."The reach of the California law ends at our borders, and so we cannot control what other states do, and that's what makes it so tough," he said at a news conference on Monday."California's doing its part,'' Governor Gavin Newsom told reporters when he visited the Gilroy shooting victims at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center on Monday. "But the folks in the White House have been supporting the kinds of policies that roll back the work that we're doing in states like ours to get rid of large-capacity magazines, to address the issues that we're trying to advance on background checks."Newsom pushed for the background-check system when he was lieutenant governor.A bill has passed the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives for mandatory background checks nationwide, but no vote has been scheduled in the Republican-led Senate.A 2017 study found that in the two weeks after a gun show in Nevada, gun-related injuries and deaths jumped in nearby California cities.In that same year, data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives show that 24,130 of 41,527 firearms recovered and traced in California in 2017 were from other states, or 60 percent of the total.Nevada voters passed a ballot measure in 2016 requiring a background check for firearm transactions between private parties, including at gun shows. But the state attorney general put it on hold, saying it wasn't enforceable.The top source states for California's recovered firearms include Arizona, Nevada and Texas, which are scored "F", "D" and "F", respectively, in terms of gun-law strength, by the San Francisco-based gun-control group Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.So far this year, more than 32,000 gun-violence incidents have occurred in the US, including 248 mass shootings, and 8,534 people were killed, according to Gun Violence Archive, a not-for-profit corporation.A new study — "American firearm homicides: The impact of your neighbors" — found that states with strong gun laws, such as California and Illinois, have increased rates of gun crime and homicide when they border states with weak gun laws, such as Arizona and Indiana.To stop the illegal purchase of trafficked weapons, Congresswoman Robin Kelly on Tuesday introduced the "Preventing Gun Trafficking Act'', which would prevent prohibited purchasers from obtaining guns by creating a federal firearms trafficking statute."One of our greatest challenges to combating gun violence in our communities is that Illinois is an oasis of commonsense safety laws surrounded by a desert of misguided 'guns everywhere, rules nowhere' ideology," Kelly said in a statement on Wednesday."In fact, more than half of all crime guns used in Chicago come from outside Illinois, largely from the bordering states of Indiana and Wisconsin, which have extremely weak laws," she said.David Chipman, senior adviser at Giffords Law, said in a statement on Wednesday: "Too often, law enforcement faces the tough job of solving a gun crime after a tragedy. It's time to put more focus on stopping criminals before they get a firearm and put communities at risk."Gun-trafficking is a nationwide problem, and officials say the Northeast is a major center of gun trafficking.Though New York and New Jersey also have gun laws that rank among the tightest in the country, firearms flow up Interstate 95 from the South into both states through what has become known as the "Iron Pipeline''.Between 2010 and 2015, 3 of every 4 guns recovered by authorities in New York state whose state of origin could be determined came from outside New York, officials said.Neighboring New Jersey contributed less that 1 percent of New York's trafficked guns. But almost half of them came from six states with comparably lax gun laws, according to data from the New York attorney general: Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.For the first quarter of 2019, more than 4 of every 5 identified guns used in crimes in New Jersey came from out of state, largely from the same pipeline that feeds New York.With few exceptions, officials said that those states allow sales between private parties at gun shows without background checks, as well as handgun purchases without first obtaining a permit.State and local officials, gun-control advocates and others say the real solution to gun trafficking lies in changes to federal law that states will have to follow.Only Congress and the president can set a baseline, such as universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, and requiring a license to buy and own a firearm.The day after the Gilroy shootings, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, sharply criticized the Senate for not advancing gun-control legislation."Enough is enough. Congress has a responsibility to every family torn apart by gun violence to act, and help advance a future that is finally free from this senseless violence," Pelosi said. "Every day the Senate refuses to act is a stain on the conscience of our nation."

                Farady Future CPUO commits everything to ensure company's success
            </a>
            <p>
                Carsten Breitfeld has succeeded Jia Yueting as CEO of Faraday Future (FF), the electric vehicle startup announced on Sept 3, the National Business Daily reported.Jia has now been installed as chief product and user officer (CPUO), according to FF's Sina Weibo account, which posted the news on the same day. As CPUO, he now takes the charge of work on the company's internet ecosystem, artificial intelligence, product definition, user acquisition, user experience and user operation.FF said the joint cooperation between Jia and Breitfeld is powerful combination that will benefit FF's long-term strategic development. Breitfeld's experience in the automobile and electric vehicle industries has merged with Jia's vision and knowledge of the internet, consumer electronics, AI and user operation.FF also announced open recruitment for its chairman of the board on the same day, saying Jia and Breitfeld will corporate to build a strong product technology and global management team, to push forward the reform of the company's top management structure.Analysts deemed Jia's resignation as CEO was clearly a critical move in the reform which appears to have already begun implementation.According to ThePaper.cn, FF will transfer power control from individuals to a partnership committee through a co-partnership system that the company's higher levels began designing late last year.The public considers Jia's resignation as a favourable move to tackle his secured-liability problem. Information published by FF in August this year showed Jia has paid back more than $3 billion in debt since the Letv funding crisis in November 2016. Some consider this to be a show of determination to pursue a co-partnership system in FF, as well as his persistence and individual sacrifice to achieve the dream of revolutionizing the auto industry.Jia said, "I'm giving up everything to make FF a success, repaying the debt as early as possible, and realizing my dream."

                Trump's GOP challengers say canceling primaries is a mistake
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - The three Republican challengers to President Donald Trump say it's a mistake for the party to cancel primaries ahead of the 2020 election.Bill Weld, Joe Walsh and Mark Sanford write in a Washington Post opinion piece published Friday that the Republican Party has "taken a wrong turn" in letting Trump define the party. They describe the president as "a serial self-promoter who has abandoned the bedrock principles of the GOP."At least four states — South Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and Kansas — have canceled Republican primaries and caucuses next year to help smooth Trump's path to reelection. Weld, Walsh and Sanford are urging the party to reconsider.Trump has dubbed his three challengers "The Three Stooges." None of them is expected to generate enough support to defeat Trump.AP
