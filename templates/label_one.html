But only 13 of these were lower-income countries, the report said, meaning that those most at risk of cervical cancer are still least likely to have access to the vaccine

                             It was only in the late 18th century and early 19th century that some writers started geographically referring to what is now Xinjiang as part of "Turkistan", which secessionists have used to create divisions among the people of different ethnic groups in Xinjiang.Interestingly, the term "Uygur" was first used to refer to the largest ethnic group in the region as late as 1934 although the region has been an integral part of China for centuries. As such, people in the West have no reason to call Xinjiang "Eastern Turkistan", suggesting the region used to be part of the Turkic Khaganate

The US Army Observer Group in China, also known as the Dixie Mission, was the US' first attempt to establish official relations with Mao Zedong's Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army, who were holed up in the northern mountain city of Yenan (Yan'an). Thanks to the miracle of email and the internet, China Daily was able to catch up with Lam - a Yale-trained eye surgeon whose passion is the history of World War Two in China and whose novel, Two Sons of China (Bondfire Books) came out last year and was reviewed in these pages. Some of the best details available of Whittlesey's final mission and death come from Wilbur Peterkin's Inside China 1943-1945: An Eyewitness Account of America's Mission in Yenan (Baltimore: Gateway Press, 1992), Lam said
