                Toronto driver charged with 10 counts of 1st degree murder
            </p>
            <p>
                TORONTO — A 25-year-old who plowed a van into a crowded Toronto sidewalk was ordered held Tuesday on 10 counts of murder and 13 of attempted murder as Canadian authorities and the public sought to make sense of what appeared to be one of the deadliest mass murders in the country's modern history.Alek Minassian showed little overt emotion as he made a brief appearance in a Toronto courtroom in a white jumpsuit and handcuffs. The judge ordered him detained without bond and scheduled the next hearing for May 10.Police, meanwhile, still appeared to be gathering evidence. About 20 officers made their way down the van's deadly path on Yonge Street searching for any evidence. Nearby, mourners had put together a makeshift memorial to the victims."It was like he was playing a video game, trying to kill as many people as possible," said Panna Patel, 42, who stopped by the memorial and had been at the scene a day earlier, getting cash from an ATM as it occurred. "He was looking people directly in the eye, making eye contact, it was so scary. He wasn't remorseful at all."Prime Minister Justin Trudeau dismissed the possibility of terrorism, saying that authorities see no national security element in the case.He told a news conference that the incident "hasn't changed the overall threat level in Canada," though it occurred as Cabinet ministers from the G7 nations were meeting in Toronto.Authorities so far had not disclosed a possible motive or cause, though "the incident definitely looked deliberate," Police Chief Mark Saunders told reporters at a late-night news conference.Saunders said Minassian, who lives in the Toronto suburb of Richmond Hill, had not been known to police previously. An online social media profile described him as a college student.Authorities released few details in the case, saying the investigation was still underway, with witnesses being interviewed and surveillance video being examined."We are looking very strongly to what the exact motivation was for this particular incident to take place," Saunders said. "We need every single piece of this puzzle so we can have a fulsome picture and account as to exactly what took place here."The driver was heading south on busy Yonge Street around 1:30 p.m. and the streets were crowded with people enjoying an unseasonably warm day when the van jumped onto the sidewalk.Ali Shaker, who was driving near the van at the time, told Canadian broadcast outlet CP24 that the driver appeared to be moving deliberately through the crowd at more than 30 mph."He just went on the sidewalk," a distraught Shaker said. "He just started hitting everybody, man. He hit every single person on the sidewalk. Anybody in his way he would hit."Witness Peter Kang told CTV News that the driver did not seem to make any effort to stop."If it was an accident he would have stopped," Kang said. "But the person just went through the sidewalk. He could have stopped."Video broadcast on several Canadian outlets showed police arresting the driver, dressed in dark clothes, after officers surrounded him and his rental Ryder van several blocks from where the incident occurred in the North York neighborhood of northern Toronto. He appeared to make some sort of gesture at the police with an object in his hand just before they ordered him to lie down on the ground and took him away.Witness Phil Zullo said that he saw police arresting the suspect and people "strewn all over the road" where the incident occurred."I must have seen about five, six people being resuscitated by bystanders and by ambulance drivers," Zullo said. "It was awful. Brutal."Police shut down the Yonge and Finch intersection following the incident and Toronto's transit agency said it had suspended service on the subway line running through the area.Trudeau on Monday expressed his sympathies for those involved."We should all feel safe walking in our cities and communities," he said. "We are monitoring this situation closely, and will continue working with our law enforcement partners around the country to ensure the safety and security of all Canadians."The stretch of Yonge Street where the victims were struck remains closed to traffic and was expected to stay blocked off for several days as police continue what is likely to be a lengthy investigation.??The incident prompted police to beef up security and close several streets around the Air Canada Centre on Monday night for the Toronto-Boston NHL playoff game. Police tweeted that similar road closures may be in effect for the Toronto Raptors NBA playoff game on Wednesday night.The incident occurred as Cabinet ministers from the major industrial countries were gathered in Canada to discuss a range of international issues in the run-up to the G7 meeting near Quebec City in June. Canadian Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale called the incident a "horrific attack" and said the G7 foreign ministers extended their condolences.Associated Press writers Ben Fox in Miami, and Rob Gillies in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, contributed to this report.AP

                Bilateral kinship, auto industry changes top issues at seminar
            </a>
            <p>
                The US and China have already established such a deep economic relationship that it would be very hard to pull back without causing a deep ripple through both nations' economies, said the president of Wanxiang America Corp and vice-president of the China General Chamber of Commerce Chicago."Economic fundamentals will dictate our relationship, and our track has already been defined and it is one of integration," Pin Ni told attendees at a seminar in Detroit Monday on the auto industry sponsored by the chamber and the accounting firm of Grant Thornton LLP.Ni, who launched Wanxiang America in 1994 as the North American offshoot of a privately held Chinese conglomerate and turned it into a major auto-parts company, said while there is concern over the bilateral relationship, he hasn't seen a major slowdown in Chinse investment in the US."We don't think that is necessarily the case. There are two Chinese companies who want to open plants in the Midwest right now," he said.Ni's remarks came before a panel discussion on the auto industry and how technology, electric vehicles and mobility will radically alter the auto industry. "The auto industry will change more in the next 15 years than it has in the last 50," said Kevin Gillis, senior vice-president of Key Safety Systems Inc.Richard Walawender of the Detroit-based Miller Canfield law firm, said that mobility companies seeking to exploit emerging technologies in autonomous driving, vehicle electrification and connectivity are disrupting the traditional models of the auto industry.Walawender said one area undergoing a rapid change is the relationship between original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like Ford and General Motors and their suppliers."The days of OEMs imposing conditions on suppliers are ending," he said and noted that technology companies like Google are taking a seat at the auto industry's table.Gillis, whose company's products include air bags and other safety equipment, said a key challenge for his company is where the occupant or occupants will be in an autonomous or driver-less vehicle."Occupants will become more like airline passengers. When we board a plane we let the pilot and staff handle the plane. Autonomous vehicles will offer a similar experience," he said.Despite the rapid progress of autonomous vehicles, states have been slow to update their laws and regulations to account for the new technology. Only a dozen US states have authorized autonomous vehicles said Walawender.Qiang Hong of the Center for Automotive Research noted that Michigan has taken the lead among the states."Michigan allows no driver in the vehicle for testing and also allows autonomous trucks to be tested," he said.

                Toys R Us plans to close 182 stores, citing holiday 'missteps'
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW YORK - Toys R Us, a nostalgic favorite even as many shoppers moved to Amazon and huge chains like Walmart, plans to close up to 182 stores after struggling during the holiday season.The company that once dominated toy sales in the United States has been operating under bankruptcy protection since last fall, when it filed for Chapter 11 under the weight of $5 billion in debt. Toys R Us operates about 900 stores in the US, including Babies R Us stores."I'm very sad about Toys R Us closing," said Dana Gillis, who was shopping at the store in Highland Park, Illinois, on Wednesday.

                Canada's Virtue/Moir win second Olympic gold in ice dance
            </a>
            <p>
                PYEONGCHANG - The ending of musical Moulin Rouge is sad, but it is not the case of Canadian ice dancers Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, who has danced to the music and beaten strong contenders from France and the United States to claim their second Olympic ice dancing title Tuesday.The championship marked the Canadian duo, who won gold at Vancouver 2010, the second pair to win two Olympic golds in this event, after Russians Pasha Grishuk and Evgeniy Platov's achievement in 1994 and 1998.With the fifth Olympic medal in hand, they also broke the record of four medals by the Swede Gillis and Russian Evgeniy Plushenko in figure skating.After winning the gold in team event, Virtue and Moir continued their strong run in original dance, setting personal best records of 122.40 points in free dance and 206.07 overall to stand on the top of the podium.Their strong ambition for the championship could be vividly shown in each powerful and steady lift, flowing step sequence and precise synchronized twizzles, making the crowd all on feet at the stands at a packed Gangneung Ice Arena."I am thrilled with this competition. That performance was really special and truly memorable. The gold medal is the cherry on the cake," said an excited Virtue.Commenting on the difference between the two victories in Vancouver and Pyeongchang, Moir said, "Extremely different this time. Obviously, 2010 we were in our own country. Those are moments we will never forget. But eight years later we're completely different people, we're completely different athletes.""We still love what we do. It's personal this time. It was for each other, we skated with each other in mind the whole way and we skated with our hearts. It's extremely fulfilling," said the 30-year-old Moir.

                World's last male northern white rhino battles illness
            </a>
            <p>
                NAIROBI -- The world's only remaining male northern white rhino has been battling with a life-threatening ailment, throwing the world's conservationists into a spin.The 45-year-old giant land mammal, fondly named as Sudan, has been sheltered at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in the northern Kenyan county of Laikipia, and has lately grappled with an infection on his right hind leg, undermining his capacity to roam around and forage.Sudan's health remained critical though veterinarians have been attending to him twice a day, Elodie Sampere, communications manager at Ol Pejeta Conservancy told Xinhua in an interview."There has been no significant improvement on the health of Sudan and doctors are on the standby to administer treatment twice a day," Sampere said, adding that conservationists and scientists are still hopeful the iconic species will overcome the current ailment.Conservationists from all over the world have been fascinated by the last remaining male northern white rhino with concerted efforts to prolong its lifespan.Under a "Last Chance to Survive" breeding program supported by global wildlife campaigners, Sudan and two of his female partners were relocated to their current abode in northern Kenya in 2009 to induce their breeding through a conducive natural habitat.However, due to advanced age, Sudan was unable to breed with his female partners, Fatu and Najin, adding to the fear that the white rhino subspecies was on the verge of extinction.GLOBAL CAMPAIGNOl Pejeta Conservancy last year kicked off a global campaign to save the world's last remaining subspecies of white rhinos through In Vitro Fertilization (IVF).Among the modern reproductive technologies, scientists are considering using southern white rhinos as surrogates to carry the northern white rhino's embryos, which would cost as much as $1 million.The campaign hit a crescendo last year when a dating app, Tinder, named Sudan the most eligible bachelor in the world. Since then, well-wishers have made considerable donations to support the surrogate birth.In January, two globally renowned monumental sculpture artists, Gillie and Marc Schattner, announced that they were carving three giant rhino sculptures that would be unveiled in New York City to raise awareness on the plight of the only three remaining northern white rhinos on the planet."The sculptures will be used to raise awareness and gather 1 million goodbye messages from the world. Gillie and Marc will then take these messages and use them as petition to stop the trading," Ol Pejeta Conservancy said in a statement.It revealed that the two artists will recreate Sudan, Najin and Fatu into life-sized bronze sculptures so that everyone in the world would get a chance to see them, touch them, hug them and say goodbye to the iconic species.Ol Pejeta Conservancy disclosed that each rhino bronze sculpture would be stacked on top of the other to illustrate how fragile but magnificent these creatures were, arousing the sentiment to halt their extinction.TIP OF ICEBERGOl Pejeta Conservancy, East Africa's largest black rhino sanctuary, has been updating well-wishers on the health status of Sudan, and a recent Facebook post from the conservancy struck a positive note indicating that Sudan's health improved slightly following a heavy down pour."It has been raining heavily on Ol Pejeta for the past couple of days and the weather certainly seems to have lifted Sudan's spirits. He has been able to wallow in the mud with the careful assistance of his caregivers, something that he seems to savor," Ol Pejeta Conservancy posted on its Facebook account Tuesday."We are cautiously optimistic that he (Sudan) will respond favorably to the treatments that are being administered by our vet teams," said the conservancy. His two female counterparts have remained in good health.According to Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), the global population of northern white rhino subspecies stood at about 2,000 in the 1960s but it shrank to the current three due to poaching and habitat loss.The fate of northern white rhinos is just the tip of the iceberg. According to the 2016 Living Planet Report by the World Wildlife Fund, the global population of fish, birds. mammals, amphibians and reptiles declined by 58 percent between 1970 and 2012.The organization also said the experts calculated that 0.01-0.1 percent of all species will extinct each year, at an unprecedented speed between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than the natural extinction rate.ONGOING BATTLEKenya has earned global acclaim for its spearheading efforts to save the world's three last remaining northern white rhinos, and wildlife entities like Ol Pejeta Conservancy that occupies an estimated 90,000 acres of land have been at the fore front in the battle.Heavily armed guards have been providing 24-hour security for Sudan to protect it from poachers who are to blame for the reduction in the population of the rhino subspecies in Kenya.The Kenyan government has also stepped up efforts to save rhinos through a raft of measures such as punitive legal action on poachers as well as community participation in the conservation of the iconic species.Najib Balala, cabinet secretary for tourism and wildlife, told Xinhua that Kenya was undeterred in its commitment to saving all rhino subspecies despite jitters caused by Sudan's illness."This northern white rhino, the only remaining in the world, came from Czechoslovakia. It was brought to Kenya to survive. But unfortunately, we cannot control age. It is now 45 years old. But we have very elaborate programs for southern white and black rhinos," said Balala.He further noted that the population of rhinos and elephants has gone up due to investments in robust anti-poaching measures. Balala also thanked China for rallying behind such efforts.Kenya currently hosts a population of around 1,100 rhinos, the third largest globally after South Africa and Namibia.

                Tourist exodus as quake toll hits 105
            </a>
            <p>
                Appeal for help made after 20,000 people left homeless MATARAM, Indonesia - Terrified holidaymakers rushed for boats and planes to leave Indonesia's Lombok island on Tuesday after it suffered a second deadly quake within a week, as rescuers scrambled to reach remote areas where survivors are in urgent need of food and shelter. The shallow magnitude 6.9 quake killed at least 105 people and destroyed thousands of buildings in Lombok on Sunday. Rescuers on Tuesday resumed the desperate search for survivors, and to recover the bodies of victims in the rubble of houses, mosques and schools destroyed in the latest disaster. More than 20,000 people are believed to have been made homeless on Lombok as the quake brought down or damaged about 13,000 houses, with 236 severely injured, and authorities have appealed for more medical personnel and basic supplies. The tremor struck as evening prayers were being held across the Muslim-majority island. Emergency crews using heavy equipment to search through a collapsed mosque in northern Lombok and managed to pull one man alive from the twisted wreckage. Video shot by a soldier shows rescuers shouting "Thank God" as a man is pulled from a space under the mosque's flattened roof sometime on Monday and he staggers away from the ruins supported by soldiers. "You're safe, mister," says one of the soldiers as emotion overcomes the man, clad in Islamic robes, and villagers crowd around him. Extra flights Disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said he hopes "a lot" of people can be saved from the mosque. Two people were rescued from the building on Monday including a woman with a broken leg, said villager Supri Yono, and three were found dead. "We're forced to deal with broken bones in the traditional way at home because the hospital had to deal with hundreds of other injuries," said Budhiawan, the head of Lading-Lading village. Thousands of tourists have left Lombok since Sunday evening, fearing further earthquakes, some on extra flights that were laid on by airlines and some on ferries to Bali. French tourist Laurent Smadja, who had been on Gilli Meno, the smallest of the three islands, described scenes of chaos and confusion in the aftermath of the quake as holidaymakers jostled to leave. "We had no electricity and no information about what to do. We saw everybody leaving in boats but no boat came to us," he said. On Tuesday he eventually managed to board a boat with locals and head to nearby Lombok. He made his way to the airport, where hundreds of holidaymakers slept on the floor overnight awaiting flights out. An official at the airport said the airlines opened ticket counters for the tourists wishing to immediately leave Lombok. The airport was now also opened 24 hours to serve flights for foreign tourists. He added Indonesian airlines provided five extra flights bound to Bali, Jakarta and Surabaya for them on Monday with more flights from Lombok having been planned in the following days. Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas) said on Twitter it had rescued more than 3,000 people from the Gilis by Monday evening and many more were yet to be evacuated. "Thousands more, tourists and hotel workers, are still in the process of being evacuated out of the three island," the disaster mitigation agency said in a statement on Monday evening.

                S. Korea eases rules on military service
            </a>
            <p>
                SEOUL - South Korea's supreme court ruled on Thursday that moral and religious beliefs are valid reasons to refuse the country's mandatory military service, in a case that has implications for hundreds of conscientious objectors.Almost 65 years after the end of the Korean War, nearly every able-bodied South Korean male between the ages of 18 and 35 must still complete around two years of military service.Anyone refusing the call-up has usually ended up in prison for 18 months, and more than 19,000 conscientious objectors have been jailed since 1950, most of them Jehovah's Witnesses.But the Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a conscientious objector on Thursday, months after a landmark constitutional court ruling that authorities had to provide an alternative to joining the military.At the center of Thursday's case is Jehovah's Witness Oh Seung-hun, who was called up in 2013 but refused, was found guilty, and lost an initial appeal to the high court. "It is the majority opinion of the supreme court that conscientious objection is... a valid reason (to refuse conscription)," said chief Supreme Court justice Kim Myeong-su.Punishing conscientious objectors "for refusing conscription on grounds of religious faith, in other words, freedom of conscience, is deemed an excessive constraint to an individual's freedom of conscience", he added.The decision, by a majority of nine votes to four, overturned a previous Supreme Court ruling 14 years ago.Oh, 34, said he had refused to join the military as doing so went against biblical teaching."The bible says that everyone who uses a sword will be killed by a sword," Oh said."I expected to suffer for objecting to conscription but I thought the pain I would feel by not listening to my inner voice would be far worse."Jehovah's Witnesses welcomed the ruling, calling it a "huge step forward in ending this policy of imprisoning our fellow believers"."Today the Supreme Court has brought South Korea more in line with international norms," said spokesman Paul Gillies.According to the Jehovah's Witnesses, more than 900 similar cases are pending in the South Korean justice system, with another 96 people currently serving prison terms for not fulfilling their duties.Seoul's armed forces rely heavily on conscription, and the social implications of the South's military service are also enormous - men must interrupt or delay either their education or their careers to comply, with Tottenham striker Son Heung-min a high-profile recent example.He only secured an exemption - avoiding a potentially ruinous career break - by winning gold at this year's Asian Games in Indonesia.Agence France-presse

                Stores offer 'experiences' to fend with internet
            </a>
            <p>
                Spending a Saturday afternoon shopping at a US department store used to be a favorite pastime in America. But stepping foot in a store has long been replaced with point-and-click from the comfort of home or anywhere.The shift in consumer behavior in favor of online buying knocked down sales at US department stores 20 percent from 2017 to 2018, according to the US Census Bureau.Now, American department stores — and many stores throughout the world — are trying to reinvent themselves, seeking to offer consumers something they can't get from Amazon or other online sellers: an experience.They are combining digital technology with meaningful experiences to draw shoppers into their stores. Some, like Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's in New York City, are spending millions to make existing stores more attractive."Retailers must adapt to a new technology-enhanced environment or go under. Stores (and shopping centers) must get creative to offer enticing experiences that will get consumers off-line and in the stores,'' Mary Gilly, a professor of marketing at the University of California-Irvine Paul Merage School, told China Daily.In Plano, Texas, a store called Neighborhood Goods is showcasing what the future of retail shopping might look like, according to The Wall Street Journal.Customers talk with a brand ambassador' about what they would like to buy while sipping on a specially prepared cocktail from a cafe. Customers can complete a purchase using an app and have their purchases delivered by a sales assistant, who knows their in-store location.The store has no cash registers, and shoppers must scan a barcode to buy things. There is also the option to buy out-of-stock items in-store and have the product delivered home."Some retailers (Nordstrom, for example) are using their online site to build traffic to their real-life stores. When consumers come to the bricks-and-mortar store to pick up items they've ordered online, there is always the opportunity to attract them to other purchases, Gilly said.Nordstrom also lets customers in some stores make returns by dropping their items into a box and walking out — no human interaction required.Macy's shares are down 35 percent so far this year after dismal second-quarter earnings. But the department store is testing new concepts to increase in-store traffic, including Market @ Macy's, launched last year at the Manhattan store.It is a pop-up retail experience that offers new and existing brands a chance to showcase their goods in the store.To capture customers, Macy's and J.C. Penney announced a partnership with the resale marketplace thredUp in August. The deal will see the department stores sell used clothes and accessories at some of their branches.It comes as buying secondhand clothes, shoes and bags gains momentum among younger shoppers, who are more conscious of recycling.Bloomingdale's (owned by Macy's), Urban Outfitters and Ann Taylor are launching services that will let customers rent clothes. Walmart, the world's largest retailer, has embraced "omnichannel'' retail, which blends online and in-store channels to let customers order by text at Walmart.com for same-day deliveries. The service is called Jetblack.Neiman Marcus' "Snap Find Shop" app' allows customers to take a picture of an item in the store and look for it or similar items online, seamlessly blending online and offline shopping.Make-up store Sephora's mobile app lets users sample makeup by placing filters over their live selfies to see what it would look like on their face before heading into the store to buy it.Target's app allows customers to shop in-store and then get a discount on, for example, beauty items, by scanning the items into the app and then paying for the goods at a cash register.Other ways department stores are taking advantage of technology include using social media to market their brands and promotions, and sending digital coupons.In-store facial recognition technology is being deployed in several big-box retailers to map out where customers like to stand and where they go after entering the store to determine layouts, according to Forbes.Big stores realize that they must use their selling points – location, size and scale – to offer "experiences" to entice shoppers, says one expert.Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, a data analytics and consulting company, told China Daily: "Department stores need to innovate and think about the services people want from a modern-day shop. This goes beyond selling products and involves concepts like food service, beauty spas, classes and events."Essentially, they need to differentiate and think of new things to bring customers in. Working with third parties is one of the solutions, but department stores need to do most innovation on their own so they can reap full rewards," he said.The consequence of getting it wrong means many more stores will either go belly-up or be forced to close branches, data from Coresight Research shows.At least 7,500 stores will close this year — including Dressbarn, Pier 1, Gap and others – according to Coresight Research. It predicts that that number could increase to 12,000 by year-end.Another problem for department stores is that some big brands are pulling out.Ralph Lauren closed about a quarter of its US department store distributions last year. Michael Kors, Coach and others also have announced plans to pull back from their dependence on department stores, preferring to use online stores."In many ways, the fate of department stores is in their own hands, and one of the issues is that too many of the chains have not properly invested and evolved their concepts as customer demands have changed," he said.
