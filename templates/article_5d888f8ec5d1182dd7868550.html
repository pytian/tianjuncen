                Professor Lectures on International Law and China's Position at Xi'an Jiaotong University
            </p>
            <p>
                The New Port Report Series Activities designed by Xi'an Jiaotong University in Shaanxi province kicked off on Monday with Professor Kuen-chen Fu's lecture on how ocean neighbors get along. In his English report, Fu, dean of the Nanhai Research Institute at Xiamen University, introduced the basic concepts and terminology related to maritime territorial sovereignty and the historical origin and specific situation of the dispute between China and the surrounding countries on the sovereignty of islands and reefs, and put forward his own views on dealing with the issue of maritime sovereignty. From the perspective of international law, Fu analyzed the disputes over oceans, such as the Diaoyu Island issue, saying that in terms of maritime claims, legal principles and human feelings need to be weighed. In addition to resolving disputes by international rules, China should also adhere to the principle of sovereignty and achieve common development and development with surrounding countries."The ocean was once a barrier to the mainland, but with the progress of human technology, the ocean has been more and more developed and utilized, and has become a convenient and safe route for trade and cultural exchanges. The future development of sea areas also needs to take into account environmental protection and make efforts for the sustainable development of the Earth,” Fu said. Zhang Maizeng, Party secretary of Xi'an Jiaotong University, said the "New Port Report" series activities were the first exploration and demonstration of the connotation construction of "internationalization" of the school’s innovative port. It will publicize to the world the latest exploration and research achievements of the university in different disciplines.Professor Fu gives his report on International Law and China's Position on Apr 29 at Xi'an Jiaotong University.

                Constructive China-Japan ties help build community spirit
            </a>
            <p>
                In a sign of continuously warming relations between Beijing and Tokyo, Japanese naval forces are reportedly expected to send warships on a courtesy visit to Qingdao next April, to take part in the parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Liberation Army's Navy. In reference to the planned visit, the first of its kind in seven years, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Wednesday that more military exchanges between the two countries are beneficial for both sides to "properly handle disputes and consolidate mutual trust in security". The move toward restoring normal military contacts comes as the two sides have just concluded consultations on the creation of a maritime and air liaison mechanism to help avoid any misunderstanding or misjudgment. The two countries are yet to resolve the territorial dispute over the Diaoyu Islands in East China Sea, and the liaison mechanism will be an effective means of reducing the risks of any untoward incident happening.

                Chinese culture vital to exchanges across the Straits in the new era
            </a>
            <p>
                Chinese culture has always been a basis and driving force of cross-Straits exchanges and cooperation. In the new era, Chinese culture will keep playing an essential role in uniting compatriots from both sides of the Straits to work together to realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.With 2018 marking the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, and Jan 1, 2019, marking the 40th anniversary of a Message to Taiwan Compatriots, nearly every aspect of exchanges across the Straits has deepened, increasingly injecting new impetus into the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations.Pop music from Taiwan campuses became popular on the Chinese mainland in the 1980s, bringing plenty of artistic enjoyment and the island's latest news to mainland compatriots.

                Des fouilles archéologiques à la redécouverte de l’histoire
            </a>
            <p>
                Un objet de décoration de toiture en forme de dragon, dans la province du Hebei. [Provided to China Daily]Dix sites d’intérêt historique nouvellement découverts représentent une large partie de l’histoire connue, depuis l’ère paléolithique jusqu’au 19ème siècle. Ils ont été identifiés lors de la publication, à la fin du mois dernier, de la liste annuelle des grandes découvertes archéologiques chinoises.La liste 2018 des 10 premières découvertes archéologiques nouvellement faites en Chine témoigne de l’expansion, de la lutte et de la gloire de la civilisation chinoise, ainsi que de ses contacts fréquents avec l’étranger. Y figurent des reliques remontant à plus de 20 000 ans dans la province du Guangdong, mais aussi l’épave d’un navire de guerre coulé en 1894. La liste a été établie par un comité de juges comprenant 21 experts de première catégorie issus d’institutions universitaires, d’universités et de musées de tout le pays.Parmi les découvertes essentielles de 2018, on signale le premier témoignage de l’utilisation humaine du charbon, il y a 3 500 ans, dans la vallée fluviale de l’Ili, dans la région autonome ouïgoure du Xinjiang. C’était un millier d’années plus tôt que la période où l’on pensait que l’homme avait commencé à employer le charbon. « D’abondants vestiges métallurgiques de cuivre et de fer ont également été mis au jour sur le site », dit Yu Zhiyong, un archéologue du Xinjiang. « Ils nous ont fourni d’importantes références pour des études semblables dans toute les prairies de l’Eurasie ».Sur le site de Lushanmao, à Yan’an dans la province du Shaanxi, de nombreuses découvertes capitales ont été faites dans les ruines d’une ville datant de 4 500 ans et s’étendant sur plus de 200 hectares. Les vestiges d’une cour et de terrasses qu’elles abritent sont considérés comme les prototypes des palais et des temples chinois ancestraux, commente Chen Honghai, professeur d’archéologie à la Northwest University de Xi’an.Le Jingyuan, un croiseur cuirassé de la flotte de Beiyang, qui est devenue la plus puissante des quatre marines chinoises modernisées vers la fin de la dynastie Qing (1644-1911), a symbolisé à une époque le rêve collectif de la nation qui consistait à posséder une force maritime dernier cri et redoutable. Néanmoins, le Jingyuan a été envoyé par le fond et la flotte détruite au cours de la guerre sino-japonaise (1894-95). Le navire est resté sous les eaux jusqu’à ce que son épave finisse par être retrouvée l’an dernier.Il avait été construit à Stettin, en Allemagne (ville devenue Szczecin, en Pologne). C’est l’un des premiers modèles de croiseurs cuirassés allemands. Hormis l’importance sentimentale du navire de guerre pour les Chinois, la découverte de l’épave a été cruciale pour les études de l’histoire navale mondiale, assure Chai Xiaoming, directeur de l’académie chinoise de patrimoine culturel.Autre découverte d’importance militaire, le site de Fanjiayan à Chongqing montre la façon dont la célèbre forteresse Diaoyu a contribué à la défense contre l’armée mongole pendant 36 ans avant la chute de la dynastie Song du Sud (1127-1279). L’endroit est censé avoir joué un rôle charnière dans l’histoire mondiale car Mongke Khan, le quatrième khan suprême de l’Empire mongol, est mort pendant le siège de la forteresse, et le déploiement vers l’ouest de l’armée mongole en Europe a été stoppé.On a également retrouvé sur ce site les vestiges rarement vus d’une administration locale issue de cette dynastie.Pour autant, les nouvelles découvertes ont révélé la présence de manifestations d’amitié et de communications culturelles dans les temps anciens.Des signes de communication entre l’Asie orientale et l’Asie du Sud-Est datant de 25 000 à 10 000 ans sont visibles sur le site de Qingtang dans la province du Guangdong.À Liujiawa, dans la province du Shaanxi, on a découvert des gens de groupes ethniques et de milieux culturels différents enterrés dans le même cimetière remontant à la dynastie Zhou de l’Est (770-256 avant notre ère). De nombreux instruments de musique y ont également été mis au jour.À Zhangjiagang, dans la province du Jiangsu, on a retrouvé les traces d’un port florissant datant de la dynastie Tang (618-907). D’après les vestiges d’un temple qu’ils y ont observés, les archéologues imaginent que c’est de là que le moine chinois Jianzhen avait entamé son sixième voyage pour propager le bouddhisme au Japon.

                Abe praises outgoing Chinese ambassador
            </a>
            <p>
                Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe praised top Chinese envoy's work in improving Japan-China relations and thanked him for playing an active role "when the two countries face difficult situations" on Tuesday.Abe made the remarks at a reception held in Tokyo for Cheng Yonghua, Chinese ambassador to Japan, who is leaving Japan soon after being ambassador to Japan for more than nine years."Ambassador Cheng, using his fluent Japanese and wide range of personal connections, has made great contribution to the development of Japan-China relations even when the two countries face difficult situations," Abe said, adding that he wants to push the Japan-China relationship into a new era as "competition transforms into coordination".Cheng said the happiest thing for him as ambassador was that "China-Japan relationship returned to the normal track after passing the most difficult period since the normalization of diplomatic relations"."Peace, friendship and cooperation between China and Japan have once again began their journey and will continue to make progress. And that makes me feel secure as I leave," Cheng said.Among the first batch of students to study abroad since the founding of the People's Republic of China, Cheng came to Japan in 1973 and has lived and worked in the country for more than 30 years.Having visited all of the 47 prefectures in Japan, Cheng's tenure is also the longest among Chinese ambassadors to Japan since Beijing established diplomatic relationship with Tokyo in 1972.During Cheng's tenure, China-Japan relationship saw many twists and turns, including the 2012 Diaoyu Islands dispute which brought the bilateral ties to a freezing point.Chen said the importance of Sino-Japanese relationship will not be changed by anyone who likes or hates the other country and he is confident that the mutual understanding will improve in the future through dialogues."I have fully experienced the beautiful scenery of Japan and its culture of different places that have deep ties with China," he said, "although sometimes our opinions are not completely the same, we can gain people's understanding and trust through dialogues."

                Time ripe for promoting peace in Northeast Asia
            </a>
            <p>
                The dynamics of Northeast Asia are shifting.The Korean Peninsula is seeing positive signs over denuclearization, with both the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea making all the right gestures. Tension has been eased and motivation for regional cooperation boosted. There cannot be a better time for promoting a regional political and security agenda, as well as economic and cultural exchange, for a peaceful and prosperous Northeast Asia.These are the best times for Northeast Asia since the 19th century. Countries in the region were colonized by the Western powers, and later by their Asian neighbor, Japan. After World War II, Northeast Asia was caught in the Cold War and divided into two camps.It has remained the only region still plagued by the Cold War mentality, because the United States has refused to make peace with the DPRK. To defend itself from the US, the DPRK resorted to developing nuclear weapons.In 2018, the DPRK declared a major shift in its national policy, from the previous parallel development of nuclear weapons and economy to the current focus on the economy. This move has been viewed as an initiative to halt nuclear development and extend an olive branch to the other nations.The DPRK's concession on its nuclear development has led to breakthroughs in its foreign relations. Two summits between US President Donald Trump and DPRK top leader Kim Jong-un have been held, as well as three meetings between the DPRK and ROK leaders.China-Japan relations, which had hit rock bottom following differences over the Diaoyu Islands, are back on track. The ROK and China have started to mend relations that were strained because of US deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-ballistic missile system in the ROK.China-DPRK relations reached a new high. The positive signs in this region and in the bilateral relations have created a favorable atmosphere for regional economic cooperation. Talks on a trilateral China-Japan-ROK free trade agreement have resumed, and Japan has voiced its willingness to engage in the Belt and Road Initiative.All stakeholders in the region should look at the bigger picture and build a peaceful and prosperous Northeast Asia.First, all the Northeast Asian countries should reach a consensus on cooperation. All nations should safeguard regional stability and press ahead for greater development for the long-term goal of building a peaceful and prosperous region.Second, all parties should strengthen cooperation and push for denuclearization with one voice.Third, the Northeast Asian countries, while handling disputes between each other, should be willing to make some compromises. All nations should learn to meet each other halfway to resolve conflicts, including territorial disputes.Fourth, the Northeast Asian countries should accelerate development of free trade zones. The future of Northeast Asia hinges on the integration of the nations in the region.Last, the BRI should be a cohesive and driving force for a close-knit Northeast Asia. The initiative, aligned with the development agendas of individual nations, will spur integration and cement crossborder cooperation in the region.The author is vice-director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

                Political trust key to Sino-Japanese ties: China Daily editorial
            </a>
            <p>
                Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng and Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Takeo Akiba exchanged views on bilateral ties and international and regional issues of common concern at the China-Japan Strategic Dialogue in Japan on Saturday, which concluded with a proclaimed commitment to "building a China-Japan relationship consistent with the demands of a new era".Although more symbolic than about technical specifics, the Dialogue, the 14th of its kind, was a further sign that ties are recovering, as it was the first to be held after a seven-year hiatus due to the two countries' longstanding diplomatic impasse.Created in 2005, the mechanism served as an important channel for strategic communication between the two countries until its suspension in 2012. Frequent, timely bilateral interaction proved an essential anchor of bilateral ties in times of crises, until it came to a stop after the 13th, when Beijing and Tokyo locked horns over the Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea.Given how relations soured after that, it was natural that the just restored Dialogue should focus on macro-level concerns, especially the orientation of the bilateral relationship. As sources close to Beijing's diplomatic authorities have disclosed, Saturday's talks were more about clarifying each other's bottom lines, and discussing crisis management and future plans.As the latest quarrel between Japan and the Republic of Korea demonstrates, Northeast Asian nations, China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Japan and Republic of Korea in particular, remain in the shadow of history more than seven decades after the end of the World War II.These four neighbors do need to find a way out of the debilitating quagmire of history so they can start a brand-new chapter for regional economic development and intra-regional relations.For bilateral relations between China and Japan that meet the requirements of the new era, Beijing and Tokyo need to maintain close communication and strengthen high-level guidance so they can increase their political mutual trust and further expand their convergence of interests.All being well, the two countries can continue to keep the bigger picture in mind and maintain the current positive momentum in their relations, given President Xi Jinping has accepted, in principle, the invitation of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to visit Japan in spring next year.That will be an opportunity for the two leaders to further shape a shared vision for future-oriented bilateral relations.

                Strategic talks between China, Japan resume
            </a>
            <p>
                The dialogue, being held after a gap of seven years, focuses on boosting bilateral relations An amicable tie between China and Japan serves the interests of the two countries and the region, said experts as Beijing and Tokyo resumed strategic talks after a seven-year hiatus. On Saturday, a strategic dialogue between Le Yucheng, China's vice-minister of foreign affairs, and his Japanese counterpart Takeo Akiba was held in Japan's Karuizawa, a mountain resort in Nagano prefecture. China and Japan had candid exchanges on bilateral and regional issues, and confirmed to push forward the consensus reached between President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the G20 Summit in Osaka in June, said a foreign ministry statement issued after the dialogue. "China and Japan had advocated themselves to build a relation that meet the requirements of a new era," it said. The resumption of the China-Japan strategic dialogue is an important sign that Beijing and Tokyo have pushed forward their bilateral relations on the right track and forged for even closer ties, said Lu Hao, a researcher from the Institute of Japanese Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Official exchanges, including the strategic dialogue, was suspended after China and Japan got mired over the uninhabited Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea. "The dialogue not only focuses on improving bilateral ties, but also touches on some important regional and international issues of common interest for both sides," Lu said. On Friday, while meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, Le said China and Japan should keep up with the positive momentum brought by the improved ties and "enhance short bars while strengthening the long ones at the same time" as in a wooden barrel theory. Saying the meeting in Osaka between Xi and Abe was very fruitful, Kono said Japan expects a state visit by Xi next spring and is willing to work with China "in various fields and face global challenges shoulder to shoulder". Zhou Yongsheng, a professor and deputy director of the Japanese Studies Center at China Foreign Affairs University, said, "As Sino-Japanese relations have shown signs of warming in recent years, both countries should cherish the momentum and build new relations featuring a shift from competition to collaboration under the guidance of the strategic dialogue mechanism. Promoting China-Japan ties will benefit the peace and prosperity of Asia." As for the "short bars" between the world's second and third largest economies, Noriyoshi Ehara, chief economist of Japan's Institute for International Trade and Investment, said one perspective is the "little understanding of China among Japanese people". "Nowadays, more Chinese people get to know Japan through tourism and education but it is not the case with Japanese people," Ehara said. "So it is crucial to boost people-to-people exchanges and China should do more to fascinate others using its history and culture."

                Cooperation for the common good
            </a>
            <p>
                Relations between China and Japan are on an upswing and they should take the opportunity to strengthen their communication and coordination Sino-Japanese ties have seen many ups and downs over the past 70 years, from isolation to overall engagement and peaceful cooperation. Through all the vicissitudes, they have come to realize that if stability is ensured, they can drive not only the Asia-Pacific but also the global growth story. Right after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, China and Japan, remained politically isolated, maintaining no diplomatic ties for over 23 years. In September 1972, the Chinese and Japanese governments issued the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement, normalizing bilateral relations and opening a new chapter in ties. Japan can't escape its wrongdoings, but the overall tone of Sino-Japanese ties has changed since the two nations normalized diplomatic relations and embarked on the new road of peaceful cooperation. The far-reaching significance of the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan goes beyond the bilateral scope. It has also had a major impact on the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large. China and Japan concluded the Treaty of Peace and Friendship in August 1978, laying a political foundation for the comprehensive development of bilateral relations. This was one of the three major events that year that were of great historical significance, not only for China, but also the world. The others were the joint communiqu�� on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, and the launch of China's reform and opening-up. Japan's offering of official development assistance to China meant a lot in the early stage of China's reform and opening-up. With the end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the international community underwent dramatic changes in the 1990s. At the bilateral level, Japan became mired in its economic downturn, while China's policy of reform and opening-up saw it overtake Japan to be the world's second-largest economy in 2010. A host of external and internal changes from the 1990s to the 21st century have posed new challenges to Sino-Japanese ties. Japan strengthened its alliance with the US, involved itself with Taiwan issues, its leadership visited the Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan's war dead including those convicted of war crimes committed during its war of aggression, and it illegally "nationalized" China's Diaoyu Islands. These actions seriously hit strategic mutual trust and seriously tested China-Japan relations. However, against the backdrop of deepening globalization, common interests have taken center stage and the demand for cooperation has only increased, injecting powerful impetus on both sides to safeguard peaceful coexistence and expand bilateral multilateral cooperation. Ever since Japan changed its attitude toward China's proposed Belt and Road Initiative in 2017, bilateral ties have showed signs of thawing. In May 2018, during Premier Li Keqiang's official visit to Japan, both sides arrived at a consensus on the cooperation in third-party markets under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative. In October, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited China and re-emphasized the significance of third-party market cooperation with a total of 52 projects signed worth $18 billion. Third-party market cooperation will help to ease the vicious competition between the two countries. China and Japan have their own advantages in exploring third-party markets. For example, Japan has comparative advantages in technology, engineering management and operational experience in infrastructure construction, while China enjoys comparative advantages in terms of capital, cost, corporate decision-making and technologies in some special fields. Cooperation in this regard will not only bring more international capital to support Belt and Road projects, but also facilitate Japan's access to markets in Eurasia. Bilateral cooperation in third-party markets has a promising future and is expected to achieve multiple-win results. Relations between people are the foundation of state-to-state relations. Cultural and people-to-people exchanges have played an increasingly important role in the interactions between China and Japan. The leaders of the two countries reached a 10-point consensus when they met ahead of the G20 Summit in Osaka in June. Both sides have stressed that they should continue to strengthen people-to-people exchanges. The number of tourists from the Chinese mainland visiting Japan reached 4.53 million in the first half of 2019, a year-on-year increase of 11.7 percent. The two countries are also due to launch a high-level consultation mechanism within this year. Despite all the twists and turns, Sino-Japan ties have maintained an overall positive trend since they established diplomatic relations, and they have held firm to the bottom line of peaceful cooperation, which is in line with the fundamental long-term interests of both countries. It goes without saying that China and Japan are beneficiaries of a stable regional and international environment. The two countries have broad space for cooperation in the proper handling of security problems. They should make joint efforts to strengthen communication and coordination on the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue and work together to build a security mechanism in Northeast Asia. To realize sustainable and steady development, the two countries should focus on the following: First, both sides should look at bilateral relations as part of East Asian civilization. Second, both sides should deepen mutual understanding, enhance strategic mutual trust and build constructive security relations and effectively manage their differences. Third, both sides should promote pragmatic cooperation and lay a solid foundation for better China-Japan ties. Fourth, both sides should shoulder their responsibilities as major powers, strengthen communication and coordination in regional and international affairs as well as rule-making. By working together they can safeguard their mutual interests and promote regional peace and prosperity.
