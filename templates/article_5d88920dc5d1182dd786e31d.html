                In sharp exchanges, Democrats go after front-runner Biden, Harris
            </p>

                Joe Biden had to fend off attacks Wednesday during a Democratic presidential primary debate about his stances on health care, immigration and criminal justice, as several Democrats trailing in the polls looked to increase their standing.Ten candidates faced off on the stage of the Fox Theatre in Detroit, Michigan, one night after 10 other Democratic hopefuls clashed on the same stage.US Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, in calling out the former vice-president on favoring giving visas to "PhDs", said it was that type of division on immigration that Republicans were supporting. Booker also chastised Biden for invoking "President Obama more than anyone in this campaign".Biden went back at Booker over his tenure as mayor of Newark, New Jersey, saying Booker hired (former New York City Republican mayor and Donald Trump adviser) "Rudy Giuliani's police chief".Booker criticized Biden's support of a 1994 crime bill that the senator said disproportionately affected minority citizens."There are people right now in prison for life for drug offenses," Booker said, accusing Biden of using "phony rhetoric" in touting the crime bill. "I believe in redemption. You offered no redemption."New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who in his second debate again made a move to be heard over the fray, asked Biden if he had counseled former president Barack Obama against deportations of undocumented immigrants.Biden said his conversations with the president were private."You still haven't answered my question," de Blasio replied.US Senator Kamala Harris of California, who pressured Biden in the June debates by criticizing his opposition to school busing to integrate schools in the 1970s, found herself fending off attacks on her own record as California attorney general.Biden said Harris did nothing about racial polarization in public schools in San Francisco and Los Angeles.US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii said Harris put 1,500 people in prison for marijuana convictions and "laughed when she was asked if she smoked marijuana". Gabbard said Harris "actually blocked evidence" that would have freed a death row prisoner.Entrepreneur Andrew Yang, whose parents came to the US from Taiwan, said the candidates should have been talking about all the jobs lost to artificial intelligence."We've already automated away millions of manufacturing jobs," Yang said. "Amazon is closing 30 percent of America's stores and malls and paying zero in taxes."Earlier in the debate, Biden opposed the "Medicare for all" approach to the American healthcare system, an issue that was prominent in Tuesday's debate and favored by top-tier candidates, the senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts."You can't beat President Trump with double talk on this plan," Biden told Harris. "The plan no matter how you cut it costs $3 trillion. It will require middle-class taxes to go up, not down.""In 2019 in America for a Democrat to be running for president with a plan that does not cover everyone, I think is without excuse," Harris countered."The ultimate choice is an election," de Blasio said. "This should be the party that stands for universal healthcare."Booker, who said "we spend more than every other nation" on health care, said pitting progressives versus moderates on the issue was self-defeating.On trade with China, Gabbard said that US tariffs on China have had a "ravaging and devastating effect" on American farmers.Biden said he would "renegotiate" the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed trade agreement from which Trump withdrew the US."Either China is going to write the rules on 21st century trade or we are," Biden said.US Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, when the issue of racial polarization was addressed, said: "I can explain to white women in the suburbs that when their son is walking down the street with a bag of M&Ms in his pocket, wearing a hoodie, his whiteness is what protects him from not being shot."Also on the stage Wednesday were US Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado; Julian Castro of Texas, former secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and Washington state Governor Jay Inslee.

                Protesters rally to block new statewide bans on abortion
            </a>
            <p>
                Hundreds of rallies protesting stringent new state abortion bans and laws were held across America on Tuesday at statehouses, town squares and court houses as women in the tens of thousands demanded the right to choose what to do with their own bodies.The "Stop the Bans" protests that started at noon were in reaction to sweeping changes made in conservative-run states like Alabama, where a recent law imposes the harshest limitations of any state in the country by prohibiting nearly all abortions at any point during a pregnancy.Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio also have enacted statutes banning abortions if a fetal heartbeat can be detected.Abortion-rights activists at the rallies slammed the moves as thinly veiled attempts to challenge the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v Wade decision to legalize abortion.Thousands of women and men rallied in Washington in front of the Supreme Court, where they held pro-choice placards reading "Abortion is a human right!" and wore pink or purple T-shirts. Their rallying cry was "Stand up, fight back!" and "This is what democracy looks like!"With abortion expected to be a key issue in the 2020 presidential election, several Democratic 2020 presidential hopefuls appeared with protesters on the front steps of the Supreme Court in Washington, including US senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Klobuchar shouted into a bullhorn from a podium: "This is the beginning of a long march. This is the beginning of President Trump's war on women. If he wants this war, he will have this war and he will lose.""The legislators in Alabama will not have the last word," Booker told the protesters. "Those legislators in Georgia will not have the last word. And just as it was in the Civil Rights Movement, a governor from Alabama will not have the last word on our rights."Although he did not address the protesters from the podium during the rally, Sanders told reporters outside the Supreme Court: "The right for a woman to control her own body is a fundamental Constitutional right and we have got to do everything we can to defend it."Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton weighed in on Twitter: "In the face of extreme abortion bans sweeping the country, we all have to stand up for women's rights."The protests were organized under the #StopTheBans hashtag and included more than 50 groups, including Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union and NARAL Pro-Choice America.A spokeswoman for #Stopthebans, said in a statement: "This is Trump's anti-choice movement ... and it's terrifying."Hundreds attended a demonstration in Foley Square in New York City on Tuesday evening."Hands off the bodies of women. Hands off the rights of women," Mayor Bill de Blasio, who recently announced he was running for president, said at the rally.Protesters also gathered in downtown Philadelphia, chanting "Abortion is Healthcare", "Vote Them Out," and "My Body, My Choice."In Georgia, demonstrators stood on the steps of the Georgia State Capitol with signs that read: "Stop the bans" and "Don't take away our health care."In Phoenix, Arizona, demonstrators dressed like handmaids from the television show The Handmaid's Tale and wore signs around their necks reading #WarOnWomen.The backlash to the bans ratcheted up after Alabama Governor Kay Ivey signed the strictest abortion law in the nation last week. It makes performing an abortion a felony, punishable by up to 99 years even in cases of rape or incest. An abortion is only legal if a mother's health is in danger.On May 17, Missouri approved the ban of abortions after eight weeks, with no exceptions in cases of rape and incest. At least 16 states, mainly in the South, have passed or are considering so-called heartbeat laws.In Vermont, Governor Phil Scott, a Republican, is expected to sign a bill passed by the Democrat-controlled state legislature providing some of the strongest protections of abortion.

                Second debate of the 2020 Democratic presidential debate kicks off
            </a>
            <p>
                MIAMI, United States - The second night of the first Democratic primary debate here on Thursday featured more early front-runners for the party's presidential nomination to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020.Thursday night's 10-Democrat matchup included four of the five front-running candidates in early polls: former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Senator Kamala Harris of California, and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg of Indiana.They shared the stage with Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, Congressman Eric Swalwell of California, author and activist Marianne Williamson, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.Debate moderators are expected to raise such topics as economy, healthcare, education, immigration, climate change, and foreign policy, similar to those for the first group of participants on Wednesday night.According to debate rules, each candidate will have 60 seconds to answer questions and 30 seconds for rebuttals. There are no opening statements, but each candidate will have one minute for a closing statement.Wednesday's debate was attended by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another top-tier contender, along with former Congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, Washington Governor Jay Inslee, and five others.Together, 20 candidates qualified for the first primary debate for either scoring at least 1 percent support in three qualifying polls or receiving donations from at least 65,000 unique donors.The two-night debate, hosted by NBC News, MSNBC and Telemundo at Miami's Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, was the first of a dozen that the Democratic National Committee had planned for the party's primary.The second debate is scheduled for July 30-31 in Detroit, Michigan.

                Senate approves bill to extend 9/11 victims fund
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON — The Senate gave final legislative approval Tuesday to a bill ensuring that a victims' compensation fund related to the Sept 11 attacks never runs out of money.The 97-2 vote sends the bill to President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it.The vote came after Democratic senators agreed to allow votes on amendments sponsored by two Republican senators who had been blocking the widely popular bill. The Senate easily defeated the amendments proposed by GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Lee and Paul voted against the bill's final passage.Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said 9/11 first responders and their families have had "enough of political games" that delayed passage of the bill for months."Our 9/11 heroes deserve this program as written," Gillibrand said. "Let our heroes go home and live in peace and finally exhale."The bill would extend through 2092 a fund created after the 2001 terrorist attacks, essentially making it permanent. The $7.4 billion fund is rapidly being depleted, and administrators recently cut benefit payments by up to 70%.The Congressional Budget Office estimates the House-passed bill would result in about $10.2 billion in additional compensation payments over 10 years, including more than $4 billion for claims already filed.Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the bill guarantees "once and for all that the heroes who rushed to the towers 18 years ago will no longer have to worry about compensation for their families when they're gone."First responders "won't have to return to Congress anymore to fight for the compensation they always should have been given," Schumer said. "They will be able to go home, attend to their illnesses, their family members, their friends. That's what they always wanted to do, just take care of themselves and their families."Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was the subject of withering attacks from comedian Jon Stewart and other activists, also hailed passage of the bill.The legislation makes "solemn commitments" to firefighters, police officers and other first responders who "rushed selflessly toward the World Trade Center" just moments after the 2001 terrorist attacks began, McConnell said."Congress can never repay these men, women and families for their sacrifices. But we can do our small part to try and make our heroes whole," McConnell said on the Senate floor. "That's why the Senate has never failed to attend to the (victims') fund before. We weren't about to do so now."The collapse of the World Trade Center in September 2001 sent a cloud of thick dust billowing over Lower Manhattan. Fires burned for weeks. Thousands of construction workers, police officers, firefighters and others spent time working in the soot, often without proper respiratory protection.In the years since, many have seen their health decline, some with respiratory or digestive-system ailments that appeared almost immediately, others with illnesses that developed as they aged, including cancer.More than 40,000 people have applied to the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, which covers illnesses potentially related to being at the World Trade Center site, the Pentagon or Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after the attacks. More than $5 billion in benefits have been awarded out of the $7.4 billion fund, with about 21,000 claims pending.Stewart, a longtime advocate for 9/11 responders, had sharply criticized Congress for failing to act. He told lawmakers at an emotional hearing last month that they were showing "disrespect" to first responders now suffering from respiratory ailments and other illnesses as a result of their recovery work at the "pile" of rubble left by the 2001 attacks.Stewart called the sparse attendance at the June 11 hearing "an embarrassment to the country and a stain on this institution." He later targeted McConnell for slow-walking previous versions of the legislation and using it as a political pawn to get other things done.Gillibrand and other lawmakers credited Stewart for raising the profile of the issue, which has lingered on Capitol Hill for years.Lee said he did not object to the bill, but wanted to ensure the fund has proper oversight in place to prevent fraud and abuse. Paul said he was concerned about its effect on the deficit, and said any new spending should be offset by spending cuts elsewhere.AP

                Progressives, moderates clash
            </a>
            <p>
                The issues of healthcare and immigration highlighted a divide among the Democratic presidential field on Tuesday, with ideological differences apparent between progressive and moderate candidates.Going into the first evening of the second round of debates at the Fox Theatre in downtown Detroit, Michigan, the challenge for two of the top-tier Democratic presidential candidates — US Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and US Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont — was how they could differentiate themselves from each other, as they both favor universal healthcare and rail against excessive corporate profits.In a spirited debate on the issues, the senators defended their progressive stances against a couple of upstart, moderate candidates — Montana Governor Steve Bullock, making his first debate appearance, and former Maryland congressman John Delaney. Both men made a noticeable effort to stand out from the field.Sanders, meanwhile, was looking to bounce back from what many considered a middling performance in the first debate. The 77-year-old native New Yorker was booming and forceful in defense of his positions."Right now we have a dysfunctional healthcare system. Eighty-seven million uninsured or underinsured, 500,000 Americans every year going bankrupt because of medical bills, 30,000 people dying while the healthcare industry makes tens of billions of dollars in profit. Five minutes away from here, John, is a country called Canada. They guarantee healthcare to every man, woman and child as a human right," Sanders said.Delaney responded that "we don't have to go around and be the party of subtraction and telling half the country who has private health insurance that their health insurance is illegal. My dad the union electrician loved the healthcare he got from the IBEW (International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers)."Delaney earlier suggested that it was "bad policies like universal healthcare that got Trump elected"."We are the Democrats," Warren replied to Delaney. "We are not about trying to take away healthcare from anyone. That's what the Republicans are trying to do. And we should stop using Republican talking points in order to talk with each other about how to best provide that healthcare."Warren earlier said that the current healthcare system is "working great for insurance companies and drug companies", which she said "do not have the God-given right to make $23 billion in profits".Another flashpoint was immigration, particularly whether entering the country undocumented should be decriminalized, which Warren favors."You are playing into Donald Trump's hands," Bullock told her.Sanders said the president was "demonizing a group of people. A mother and child walk thousands of miles on a dangerous path, they are not criminals. Bring the entire hemisphere together to talk how we rebuild Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador."Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan, who opposes decriminalizing entry by migrants at the US' southern border, replied: "If you want to come into the country, you should at least ring the doorbell."Also on the stage Tuesday were author Marianne Williamson; US Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana; Beto O'Rourke, former congressman from Texas; and John Hickenlooper, former governor of Colorado.The lineup for Wednesday's debate, same time and location as Tuesday's, includes a rematch between former vice-president Joe Biden and US Senator Kamala Harris of California. Harris surged in the polls after the first debate when she went after Biden for his opposition to school busing in the 1970s to racially integrate schools.Also on the stage Wednesday will be US Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado; US Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; Julian Castro of Texas, former secretary of Housing and Urban Development; US Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey; entrepreneur Andrew Yang of New York City; Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard; Washington state Governor Jay Inslee; and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.

                US Democrats squabble over health care in 2nd night of debate
            </a>
            <p>
                DETROIT — Democrats battled over health care on Wednesday in the early moments of a presidential debate that was expected to test the strength of Joe Biden's candidacy.In particular, the former vice president and one of his chief rivals, California Sen. Kamala Harris, fought over competing plans to provide universal coverage.Biden charged that Harris' plan would cost $3 trillion after she left office and would force middle-class taxes to go up, not down. He said that would put Democrats at a disadvantage against President Donald Trump."You can't beat President Trump with double talk on this plan," he said.Harris slapped back that Biden was inaccurate."The cost of doing nothing is far too expensive," Harris said. She added: "Your plan does not cover everyone in America."The tense exchanges came early on the second night of Democratic debates that pitted the 76-year-old Biden against a younger slate of more diverse candidates. There were no candidates of color onstage in the first wave Tuesday night. On Wednesday night, there were four.Biden was flanked by Harris on one side and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker on the other. As he greeted Harris onstage moments before the opening statements, Biden quipped, "Go easy on me, kid."Biden expects to face pointed questions about race in particular, having stumbled in the opening debate in June when confronted by Harris over his record on school integration. Booker in recent days has seized on Biden's decades-old support for criminal justice laws that disproportionately hurt minorities.Biden's team said that he hopes to focus his attacks on Trump but that he's ready to fight back more aggressively against Harris and Booker if provoked.Wednesday's debate comes 24 hours after another set of 10 Democrats debated, fiercely at times, over the direction of their party.In that encounter, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren faced intense criticism from lesser-known moderates who warned primary voters that a sharp shift to the left on health care and other key policies would make it all but impossible to defeat Trump.That same dynamic will be on display Wednesday night — only in reverse.Biden, who leads virtually all early polls, is considered the premier moderate on stage. In addition to Harris and Booker, his more progressive opponents include New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Obama administration housing chief Julián Castro, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.While the first primary votes won't come for six more months, there is a sense of urgency for the lower-tier candidates to break out. More than half the field could be blocked from the next round of debates altogether — and possibly pushed out of the race — if they fail to reach new polling and fundraising thresholds implemented by the Democratic National Committee.The dire stakes have forced many Democrats to turn away from Trump and turn against one another in recent weeks.Diversity was an early focus.Biden said Trump was tearing at the "fabric of America" and highlighted the value of diversity in his opening statement."Mr. President, this is America," Biden said of the diverse slate of candidates on stage.Harris, one of Biden's chief rivals, also referenced the divisive presidency."This becomes a moment we must fight for the best of who we are," Harris said. "We are better than this."AP

                Kirsten Gillibrand drops out of US presidential race
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - US Democratic presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand announced Wednesday that she is dropping out of the race after failing to qualify for the September debate."Today, I am ending my campaign for president," the New York senator said in a video posted on her Twitter account. "It's important to know when it's not your time."Gillibrand's decision came as she was unable to meet the donor and polling requirements set by the Democratic National Committee, thus failing to qualify for the third Democratic primary debate slated for Sept 12 in Houston, Texas.Candidates must get at least 2 percent in four qualifying polls in addition to getting 130,000 donors to qualify. The qualification deadline for the Houston debate is set for Wednesday.Despite the 10 million dollars left in her 2018 Senate run account and an early outreach to big donors, the 52-year-old struggled to raise funds for her presidential bid. She posted 3 million dollars in the first quarter and raised 2.3 million dollars in the following quarter.The senator's support averaged below 2 percent throughout 2019, according to RealClearPolitics rolling average.Gillibrand, the first senator among the Democratic candidates to quit the race, has made women's equality central to her campaign, while advocating vehemently for abortion rights.The New York Times reported that Gillibrand said she would endorse another candidate in the primary but stopped short of specifying who that person would be.
