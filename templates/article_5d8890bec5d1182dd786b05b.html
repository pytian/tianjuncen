                Beijing Design Week gets underway
            </p>
            <p>
                The 2019 Beijing Design Week kicked off in the capital on Sept 5, and will run until Oct 7. Over 1,500 people, including government officials, famous designers at home and abroad, and officials from design institutes, attended the opening ceremony.Since this year's event coincides with the 70th anniversary of China's founding, the event includes a number of exhibitions and activities related to this theme. A highlight is an exhibition showing images of China in the early days after its founding in 1949.An award ceremony was also held before the opening ceremony, which recognized the design of Shenzhou V manned spacecraft, China's rural medical service system and Finland's Mightifier child emotional management training project.A special meeting to discuss the prize winners' designs was held on Sept 6.

                Red Boat brings prosperity to where it set sail
            </a>
            <p>
                HANGZHOU - On Nanhu Lake in East China's Zhejiang province rests one of the most famous boats in the country -- the Red Boat.Every day, a large number of visitors queue up to pay homage to the historical boat in the city of Jiaxing, which honors the conclusion of the first National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1921.After 98 years, the CPC has grown from a small party of some 50 members into the world's largest ruling party, with more than 90 million members. At the same time, China has developed from an impoverished country to the second-largest economy in the world."To help remind us of the spirit behind the Red Boat, we placed a model of the boat at our company," said You Yuan, chairman of Jiaxing Glead Electronics Co Ltd, which is located less than 5 km from Nanhu Lake.The Red Boat spirit, written above the one-meter-long boat model, highlights pioneering work, striving spirit and dedication.Glead Electronics is a high-tech company that specializes in the research, development and sale of microwave dielectric ceramics components and satellite navigation modules."The Red Boat spirit continually pushes us forward," said You.The company receives foreign clients from time to time. "If they are interested in the history of the boat, we tell them the story and even bring them to the lake to see the real boat," said the chairman."The employees are united together through the Party and union activities, which is conducive to the operation of the company," said Kawada Masahiro, division director of the general administration department of Nidec (Zhejiang) Corporation.The Japanese businessman has been working in Jiaxing for four years. He is impressed by the positive role the Party plays in mobilizing and uniting his Chinese colleagues.Apart from expats who live and work in the city like Kawada, a growing number of foreign visitors are also attracted to the Nanhu Lake Revolutionary Memorial Hall."In 2019 alone, we have received five batches of 75 delegates from the communist parties of Britain, Norway, and Finland," said Zhang Xianyi, curator of the memorial.Most foreigners are eager to find out the secrets behind China's economic success, and they are interested in the country's development course, as well as the original pursuit and mission of the CPC, according to Zhang.The prosperity of Jiaxing is a testimony of the pursuit of the CPC and the fast development of China.Mao Longhua, a 68-year-old farmer, just spent 900,000 yuan (about $126,177) on the renovation of his house in Tongjie Village of Jiaxing, which was something unthinkable in the past.There is no significant difference between rural and urban areas now in terms of income and living conditions, Mao said.According to the city's bureau of agriculture and rural affairs, the per capita disposable income of rural residents in Jiaxing reached 34,000 yuan in 2018, ranking first in Zhejiang Province for 15 consecutive years."The little boat on Nanhu Lake has evolved into a "giant ship," which carries the hope of the people and the Chinese nation," said Liu Yong, a scholar from the Party School of Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the CPC.

                Unique contest in Finland for utility drone fans
            </a>
            <p>
                HELSINKI - The growing benefits that drones give to society were highlighted in Helsinki recently, as utility drone enthusiasts from several countries gathered for a competition. Drones were seen flying in the vicinity of the Helsinki Central Library Oodi, where the tournament was held. Participants brought their own drones and competed in various contests. In one scenario, dangerous chemical canisters were afloat in a body of water, and the drone operators had to map out the number and location of the canisters and identify, from the air, the markings on them to assess the contents. In an agriculture assignment, the drone had to estimate the total area of a field, available for harvesting and to ascertain the potential crop variation. The tournament also included the task of building and operating a drone that would reach as high as possible to measure atmospheric climate variables while flying and then land safely. Contestants were also asked to count the number of purple spruce flowers and assess the condition of individual trees in a one-hectare test area. One task required competitors to design a solution for a wind turbine blade inspection process carried out by autonomous drones, and combined with AI and machine learning analysis. Teams could choose the sectors that matched their interests, and there were winners for each category as well as an overall winner. The event was arranged by a company offering future oriented tournaments in cooperation with Finnish digital producers and an organization of IT sector students at the University of Helsinki. The winning team comprised Otso Aalto and Elias Kunnas, Finnish activists of an association that produces software for the common good, and Tinja Pitkamaki, a Finnish biologist. Aalto said that the benefit of the tournament was that it brought the IT sector and coders together with drone users, such as rescue services and various scientific groups. "Our association produces software solutions that may help land and forest owners," he said. Aalto and Kunnas said they specifically did not want to launch a company but an association, and that the association currently provides a map service free of charge. It combines open data about land and forests - and combines it with information from other sources, for example from drones. Mikko Jarvilehto, the main organizer of the tournament, said at the closing event that "the community of drone innovators, operators and beneficiaries is growing". He said that the winners had "showed a great attitude" by creating their teams from scratch and managing to excel in multiple tasks. Xinhua (China Daily Global 09/18/2019 page14)
