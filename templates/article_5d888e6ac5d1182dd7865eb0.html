                15 killed, 190 wounded in Basra violent protests
            </p>
            <p>
                BAGHDAD -- The Iraqi Ministry of Health said Saturday that 15 people have been killed and 190 others wounded since violent protests against worsening living conditions broke out several days ago."The casualties come from both demonstrators and security forces," the Health Ministry Spokesman Sayf Bader said in a statement.Bader said that most of the wounded have received treatment and left the hospitals of Basra province.During the week, hundreds of angry demonstrators burned the provincial government buildings, the offices of leading political parties and the headquarters of some Shiite militias in protest of wide-spread corruption, poor public services, unemployment and water contamination in the province.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) called for restraint over the deterioration of the security situation in Basra."The deaths of civilians and the growing number of casualties at the ongoing demonstrations is particularly worrying, as is the use of firearms for restoring public order," ICRC statement said.Basra, the province's capital city which bears the same name, has long witnessed complaints among its over 2 million residents about the collapsing infrastructure, power cuts and corruption.Water supply in the province is also widely criticized for high salinity, with thousands of residents having been hospitalized.The protesters also accused the influential political parties of being behind the wide-spread corruption, which led to high unemployment and failure in rehabilitation of the country's electricity, water and other basic services.

                40 children among victims killed in airstrike on Yemen's school bus: Red Cross
            </a>
            <p>
                SANAA -- International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) said Tuesday that 40 children were among 51 people killed in a recent airstrike on a school bus in Yemen's northern province of Saada.There are also 56 children among the 79 people injured in the strike, Johannes Bruwer, head of the ICRC delegation in Yemen, said in an emailed statement."Final information issued by Saada authorities: out of a total number of 130 victims, 51 are dead, including 40 children, and out of the 79 injured, 56 are children. The numbers speak for themselves," the statement said.On Thursday, two airstrikes hit a school bus in the Dhahyan market in Saada, the key stronghold of the Iran-allied Shiite Houthi rebels.The Houthi rebels blamed the Saudi Arabia-led coalition for the attack, which has triggered popular anger across Yemen and condemnation from international humanitarian agencies.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the airstrike on the school bus, calling for an "independent and prompt investigation."The ICRC also condemned the airstrikes, saying "civilians must be protected during conflict under international humanitarian law."On Friday, the Saudi-led coalition said it would investigate the airstrike. But on Saturday, the Saudi mission to the UN submitted a letter to Guterres affirming that the airstrike was "legitimate and it targeted Houthi leaders responsible for recruiting and training young children."On Monday, thousands of Yemeni mourners from several northern provinces attended the funeral in Saada, where the killed children were buried.Local residents said the students were traveling on a field trip when their bus was hit in the Dhahyan market.The chief of Houthi revolutionary committee, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, attended the funeral and accused the United States of backing the coalition airstrikes.The U.S. State Department has reportedly urged the Saudi-led coalition to "conduct a thorough and transparent investigation".Yemen has been locked in a civil war since the Houthi rebels overran much of the country and seized all northern provinces in late 2014, including the capital Sanaa.Saudi Arabia is leading an Arab military coalition that intervened in the Yemeni war in 2015 to support the government of exiled President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.More than 10,000 Yemenis, mostly civilians, have been killed in the war, with about 3 million others displaced.

                Peking University wins IHL moot competition in Hong Kong
            </a>
            <p>
                Peking University recently won the 17th Red Cross International Humanitarian Law Moot for the Asia Pacific region, the first time a Chinese mainland team has done so in the 17 years' history of the moot in Hong Kong. The University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences was also among the top four finalists.The moot was co-organized by the international Committee of the Red Cross and the Hong Kong Red Cross.While the competition is aimed at enhancing knowledge and raising awareness of international humanitarian issues among law students, Anne Quintin, the head of the Advisory Services of the ICRC, believes it will also help bring an Asian perspective into IHL, which is a set of rules that seek to limit the effects of armed conflict."The moot court competition is one way to contribute to the creation of a conducive environment for the respect for IHL. This is the precise impact of the moot court," says Quintin.As for Larry Maybee, the deputy head of the ICRC Regional Delegation for East Asia, he says: "The objective (of the event) is to promote the study and knowledge of IHL in Asia. But specifically with a focus on students who are studying, because we want to influence the next generation of leaders to be aware of the issues and the law in this area."

                Red Cross calls for united action
            </a>
            <p>
                Affirmation of lawful international mission needed in face of conflictsUNITED NATIONS - Head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, or ICRC, on Monday asked the international community to protect principled humanitarian action even as the shape of conflict has undergone a rapid transformation in recent years."Throughout ICRC's operations, we see that neutral, independent and impartial humanitarian action has the best chance to reach those most in need. It is also a tried and tested formula to prevent humanitarian action being appropriated for larger and more controversial political agendas. Yet in many places across the world, the space for impartial humanitarian action is under threat," said ICRC President Peter Maurer."It is the task of the international community to fiercely defend and protect principled humanitarian action," he told the UN Security Council.Maurer asked to fight any attempt to instrumentalize, manipulate or politicize principled humanitarian action. Humanitarian access must not be unlawfully denied or withheld, especially when people's basic needs are going unmet, he said."Our license to operate should not be up for debate: It has already been guaranteed. The mission to protect and aid civilians during times of armed conflict was universally agreed 70 years ago in the Geneva Conventions. We call on states to step forward and reaffirm this mission, not only in words but through urgent and concrete actions," said Maurer.International humanitarian law does not rely on reciprocity. It applies even if an opponent fails to comply, he said. It relies on a consensual understanding among belligerents that there are limits to war and there must be a neutral and impartial humanitarian space in which those not participating in hostilities are protected. Those who deny the space, deny the very essence of the law."The Geneva Conventions are not up for negotiation. They reflect in normative language the tested practice of societies over time. They are customary law and must guide practical action," he said.Humanitarian organizations are increasingly placed under pressure as both state and nonstate armed groups hold civilian populations and humanitarian actors to ransom in order to achieve their goals, he said. "But humanitarian organizations do not exist to endorse, to legitimize or to help authorities further their political objectives. The ICRC works to help states live up to the obligations they have signed, not to help them circumnavigate them."He asked states to respect their obligations under international humanitarian law.States should ensure the proper application of the rules on the conduct of hostilities, the protection of civilians and medical facilities and the humane treatment of detainees, he said.Maurer asked states to train and instruct their troops and the troops of their partners so that they know international humanitarian law and how to respect it; vet and oversee with appropriate structures, processes and mechanisms in combat operations; and to put accountability mechanisms in place.He asked to tighten rules on the proliferation of arms, putting into place safeguards and precautions to make sure that no weapons are transferred if there is a clear risk they would be used to violate international humanitarian law.He voiced particular concern over the use of explosive weapons. "The ICRC sees the enormous civilian costs of bombing and shelling including death, physical injury, but also the long-term damage to critical civilian infrastructure. We ask all parties to an armed conflict to avoid the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effect in populated areas, due to the significant likelihood of indiscriminate effects."Human dignity is disregarded, the applicability of international humanitarian law is questioned, humanitarian aid is politicized and deliberately hijacked for political gain or the control of populations. Terrorist attacks, indiscriminate by nature, are destroying the very notion of proportionality, precaution and distinction, which are at the core of behavior in combat, he noted.Xinhua

                UN vows to protect civilians in wars
            </a>
            <p>
                A Chinese envoy called for efforts to prevent conflict by resolving issues peacefully for the protection of civilians."Conflict prevention and conflict resolution through peaceful means represent the most effective way of protecting civilians," said Ma Zhaoxu, China's permanent representative to the United Nations.This year marks the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, a cornerstone of international humanitarian law. It also marks the 20th anniversary of the Security Council making the protection of civilians an item on its agenda."The Security Council should earnestly fulfill its primary responsibility of maintaining international peace and security, and strive to resolve conflicts by promoting dialogue and consultation and political negotiations, so that civilians can be spared from the scourge of war," he told the council in an open debate on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, held at UN headquarters in New York on Thursday."We must oppose the use of force or the threat of the use of force, and oppose power politics and bullying," he said.He called for the international community to form a concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, build partnerships based on dialogue rather than confrontation, friendship rather than alignment, so as to create a world of lasting peace and universal security.He also asked the international community to nurture an awareness of a shared future for mankind and advocate for the concept of global governance based on the idea of shared growth through collaboration.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said a culture of protection in the Security Council and across the UN has been in place for the past 20 years, including the deployment of special advisers in peace operations to protect children and all civilians from acts of sexual violence in conflict.Security Council-mandated UN peace operations have protected and saved countless civilian lives in many conflict zones, including South Sudan, where nearly 200,000 internally displaced civilians are currently being sheltered at protective sites.In the Central African Republic, the UN mission has supported local peace and ceasefire agreements that are monitored by civilian and military components.In addition, war criminals — including from Cambodia and the former Yugoslavia — have been tried and convicted. Security Council resolutions on the protection of medical care in armed conflict have given important focus and urgency to these issues."But, despite these advances, grave human suffering is still being caused by armed conflicts and a lack of compliance with international humanitarian law," he warned, noting that civilians continue to make up the vast majority of casualties in conflict.In 2018 alone, the UN recorded the death and injury of more than 22,800 civilians in just six countries: Afghanistan, Iraq, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen. Overall, some 1.4 million people were newly displaced across international borders, while a further 5.2 million were internally displaced.The World Health Organization recorded 705 attacks against healthcare workers and facilities in just eight conflicts, resulting in 451 deaths and 860 injuries, he continued.Separately, 369 aid workers were kidnapped, wounded or killed. Starvation of civilians was used as a method of warfare, as well as rape and sexual violence.There is also an urgent need to reduce the humanitarian impact of urban warfare, particularly explosive weapons."As bleak as the current state of protection is, there is considerable scope for improvement if we each do our utmost to promote and implement the rules that bind us to preserve humanity in war," he stressed."This is the best way that we can honor the twentieth anniversary of the protection agenda. We have the rules and laws of war. We all now need to work to enhance compliance."Peter Maurer, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), asked for unity in the Council on the protection of civilians in armed conflict."Not only are the decisions of all UN member states and especially the Security Council important, the absence of decisions by the council also takes its toll on civilians," said Maurer."In battlefields where the ICRC is today, too many actors take the absence of political convergence amongst you as a free ride for military operations without any limitations and without accountability," he told the Security Council.Maurer asked individual countries to prioritize the protection of civilians, to uphold international humanitarian law, and to set clearer frameworks for their troops and clearer ground rules."As we mark the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions this year, we urge states to recall their spirit, which is to uphold human dignity in the midst of armed conflict," he said.

We all now need to work to enhance compliance."Peter Maurer, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), asked for unity in the Council on the protection of civilians in armed conflict."Not only are the decisions of all UN member states and especially the Security Council important, the absence of decisions by the council also takes its toll on civilians," said Maurer.Maurer asked individual countries to prioritize the protection of civilians, to uphold international humanitarian law, and to set clearer frameworks for their troops and clearer ground rules."As we mark the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions this year, we urge states to recall their spirit, which is to uphold human dignity in the midst of armed conflict," he said.

                ICRC says over 100 people died in airstrikes on Yemen prison
            </a>
            <p>
                SANAA - More than 100 people were killed in Saudi-led coalition airstrikes on a prison in Yemen's central province of Dhamar, the office of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Sanaa said on Sunday."The head of the ICRC delegation in Yemen Franz Rauchenstein believed that more than 100 people were killed in the airstrikes on the prison in Dhamar, but this is not the final number as rescue teams are still searching under rubble," the ICRC office told Xinhua by phone.The Saudi-led coalition said its airstrikes early on Sunday on Dhamar targeted "a Houthi location for hostile air defense missiles and drone storages," Saudi-owned AL Arabiya television reported on Twitter.But Houthi rebels said the airstrikes targeted the prison of detainees of over 170 government soldiers captured during battles in several front lines.Houthis said the location of this prison is known by the ICRC and the Saudi-led coalition.The ICRC head in Yemen twitted earlier on the day that his teams had visited the detainees in this prison before, as part of their regular humanitarian work.Dhamar is about 100 km south of the capital Sanaa. Both Dhamar and Sanaa, as well as several other northern provinces have been under Houthi's control since late 2014 after they forced Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his government into exile.Saudi Arabia has been leading an Arab military coalition against Iran-allied Houthis in Yemen for more than four years in support of the internationally-recognized government of Hadi.
