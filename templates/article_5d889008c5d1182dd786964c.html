                Twelve Japanese grey kangaroos touched down in Qingdao, East China's Shandong province at midnight on April 12, and were able to spend the night in comfort after their long flight. The large bi-pedal animals, each weighing about 45 kilograms, are reciprocal gifts from a zoo in Tokyo following the offering of a cougar and two panthers by the Qixia Zoo in Rongcheng, Shandong earlier this year.It took only 40 minutes for the kangaroos to clear customs at Qingdao Liuting International Airport.The Japanese arrivals will have a stopover in Qingdao before heading to Rongcheng, about 275 kilometers away, on April 13.

                    Father sues Disney over child ticket
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                He claims Shanghai resort wrong to link price to height, not ageA Chinese father is suing Shanghai International Theme Park Co, co-owner of Shanghai Disney Resort, claiming the park refused to issue a discounted ticket to his 10-year-old child.The father, Liu Demin, a judge at Guangdong High People's Court, took his child to Shanghai Disney in January. He said he purchased a parent-child package priced at 499 yuan ($76.80) online, but his son was refused entrance at the resort as his height exceeded the eligible maximum of 1.4 meters for a child pass. The father was told to purchase a full-price adult ticket for the child instead.Under the park's rules, children whose height is between 1 and 1.4 meters are allowed to purchase children's tickets, which are priced at 299 yuan each on off-peak days and 431 yuan during holidays and weekends. Adults pay 399 yuan and 575 yuan, respectively."Is the child pass sold to children or to anyone below 1.4 meters tall?" Liu was quoted as saying by China Youth Daily. "I am upset by the park's unreasonable rules, which should be fairer, like the standards used at other Disney parks."Disney parks in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Paris and the United States all use age rather than height as the standard for child tickets.At Tokyo Disneyland, for example, child tickets are available to kids 4 to 11 years old. Kids under 4 enjoy free admission, while those aged 12 to 17 can purchase student tickets. Adult tickets are for people 18 and above.At Hong Kong Disneyland, child tickets are for kids between 3 and 11. At Disneyland Resort in California, the age range is 3 to 9.After Liu litigated the issue in Shanghai, a staff member of Shanghai International Theme Park contacted him in April to apologize and offered to refund his overpayment, hoping that he would withdraw the lawsuit.Liu said he would not withdraw the suit unless Shanghai Disney revises the standards for child tickets and bases them on age rather than height.Shanghai Disney is not alone in setting the standard for children tickets based on height, nor is Liu alone in demanding a change in the standard.It has been a common practice for decades for tourist destinations, entertainment and education facilities across the country to charge children based on height, a practice that that has been challenged as it is considered unfair.In a survey by China Youth Daily in April, 56.7 percent of nearly 2,000 interviewed parents said they disliked the current height standard used at most Chinese public places.A majority of respondents thought age was an objective criterion and that height can be subjective.The Law on the Protection of the Minors in China says that public places, including museums and zoos, must offer free admission to those under 18, or provide discounted tickets."However, it does not stipulate that the standard is to be based on age or height for the purchase of child tickets," said Tian Xiangxia, deputy secretary-general of the Shanghai Law Society's Institute of Minors Law."In any case, the eligibility to use child tickets should be grounded in the primary principle of protecting the rights of children in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child."It is discrimination against children's interests that a kid less than 12 years old but taller than 1.4 meters should be forced to buy an adult ticket."

            <p class="style-content">
                TOKYO - The plight of a lonely dolphin and dozens of penguins that have been abandoned in a derelict aquarium in Japan since the start of the year sparked protests this week, with activists and ordinary Japanese alike calling for the animals to be saved. The female bottlenose dolphin, nicknamed Honey, was captured in 2005 near Taiji, a western port town that has become notorious for its annual dolphin hunt that was featured in the Oscar-winning 2009 documentary The Cove, media reports say. The practice of Japanese aquariums buying dolphins from Taiji came under heavy criticism following the release of the film. The hunt involves driving hundreds of dolphins into a cove, where some are taken alive for sale to marine parks, while others are killed for meat. The Japan Association of Zoos and Aquariums has since agreed to stop buying dolphins from Taiji.

                In stories this week, we have a Lego wheelchair for a turtle, a school made from trash in Cambodia, the most traveled man on Earth, a fully autonomous in-home cleaning robot and skydivers forming a huge floating target.All these interesting, odd anecdotes from around the world are here, in our news review.A Lego wheelchair for a turtleAn injured turtle that suffered a cracked shell in a hit-and-run is learning to get around again thanks to a custom wheelchair, made entirely from Lego.The 18-year-old reptile was found fighting for its life in the middle of the road by staff at the Maryland Zoo on their way to work.They took the animal to their onsite veterinary clinic, where staff discovered the crash impact had shattered its shell into seven pieces.The zoo’s veterinarians performed surgery to fix his shell, stabilizing it with metal plates, sewing clasps and surgical wire. They tried a few other versions of a cart to keep the turtle’s shell off the ground so it could heal while also maintaining his mobility, but it did not work well.So they started to brainstorm other materials that would allow them to incorporate wheels so he could move around easier, and the idea of Lego came about.

                Editor's note: When then Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei visited China in Sept 1972, China donated a pair of pandas to Japan. Since then, Japan has had perpetual "panda fever". Giant pandas have successfully captured Japanese people's hearts. China and Japan are expected to reach a broad agreement on panda leasing during Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's planned visit to Beijing this week, bilateral sources close to the matter said.

                Excursions to Europe and seven promotion stations in different countries and regions have city officials hoping for more tourism and business Dujiangyan's connections to the world are increasing as its governmental delegation works to capitalize on recent visits to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain for exchanges and investment promotion. The delegation, led by the Mayor He Weikai, signed memoranda of understanding with County Donegal in Northwest Ireland and Toledo in Central Spain to set up friendly and cooperative relations. The official declarations increased the number of Dujiangyan's international friendship cities to 22.  From left: Dujiangyan is a popular venue among cycling enthusiasts. Dujiangyan holds nearly 30 brand competitions every year, including the Chengdu Panda Marathon, which draw participation from domestic and foreign tourists. Photos Provided to China DailyHe's delegation also met with Lawrence Williams, vice-mayor of Bournemouth, England, during their visit to the United Kingdom. Bournemouth and Dujiangyan, a county-level city under the administration of Chengdu, in Southwest China's Sichuan province, are both UNESCO World Heritage cities. The Chinese mayor said the meeting was a good gesture to kick off communication between the two cities, and hoped that universities in Bournemouth could collaborate with Chengdu Neusoft University in information technologies and animation production. Bournemouth has world-class cultural, creative and IT industries. Williams said Dujiangyan is a beautiful city and has many resources that compare to Bournemouth's. He planned to repay a visit and sign a friendship agreement with the Chinese city for future cooperation in tourism, culture, education, innovation and entrepreneurship. Dujiangyan has always maintained an inclusive, open and cooperative attitude to form official friendship with other cities around the world, said the mayor He. It conducted a giant panda-themed ceremony with Pairi Daiza, a privately owned zoo and botanical garden located in Brugelette in the province of Hainaut, Belgium, and hosted outdoor recreation events in Monthey, a beautiful city in Switzerland. The city also takes full advantage of its diverse resources to enhance its international cultural influence. It's one of just a few cities in the world that have three different World Heritage sites. The Dujiangyan Irrigation System, together with nearby Mount Qingcheng, was listed as a World Cultural Heritage site in 2000. Qingcheng is one of the cradles of Taoism, known as a famed Taoist Mountain in China. In 2006, Dujiangyan was listed as a World Natural Heritage site as a corridor region of the giant panda habitat. In 2018, the irrigation system was recognized as World Heritage Irrigation Structure by the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage. The 2,000-year-old water engineering project impressed Clement Mouamba, prime minister of the Republic of Congo, during his visit to Dujiangyan in 2018. Mouamba said the irrigation system has embodied the talent and wisdom of the Chinese people. Blessed with a favorable environment and rich natural resources, the city is striving to build itself into a world-renowned ecological tourist destination. It set ambitious goals for the coming three years. By the end of this year, Dujiangyan hopes to receive 26 million visits and generate more than 29 billion yuan ($4.33 billion) of tourist income. These two figures are expected to reach 27 million and 35 billion yuan in 2020, and 30 million and 45 billion yuan in 2021. Local officials of culture, sports and tourism said Dujiangyan will study business and development concepts from world-class tourist destinations and consumption cities like Hong Kong, Tokyo and London, to help achieve its goals. In addition to attracting tourism, the city has also implemented a strategy for overseas expansion. It has set up seven promotion stations, in countries and regions such as Canada, Indonesia, Germany, Cambodia, Thailand and Finland, to develop more opportunities to do business with them, while also helping the world to better understand what Dujiangyan has to offer. The city has dispatched doctors to the University Hospital of Leipzig in Germany for training, and exchanged students with schools in Japan, Thailand and Germany. Dujiangyan has been a member of five international organizations, including the League of Historical Cities, World Historic and Cultural Canal Cities Cooperation Organization and the Organization of World Heritage Cities.
