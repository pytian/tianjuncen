                Experts want US, China to rebuild trust
            </p>

                Business leaders call on both countries to avoid harm to trade brought by tariffs The United States and China can resolve their disagreements by rebuilding trust and avoiding the harm to trade brought by tariffs, experts and business leaders said after the two countries concluded two days of talks in Washington on Friday. Talks between Vice-Minister of Finance Liao Min and the US officials ended on a good note, as discussion on both sides was "constructive", according to a statement by the Ministry of Commerce on Saturday. Officials from both sides also discussed arrangements for further talks in Washington in October, the 13th round of China-US high-level economic and trade consultations, the statement said. Rebuilding trust and eliminating negative factors are helpful in removing tariffs, stimulating the flow of foreign direct investment, saving consumers' money and enhancing the power of international institutions, including the World Trade Organization, said Chen Wenling, chief economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing. Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing-based think tank, said that both sides must be aware that reaching an agreement is only the beginning of the process. The two sides must continue to seek pragmatic solutions to end the prolonged dispute, Wang said. Patrick Zhao, senior vice-president for Asia Pacific of BASF Coatings Solutions, said that for a global company like BASF, which has integrated global value chains, minimizing the impact of trade barriers and tariffs is essential to operations. The company and its customers benefit from free trade, since any kind of tariff represents an indirect tax, he said. "We are therefore concerned about the recent US announcements, and the response of several US trading partners, including China, to impose import tariffs on a wide range of products that could affect the chemical industry and its numerous customer industries, including the automotive industry," Zhao said. He said the BASF believes deeply in the value of open markets and a rules-based global order. The company hopes governments will eventually resolve trade differences via sustained multilateral dialogue and within the boundaries of the WTO rules, he said. According to analysts, the US was sending positive signals about the next round of consultations. For example, the Office of the United States Trade Representative announced on Tuesday that it would temporarily exempt 437 categories of Chinese products from tariffs that the US government imposed in 2018. The announcement came after companies and other entities submitted more than 1,100 requests for relief. Yin Zheng, executive vice-president of Schneider Electric SA, said globalization is a positive economic trend that brings new opportunities everywhere in the world and improves cross-border partnerships. Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Renmin University of China in Beijing, said it's possible for China and the US to reach a temporary bilateral agreement during the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in November in Chile if they can make breakthroughs in the coming high-level talks. This would be consistent with both nations' interests, Wang said. zhongnan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 09/23/2019 page3)

                Investment abroad, export of capital will be the key to yuan outflows
            </a>
            <p>
                On Aug 5, Chinese currency renminbi (RMB) breached the 7-yuan-per-1 dollar mark in both onshore and offshore forex markets for the first time since the 2015 exchange rate reform.What exactly does this indicate?As early as the beginning of this year, at the CEIBS Financial Management Salon, I made it clear that like in the stock market, where volatility is the norm, the RMB volatility is the norm in the foreign exchange market. "There is no need to panic over the RMB breaching the 7-yuan-per-dollar threshold," I said at the event.According to the country's balance of payments, China has enjoyed many years' of trade surplus (that is, exports were larger than imports) and capital account surplus, which have helped it to build massive foreign exchange reserves.This leads to a fundamental question: Is it a case of "more is better "when it comes to foreign exchange reserves? The answer is no.Let's look at it from a monetary policy perspective.The most important component of any monetary policy is money supply. In the graph alongside, the red line represents China's economic growth, and the blue one shows China's money supply. We can see that the blue line is significantly above the red one. This phenomenon is called an excess supply of money.So, has the People's Bank of China put more money on the market than is needed? No. As a penny of collateral corresponds to the same amount of money, more collateral naturally means more money supplied. It just means that we have more collateral. Where does the collateral come from? Obviously, the bulk of it is in foreign exchange reserves.Under the previous monetary policy, China's money supply was largely based on the amount of foreign exchange reserves it had. As the amount of RMB put on the market was largely dependent on dollar inflows and outflows, the PBOC's power over money supply was effectively controlled by the US Fed.In this sense, the yuan was not an independent currency, but a "sub-currency" affiliated to the dollar. Obviously, this was not helpful for the internationalization of the renminbi. To reform the money supply system, China had to eliminate its reliance on the yuan funds outstanding for foreign exchange.In 2015, the PBOC introduced a new mechanism called "commercial bank credit asset collateral", under which the central bank allows commercial banks to use credit asset collateral to re-lend. Financial institutions have more wiggle room with lending, and their loan business is expected to grow bigger and more significant.What comes to mind when you hear the RMB exchange rate? The first thing you think of might be 6.9 or 6.8. That's the dollar exchange rate against the yuan, not the RMB exchange rate as we know it.This misconception is due to the fact that the renminbi was pegged to the dollar for a long period of time. You might wonder what the dollar exchange rate is. In fact, the dollar exchange rate is called the "dollar index", a measure of the value of the dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies. As this basket does not contain the renminbi, the yuan does not have equal status relative to the dollar.The RMB index stood at 100 at the end of 2014, and five years on, it is now around 95 or 96. We can see that although the yuan has slipped past 7 to the dollar, the RMB index has remained stable, with only a slight decline.As the RMB index is a measure of the yuan's exchange rate against a basket of its peers, and as the strength of the dollar means varying degrees of weakness of a basket of currencies, the RMB index is lower naturally.In the past, the yuan was pegged only to the dollar. That's why, people thought of the yuan/dollar exchange rate when they heard the renminbi exchange rate. In its exchange rate policy reform, the PBOC pegged the yuan to a basket of currencies.As a result, the yuan/dollar exchange rate is no longer fixed, but is a floating one. So, it is worth reiterating here: Like in the stock market, where volatility is the norm, the yuan volatility is the norm in the foreign exchange market. There is no need to make a fuss about the yuan breaching 7.0.We've heard a lot about the need to internationalize the RMB. What is an international currency like? The dollar is an international currency, and how does it circulate around the world?The US trade deficit with trading partners is a major cause of outflows of dollars, while in the US Treasury market, the world's largest financial market with massive inflows and outflows of dollars, there are substantial foreign holdings of US government debt denominated in US dollars.In addition, international trade in oil and commodities is also settled in dollars, serving as the final link in the global circulation cycle of the dollar.But there is yet to be such a cycle for the yuan.First of all, China is a trade surplus country. More goods are exported than imported, resulting in net inflows of the renminbi from overseas.Second of all, China inbound investment has always exceeded outbound investment, meaning that inflows of the yuan are greater than outflows. So, in order to turn the renminbi into a global currency, China has to create a global circulation cycle, and the key lies in opening up new capital accounts.Last year marks the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up. Having successfully upgraded itself from a labor-intensive economy to a capital-intensive economy, China should start to export capital overseas according to the principle of comparative advantage.China's capital intensity ratio was 1 percent in 2001, and as of 2016, it was 18 percent, marking an 18-fold growth. Now, with overcapacity, and excess inventory and capital, China should go global supported by capital accounts, facilitating outflows of the renminbi through overseas investment and export of capital. Meanwhile, China should bring back the renminbi by exporting industrial products. Then, a full circulation cycle of the yuan will be completed.On the international level, there are two pillars underpinning the renminbi's internationalization. The first is the creditworthiness of China as the world's second-largest economy; and the second is China's gold reserves. As well as foreign exchange reserves, central banks are also major holders of gold and other securities. The PBOC has built up vast gold reserves, which are of great significance to the internationalization of the renminbi.Businesses investing overseas may not be fully appreciative of the risks related to cross-border investment - including political, regulatory, market, foreign exchange, and legal compliance risks - but financial institutions as service providers for businesses must be fully prepared to mitigate such risks as they go global themselves.Zhang Yimin is a professor of finance at the China Europe International Business School (CEIBS).

                Online literature contest boosts cross-Straits cultural ties
            </a>
            <p>
                An awards ceremony was held Saturday in Hangzhou, capital city of East China’s Zhejiang province, to present prizes to winners of a competition featuring online literary works created by young authors from both sides of the Straits.In recent years, exchanges between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan have been frequent and fruitful, especially in the sector of online literature and the movie, TV, gaming productions adapted from those popular internet literary works.To further strengthen multi-dimensional cooperation and cultural exchanges between the youth of both sides of the Straits, the Zhejiang Publishing United Group and Want Want China Times Group of Taiwan worked together to host a competition to provide a platform for young writers to create better works through mutual learning and to deepen cross-Straits cultural ties.Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council attended the ceremony and delivered a speech."We would like to share the opportunity for development with Taiwan compatriots. What comes with this online literature competition is the huge market potential behind the booming development of internet literature in the Chinese mainland, which is a good opportunity for literature lovers in Taiwan. I hope this platform can be fully utilized to boost cross-Straits exchanges and mutual development", Ma said.This year marks the second time the contest has been held. In total, 682 works were received, among them 200 from Taiwan, which is double compared with the first competition in 2017.Topics in the submissions are wide-ranging, including history, romance, magic, urban life and sci-fi. Thirty-two contestants stood out, with Taiwan author Yan Pingle winning first prize this year.

                Hong Kong youths vow to help restore peace, order
            </a>
            <p>
                Hong Kong members of the nation's leading youth association on Sunday vowed to play their roles in helping the special administrative region recover from the ongoing social unrest that has plagued the city for more than three months.They made the pledge at a sharing session in Shenzhen attended by about 120 Hong Kong and Macao members of the All­China Youth Federation and from its provincial committees across the country.Eric Yeung, a Hong Kong member of the federation's standing committee, told the session the first priority now is to fully support the HKSAR government and the police in halting the violence.Yeung, who is also chairman of Hong Kong United Youth Association, pledged to ramp up efforts in mobilizing his peers to reject violence, which he said will only harm Hong Kong.Other members are worried about the aftermath. Kevin So, another Hong Kong participant, who's secretary ­general of Hua Jing Society, said the protracted turbulence has caused deep social rifts, which could leave permanent scars."If the 2014 'Occupy Central' movement has left a wound in society, the current unrest is a fresh cut on the wound," he said.He urged young people not to tag others with political labels to prevent the situation from deteriorating. "Whatever political views we may have, we live in the same society and share the same core values."Another Hong Kong attendee John Wong, said the SAR is facing its worst social crisis. "It's time for us young people to play our role in helping to restore peace and order in society."He said the unrest has shown that many Hong Kong youngsters still have a poor understanding of the Chinese mainland.Wong is also director­ general of local charity group, the New Home Association, which has organized various cross­boundary youth exchange events. He pledged to double efforts to make Hong Kong youngsters realize the great opportunities created by major national development strategies, such as the Guangdong­-Hong Kong-­Macao Greater Bay Area development.So also stressed the importance of increasing Hong Kong youths' understanding of the mainland, and urged the SAR government to attach greater importance in this area by introducing more measures to meet that objective.
