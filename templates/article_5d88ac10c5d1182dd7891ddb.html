                SWAKOPMUND, Namibia-"Who was the first astronaut in space? Who was the first astronaut landing on the moon? Who was the first Chinese astronaut?" a group of visibly excited students asked.These were just some of the questions raised by students at a recent aerospace science and technology interactive event with visiting Chinese astronauts at Namibia's Space Telemetry, Tracking and Command Station in the coastal town of Swakopmund.Metumu Nomvula Tjimune, a grade 12 student at Westside High School, said she was very pleased to see the astronauts from China."I like Liu Yang. As a woman, she can match any man. She shows what she can do, which means we can make it, too," Tjimune said.Liu Yang, China's first female astronaut in space, and her colleague Chen Dong arrived in Namibia's port town of Walvis Bay on Aug 19, starting their five-day visit to the southern African nation at the invitation of President Hage Geingob.Chinese Ambassador to Namibia Zhang Yiming said the visit was aimed at enhancing communication and cooperation on astronautics between China and Namibia.Zhang said that during the Namibian president's state visit to China last year, Geingob had visited the Beijing Aerospace Control Center, interacted with three Chinese astronauts and invited Chinese astronauts to visit Namibia."During the visit, the delegation will pay a courtesy call to President Geingob, meet local middle school learners at Space TT&C Station, and talk with students face-to-face at the Namibia University of Science and Technology," according to Zhang.Although this is her first trip to Namibia, Liu said she is no stranger to the country."When I was serving on Tiangong-1, I flew over Namibia many times. I knew there is a Space TT&C Station based here, and I'm grateful to be here," said Liu.

                    Mandarin a favorite of Namibian students
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                With growing trade relations between Namibia and China, more Namibian students are falling in love with Mandarin."I am only in the first year at university and I chose Chinese as a foreign language as this could broaden my horizons," says Ndapewa Shikongo, a student at the University of Namibia.More countries around the world are doing business with China and soon Mandarin will be a most sought-after language, "so why not prepare for it", says Shikongo.Andrew Niikondo, deputy vice-chancellor of the Namibian University of Science and Technology, says many African countries stand to benefit immensely from having more students learning Chinese."Namibia's trade relations with China are growing by the day and more deals are being signed between the two countries," says Niikondo."This is creating an opportunity for Namibian graduates to interact more in the business world with their Chinese counterparts," he says.As a result, it is imperative that more tertiary education students and even officials learn the language as a way of bridging barriers when doing business, he says.Niikondo adds that China is now the next frontier for both African exports as well as reliable business partners for most African governments. And he says that Namibia is not the only country that sees the relevance of incorporating Chinese at universities, but that a host of other countries are also making the same move.The trend is now just as popular in countries in the southern African region as it is on the continent as a whole, he says. "It is only wise that as a country Namibia also follows the same path as everyone else."In fact, many major universities on the continent are incorporating Mandarin in their management courses as a way of improving the quality of graduates who will in future have to negotiate with Chinese companies coming to Africa, he says.Over the past six years, more than 3,000 Namibians have enrolled to learn to speak Mandarin at the Confucius Institute at the University of Namibia in partnership with the China University of Geosciences.The director of the Confucius Institute, Zhang Fan, says the language is serving as a smooth conveyor belt in strengthening Sino-Namibian relations."Students see that learning Mandarin offers advantages both in the local tourism industry, and in a variety of interactions on the world stage," he says.

                    Chinese computers help Namibia school enhance education provision

            <p class="style-content">
                On a sunny Tuesday, a beam of hope illuminates the Mariental High School in Hardap Region in the southern part of Namibia.At a computer room of the school, student Donna Gamatham was completing a task using a desktop computer, which was part of the 10 computer sets donated by the Chinese embassy in Namibia.For her and other learners, the donation has introduced them to a new era of studies that involved the digital mode of learning.The donation is also set to expose learners to global development and multiculturalism.School principal Albertus Stein said that the new computers would address the scarcity of resources the school suffered."Due to limited computers, learners had to share, which decelerated progress and access to information communication technologies to all at school," he said.Namibia's Minister of Education, Arts and Culture Katrina Hanse-Himarwa said that the ministry faces the challenge of aging information communication technologies equipment.Since 2015, records show that no state schools received new information communication technologies equipment, and the ministry stagnated as only 24 percent of schools have information communication technologies equipment installed, according to Hanse-Himarwa.As the Namibian government strives to integrate information communication technologies into mainstream education programs, the Chinese embassy is harnessing information communication technologies capacity to boost education provision and improve access to inclusive education in the country.Yang Jun, charge d'affaires of the Chinese embassy in Namibia said the donation is aimed at supporting Namibia to enhance the provision of education and advance learners' career prospects.The new donation, brings to 20, the number of desktop computers at the school.Mariental High School has 900 learners and 30 teachers. The Chinese embassy established ties with the school in November 2018 when Chinese ambassador to Namibia Zhang Yiming awarded scholarships worth 20,000 Namibian dollars ($1,390) to top performers at the school.

                    Drought-hit Namibia to auction wild animals
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Drought-stricken Namibia will sell about 1,000 wild animals from its national parks to avoid losing them through starvation, as well as to generate conservation funds. Stanley Simataa, Namibia's minister of Information, announced the plan on Saturday. The animals to be auctioned off include 600 disease-free buffaloes, 28 elephants, 20 impalas, 65 oryxes, 150 springboks, 60 giraffes, 35 elands and 16 kudus, according to Agence France-Presse. Namibia has about 960 buffaloes in its national parks, as well as 2,000 springboks, 780 oryxes and 6,400 elephants, AFP reported. The government hopes to raise $1.1 million from the sale. The proceeds are to be put in the Game Products Trust Fund's account to help in wildlife conservation and management of parks. Romeo Muyunda, the spokesman for Namibia's Ministry of Environment and Tourism, told the newspaper The Namibian that the sale was a response to the drought, which has affected the grazing and water points in some game reserves and national parks. Muyunda said the move was meant to reduce the number of wildlife in national parks to manageable levels. Namibian President Hage Geingob declared a state of emergency over the drought in May. He promised that offices, ministries, agencies and all stakeholders will be mobilized to ensure that necessary assistance is provided to affected communities. According to the United Nations Children's Fund, also known as UNICEF, the drought is affecting about 556,000 people. The hardest-hit regions, according to UNICEF, are Kunene North, which has lost 12,200 head of cattle, goats and sheep, and Erongo, which has lost 11,800. Those regions are followed by the Ohangwena and Otjozondjupa regions, both of which have lost more than 4,700 head of cattle, sheep and goats in the past six months. The Omaheke, Omusati and Oshana regions each lost around 2,500 head of livestock, while the Kunene South, Khomas and Oshikoto regions combined lost about 1,270, UNICEF reported. According to a report released in March by Namibia's Ministry of Agriculture on crop prospects, food security and the drought, the country is expecting a reduction in harvest of at least 53 percent compared with last season. The report says grazing conditions continue to deteriorate in most parts of the country, with below average rainfall nationwide. This is the fifth time in six years that the country has faced a drought. The phenomenon is reported to be caused by the La Nina effect, which causes periodic warmer winters and drought spells in Namibia. The southwest African nation has 20 state-run protected areas covering about 17 percent of the country's land surface. Namibia incorporated protection of the environment into its Constitution - the first African country to do so. The government then gave people living in communal areas the opportunity to manage their natural resources through the creation of communal conservancies. Conservancies exist in order to protect wildlife and habitat. Game guards from the community are employed by the conservancy to patrol the area, deter poachers and assist the ministry to monitor wildlife numbers during annual game counts. The ministry also sets a quota for hunting so that wildlife populations are stable or can grow. edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 06/19/2019 page1)

                    Road warrior Dong facing world-class test in Africa
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Qingdao welterweight, ranked No 15 by WBO, could vault into title contentionIt's roughly 7,500 miles from China to Namibia in southwest Africa, but for Qingdao welterweight Dong Youli, the intercontinental journey could end up being a shortcut to global boxing glory.On Saturday, in his first fight outside China, the 24-year-old Dong (13-1-1, 9 KOs), ranked No 15 by the World Boxing Organization, is challenging No 5-ranked WBO Africa champion Mikka Shonena (14-0, 3 KOs) in the northern Namibian city of Ongwediva, with the winner in line for a shot at the world championship next year.With just three stoppages on his record, Shonena - aka 'The Silent Assassin' - isn't known as a big puncher, but the 31-year-old has been very vocal in telling anyone who will listen that Dong will be "ironed out" if the Chinese challenger chooses to turn their bout into a slugfest."I know that Dong is strong and world rated, but I have a perfect record and will have the home crowd advantage. I promise to give the fans the best performance of my career so far in order to remain undefeated," Shonena told The Namibia Sun last week."When I promise to give the fans my best, it means I'm promising to iron out that Chinese boy. I think it will be easy work, and I will make them proud."Saturday's bout will be Dong's first since he captured the vacant WBO Asia Pacific title with an eighth-round TKO of India's Pardeep Kharera in Chongqing last December, but the long layoff doesn't faze him."I am going to Namibia to win. I know I will be fighting far away from home, but I also know that my Chinese brothers and sisters will come out in their numbers to support me," Dong said earlier this month."I am super prepared for this fight and I'm looking forward to taking a big step upwards in the world rankings."While Dong hovers on the periphery of world title contention, another Chinese boxer is bracing to battle for a unified version of the world light heavyweight championship in the coming months.No 1-ranked contender Meng Fanlong, a 31-year-old from Inner Mongolia who represented China at the 2012 London Olympics, has been named mandatory challenger for the winner of an Oct 18 title unification bout in Philadelphia between WBC champ Oleksandr Gvozdyk (17-0, 14 KOs) of Ukraine and IBF titleholder Artur Beterbiev (14-0, 14 KOs) of Russia.After Meng (15-0, 9 KOs) became the IBF's top contender by beating Germany's Adam Deines in an eliminator on June 1 in Macao, Beterbiev opted for the unification bout rather than face the 6-foot-3 Chinese southpaw, who packs a KO wallop with both fists."I respect Beterbiev's choice," Meng told boxingscene.com. "I would have done the same if I was him. The best deserves to fight the best in this sport. My dream has always been to challenge for the world title, but the rule allows the unification fight to take place first."I will get to fight the winner to fulfill my mandatory obligation, and I'm excited about that opportunity."Meng's promoter, Roc Nation's Dino Duva, wasn't quite so accommodating."It was disappointing to get word of the Beterbiev-Gvozdyk match because Fanlong has worked so hard to earn his shot," said Duva."We were in negotiations with Top Rank for Beterbiev and they said he had no problem fighting Fanlong, but then they decided to make a unification match. We will respect the unification concept, but only for this match."One thing I can assure you - we will fight to enforce Meng Fanlong's rights against the winner. Hopefully, whoever wins the fight on Oct 18 will have the courage to put both titles on the line against Fanlong, which will make the wait even sweeter."
