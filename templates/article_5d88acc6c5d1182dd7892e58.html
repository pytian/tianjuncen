                Many young people in Hong Kong seem to have misunderstandings about the Chinese mainland and the United States.No matter how noble an individual goal is, the collective outcome could be exactly the opposite of what each individual wanted. When I taught social decision theories, my students often could not believe their eyes when I read them the mathematical proof that collective decisions are necessarily dictatorial even under very minimal assumptions. That is an implication of the Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem developed by Nobel Laureate Kenneth Arrow.It can also be proved that by simply setting a different voting agenda, such as who to get to vote first, we will have a different social outcome even when the individual preferences of all voters have not changed at all. That is an implication of the Condorcet Paradox.The situation is further aggravated when there is herd behavior. Even when an individual’s underlying preference does not change, his or her previously unwanted actions might simply be induced by a change in his beliefs about the actions of others and about the consequences of his actions.For instance, panicked individuals confined to a room with two equal and equidistant exits oftentimes overwhelmingly choose one exit over the other. It is especially problematic when the leading herd is a professional actor or traitor financially supported by foreign powers which are at war with the only nation in history that has emerged to superpower again without waging unjust wars on other nations. The world has already seen that the “color revolutions” only brought chaos in other nations.Do not fall in the common narratives about how bad the future of the Hong Kong younger generation is, especially due to the ultra-high property prices in Hong Kong. In fact, Hong Kong people are exactly in the heart of the most prosperous place there is on Earth for the next 20 years — the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. But youngsters should not use the exact same success measures of their parents, which often imply a pricey apartment in Hong Kong. New Yorkers will not resort to blaming high Manhattan prices all day but not moving their feet to consider cheaper and more beautiful houses in Queens and Brooklyn. There is reason to be ridiculed for not taking the new 14-minute high-speed train ride to Shenzhen from Hong Kong, which is shorter than taking the subway ride to other boroughs from Manhattan. Shenzhen and close-by Guangdong cities are beautiful with plenty of opportunities and way lower property prices. But, to tell the truth, even garbage men in the US often own large and cozy houses.Our goals should be much nobler than that. There are very poor people suffering in the rural villages in China and also in Africa. We all should think about how to use our intelligence to improve the lives of the disadvantageous.The fight of the youngsters in Hong Kong so far has completely defied their moral ground, at least on freedom. Arguably the most intelligent man at that time J.S. Mill wrote in the classics On Liberty: “The only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it.”Instead of escalating violence and blocking traffic, the Hotelling’s Model tells us that being midway attracts you the biggest group of supporters instead of calling oneself yellow or blue as in the Hong Kong riot case. It is wise now not to polarize opinions but to admit nuances in perceptions. It is wise not to compress the high dimensional nature of an incident to a single-dimensional nature of black and white.Many Hong Kong youngsters have misunderstood US citizens. Even many Americans disagree strongly with the American politicians. The violence part of Hong Kong protesters is what an average American would hate, and a typical American cop would shoot.There was a “China is not an Enemy” open letter to the US president last month in The Washington Post by a group from the scholarly, foreign policy, military and business communities, overwhelmingly from the US, including a former US ambassador to China and professors from Yale, MIT and Harvard.The letter reads: “US opposition will not prevent the continued expansion of the Chinese economy, a greater global market share for Chinese companies and an increase in China’s role in world affairs ... We do not believe Beijing is an economic enemy or an existential national security threat that must be confronted in every sphere...”It is wise not for the elder generation to call the protesters cockroaches. Open your arms to hug them if a stranger in black scolds you with foul languages. Return with “Ameituofo” if you are a Buddhist, “Hallelujah” if you are a Christian, or simply “gong xi fa cai” if you are a Hong Kong resident. Our kids: Heal the wound now, or else the police will prosecute you because you are becoming the ones you hated most. If the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong become hell, you are contributing to it, for the above letter continues to read: “Efforts to isolate China will simply weaken those Chinese intent on developing a more humane and tolerant society.”The crowd cannot represent you and you are the most unique and beautiful creature there is if you stay away from the crowd and turn back now.The author is academic dean and professor of the Paris School of Business.

                    New York adds to its history of blackouts
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                When the lights go out on Broadway, to quote singer Billy Joel, the whole world knows about it.Actually, the lights went out Saturday in the middle of a Jennifer Lopez (J-Lo) concert at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan.Half of Times Square and a good chunk of the West Side of the borough lost power for a few hours, starting around 6:45 pm Saturday.Activity in Times Square returned to normal on Sunday, and the 26 Broadway theaters that had to close were open again.Although the blackout wasn't up there with the scarier ones of 1965, 1977 (42 years to the day of Saturday's outage) and 2003, it wasn't long before word spread. This was, after all, the first city blackout in the modern social media era.The city's mayor, Bill de Blasio, was out of town campaigning in Iowa for the Democratic presidential nomination. He hurriedly returned on Sunday morning."New Yorkers are absolutely the strongest, the toughest, the most resilient of any people anywhere," de Blasio said Sunday."Our first responders did an absolutely exemplary job. Pressed into service in large numbers, very quickly, making sure that folks stuck in elevators were rescued, making sure that folks on those two subway trains were brought to safety, making sure that traffic was controlled," he said. "An amazing job by FDNY, NYPD, Emergency Management, DOT – so many agencies immediately deployed because they have been preparing for situations like this and they knew what to do and they brought a huge amount of personnel in to do it."New York Governor Andrew Cuomo stepped in as the chief blackout spokesman on TV while de Blasio was away. Cuomo said Saturday that he could "count on my fingers" the number of trips he's taken outside New York in his eight years as governor.He said in a radio interview on Sunday that he would have state investigators conduct an independent review of the outage, The New York Times reported."You lose power, chaos is right around the corner," he said.US Senator Chuck Schumer called for the Department of Energy to investigate Con Ed and how it has invested in the power grid. "This type of massive blackout is entirely preventable with the right investments in our grid," the Senate's top Democrat said on Sunday.Consolidated Edison Co of New York is the city's main electric utility.Government and utility officials were still searching for clues on Sunday for the five-hour outage that left 73,000 customers without power. No deaths or injuries resulted from the blackout, which encompassed West 30th Street to West 72nd Street, an area filled with tourist attractions and Broadway theaters.A transformer explosion at West 49th Street was isolated as the catalyst for the loss of power to subways, homes and businesses.De Blasio said the city and Con Ed ruled out a surge in usage as a factor. Neither a cyberattack nor a terrorist act was to blame, de Blasio added.The outages struck just as shows were starting at theaters in Midtown and at the Lincoln Center Plaza on the Upper West Side. With subway stations suddenly dark, thousands spilled into the streets on a hot night."I guess this is what they call a New York moment," Briallen Hopper, who had been stuck on a subway train for an hour, wrote on Twitter, with a video of a choir singing at sunset. She wrote of "an evacuated Carnegie Hall concert happening in the street".In a photo on Twitter taken after sundown, a civilian was seen directing traffic in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood with a toy light saber.All Broadway theaters had to close except the Winter Garden Theater, Nederlander Theater and Lyceum Theatre, authorities said.But among those who entertained theatergoers with improvised performances were the casts of the musicals Waitress, Hadestown, Come From Away and Rock Of Ages.One Twitter user named Antony posted video of the cast of Hamilton: An American Musical singing from theater windows to crowds below.And Bronx native Jennifer Lopez sent her regrets in a video clip in a Twitter post to fans attending her Madison Square Garden concert."I am obviously heartbroken and devastated. I love you. I am so sorry this happened in the middle of our moment, at our show," she wrote. Lopez rescheduled the show for Monday.Over the next five days, the city faces daily peak temperatures in the high-80s to low-90s Fahrenheit, the National Weather Service said.Con Ed President Timothy Cawley assured that the utility's electrical system will be able to handle increased demand for air conditioning."We are prepared to the end of the week," he said. "We could still serve the system on the hottest day of the year."Reuters contributed to this story.

            <p class="style-content">
                Host crowned world champ after 'most ridiculous game ever'LONDON - Jos Buttler threw his gloves into the sky and wheeled away in celebration. Jofra Archer slid on his chest across the Lord's turf and beat the ground. Joe Root punched the air as he was lifted up by a teammate.After more than nine stomach-churning hours, the first super over in Cricket World Cup history, and one of the most extraordinary overs ever played, England ended its agonizing 44-year wait to be world champion of the sport it invented."The most ridiculous game of cricket to have ever been played," was how wicketkeeper Buttler summed up a crazy World Cup final against New Zealand on Sunday that had pretty much everything.A sporting contest for the ages finished with England winning courtesy of a tiebreaker that few inside the home of cricket had likely ever heard of, or even understood: Boundaries countback.That was because England and New Zealand - both bidding for a first Cricket World Cup title - couldn't be separated after the regulation 50 overs a side (each team scored 241) and then a nerve-shredding super over (both teams scored 15) played in early evening sunshine in northwest London.In the end, England prevailed because it hit a total of 26 boundaries - fours and sixes scored across both the 50 overs and the super over - compared with New Zealand's 17."The guys are shattered," New Zealand captain Kane Williamson said. "It's devastating. Tough to swallow."

                    NYC’s encore to a blackout: a heat wave
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                New York City isn't the most pleasant place to be when the mercury soars toward three digits. Stifling subway platforms turn into virtual saunas, nauseating stenches can waft into the air on any block, and already-short tempers can get shorter.Usually in July and August, when heat waves are most likely, you'll hear a 1966 song by The Lovin' Spoonful frequently played over various media. (I would have said on the radio, but no one really listens to music on the radio anymore.)Hot town, summer in the cityBack of my neck getting dirty and grittyBeen down, isn't it a pityDoesn't seem to be a shadow in the cityAll around, people looking half-deadWalking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match headWith the National Weather Service forecasting that temperatures could pass 100°F (37.7°C) in New York this weekend, city dwellers are wary of experiencing another electrical power outage, or blackout, as they just did on July 13, which could compound the heat's misery.A downpour on Wednesday evening provided a respite to the week's stifling temperatures. In fact, one of those subway saunas added a pool as rainwater gushed through a temporary wall at a Queens station.Last Saturday, some 72,000 customers of the Consolidated Edison Co of New York, the local utility giant, lost power for about six hours.Subways and elevators stopped in their tracks, and the show couldn't go on at most Broadway theaters. A Jennifer Lopez concert at Madison Square Garden came to a halt mid-dance number.With New Yorkers' vaunted image of stepping up in a crisis, the blackout produced its share of impromptu heroes, such as the pedestrians who took it upon themselves to direct traffic with their smartphone flashlights, or in one case, a toy light saber.But when a crisis strikes, there's always plenty of blame and sarcasm to go around.Mayor Bill de Blasio was out of town when the lights went out, campaigning in Iowa for the Democratic presidential nomination.Governor Andrew Cuomo gladly stepped in to fill the media crisis-center void. Cuomo sent a not-so-veiled message to his fellow Democrat, saying he could "count on my fingers" how many times he has been out of the state in his eight years as governor.This weekend, de Blasio will stay in the city."Friday is going to be bad. Saturday is going to be really, really bad," de Blasio said of the heat in a video posted on social media on Thursday. "Take it seriously.""We expect that there could be service outages," Consolidated Edison spokesman Mike Clendenin told WPIX-TV on Wednesday. "Those things happen during heat waves. Our crews are ready to respond. We are going to be prepared for this. It's going to be intense."This week's heat wave follows a report on Monday from US space agency NASA that last month was the world's hottest June since record-keeping started in 1880.Beijing experienced sizzling heat earlier this month, with a temperature of 42.9 degrees Celsius recorded on July 4 in the city's Changping District.This weekend in the New York area, the heat index (how hot it actually feels) is expected to range from 105 to 110 degrees.The city's Office of Emergency Management has already declared an emergency and opened 500 "cooling centers" on Wednesday.It's not only New York City feeling the heat.A high-pressure system is stretching across the US from coast to coast, keeping temperatures elevated. What makes things more uncomfortable is the humidity, with moisture in the air coming from the Gulf of Mexico, much of it left over from Hurricane Barry.The heat index could hit 110 (43.3) in Washington DC on Saturday and 109 (42.8) in Chicago and Detroit on Friday, said Jeff Masters, meteorology director of Weather Underground.As if the politics on Capitol Hill weren't generating enough heat, Thursday marked DC's eighth straight day with temperatures of at least 90 degrees, and that streak was expected to last for another four days.The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this story.Contact the writer at williamhennelly@chinadailyusa.com

                Housing officials under fire for not stemming tide of rodent infestationThe New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) is the largest public housing system in the United States, and for years has been riddled with mismanagement, leaky roofs, mold, broken elevators and faulty heating systems. Perhaps nothing is scarier to its 400,000 residents than rats.Now, in his first quarterly report released last week, the federal monitor overseeing the fixing of problems at NYCHA, which houses 1 in 14 New Yorkers, found that it was unlikely to meet deadlines to reduce its rat population and backlog of pest complaints.NYCHA employs only 108 pest exterminators, which means each exterminator is responsible for about 1,400 apartments.Twelve more exterminators were expected to be hired, but the report said NYCHA needed almost 1,000 exterminators to meet the Aug 1 deadline stipulated in the agreement struck between Mayor Bill de Blasio and the federal government to address pest complaints.The monitor said that the rat infestation is so bad at the Washington housing complex in East Harlem, residents feel they are "hostages in our own home at night".In a letter to NYCHA, the tenant association described rats spilling out of elevators and stairways, and workers refusing to enter compactor rooms "for fear of being attacked by rats". Rats were beginning to climb up clogged garbage chutes and enter apartments, the letter said."I have more rats than I do residents," said Tenant Association President Claudia Perez in the letter. "For every four dead rats, you see 10 more alive."The mayor was asked about the federal monitor report's findings on the rats at the Washington houses. "We don't accept trash piling up. We will fix it and if we find personnel isn't doing their job, they won't be there," he said."We don't have a rat problem," Frances Brown, president of Red Hook East Tenants Association in Brooklyn, told China Daily. "We keep the ground clean. We have an exterminator who puts traps out and monitors them. I don't see them running around."In Harlem, dead rats reportedly fell from the ceiling — along with maggots and cockroaches — in a community room at the Jackie Robinson Houses, forcing NYCHA officials to cancel summer camp there on July 16. According to NYCHA, the agency did respond, sending exterminators just under a week after staff canceled camp.NYCHA houses 400,000 people in 2,602 buildings situated on an area three times the size of Central Park. Housing officials have put the price tag to remedy the conditions and restore NYCHA's infrastructure to good working order at close to $32 billion over the next five years, almost double the last estimate seven years ago.The city is required to commit to NYCHA $1 billion in the first four years and $200 million annually indefinitely until the problems are fixed.Rats are not exclusive to the NYCHA buildings. The city is a thriving environment for them. With sewer pipes, food on subway tracks and on almost every corner, they survive and flourish.Two years ago, de Blasio launched the Neighborhood Rat Reduction Initiative, a $32 million program involving multiple city agencies intended to cut the city's rat population by 70 percent.The effort included minimizing food sources and reducing habitats coupled with an aggressive extermination program. The city's Sanitation Department has increased pickups in selected neighborhoods and many apartment buildings now use food scrap bins with snap-shut lids to keep the rats at bay.The program has piled up dead rats, but the infestation has spread to posh areas in Manhattan, including the Upper West Side."Rats benefit from our bad habits," Jesse Scaravella, owner of Evergreen Eco Pest Control in Brooklyn, told China Daily. "It takes only one person not practicing proper sanitation — one zombie house, one person not handling trash property or one empty lot — for the rat population to grow. Rats are a symptom of the obvious holes we have in how we handle refuse and we'll never be able to eradicate them."

                    Progressives, moderates clash
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The issues of healthcare and immigration highlighted a divide among the Democratic presidential field on Tuesday, with ideological differences apparent between progressive and moderate candidates.Going into the first evening of the second round of debates at the Fox Theatre in downtown Detroit, Michigan, the challenge for two of the top-tier Democratic presidential candidates — US Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and US Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont — was how they could differentiate themselves from each other, as they both favor universal healthcare and rail against excessive corporate profits.In a spirited debate on the issues, the senators defended their progressive stances against a couple of upstart, moderate candidates — Montana Governor Steve Bullock, making his first debate appearance, and former Maryland congressman John Delaney. Both men made a noticeable effort to stand out from the field.Sanders, meanwhile, was looking to bounce back from what many considered a middling performance in the first debate. The 77-year-old native New Yorker was booming and forceful in defense of his positions."Right now we have a dysfunctional healthcare system. Eighty-seven million uninsured or underinsured, 500,000 Americans every year going bankrupt because of medical bills, 30,000 people dying while the healthcare industry makes tens of billions of dollars in profit. Five minutes away from here, John, is a country called Canada. They guarantee healthcare to every man, woman and child as a human right," Sanders said.Delaney responded that "we don't have to go around and be the party of subtraction and telling half the country who has private health insurance that their health insurance is illegal. My dad the union electrician loved the healthcare he got from the IBEW (International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers)."Delaney earlier suggested that it was "bad policies like universal healthcare that got Trump elected"."We are the Democrats," Warren replied to Delaney. "We are not about trying to take away healthcare from anyone. That's what the Republicans are trying to do. And we should stop using Republican talking points in order to talk with each other about how to best provide that healthcare."Warren earlier said that the current healthcare system is "working great for insurance companies and drug companies", which she said "do not have the God-given right to make $23 billion in profits".Another flashpoint was immigration, particularly whether entering the country undocumented should be decriminalized, which Warren favors."You are playing into Donald Trump's hands," Bullock told her.Sanders said the president was "demonizing a group of people. A mother and child walk thousands of miles on a dangerous path, they are not criminals. Bring the entire hemisphere together to talk how we rebuild Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador."Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan, who opposes decriminalizing entry by migrants at the US' southern border, replied: "If you want to come into the country, you should at least ring the doorbell."Also on the stage Tuesday were author Marianne Williamson; US Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana; Beto O'Rourke, former congressman from Texas; and John Hickenlooper, former governor of Colorado.The lineup for Wednesday's debate, same time and location as Tuesday's, includes a rematch between former vice-president Joe Biden and US Senator Kamala Harris of California. Harris surged in the polls after the first debate when she went after Biden for his opposition to school busing in the 1970s to racially integrate schools.Also on the stage Wednesday will be US Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado; US Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; Julian Castro of Texas, former secretary of Housing and Urban Development; US Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey; entrepreneur Andrew Yang of New York City; Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard; Washington state Governor Jay Inslee; and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.

                    Audience in NYC wowed by Chinese dance drama Under Siege
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                NEW YORK - Marvelous, stunning, gorgeous, breathtaking... Those are the most common words shared by viewers of Under Siege, a Chinese dance theatre piece, after its US debut at New York's Lincoln Center Thursday night."It was so beautiful. The scenery, the performance, the dancing, the costumes, the music... I'm so inspired." A woman who called herself Jacinth told Xinhua after the show.As an experimental stage artwork created by renowned Chinese dancer and choreographer Yang Liping, Under Siege is a fusion of contemporary dance, martial arts, Chinese folk music, Peking Opera, paper-cutting craftsmanship, and installation art, blending traditional Chinese cultural symbols with modern movements.It depicts a legendary war between Chu and Han kingdoms some 2,200 years ago that changed the course of Chinese history. Through unremitting strategizing, scheming, laying ambush, fighting... the drama also reflects the everlasting confrontation of darkness and light in human nature as well as between human beings.Jacinth, who drove all the way from the state of Connecticut to Manhattan for the show, booked her ticket as soon as she saw the advertisement on a social media website because she's been always enchanted by Eastern arts.And Under Siege didn't fail her. Like many other viewers, she was deeply impressed by the final sequence, in which the beaten soldiers of Chu struggle in a thick layer of red feathers that flutter and erupt around them, resembling a sea of blood and the unbearable lightness of life in face of war.Another similarly eye-catching part of the scenic design features thousands of scissors hanging from the ceiling throughout the 2-hour show, which highlight the conflict between the warring factions."The installation art of scissors by Chinese American artist Liu Beili deepens the theme, as the household tool scissor implies danger and fear in Chinese culture," said Yang Liping in an interview with Xinhua weeks ago.Since its debut in 2015 in China, Under Siege has been widely hailed as an aesthetic feast and visual splendor. Hong Kong-born Tim Yip, who won the 2001 Academy Award for Best Art Direction in the feature film "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," took the lead in costume and scenic designs for the dance drama."It is perfect color-matching everywhere," said Enoch Huang, a China-born New Yorker who works as a sales consultant at a luxury store."All those costumes are not only beautifully-looking but designed in accordance with historical facts and each character's distinctive personality," said Huang, who majored in fashion design in college.Every main character in the drama plays a critical role in making the story coherent and convincing. "It's hard to say who is my favorite. The heroes are spectacular, and Han Xin and Yu Ji are really, really good," said Diane Gill, an editor at a publishing house, who added that "it is the best thing I've seen in a long time."It's worth noting that Yu Ji, the beloved concubine of Lord Xiang Yu of Chu and the only female protagonist in the story, is played by a male dancer following a Peking Opera tradition; while Han Xin, a general who contributed greatly to the final victory of Emperor Liu Bang and the establishment of the Han Dynasty, is played by two dancers wearing black and white respectively to depict his perpetual mental struggle between pride and insecurity, ambition and loyalty.Chuck Oliver, a long-time Chinese culture lover, has some knowledge of the historical background of the drama. He thought the production is a very imaginative, modern work and yet very respectful of the original story."It's done in a powerful and gripping fashion," he noted. "Apparently the audience who were not used to this type of drama was very impressed by the action and the emotion that was being expressed.""I hope there's more of this coming from China to the United States, and there are more people who appreciate the value of this," he added.For Huang, the drama's US debut also marked a dream-come-true moment as he finally got the chance to see Yang Liping, who appeared on stage during the curtain call amid a standing ovation from some 2,500 spectators that lasted for nearly 10 minutes."Through the drama I can really see the huge progress of Chinese theatre productions during these years. I've seen several good ones at Lincoln Center already," said Huang, who has settled down here for 10 years. "They are growing so fast. I feel so proud. Just so proud."

                    Young people should not follow herd's behavior
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Many young people in Hong Kong seem to have misunderstandings about the Chinese mainland and the United States. No matter how noble an individual goal is, the collective outcome could be exactly the opposite of what each individual wanted. When I taught social decision theories, my students often could not believe their eyes that collective decisions are necessarily dictatorial, even under very minimal assumptions. That is an implication of the Arrow's impossibility theorem developed by Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow. It can also be proved that by simply setting a different voting agenda, such as whom to get to vote first, we will have a different social outcome even when the individual preferences of all voters have not changed at all. That is an implication of the Condorcet paradox. The situation is further aggravated when there is herd behavior. For instance, panicked individuals confined to a room with two equal and equidistant exits often overwhelmingly choose one exit over the other. It is especially problematic when some leading the herd are professionally engaged or supported by external entities. The world has already seen that the "color revolutions" only brought chaos in other nations. It is easy to fall prey to the common narratives about how bad the future of the Hong Kong younger generation is, especially due to the ultra-high property prices in Hong Kong. Yet Hong Kong people are exactly at the heart of arguably the most prosperous place there is on Earth for the next 20 years - the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. But young people may consider not using the exact same success measure of their parents, which often implies a pricey apartment in Hong Kong. New Yorkers will not resort to blaming high Manhattan prices all day but not moving their feet to consider cheaper and more beautiful houses in Queens and Brooklyn. There is reason to be ridiculed for not taking the new 14-minute high-speed train to Shenzhen from Hong Kong, which is shorter than taking the subway ride to other boroughs from Manhattan. Shenzhen and other nearby cities in Guangdong province are beautiful, with plenty of opportunities and far lower property prices. The fight of young people in Hong Kong so far has defied their moral ground, at least on freedom. John Stuart Mill wrote in the 1859 classic On Liberty, "The only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it." Instead of escalating violence and blocking traffic, being midway attracts the biggest group of supporters, instead of calling oneself yellow or blue as in the Hong Kong riot case. It is wise now not to polarize opinions but to admit nuances in perceptions. Many young people in Hong Kong have misunderstood US citizens. Even many Americans disagree strongly with US politicians. The violence part of Hong Kong protesters is what an average American would frown upon. There was a "China is not an enemy" open letter to the US president recently in The Washington Post by a group from the academic, foreign policy, military and business communities, overwhelmingly from the US, including a former US ambassador to China and professors from Yale, MIT and Harvard. The letter reads in part: "US opposition will not prevent the continued expansion of the Chinese economy, a greater global market share for Chinese companies and an increase in China's role in world affairs.... We do not believe Beijing is an economic enemy or an existential national security threat that must be confronted in every sphere." It is imperative for the protesters to heal the wound now and clearly stay away from the rioters. Identify the right crowd and recognize one incontrovertible fact - that Hong Kong is part of China. Upholding the "one country, two systems" principle is the first step toward restoring the rule of law in Hong Kong. Please do not become the ones you hated most. If Hong Kong becomes hell, you are contributing to it, for, as the open letter mentioned earlier also says, "Efforts to isolate China will simply weaken those Chinese intent on developing a more humane and tolerant society." The wrong crowd cannot represent you, and you are the most unique if you avoid the crowd and turn back now. The author is academic dean and professor of the Paris School of Business.

                    New Yorkers celebrate 25th anniversary of Friends
                </p>

                NEW YORK - Central Perk's famous orange sofa, Chandler and Joey's reclining leather armchairs and Phoebe's guitar: All are on display at an exhibition to mark the 25th anniversary of the hit TV sitcom Friends. The pop-up exhibit opened in New York on Saturday as part of celebrations marking a quarter of a century since the first episode aired on NBC, and runs until Oct 6. It is also a way for Warner Bros to cash in on the comedy series' seemingly never-ending popularity, 15 years after the last episode was broadcast in May 2004. "It's like a museum. The amount of details, of props, and just the craftsmanship that has gone into this event is astounding," said James Michael Tyler, who played Gunther, the timid waiter in love with Rachel. The studio has almost exactly recreated the set in a huge loft in the Soho neighborhood of Manhattan. Everything from the furniture to the decor is the same. Visitors can lounge on the famous armchairs where Joey and Chandler would shout at the television, eye their foosball table, or open the door to Monica and Rachel's apartment just across the hallway. "When I first walked in, I just burst into a smile. Every corner that I turn and all the things that I could see brings back a lot memories and it's so well done," said Maggie Wheeler, who played Janice - that woman with the annoying, nasal laugh. The exhibition, which is already sold out, is part of a wider effort to mark the anniversary and capitalize on its popularity among younger audiences who weren't even born when the final episode was broadcast but have discovered it through reruns on Netflix. More than a thousand movie theaters in the United States are planning to show iconic episodes this year while lines in Friends toys and furniture, including the orange sofa, have been launched around the world.
