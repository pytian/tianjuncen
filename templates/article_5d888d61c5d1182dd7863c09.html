                Only one UK firm in five ready for no-deal Brexit
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                 Four British companies in every five are woefully underprepared for a no-deal Brexit, according to a new survey of supply-chain managers.The Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply's study, which was published on Wednesday, found only 22 percent of United Kingdom companies have completed the four steps it says are needed to continue trading with suppliers in the European Union.The institute, which is also known as Cips, conducted a similar survey in March and found 14 percent of UK enterprises had completed the four steps, meaning there has been a small improvement in the six months since then, but not a significant enough change to avoid queues at borders following a no-deal Brexit.John Glen, an economist at Cips, told the Financial Times the findings show "with the Brexit deadline just weeks away, the government faces an uphill battle to get businesses ready in time".The four steps relate to whether companies have an "EORI" number – which is necessary to interact with EU customs authorities – as well as whether they know how to fill in a customs declaration, whether they have agreed responsibilities with a customs agent or logistics provider, and whether they are familiar with the software needed to submit customs documents.The Cips survey found that many enterprises hope to avoid the worst of any anticipated disruption by importing goods earlier than they would ordinarily have done, something that has had the knock-on effect of snarling up the nation's warehousing space.But Peter Ward, the chief executive of the UK Warehousing Association, told the Financial Times that inquiries from companies seeking additional warehouse space are still only about half the level they were in the weeks leading up to the ultimately abandoned March 2019 Brexit deadline, something he attributes to "Brexit fatigue"."The Oct 31 deadline couldn't have come at a worse time, clashing with peak season in logistics in the run-up to Christmas, including Black Friday and Cyber Monday," he said.The Cips survey quizzed 817 supply-chain managers at companies involved in 11 sectors of the British economy.The government is encouraging businesses to get ready for the Oct 31 Brexit deadline through its recently launched Prepare for Brexit information campaign.Meanwhile, documents prepared by the UK's Department for Transport that were leaked to the Financial Times suggest disruption caused by UK companies not having the correct customs documents would be serious. The papers show the government anticipates EU ports will turn trucks away if drivers do not have the right paperwork, rather than let them queue dockside.Other government documents quoted by the Guardian newspaper show London's own planning for a no-deal Brexit includes the expectation that 85 percent of freight trucks attempting to cross the English Channel may be bumped by French customs authorities.The Guardian newspaper said UK companies are responding by stockpiling beer, wine, and spirits,in a bid to keep the alcohol flowing at Christmas.Glen, the Cips economist, said: "It's particularly wine from the EU. Companies have bought well ahead of Christmas this year, due to potential disruption at the ports and to try and avoid depreciation in the value of sterling against the euro."Britain is France's biggest export market for champagne, quaffing 26 million bottles a year, which is worth billions to the French economy.

                    Sino-Finnish partnership entering into new era

                Further enhanced cooperation opens up new avenues for interconnectivity, trade, investment and innovation In April 2017, President Xi Jinping made a state visit to Finland on occasion of the centenary of Finland's independence. The visit came 22 years after the last time a Chinese president visited Finland. The two heads of state jointly announced the establishment of future-oriented new-type cooperative partnership between China and Finland. In January 2019, Finnish President Sauli Niinisto paid a visit to China. The two countries jointly launched the 2019"China-Finland Year of Winter Sports". This is the first time China and a foreign country jointly held thematic year of winter sports. Looking back, it's not quite hard to find that Finland has always been at the forefront of western countries in establishing diplomatic ties and developing cooperation with China. Sino-Finnish relationship has stood the test of time and changes in international circumstances. Finland was among the first Western countries to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. Finland was also one of the few countries which supported China's restoration of the legitimate seat in UN in the early 1970s. In recent years, under the guidance of the heads of state diplomacy, the two countries have witnessed frequent high-level exchanges and enhanced mutual political trust. At the beginning of last year, the speaker of the Finnish Parliament had led a joint visit of speakers from eight Nordic and Baltic countries to China. Cabinet members from Finland, including the prime minister, visit China or attend international conferences in China. Each year, nearly 40 Chinese provincial and ministerial delegations from political parties, governments, the National People's Congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the judiciary and military departments visit Finland to exchange governance experience. Such visits have, in fact, become the "new normal". In 1953, Finland has signed intergovernmental trade agreement with Chinese government, making Finland the first Western country to sign such agreement with the New China. In the past few decades, large number of Finnish companies, such as Nokia, have achieved great success in China. Many Chinese people, myself included, have their first mobile phone from Nokia. As China has grown into the world's second-largest economy, two countries have expanded cooperation in the fields of trade and investment. In fact, China has already been Finland's fourth-largest trading partner in the world as well as the largest in Asia for 16 consecutive years. China's investment in Finland has grown rapidly in recent years, and mutual investment between the two sides has been basically at equal level. At present, there are nine direct flights between China and Finland operated by three airlines, and two lines of China Railway Express have been extended to Finland. Finland was also the first place where the five-starred red flag was raised at the Olympic Games. In 1952, the New China sent its first ever delegation to the Helsinki Olympic Games. At the beginning of 2018, a pair of Chinese giant pandas, named" Hua Bao" and" Jin Baobao", came to Finland. Finland became the first Nordic country to welcome Chinese giant pandas. I often say that, Finland is among the few countries to have three Chinese ambassadors. Traditional Chinese cultural activities represented by the" Happy Chinese New Year - Chinese Temple Fair in Helsinki" have attracted wide attention and participation in Finland, while the number of overnight visitors from China to Finland has increased dramatically. Finland's unique educational philosophy and lifestyle are particularly popular among the Chinese people, especially the young. The comic book Finnish Nightmare has become a hit in China, and Jingfen (spiritually Finnish) becoming buzzword on the internet. China and Finland share common similarities in diplomatic philosophy. In the context of anti-globalization, unilateralism and trade protectionism, both countries firmly stand for multilateralism, economic globalization and free trade. The two sides hold similar positions on sustainable development, climate change, Arctic affairs and other issues. There are many areas of cooperation China and Finland can focus on: First, connectivity. Although Finland is a Nordic country, it is one of the nearest path from China to Europe. Therefore, cooperation on connectivity under the Belt and Road Initiative could be fruitful. China and Finland also face broad prospects for cooperation in the Arctic shipping-lane. In the future, we can even foresee the idea of" Ice Silk Road" and" Digital Silk Road". Second, trade and investment. The successful cases of Chinese investment in Finland in recent years, such as Tencent's acquisition of majority shares of Finnish game company Supercell and Anta's acquisition of famous sports company Amer Sports, provided excellent practice. Finland has advantages in high-tech fields of clean technology, bio-economy and circular economy. Excellent products, services and technologies from such areas are exactly what China needs. The China International Import Expo with other platforms in return offer a huge market for Finnish companies. There are also great potentials for Sino-Finnish cooperation in tripartite financial market, as Finland is the founding member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Third, innovation cooperation. China overtook Japan in the Global Innovation Index 2019 to rank 14, making it the only middle-income economy in the top 20. Innovation is one of Finland's unique features, especially in the information and communication industry, where Finland has accumulated talent, experience and technological advantages. Sino-Finnish cooperation in 5G, artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge scientific and technological fields can make new contributions to the growth of world economy. This year is "China-Finland Year of Winter Sports". The two sides will carry out nearly 70 activities, including cooperation in the fields of personnel training, equipment manufacturing, site construction, and event organization. In October, Finland will participate in the International Winter Sports Expo in Beijing as the guest of honor. In December, the closing ceremony of the" China-Finland Year of Winter Sports" will be held in Rovaniemi, a tourist resort in northern Finland. These series of activities will provide a great platform for enterprises and sports institutions related to ice and snow sports in China and Finland to promote exchanges and cooperation. It is believed that this will help China achieve the goal of"300 million people joining the ice and snow sports" and help China host the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. Finland, a member of the European Union, has just taken over the EU's rotating presidency since July. We believe that Finland will play a positive role during its rotating presidency to create favorable conditions and lay a solid foundation for the next EU institutions to cooperate with China and participate in the Belt and Road Initiative. Well begun is half done. Next year we will usher in the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Finland. Joint efforts will ensure the future of Sino-Finnish partnership to be even better. The author is Chinese ambassador to Finland.

                NICOSIA - Britain will definitely leave the European Union on Oct 31, no matter what, visiting British Secretary of State for Brexit Stephen Barclay said here Wednesday.After meeting with Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades, Barclay was asked if Britain would be leaving the EU on Oct 31 without an agreement, and Barclay said "yes, we will."Barkley said that he was "grateful to the president for the very strong bilateral relationship that we have.""He has a deep understanding of the issues around Brexit and very much shares the prime minister's desire for a deal ... It was surely appreciated to get the president's engagement on this issue because both sides want to get a deal, which is in the interest of both sides, and that is what we are working for," Barclay said.Barkley is on his visit to Cyprus to discuss Brexit issues. A spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the EU in London told the Cyprus News Agency that the visit was part of the British government's engagement with EU member states, "as the UK seeks to reach a deal with the backstop removed."Britain has two bases on the island, which will have the status of foreign territory with boundaries with Cypriot soil.However, the two countries have reached a private agreement that the status of the base areas will not change and that Cypriots living or working within the boundaries of the bases will not be adversely affected in their everyday life after a hard Brexit.Likewise, Britain guaranteed that Cypriots living in Britain will not be affected and Cyprus guaranteed that about 80,000 Britons living on the island will not have their everyday life disrupted."We have made an unequivocal guarantee to the 30,000 Cypriot nationals living and working in the UK. They will have absolute legal certainty of the rights to work, study and access benefits and services on the same basis as now under any Brexit scenario," the Brexit ministry spokesman said.He added that Barclay will be stepping up his engagement with Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, over the coming days, following their meeting in Luxembourg on Monday, which he described as constructive.

                BRUSSELS - Britain has submitted some proposals in writing of how it would like the stalled Brexit deal to be amended, a spokeswoman for the European Union's executive Commission said on Thursday, confirming an earlier Reuters report."We have received documents from the UK and on this basis we will have technical discussion today and tomorrow on some aspects of customs, manufactured goods and sanitary and phytosanitary rules," said Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva.She added that the EU and British Brexit negotiators, Michel Barnier and Stephen Barclay, will also discuss Brexit in Brussels on Friday."These are papers for now. Until we have looked at them in detail, I will not characterise them beyond being a paper," Andreeva said.The UK side said it had shared with Brussels "technical non-papers which reflect the ideas the UK has been putting forward," without going into further detail. "We will table formal written solutions when we are ready," a British government spokeswoman said.Andreeva added that there was no formal deadline for Britain to submit formal proposals but stressed that every day counted now as the Brexit date nears on Oct 31. Reuters
