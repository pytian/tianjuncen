            <p class="style-content">
                NAIROBI - China is devoted to modernizing its defense forces to enhance its capacity to handle new security threats, said Wang Yang, military attache at the Chinese Embassy in Kenya late on Tuesday.He made the remarks at an event celebrating the 92nd anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China, which was also attended by some Kenyan officials and foreign diplomats."The PLA has been making great and historical contributions to the Chinese people's liberation, socialist construction and reform," said Wang."In the new era, we are currently committed to building a fortified national defence system and a strong military that are commensurate with the country's international standing and its security and development interests," he said.Wang stressed that Beijing has no intention to pursue hegemony, but will rather promote peaceful development and win-win partnerships."We advocate a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept. We also advocate a road of common construction, sharing and win-win security, and actively participate in international security dialogues and exchanges," he said.China is now a major contributor to the UN peacekeeping operations in global hotspots, said Wang, adding that China had by 2018 participated in 24 UN peacekeeping missions and contributed more than 40,000 peacekeepers.Beijing has been on the frontline of humanitarian assistance in global hotspots and has also dispatched troops to protect critical shipping routes like the Gulf of Aden and Somalia's coastline, he said."In the past decade, over 100 vessels and 26,000 officers and sailors have been regularly deployed in 31 escort task groups. They escorted more than 6,600 ships, and rescued, protected or assisted over 70 ships in distress," he added.The offical also said he was optimistic that China-Kenya defense cooperation will be strengthened.

                    Conflicts kill and hurt over 12,000 kids last year
                </p>

                UNITED NATIONS - More than 12,000 children were killed and injured in armed conflicts last year - a record number - with Afghanistan, the Palestinian territory, Syria and Yemen topping the casualty list, according to a new UN report.The deaths and injuries were among more than 24,000 "grave violations" against children verified by the United Nations, including the recruitment and use of youngsters by combatants, sexual violence, abductions, and attacks on schools and hospitals, it said.According to Secretary-General Antonio Gutteres' newest Annual Report on Children and Armed Conflict, obtained on Monday by The Associated Press, violations by armed groups remained steady but there was "an alarming increase" in the number of violations by government and international forces compared to 2017.The secretary-general's eagerly awaited blacklist of countries that committed grave violations against children during conflicts remained virtually unchanged from last year, angering several human rights groups.Guterres said he was "deeply concerned by the scale and severity of the grave violations committed against children in 2018, notably the record high number of casualties as a result of killing and maiming and the increase in the number of violations attributed to international forces".According to the report, verified cases of deaths and injuries were the highest since the Security Council authorized monitoring and reporting in 2005.Afghanistan topped the list with 3,062 child casualties in 2018," and children accounted for 28 percent of all civilian casualties", the report said, while in Syria, airstrikes, barrel bombs and cluster munitions killed and injured 1,854 youngsters." And in Yemen, 1,689 children bore the brunt of ground fighting and other offensives."In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the UN said that in 2018 it verified the highest number of Palestinian children killed (59) and injured (2,756) since 2014. During the same period, six Israeli children were injured.Guterres said he is "extremely concerned by the significant rise" in injuries, including by inhaling tear gas. He asked UN envoy Nikolay Mladenov to examine cases caused by Israeli forces "and urge Israel to immediately put in place preventive and protective measures to end the excessive use of force".According to the report, parties to the conflict in Somalia recruited and used 2,300 children, some as young as eight-years-old, with al-Shabab extremists significantly increasing their recruitment to 1,865 youngsters. Nigeria was in second place, with 1,947 children recruited, including some used as suicide bombers.Somalia also had the highest verified figure for sexual violence against children, with 331 cases in 2018, followed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo with 277 cases, although the secretary-general said cases remain significantly underreported, particularly against boys because of stigma. And Somalia had the highest number of child abductions last year: 1,609.Guterres said thousands of children were also affected by 1,023 verified attacks on schools and hospitals last year.In Syria, last year saw 225 attacks on schools and medical facilities, the highest number since the conflict began in 2011, he said, and Afghanistan also saw an increase with 254 schools and hospitals targeted."Increased numbers of attacks were also verified in the Central African Republic, Colombia, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Somalia, the Sudan and Yemen," Guterres said.The secretary-general also expressed concern at the increasing detention of children, reiterating that "this measure should only be used as a last resort, for the shortest period of time, and that alternatives to detention should be prioritized whenever possible".In December 2018, Guterres said, 1,248 children, mainly under the age of 5, of 46 nationalities from areas formerly controlled by Islamic State extremists, were "deprived of their liberty" in camps in northeast Syria.In Iraq, 902 children remained in detention on national security charges, including for associating with the Islamic State, he said.Associated Press

                    UN calls on youth to advance peace, political progress in Somalia
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                MOGADISHU - The UN has called on the youth to help advance peace and political progress in Somalia.James Swan, special representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for Somalia and George Conway, acting deputy special representative of the UN Secretary-General for Somalia, emphasized the need for political processes in Somalia to reflect the composition of society.Somalia is currently undergoing an ongoing constitutional review process, a national reconciliation dialogue and preparations for national elections in 2020.The two UN officials, who spoke with young activists from across the country at a two-day youth empowerment and engagement dialogue that ended in Mogadishu on Tuesday evening, said the world body will continue to help young people develop initiatives to ensure their active participation in the country's ongoing political processes."We think prospects for lasting peace in Somalia will be improved if young people feel represented. If they participate in political life, and if they have a say in the national dialogue, they can ultimately show their stake and involvement in the country's future," Swan, who is also head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia, said in a statement issued at the end of the meeting.The review of Somalia's constitution was launched in May 2018 at a national convention held in Mogadishu and attended by more than 350 representatives from the federal government, federal member states, civil society and the diaspora.The process is meant to lead to a permanent constitution, which will replace the provisional one, adopted in 2012.The UN Assistance Mission in Somalia and other UN agencies are advocating for the active participation of youth and women in the process to ensure that the final document reflects the views of all Somalis.In his remarks, Conway said the UN will step up efforts to advocate for the involvement of youth in formal decision-making processes related to some of the critical political benchmarks."We keep hearing that Somali youth are the voice of the future - but in a country where 80 percent of the population is younger than 35, Somalia's youth are very much the voice of today," said Conway, who also serves as the world body's resident and humanitarian coordinator for Somalia.The horn of African nation has one of the youngest populations in the world. Experts believe that the active participation of youth in decision-making processes is vital for Somalia's stability.

                QINGDAO -- The 33rd fleet from the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy on Thursday left the port city of Qingdao in East China's Shandong province for the Gulf of Aden to escort civilian ships.The fleet is mainly composed of naval forces from the the Northern Theater Command of the Chinese navy, including a destroyer, a frigate and a supply ship.It has more than 600 officers and soldiers, dozens of special operation soldiers and two helicopters onboard.The PLA Navy began to carry out escort missions in the Gulf of Aden and the waters off Somalia in December 2008.Over the past decade, the Chinese navy has dispatched 106 vessels and over 28,000 officers and soldiers to escort more than 6,700 Chinese and foreign ships.

                    Navy sends its most capable combat ship on escort mission
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                One of the most moving episodes in the Chinese blockbuster Wolf Warrior 2 is the one in which the captain of a Type 052D guided-missile destroyer shouts "Fire!" to order the launch of supersonic cruise missiles to hit rebel troops in an imaginary African nation holding Chinese hostages.However, this scenario could not have happened in real life because in the Gulf of Aden there have been no Type 052D destroyers－now considered the most capable combat ship in the People's Liberation Army Navy.Instead, the Navy has sent other vessels to the once pirate-plagued waters to protect civilian vessels for nearly 11 years.That is about to change, as the Navy has decided to dispatch a Type 052D to take part in its latest escort mission. The CNS Xining, the fifth in the Type 052D class, is sailing toward the Gulf of Aden.The Xining, with the number 117 on its hull, was commissioned in January 2017. It is part of the PLA Navy's 33rd escort flotilla, together with CNS Weifang, a Type 054A guided-missile frigate and CNS Hoh Xil Hu, a Type 903A supply ship. All of the ships belong to the naval force of the PLA Northern Theater Command, known as the North Sea Fleet.The flotilla set sail from a naval base in Qingdao, Shandong province, on Aug 29. It will travel at least 11,000 kilometers before reaching the Gulf of Aden in the next two weeks.A Type 052D destroyer has a standard displacement of 6,300 metric tons, according to the Navy. It carries a wide range of weapons, including a single-barrel 130 mm naval gun, a close-in weapon system, 64 HHQ-9 long-range antiaircraft missiles and YJ-18 or YJ-83 cruise missiles.The vessel uses a host of cutting-edge technologies. The Navy said that the Type 052D destroyer has a stealth design and can act as a flagship for a strike group.It is capable of conducting anti-ship, anti-submarine and air defense operations, and has been described by some Western observers as a "carrier killer".The first Type 052D destroyer, CNS Kunming, joined the Navy in March 2014. The Navy has built at least 17 Type 052Ds and 11 of them are in service, according to military observers who follow the weapons' development of the PLA Navy.The 33rd escort flotilla has more than 600 officers and sailors, including dozens of special operations troops.The Navy began to carry out escort missions in the Gulf of Aden and the waters off Somalia in December 2008. In the past decade, it has sent 106 ships and more than 28,000 naval personnel to escort at least 6,700 Chinese and foreign ships, according to the Navy.

                    Appreciating the great contributions: China Daily editorial
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                 The air raid siren across Shenyang, Liaoning province, at 9:18 am on Wednesday was a reminder of the pain and humiliation foreign invaders heaped on the Chinese people for more than a century before the founding of New China in 1949. The siren to mark the 88th anniversary of the Mukden Incident the Japanese invaders staged on Sept 18, 1931, to launch a full-scale invasion of China recalled not only the atrocities committed by the foreign invaders on the Chinese people but also the heroic battles the Chinese people have fought throughout China's recent history.While the outstanding contributions of the Chinese people as well as foreign friends before and in the early days of New China are well recorded and appreciated, there was also a need to recognize individuals' contributions to the development of the nation in recent decades.President Xi Jinping fulfilled that need on Tuesday by signing a decree to award 36 Chinese citizens and six foreign nationals, including some posthumously, national medals and honorary titles for their excellent contributions to the country's development and world peace.That the presidential decree came after the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a resolution to confer the medals and titles shows the great importance China attaches to their contributions and, more importantly, to their spirit.The Chinese awardees, as representatives of the countless unsung heroes, exemplify the contributions ordinary people have made to the country's development.Tragically, the two youngest heroes were only 29 years old when they died in 2016 — one in the line of duty as a UN peacekeeper in Somalia, and the other while performing a task for the naval air force of the People's Liberation Army.The awarding of the Friendship Medal to six foreigners — former Cuban president Raul Castro, Thai princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, former Tanzanian prime minister Salim Ahmed Salim, first vice-president of Russia-China Friendship Association Galina Kulikova, former French prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin and Canadian educator Isabel Crook — shows the Chinese people not only recognize foreigners' contributions but are also grateful to them for promoting cooperation between China and other countries and supporting China's socialist modernization.Thanks partly to such individuals' efforts, China has become the biggest supporter of economic globalization, which advances the common good and benefits the whole world.And the excellent examples these individuals have set should inspire the Chinese people to emulate them in order to realize the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
