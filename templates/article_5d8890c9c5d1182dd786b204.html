                Founder Yuan Hui says firm expects to double revenue this year on AIShanghai Xiaoi Robot Technology Co Ltd, which is into artificial intelligence, aims to go public in 2019.The announcement follows the opening of its Asia-Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong earlier this month, which was graced by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor.The moves are part of the go-global strategy of Xiaoi Robot, which is better known as Xiao-i.Yuan Hui, its founder and chairman, said the firm's AI technology is the brain behind businesses embracing the digital dimension.The firm expects to double its revenue this year, given its increasingly popular conversational AI system and solutions, Yuan said, without disclosing the company's financials."Hong Kong is a leading technology hub, and innovation is strongly supported by the local government. We have every confidence in using Hong Kong as the base and taking our development to the next level in Asia-Pacific."The Hong Kong facility will deepen research and development, as well as offer sales and services to clients. The firm will continue to invest in AI technology, build the ecosystem and incubate talent, he said.The move follows Xiaoi Robot's R&D unit that was set up in the Hong Kong Science Park in January 2017. The Asia-Pacific center is expected to further extend the company's service capability in Hong Kong and support growth in the region.At the time of its founding in 2001, Xiaoi Robot engaged in semantic analysis of texts. It rapidly emerged as a pioneer in the human-machine interaction market. It is now locked in competition with iFlytek Co Ltd.The firm has businesses in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and other regions, with clients and partners such as the Bank of China's Hong Kong branch, HSBC and Asus."We see a lot of opportunities in Hong Kong as businesses are committing more resources to upgrade their technology to improve operating efficiency and to enhance the customer experience," Yuan said.The firm's products have been used in 50 sectors and adopted by more than 1,000 enterprise clients, including leading banking, financial, retail and telecom corporations and government organizations in the Chinese mainland.Earlier this year, Xiaoi Robot inked a partnership with Australian company Actura, a provider of learning solutions spanning in-class to out-of-class environments.Under the deal, Xiaoi Robot offers semantic analysis technologies to enable automatic customer service at Actura.Xiang Yang, an AI expert at the China Center for Information Industry Development, said voice-interaction is becoming an important way for human-machine interaction, which will generate a large number of business opportunities.Consultancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers has forecast that AI-enabled businesses will boost China's GDP by as much as 26 percent in 2030.

                    ASUS strengthens presence in East Africa

            <p class="style-content">
                AsusTek Computer Inc, or ASUS, a multinational computer and phone hardware and electronics company based in China's Taiwan, is betting on the Kenyan market to boost its market share in the wider East African region by launching new laptop models ZenBook, VivoBook and TUF Gaming on Thursday in the capital Nairobi.Bora Aras, the firm's regional manager for Africa, Israel and Turkey, said boosting the company's operations in Kenya was an essential part of expanding its footprint in the region."ASUS is making a concerted effort to tap into the growing opportunities in Africa and bolster its operations in the region with strategic investments," Aras explained. "This is an important first step toward unlocking the East African region and eventually expanding our presence in the African continent."Benjamin Yeh, the ASUS general manager for PC & Gaming, said the company was banking on its innovation prowess to capture and grow the Kenyan market."Kenya is one of the promising and key markets for ASUS in Africa and we are happy to launch our latest products in Nairobi today. At ASUS, we strongly believe that our passion for new technologies fits perfectly with Africa's young and ambitious population's expectations," said Yeh.ASUS now controls 20 percent of the PC market in Kenya and hopes to grow this by introducing highly innovative products and an expanded presence."We also seek to serve and eventually develop other regional markets like Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda out of Kenya," said Simplice Zaongo, the business development manager for eastern and southern Africa, and added that the response of the Kenyan market to its products has been positive.ASUS also runs operations in Nigeria and South Africa.

                    New Oriental makes push for rural education
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Yu Minhong, founder of English-language training giant New Oriental Education and Technology Group, hopes to do more to help children in rural areas to get better education."This year, I plan to return to a rural high school in a poverty-stricken area to work as an honorary principal. I want to bring high-quality resources to such schools, so children in rural areas who may have no hope for high-quality education will one day enter a prestigious university in China or other countries," Yu said at the ASU GSV Summit 2019 in San Diego.China has invested a great deal of  money in education over 40 years of reform and opening-up, dozens of times more than it used to be. However, the country still faces the problem of education imbalances, he said."Children in rural and mountainous areas are unable to receive the same quality education as children in urban areas, yet with the development of technology such as remote learning and dual teacher, we can do a lot of things in improving education equality in China."He believes the real development of China's future must be the development of education equality through technology, so children in every corner can receive the best quality education in China, so every child has the opportunity to enter the best universities in the world.The son of a farmer in East China's Jiangsu province, Yu failed the gaokao — the national college entrance exam — twice because of low scores in English. However, he was finally accepted by the prestigious Peking University in 1980 and later became a teacher there.After quitting Peking University in 1991 he opened an English school, which later became one of the largest English-language training institutions in China.

                Changan Ford fined over monopoly issueChina's State Administration for Market Regulation announced on Wednesday that it has imposed a fine of 162.8 million yuan ($23.6 million) on automaker Changan Ford for implementing vertical monopoly agreements. Since 2013, Changan Ford Automobile Co has restricted the minimum vehicle resale prices for downstream dealers in Chongqing municipality, violating China's anti-monopoly law, the administration said in a statement on its website. The company's practices deprived the downstream dealers of pricing autonomy, excluded and restricted competition within the brand and in effect weakened competition among brands, the statement said.Tencent launches gaming phone

                    Tech giants chafe at new tariffs
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Leading United States tech giants are joining forces to oppose Washington's proposal to include laptops and tablet devices among around $300 billion in Chinese imports targeted for additional tariffs of up to 25 percent.Dell Technologies Inc, HP Inc, Intel Corp and Microsoft Corp, which according to market research firm IDC account for 52 percent of notebooks and detachable tablets sold in the US, said the proposed tariffs would add a burden to cost-conscious domestic businesses and consumers, including the US government.The move signifies that the US government's proposal is losing support among crucial constituents, analysts said.They also said the proposal is expected to hinder US competitiveness in the global marketplace."The proposed tariffs threaten to substantially increase the cost of laptops in the US, … which will diminish demand for laptops and threaten to impair productivity growth for the US economy as a whole," the companies said in a joint statement.The burden will fall on small and medium-sized businesses and a wide range of consumers and device manufacturers, as well as the US government, they said.If the proposed tariffs are implemented, prices of laptops and tablets will rise by at least 19 percent, or around $120 for the average retail price of a laptop today, according to a recent study by the Consumer Technology Association, based in Arlington, Virginia.The move would cost US customers an additional $8.2 billion for laptops and tablets, producing a net loss of $3.6 billion for the US economy, the report estimated.Liang Ming, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, said it has become clear to many US consumers and businesses that imposing tariffs would harm them and not solve any problems.The four companies said the price increases would hit during the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons, which are crucial for retailers."Because our foreign competitors are less dependent on US sales, they would be less severely impacted by new tariffs and would be well-positioned to continue investing in research and development during a time when our companies will be forced to reduce R&D expenditures to offset the increased tariff burden," they said.An IDC report in May suggested that HP, Dell and Apple derive 30, 32 and 43 percent, respectively, of their global laptop revenues from US sales while Chinese manufacturers Lenovo, Acer and ASUS derive only 15, 20 and 9 percent, respectively, of their revenues from US sales.In consequence, the US would be in danger of gradually losing its high-technology leadership, the companies said."US device manufacturers will carry the burden as it is not feasible that they transfer supply chains to countries other than China in the short term," said Xiang Ligang, director-general of Information Consumption Alliance, a telecom industry association."To restart such supply chain systems in another country would cost far more than many would expect.Also, other countries would be reluctant to invest a lot in taking on such business because of uncertainties in the US position," he said.

                    Hainan free to create foreign education ties
                </p>
            </a>

                Island can link with institutions abroad, foster independent schools in pilot planWorld-class overseas universities are welcome to run schools in cooperation with Chinese institutions or establish independent educational services of their own in Hainan province on a pilot basis, according to a circular issued by the Ministry of Education and Hainan's provincial government recently.It said the country will target the tropical island for international education innovation, deepen its educational reform in an all-around way and further open the sector to make Hainan a vivid example of open and innovative development of the educational sector.Hainan, which is developing the country's newest and largest free trade zone, will be a national pilot area where a new, open system for running schools will be set up, in addition to a joint examination and approval mechanism for overseas joint ventures and cooperation projects, the circular said.It added that as long as risks are controlled, the island province will be encouraged to set up international high schools and kindergartens on a pilot basis to implement international education.The document also noted that when conditions mature, overseas engineering universities and vocational colleges will be allowed to run pilot schools independently in Hainan, which will also explore allowing leading overseas business conglomerates to develop educational services on their own.The new policy also gives a green light to overseas institutions to establish independent Sino-foreign medical and health services in Hainan, according to the circular.Furthermore, the pilot plan will encourage leading Chinese and foreign institutions of higher learning and scientific research centers to develop a cluster of higher learning institutions and synergetic platforms which will integrate production, teaching and scientific research in Hainan.An education innovation consortium - which combines research branches, laboratories and incubation centers that focus on such key areas as ocean economy, tropical agriculture, healthcare, tourism and cultural innovation - will receive government support, according to the circular.It noted Hainan will develop a modern educational governance system with negative lists, a transparent information service and sound credit management. By 2020, a modern education planning system will be initially formed. By 2035, a modern education system with Chinese characteristics and coordinated development of education at all levels will be basically formed.The new policy encourages all social sectors to participate in running schools by means of contribution of capital, knowledge, technology and management, and says they will enjoy corresponding rights."The new policy, which is very open, bold and unique to Hainan, will create great opportunities for farsighted international education investors," said Wang Lin, dean of the International Tourism College, a joint venture between Hainan University and Arizona State University in the United States.She said the talent introduction, training platforms and joint ventures to be established under the measures will bring strong support to the development of the China (Hainan) Pilot Free Trade Zone, which is facing a serious shortage of talent.With 50 percent of the major courses introduced from ASU and all major subjects taught in English by overseas faculties, the Haikou-based college - the country's first tourism JV education institution established in 2017 - is becoming increasingly attractive to Chinese students who expect an overseas education and a diploma from a foreign university, Wang said, adding all of the college's teaching is designed and managed strictly in line with ASU standards.Wang Tiansong, president of the Sanya Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, welcomed the new policy on supporting development of Sino-foreign medical and healthcare institutions in Hainan, saying it "will be encouraging to overseas medical institutions".He said Hainan had natural advantages, including its climate, and its traditional Chinese medicine resources were also effective and cheap, making the sector competitive."The natural means of treatment that are gradually favored by Western tourists promise to create bright prospects for cooperation in the island province's medical tourism sector," Wang said.About 100,000 foreigners - mostly from Russian-speaking countries and northern Europe, as well as some from Canada, the US, Turkey and Iran - have received tailored TCM therapies that eased or cured their illnesses in Sanya since the hospital began its healthcare tourism in 2002, according to the hospital.

                    Forging some homegrown puck power

                Building a strong domestic league cited as crucial for China's Olympic chancesDespite a lack of talent and facilities, China's hockey governing body is looking to its long-awaited domestic league to bolster the national program ahead of the challenge of the home Olympics.Four years into preparations for the 2022 Winter Games, China's commitment to propel hockey into the national sports mainstream still looks like a long shot, underlined by the weekend launch of a domestic league forced to include overseas teams to make up for the dearth of homegrown talent.The "league", literally a three-stop tournament, opened its first leg in Beijing on Friday with five teams, including the Arizona State University Sun Devils from the US and Ermak Angarsk from Russia's second tier VHL. The Chinese entries are Jilin Tsen Tou and KRS-ORG from the VHL and Kunlun Red Star from Russia's top-tier Kontinental Hockey League.They're competing in a round-robin format through Wednesday at northeast Beijing's Aozhong Ice Sports Center.The Chinese Ice Hockey Association revealed on Friday that the second and third legs of the competition will be held in March after the Russian leagues' regular seasons, with more domestic clubs participating.To put things in perspective, perennial national champions Harbin and Qiqihar, from China's strong winter sports province Heilongjiang, skipped the first stop in order to compete in the ongoing U19 tournament at the China Youth Games in Shanxi province.To be competitive in the world's fastest team sport, which has long been dominated by Canada, Russia and teams from Scandinavia, China needs to build a domestic league system from scratch, said Si Liang, deputy secretary-general of CIHA."It's better late than never... even though we have to launch it in a shorthanded and hasty situation," Si told China Daily at Aozhong Ice Sports Center on Friday."As host, trying to pull off a respectable showing at the 2022 Olympics means we are in urgent need of more elite-level hockey competitions on a consistent basis, rather than just the annual national championships to develop our players and help them gain more experience."Having qualified for the men's and women's Olympic tournaments by special permission from the International Ice Hockey Federation, China is pursuing a tall task to contend for a medal in the 10-team women's competition and not be embarrassed in the 12-squad men's event.China's women are currently ranked No 20 by the IIHF, while the men are No 32.Although China is ambitiously promoting snow and ice sports among 300 million people in the buildup to 2022, its stagnant player development in hockey has pushed the host to take bold moves, such as recruiting North Americans with Chinese heritage to the national program.The six-team national championships' Group A tournament in June for the first time included an extra team from Beijing consisting of several foreign-born players of Chinese ancestry.The Sun Devils, who compete in Div 1 of the NCAA, are happy to play a role in the sport's potential rise in the world most populous country."I think the more presence North American hockey can have over here, the quicker hockey will grow here. It helps a lot," Arizona head coach Greg Powers said following a 5-3 win over Kunlun Red Star in the league opener on Friday."The NHL is building a stronger presence here and a lot of North American coaches have come to help. Seeing such high level hockey from countries all over the world will make the game explode here."The Sun Devils appearance in the Chinese league marks the first visit by an NCAA Div I hockey team since 1985.Elevated to D1 status in 2015, ASU made it to the 16-strong US national championships for the first time last year before bowing out in the opening round. The team is counting on the Beijing tournament to facilitate a deeper run next season."This tournament is a huge advantage for us. The ability to practice and play against professionals should really benefit us when our regular season starts," said Powers.ASU freshman Peter Zhong had the opportunity to don the Devils' maroon and gold for the first time against Red Star at the rink 10 minutes from where he grew up.Born and raised in the Chinese capital, Zhong is one of just three NCAA D1 players from China. The other two are Song Andong, who was drafted 172nd by the NHL's New York Islanders in 2015 and now plays for Cornell University, and Chen Zimeng, Song's U18 national teammate and a freshman with Alabama-Huntsville."I started out pretty nervous," said Zhong, 21, who developed his game in Chicago's junior program. "The competitive atmosphere was so intense, but I enjoyed it a lot."The pace and speed of professional hockey is tough, but I am keen on growing my game through the collegiate system in the US to hopefully suit up for China at the 2022 Olympics."
