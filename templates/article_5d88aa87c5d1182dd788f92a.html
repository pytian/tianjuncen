                Dedicated to discovering China's landmarks
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1957, 20-year-old Li Boqian, a sophomore undergraduate at the school of history at Peking University, had to choose a specific direction for his studies. Hearing that archaeologists have the chance to travel a lot, Li thought it would be fun to pick that subject.Yet, he did not expect to be glued to it for a lifetime."It became my destiny," the 82-year-old tells China Daily. "Much emphasis was placed on archaeology even in those earliest years of New China when the country was still enduring tough times. Because of that, everyone (in archaeological circles) was eager to make a contribution using the knowledge they had gained at university."Halted by the civil war, Chinese archaeology resumed shortly after the founding of New China in 1949. The first archaeological research institution of New China was founded in Beijing in 1950. It also organized the young country's first archaeological dig, which was took place in Huixian county, Central China's Henan province."It just took around 10 people — that was how everything got started," Li recalls. "We were so lucky to become the first group of professionally-trained archaeologists in New China."In 1952, Peking University became the first Chinese educational institution to nurture archaeology majors.Born in Henan province, long considered the cradle of early Chinese civilization, Li seemed to develop a natural ability and a special emotional attachment toward research. Nevertheless, even as a veteran archaeology professor at Peking University who lead numerous key excavations around the country over the decades, Li knows that fieldwork cannot rely solely on enthusiasm."Archaeology needs lasting devotion and the patience to work in tough conditions," he smiles. "If someone wants to make a fortune, they would be wise to choose another career."Over the years, the team continued built up their experience — and muscles — as they tried to keep up pace with the country's rapid economic development.Chen Xingcan, head of Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, cites that majors in archaeology and cultural heritage conservation are now offered by over 100 Chinese universities. Currently, more than 60 institutions and 2,000 individuals in China hold licenses to lead up archaeological excavations."Large-scale urbanization and the construction of infrastructure from the 1990s presented new challenges in terms of the conservation of heritage sites," Chen says. "The need for archaeological research skyrocketed, and brought us many new opportunities."China's cultural relic protection laws demand that archaeological investigation must be undertaken before construction can begin on any major new infrastructure project.During the early 1980s, about 100 ongoing archaeological surveys were undertaken every year, and this number has risen to nearly 1,000 now, according to Wang Wei, director of the Society of Chinese Archaeology."In the past, archaeologists used to rely on luck to a certain extent," Li adds. "However, as a more comprehensive approach to archaeological research has developed in recent years, our aim now is to discover how China came into existence, and where the origins of our civilization lie."

                Lebanon takes steps to promote Chinese-Lebanese tourism ties to new height: minister
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIRUT-- Lebanese Tourism Minister Avedis Guidanian said on Wednesday that Lebanon is taking efforts to promote the Chinese-Lebanese tourism ties to a new height."One of the best implemented achievements to date which will attract more Chinese tourists to Lebanon is their exemption from long procedures to receive a visa and from paying fees to enter our country. All they need to have is a roundtrip ticket and a hotel reservation," Guidanian told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.Guidanian visited China by the end of August where he met with Chinese Minister of Culture and Tourism Luo Shugang and the two sides agreed on reactivating previously signed cooperation agreements.Guidanian also agreed with Luo to encourage Lebanese travel agents to take part in tourism exhibitions in China in order to introduce Lebanon and its attractions, and to organize meetings among travel agents between the two sides to boost tourism exchange.Guidanian said that the number of Chinese tourists in Lebanon has reached 9,450 in 2018."We have an increase by 22 percent in the number of Chinese tourists in the first eight months of 2019 compared with the same period in 2018 so my expectation is that we will reach around 12,500 Chinese tourists by the end of this year," he said.The minister said that the Chinese are showing increased interest in Lebanon because of the country's cultural diversity, cuisine and tourism professionalism."We have great touristic places that are internationally renowned such as Baalbek, Byblos, Anjar in addition to Islamic and Christian religious tourist sites and the nightlife and freedom that people can find in the country," he said, adding that shopping for luxurious brands in Lebanon competes with markets in Europe and other places.Meanwhile, Guidanian pointed out that the Chinese usually find difficulty in coming to Lebanon due to the long flight hours."This can be solved by encouraging Chinese to visit Lebanon while they are visiting other countries in the region such as Turkey, Egypt, Emirates or Qatar," he said.Guidanian added that the Lebanese government is currently working on a plan to improve the public transport system to facilitate the transportation of tourists at low cost. He also noted that the airport's expansion will be completed soon to host a higher number of passengers.

                China story: 70 years of success
            </a>
            <p>
                In 1949 the People’s Republic of China (PRC) was established and within few decades became the world’s second-largest economy. The remarkable success achieved economically, technologically and scientifically is worthy of consideration by other countries, especially developing nations.After the founding of PRC, the new state faced considerable problems, which needed immediate attention. The Asian nation, ravaged by war with Japan during the WWII, was poor and its huge population compared with the gross output was weak. The country’s policies centered then on self-sufficiency relying on agriculture, but that was not enough to build a robust economy.In 1978, China ushered in a new era of modernization and industrialization adopting a policy based on comprehensive reforms and opening-up to the world. The chief architect of modern China, Deng Xiaoping, who held office as head of state and general secretary of the Communist Party, drew up a strategy dealing with four sectors, namely agriculture, industry, science and technology, and the military. Being aware of importance of education in his long-term plans, he also sent thousands of Chinese abroad to study and contribute to building and modernizing the country.Deng is seen as inspiring leader by those who succeeded him and took his approach to put China at forefront of the world’s major industrial economies.Now President Xi Jinping is carrying out the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to serve the whole world.BRI, which revives the old Silk Route, provides a lot of opportunities in areas of trade, investment, and employment. With principles of mutual cooperation and benefits, 68 countries have already signed the BRI agreement and this number is expected to increase in the future.While staying in China for 10 months to take part in a program, hosted by International Press Communication Centre, affiliated to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, I witnessed a lot of striking signs of enormous progress in this country. I saw how Chinese people use high-quality technology in all spheres of life. I could buy anything and everything using mobile apps. The Beijing subway with more than 20 lines links almost all parts of the city. Through my visits to factories and industrial zones, I realized how China was reaping the benefits of reform and opening-up which have uplifted the state to prosperity.The country’s huge GDP is a major factor that has helped the world’s most populous country make major strides in economic growth and in different fields.According to official figures, China's GDP stood at 90 trillion yuan ($13 trillion) in 2018, nearly 20 percent of the world economy.With China pressing ahead with development projects across the country, the nation has maintained a steady annual growth rate of more than 6 percent over the last two decades.Although the US launched a trade war against China in the middle of last year, China’s economic growth amounted to 6.3 percent, in the first half of 2019, the highest rate in the world, according to the National Bureau of statistics of China.China did not achieve so much progress through luck. The goals were determined and the successive governments worked to achieve those goals.And people rose to the challenge and through sheer ingenuity, hard work and perseverance made sure that China achieved its rightful place in the world.It’s time other nations followed China’s example.The author is the head of the foreign affairs department at Al-Gomhuria newspaper in Egypt.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.
