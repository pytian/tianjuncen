                Berlin Zoo's panda pregnant, birth expected soon
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                BERLIN — Berlin's zoo is hoping to hear the patter of tiny panda paws soon.The zoo on Tuesday released a few seconds of footage from an ultrasound scan of 6-year-old panda Meng Meng, which it said shows "a mini-panda with its heart beating fast".It said that the birth isn't far off, but didn't specify when.Meng Meng mated for the first time with 9-year-old partner Jiao Qing in April, and was also artificially inseminated to increase the likelihood of pregnancy. Experts working with the zoo said in mid-August that they were about 85% sure Meng Meng was expecting. Panda pregnancies typically last four to six months.The zoo said keepers used a few pieces of apple, panda cookies and honey water to persuade Meng Meng to lie on her back for a few minutes Tuesday for the scan. It said that pandas typically deliver one, two or occasionally even three cubs, and although only one was discovered during the scan it's still possible that there are more.AP

                    Shanghai zoo opens for nighttime visitors
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Tottering cub lions, sleeping tigers and Hamadryas Baboons hanging on the trees wowed visitors during the trial nighttime operation of Shanghai Wild Animal Park on Thursday.Until Oct 15, the zoo has pushed back its closing time from 5 pm to 9 pm. Nighttime ticket sales start at 3 pm. More than 100 species and nearly 5,000 animals can be seen at night.Located in Pudong New Area, the Shanghai Wild Animal Park features more than 200 rare animal species from around the world. Two main sections - the pedestrian zone and water adventure facility - are available for night visitors while the drive-through area will be closed for safety reasons."Night zoos have operated in Singapore and Thailand, but this is the first one in our country. It helps to boost Shanghai's nighttime economy and provides an alternative for visitors at night," said Zhong Yi, deputy general manager of Shanghai Wild Animal Park.Since some animals sleep during the day and forage at night, the night zoo allows visitors to have a comprehensive understanding of the wild animals and to enhance the awareness of animal protection, according to Li Qingwen, representative of the China Wildlife Conservation Association.Ensuring that the living habits of animals are not being interrupted is the top concern for park management.According to park authorities, experts and professionals evaluated the night zoo project and believed that the current operation could guarantee the health and safety of animals. The park also selected suitable animals for display. For example, they only picked seven out of nine species from the monkey section as they are more active during night. Also, the giant panda exhibition area will not open at night."We have adjusted the light system for the night zoo, with brighter lighting on the roads, water areas, and toilets to secure visitors' safety while using diffuse lights to simulate a natural moonlight effect in the animals' living areas," Zhong added."I came to the night zoo because of curiosity about the animals' behavior during the nighttime," said Liu Yufei, a 20-year-old student who visited the night zoo on opening day."Since I have class in the daytime, the night zoo provides me a new way to spend the night. There are also fewer tourists at night, and the summer weather is comfortable," Liu said."But the transportation is an issue," she added.The night zoo opened six animal-themed exhibition areas, three featured performances, animal-themed restaurants, and souvenirs stores.It also launched the "Night Animal Tour" and animal shows at Sea Lion Theater and International Circus Theater.Zhang Caiyun, another tourist who brought her 6-year-old son to the zoo, said: "the colorful lights and the animal tour are more attractive than the daytime activities and I don't have to worry about my son getting sunburned at night.""The closing of the drive-through area is the only regret. It will be a unique experience to visit rare animals through the dark by tour bus," Zhang said.Having prepared for about three years for the night project, the park will evaluate its operation to adjust the layout of the animals, types of exhibitions, and the night facilities after operating for a while, according to park authorities.On the same day that the zoo opened, the city also issued a list of cultural and tourist sites that are opening at night. More than 100 spots were listed, according to Shanghai Municipal Administration of Culture and Tourism.It included major tourist attractions, art galleries, museums, amusement parks, and traditional scenic spots that cover 16 districts of the city.

                    Hong Kong youths get chance to learn culture on tour of Sichuan

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                More than 700 young people from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region started a six-day tour on Thursday in Chengdu, Sichuan province, to learn about the province's culture and the recent developments of the mainland.The activity was organized by New Home Association, a Hong Kong charity that has brought approximately 9,000 people from Hong Kong, especially youngsters, to visit cities on the mainland since 2015.On Thursday morning, the group visited the Dujiangyan Panda Park and witnessed the naming ceremony of a pair of newborn twin pandas."The twin panda cubs were born this year, and they represent new birth and hope. They are full of vigor and vitality just like the young people here," Zhang Zhizhong, Party chief of China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda, said at the ceremony.The twins were named "Sihai" and "Yijia". Combining the two names creates a Chinese idiom, meaning "we are a family", symbolizing the continuation of the friendship between Sichuan and Hong Kong.Xu Rongmao, chairman of the board of the New Home Association and chairman of Hong Kong Shimao Group, a property developer, said: "Young people of Hong Kong can feel the prosperity of the motherland, improve exchanges with mainland people and further promote cooperation."Junie Li Jun-ying, a 19-year-old student with the Caritas Institute of Higher Education in Hong Kong, said: "What impressed me is that the center has more pandas than Hong Kong."Li said that she was looking forward to visiting the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's former residence in Guang'an, Sichuan.Many old people in Hong Kong respect Deng and put up his photo in their homes, she said.She studied Chinese in primary and high schools and knew of the late leader, a native of Sichuan who contributed greatly to China's reform and opening-up.

                BERLIN — The six-year-old giant panda Meng Meng, sent by China to Germany in 2017 together with male panda Jiao Qing, gave birth to twin panda cubs, the first-ever panda cubs born in Germany, Zoo Berlin announced Monday morning.According to a press statement issued by Zoo Berlin, the first panda cub was born on 31 August at 6:54 pm (GMT 0454) following a gestation period of 147 days. Less than An hour later, the second cub was born. The cubs weigh 186 and 136 grams respectively, and seemed lively and alert. Their genders have yet to be determined."Meng Meng became a mom-twice! We are so happy, we are speechless," Zoo Berlin tweeted on Monday morning.The panda couple mated in April and later artificial insemination was also performed on Meng Meng to boost the likelihood of pregnancy, revealed by Zoo Berlin earlier in August.Immediately after giving birth, the new mother knew just what to do: she placed the tiny creature gently on her belly and began to warm it lovingly with her big paws and breath, and the soft fur of her cheeks, according to the press release."Even though these are the first offspring born to our young female panda, she is already doing a wonderful job as a mom. In the beginning, the cubs have to be fed roughly every two to three hours and are dependent on the body heat of their mother to keep warm," said Andreas Knieriem, director of Zoo Berlin.As pandas that give birth to twins usually only raise one of the cubs, Zoo Berlin has decided to actively support Meng Meng in the rearing process in close cooperation with Chinese experts from the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding."What fantastic news! The whole of Berlin is delighted about the new arrivals," Berlin's mayor Michael Mueller was quoted in the press statement as saying.Meng Meng and the cubs will be temporarily out of sight for visitors until further notice.

                Meng Meng, a 6-year-old female panda loaned to Zoo Berlin in Germany from the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in Southwest China's Sichuan province, gave birth to twins on Sunday Beijing time, according to the base.On June 24, 2017, Meng Meng left the base for Germany with Jiao Qing, then a 7-year-old male panda, to join in a Sino-German panda research program which would last for 15 years.Meng Meng became ruttish in late March and two panda experts from Chengdu were sent to Zoo Berlin immediately.Chinese and German experts tried in vain seven times to help Meng Meng naturally mate with Jiao Qing from April 5 to 6 because the male panda was not very interested, the Chengdu base said.As an alternative, experts from the Chengdu base used artificial insemination with Meng Meng, and it worked, resulting in pregnancy.Immediately after giving birth, the new mother knew what to do. It placed a tiny cub gently on its belly and began to warm it lovingly with its big paws and breath as well as the soft fur of its cheeks, according to a press release from Zoo Berlin.Even though these are the first offspring born to our young female panda, it is already doing a wonderful job as a mom, said Zoo Berlin director Andreas Knieriem.

Immediately after giving birth, the new mother knew just what to do. She placed the tiny creature gently on her belly and began to warm it with her big paws and breath, and the soft fur of her cheeks, according to the press release. "Even though these are the first offspring born to our young female panda, she is already doing a wonderful job as a mom. In the beginning, the cubs have to be fed roughly every two to three hours and are dependent on the body heat of their mother to keep warm," said Andreas Knieriem, director of Zoo Berlin. The team at the zoo, together with experts from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research as well as panda experts from China, have been monitoring the giant panda mother around the clock. The cubs were taking turns with their mother in a pattern of about two to three hours with her and were otherwise cared for in a warm incubator by the Chinese breeding experts. As pandas that give birth to twins usually only raise one of the cubs, Zoo Berlin has decided to support Meng Meng in the rearing process in close cooperation with Chinese experts from the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. In the past, breeding attempts with other giant pandas in Berlin had not been successful, making the twins born at the weekend a first. "What fantastic news! The whole of Berlin is delighted about the new arrivals," Berlin Mayor Michael Mueller was quoted in the press statement as saying. Mueller welcomed the fact that Berliners would "soon be able to visit the black and white twins", which was "inconceivable without highly professional work and a lot of passion". According to Knieriem, the German zoo director, only 1,864 adult pandas remain in their natural habitat. "Every single young animal thus contributes significantly to the conservation of the entire species," he said. Meng Meng and her cubs will be temporarily out of sight for visitors until further notice. The two adult panda bears were allowed to stay in Berlin for 15 years while the newborn cubs would also remain in Berlin for two to four years, said Knieriem. "Even in their natural habitat, young panda bears and mothers will eventually go their separate ways - pandas are loners," he said. "That would also be the time when the offspring would probably move to China." Xinhua (China Daily 09/07/2019 page14)
