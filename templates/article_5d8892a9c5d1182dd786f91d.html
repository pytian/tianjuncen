            <p>
                There was widespread panic in New York City's Times Square Tuesday night when crowds mistook a motorcycle backfire for gunshots.Thousands of tourists and residents fled to nearby buildings and getting separated from friends and family members, according to the New York Police Department.Nine people were hurt, and seven were taken to area hospitals with non-life threatening injuries, a spokesman of the Fire Department of New York said.

                NYC officer in chokehold death of black man won't be charged
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW YORK - The New York City police officer who caused the chokehold death of an unarmed black man during an attempted arrest in 2014 will not face criminal charges, federal prosecutors said here on Tuesday.Richard Donoghue, US Attorney of the Eastern District of New York, said there was insufficient evidence that officer Daniel Pantaleo broke the law or violated the civil rights of Eric Garner, who was selling cigarettes illegally outside a convenience store in the borough of Staten Island before his death on July 17 five years ago."Even if we could prove that Officer Pantaleo's hold of Mr. Garner constituted unreasonable force, we would still have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Officer Pantaleo acted willfully in violation of the law," he said.The decision was made by US Attorney General William Barr, who sided with federal prosecutors in New York instead of civil rights prosecutors in Washington, media reports cited a senior Justice Department official as saying.After a grand jury ruled in 2014 not to indict Pantaleo, the case was raised to the Department of Justice (DOJ) and was ended one day before its five-year anniversary.A video clip of the incident shows Garner, who refused to be handcuffed by the police, crying out "I can't breathe" at least 11 times when the officer put him in a chokehold before he eventually lost consciousness.The widely-circulated video catalyzed a nationwide Black Lives Matter movement at a time when a number of African Americans died during their encounter with police."We all saw the same devastating video 5 years ago. Our eyes did not lie," New York Attorney General Letitia James said on Twitter after the announcement of the decision."We'll continue to fight to reform a criminal justice system that remains broken," she continued.Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, said at a press conference Tuesday that the DOJ "has failed us" and her family are "not going away.""That officer, Officer Pantaleo, and all the officers who was involved in my son's death that day, need to be off the force," said Carr."I stood quietly by for five years; I'm not being quiet anymore," she added.

                The Commissioner's Office sternly criticizes US Congressman's false remarks
            </a>
            <p>
                The spokesperson of the Office of the Commissioner of China's Foreign Ministry in the HKSAR deplores and firmly opposes the false remarks by Eliot L. Engel, Chairman of the US House Committee on Foreign Affairs, that he was "deeply concerned by the reports of police brutality in response to peaceful protests in Hong Kong" and that "allegations of police violence over the past weeks have tarnished Hong Kong's international reputation for good governance and the fair administration of justice".The spokesperson stated that since the return of Hong Kong, the Central Government has been committed to the principles of "One Country, Two Systems", "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy in the HKSAR in strict accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law. As a result, the city has maintained prosperity and stability, and its people enjoy unprecedentedly extensive rights and freedoms. Hong Kong ranked the 16th for its rule of law performance in 2018 - higher than that of the US, by the way - while it ranked below 60th in 1996. These are undeniable facts. So what right do American politicians have to criticize human rights, freedoms and the rule of law of Hong Kong? They have never spoken out against the absence of human rights and freedoms in the city during the colonial period, nor showed concern about the status and situation of Hong Kong people back then. Now they are pointing fingers at the city that enjoys unprecedented rights and freedoms, and alleging that the Chinese Government continues to chip away at its freedoms and rights. Isn't this bare-faced lying and typical double standard?The spokesperson said that the rule of law is a core value of Hong Kong society and a cornerstone of its success. It is widely recognized that the SAR Government has been committed to law-based governance since the return of Hong Kong and that the rule of law here continues to improve. By proposing to amend the ordinances in accordance with law, the SAR Government aims to plug the loophole in the existing legal system and uphold social justice. The legislative procedure proceeded in accordance with law, and the amendments are in line with international law and common practices. It is, therefore, a just and reasonable effort that champions and helps improve the rule of law. When controversy arose, the SAR Government announced suspending the legislative exercise so as to listen more extensively to various sectors of society and restore calm and reason to society, which reflects how much it respects public opinion and commits itself to law-based governance.The spokesperson pointed out that violence is violence, and cannot be justified by any demands. Some radicals in Hong Kong have run amok, who flagrantly stormed and vandalized LegCo, assaulted and even brutally bit off a finger of a police officer, stormed institutions of the Central Government in Hong Kong and defaced the national emblem. Such astonishing violent and illegal acts seriously trample upon the rule of law in Hong Kong, gravely undermine public order and security, and openly challenge the red line of "One Country, Two Systems". The facts are crystal clear and backed by solid evidence. Instead of admitting that some protesters are indeed radical, however, some American politicians and individual media insist that the protests were peaceful, accuse the Hong Kong police of brutality, and call on the SAR Government to uphold its commitment. Isn't this mudslinging against their own conscience?The spokesperson said that anyone without bias would acknowledge that the Hong Kong police have exercised great restraint and showed admiring professionalism in dealing with violence and deliberate provocation by rioters. Over the past few days, some citizens in New York poured water on NYPD officers, which was condemned at all levels from the president to the mayor and to the police as "completely unacceptable". So why do some Americans once and again connive at the extreme violent and anti-law acts by radicals in Hong Kong to storm and vandalize LegCo, assault the police and bite off an officer's finger, storm Central Government institutions and deface the national emblem?The spokesperson emphasized that the Central Government firmly supports Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the SAR Government in law-based governance, and the Hong Kong police in fulfilling their duties to protect public order and security in accordance with law. It firmly opposes any attempts by foreign governments, organizations or individuals to interfere in Hong Kong affairs and undermine the city's prosperity and stability. We again urge some foreign politicians to immediately stop sending out wrong signals on violent illegal acts, immediately stop saying or doing anything that smears "One Country, Two Systems" and undermines Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China's domestic affairs as a whole.

                One dead, 11 injured in NYC shooting
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW YORK - One person is dead and 11 others injured in a shooting in the New York City borough of Brooklyn on Saturday night, according to the New York Police Department (NYPD).The incident took place during a large outdoor event at a local park at around 11 pm (0300 GMT on Sunday).A 38-year-old man died upon arrival at hospital while several others remained in critical condition, an NYPD spokesman was cited by the local media as saying early Sunday.No arrest has been made by police.According to NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill, there were around 2,000 to 3,000 people attending the annual Old Timers Event when the shooting occurred.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Sunday that the shooting "shattered a peaceful neighborhood event.""We will do everything in our power to keep this community safe and get guns off our streets," he tweeted.The United States has one of the highest gun-related death tolls in the world due to lax gun control laws, according to a study released in August last year by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.

                Trump signs Sept 11 victims' compensation fund extension
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON — US President Donald Trump on Monday signed a bill ensuring that a victims' compensation fund helping those impacted by the Sept 11, 2001 attacks never runs out of money, ending years of legislative gridlock as the number of first responders dying of Ground Zero-related illnesses mounted.Appearing in the Rose Garden with more than 60 first responders from the 2001 terrorist attacks, Trump signed into law an extension of the fund through 2092, essentially making it permanent."You inspire all of humanity," Trump said of the "true American warriors" who rushed to assist victims that day and searched for remains for months after.The president said that the nation has a "sacred obligation" to care for the responders and their families.The $7.4 billion fund had been rapidly depleting, and administrators recently cut benefit payments by up to 70%. The bill passed Congress on a bipartisan basis but only after delays by some Republicans exposed the legislative branch to brutal criticism from activists, including the comedian Jon Stewart.Dozens of first responders, many gravely ill, would repeatedly travel to Washington to lobby lawmakers to extend the funding every time it needed to be reauthorized. Though their ranks shrunk, as emergency workers died of cancers and other diseases linked to the toxic fumes from the World Trade Center rubble, the fate of the funding had never been permanently guaranteed.NYPD detective Luis Alvarez appeared gaunt and ill when he testified before Congress last month, urging lawmakers to pass the measure to help his fellow first responders even if it was too late for him."You made me come down here the day before my 69th round of chemo and I'm going to make sure that you never forget to take care of the 9/11 first responders," Alvarez said.He died two weeks later.More than 40,000 people have applied to the fund, which covers illnesses potentially related to being at the World Trade Center site, the Pentagon or Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after the attacks. Stewart, who made the cause a personal passion project, tore into the lawmakers' inaction when he testified alongside Alvarez, creating a moment that was frequently replayed on cable news."Hundreds died in an instant. Thousands more poured in to continue to fight for their brothers and sisters," Stewart said before the committee. "They did their jobs with courage, grace, tenacity, humility. Eighteen years later, do yours."A pair of Republican senators, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, voted against the measure this month, preventing its adoption from being unanimous. Both cited the need to eliminate unnecessary spending and offset the measure with budget cuts.Trump did not dwell on that division when he signed the bill. The bill-signing prompted a round of applause from first responders in the Rose Garden as well as Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who was mayor of New York City during the attacks and was widely praised for his leadership in the aftermath of the World Trade Center collapse.Trump, whose real estate holdings that day included some 20 buildings in Manhattan, played up his own personal connection on Monday to the World Trade Center site."I was down there also, but I'm not considering myself a first responder," the president said.But a number of the president's recollections about his own personal experiences that day cannot be verified, including his claims that he sent construction crews to help clear the site, that he had "hundreds" of friends die at Ground Zero and that he witnessed television coverage of Muslims in the United States cheering the destruction of the iconic skyscrapers.The ceremony was attended by a handful of lawmakers — all Republican — though a White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity to share planning details, said that all members of Congress had been invited to the event. The invitations went out Friday and Saturday.AP

                Some frown on technology that IDs faces
            </a>
            <p>
                More police departments in the US are using facial recognition, raising accuracy concernsPolice departments in the US are increasingly using facial recognition technology to catch criminals, but the software has come under fire by experts who say it has a relatively low success rate, is prone to racial and gender bias and could lead to wrongful arrests.There are no official numbers on how many local, state and federal authorities are using facial recognition technology, but at least 50 across the country, including the FBI — which has a database of 36.4 million photos — and the New York Police Department, the nation's largest, have used or are using facial recognition in some way, according to the Center on Privacy and Technology (CPT) at Georgetown Law School.In cases where police may have few leads and only a blurry photo of a suspect, they will feed an algorithm or facial recognition database sketches — or even pictures of celebrities — who resemble the criminal."The stakes are too high in criminal investigations to rely on unreliable — or wrong — inputs" the authors of the CPT report said. "It is one thing for a company to build a face recognition system designed to help individuals find their celebrity doppelganger … it's quite another to use these techniques to identify criminal suspects."Immigration and Customs Enforcement was criticized by Congress members in July for using facial recognition to analyze millions of motorists' photos without their knowledge.Norman Sadeh, a professor and expert in cybersecurity and online privacy at the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, told China Daily: "There are expectations of privacy that people have and that are supposed to be respected. … If you see a camera, you have no way of knowing what this camera is doing."Facial recognition technology works by matching live images of people walking past cameras against a list of persons of interest often compiled by police. The cameras scan the unique points of a face to create an identifiable biometric map that is as individual as a fingerprint.Nathan Sheard, a grassroots advocacy organizer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit defending digital privacy, free speech and innovation, told China Daily: "Face recognition technology is a particularly pernicious form of surveillance, given its disparate propensity to misidentify women and people of color."A 2012 study that used a collection of mug shots from Pinellas County, Florida, to test the algorithms of three commercial vendors uncovered evidence of racial disparities, according to theatlantic.com. The study, co-authored by a senior FBI technologist, found that all three algorithms performed 5-10 percent worse on African Americans than on Caucasians.One of the most-popular types of facial recognition software used by police is Amazon's Rekognition. The sheriff's office in Hillsboro, Oregon, was the first in the country to use it.When the ACLU ran its own test of Rekognition to check its accuracy by comparing members of Congress to 25,000 photos of criminals, it incorrectly matched 28 lawmakers with people who had criminal records.A study published by the MIT Media Lab in January found that Rekognition made more mistakes differentiating between men and women, according to theguardian.com. It also erroneously identified women as men 19 percent of the time.Axon, the largest manufacturer of police body cameras in the US, has rejected selling facial recognition technology over accuracy concerns. Clients of the Scottsdale, Arizona-based company include 48 of 79 major city law enforcement agencies in America.San Francisco this year became the first city to ban use of facial technology, followed by Somerville, Massachusetts, and then Oakland, California, which banned it in public spaces.The technology has its defenders, including New York City Police Commissioner James O'Neill. The NYPD has used the technology since 2011.In "How Facial Recognition Makes You Safer'', an opinion article published in The New York Times on June 18, O'Neill said that in 2018, detectives made 7,024 requests to the department's facial identification section, and in 1,851 cases, possible matches were returned, leading to 998 arrests.He also noted that the software has helped clear suspects."It would be an injustice to the people we serve if we policed our 21st century city without using 21st century technology,'' O'Neill wrote.

                New York City police say subway scare suspect arrested
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW YORK -- The man who left suspicious items inside a subway station in Lower Manhattan in the early morning of Friday has been apprehended, Dermot Shea, chief of detectives with New York Police Department (NYPD), said on Saturday.Investigation of the case continues, said Shea. He released images of the individual on Friday and sought people's tips to locate the man.The unidentified man left two pressure cookers within Fulton Street subway station which is close to the World Trade Center.The suspicious and unattended items caused scare and an evacuation of the station. However, the city's bomb squad later found no explosives within the cookers.Another suspicious package was also found Friday morning next to a garbage can at the Chelsea neighborhood, around 3 km north of the Fulton Street station.It took officers around half an hour to determine that the package was safe. It is not clear whether the two incidents are connected.NYPD has not revealed the man's motivation in placing pressure cookers in the subway station.Pressure cookers have been used to contain explosives in several fatal domestic terror plots in earlier years.In September 2016, a pressure cooker bomb detonated in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, injuring dozens.

                86 protesters detained over weekend violence
            </a>
            <p>
                Attacks with metal bars, Molotov cocktails leave 21 police officers severely bruised A total of 21 police officers were injured in the attack by violent protesters in Hong Kong, while 86 protesters were detained during the weekend, the Hong Kong police said on Monday. Kong Wing-cheung, senior superintendent of police, told a news conference in Hong Kong that 16 police officers were injured on Sunday and five on Saturday. Kong said Sunday's protests took place in Tsuen Wan and neighboring areas. Some of the violent protesters deviated from their original route, obstructed roads, vandalized shops and facilities, and attacked officers, Xinhua reported. The protesters, wearing hats and protective gear, and armed with metal bars, indulged in violence in the afternoon and evening. Attacks with bricks and metal bars left the police officers badly bruised, with many of them bleeding, Kong said. "The protesters disregarded law and order. Police severely condemn such violence, which has overstepped the bottom line of a civilized society," the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region said in a statement issued earlier on Monday. Violence during the protests escalated over the weekend "as protesters hurled Molotov cocktails at the security officers who responded with water cannon and tear gas," Reuters reported on Sunday. When the Hong Kong police used warning flags, and then tear gas, to disperse the crowd, the protesters threw "bricks and gasoline bombs" toward them, the Associated Press reported. Analysts and veteran police officers said the countermeasures taken by the Hong Kong police, including the use of water cannon, are necessary given the seriousness of the situation on Sunday. They said such measures have been adopted in many countries, including the United States and France, which recently witnessed violent protests. Hugh H. Mo, a former deputy police commissioner of New York City Police Department, said the police should never be treated as enemies, and the situation in Hong Kong is peculiar for police forces when friendly relations between the police and civilians seem to be under stress. "Here, in New York (city), the right to protest is respected as long as it is carried out in line with laws, but once you don't cooperate with the police in demonstrations, you are taking the risk of committing crimes and being punished by law," Mo told Xinhua on Aug 20. "Whenever you see an NYPD vehicle on the street, you can't fail to see the three words on its body - Courtesy, Professionalism, and Respect - which serve as a reminder for both the police and the public to respect each other, and defend the dignity of law," he said. In March, French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to crack down on troublemakers who "want to destroy the republic at the risk of killing people" after yellow vest protesters set life-threatening fires, smashed up luxury stores and clashed with the police. On Saturday, the French police fired tear gas, water cannon and dispersion grenades at a crowd of about 400 anti-capitalism demonstrators, and the authorities detained 68 people taking part in the protest in the town of Bayonne near the venue of the G7 Summit, AP reported. A few protesters threw rocks at the police, and the police responded with warning shots and then water cannon. The regional administration says those detained are accused of throwing projectiles, concealing faces or possessing objects that could be used as weapons, AP said.
