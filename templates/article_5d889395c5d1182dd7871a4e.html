                Japan's Abe hopes reaching win-win trade deal with US
            </p>
            <p>
                TOKYO -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday that he hopes to reach a trade deal with the United States at an early juncture that would benefit both countries."It depends on future negotiations when we can reach a final agreement, so I can't say when now," the Japanese premier said."That said, there is no change in our stance that we will aim to achieve a win-win outcome at an early stage," Abe said at a press conference in Nagasaki, southwestern Japan.As trade talks between both countries gather momentum, working-level talks are slated to be held next week in Washington ahead of the next round of ministerial negotiations later this month.The ministerial meetings will be held between Japanese Economic Revitalization Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.Washington has voiced its concern about the significant trade deficit the US has with Japan, with US President Donald Trump looking to a new bilateral deal to address the trade imbalance.Both parties have been eyeing September as the date to reach a deal, although for Japan's part, concerns remain about the hefty concessions it may have to make regarding its highly sensitive and protected agricultural products as well as its auto sector.The US, however, may reach some kind of compromise with Japan, Motegi indicated after the previous round of ministerial talks with Lighthizer in early August.

                Russian restaurant owner driven by passion
            </a>
            <p>
                Architect set up venue in Harbin 19 years ago and is carving out a career in writing.Strolling down the century-old Central Pedestrian Street in Harbin, tourists cannot miss the Russian restaurant or the remarkable story of its owner.For Hu Hong and his 19-year-old Russia Coffee & Food, busy season comes every winter as the "ice city" in China's northernmost Heilongjiang province sees more visitors.Food lovers come and go, rarely realizing that the Russian meat pies, accordion music and art at the restaurant all come from Hu.Tens of thousands of Russians came to Harbin at the turn of the 20th century when construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway was underway. Missing a taste of their homeland, many opened Russian restaurants.Born to a Russian mother in a Chinese-Russian marriage, Hu, 68, grew up immersed in Russian cuisine, music and architecture. He still remembers the taste of the Russian food his mother and grandmother cooked for him when he was a child.A carpenter in his teens, Hu came to the fore with a talent for architecture after he finished middle school and built farmhouses with his peers in Heilongjiang's Baoqing county in 1968.In 1988, Hu left Harbin for Japan, working as an architect. He set up his own architecture and design firm in Tokyo, with his designs appearing in Kobe, Nagasaki, Yokohama and Fukuoka.He returned 12 years later and opened the restaurant on the 1,400-meter-long street. The reason was not only to beat his homesickness but to restore Russian culture and lifestyle to the city."I did the interior design myself, from tables and chairs to wood carvings on the ceiling," Hu said. "Construction work took four years based on more than 2,000 design drawings."In addition to the oil paintings, photos, furniture and other decorations, he set the menu, with every recipe carefully considered.In 2007, Russia Coffee & Food was rated as one of the 50 best restaurants in China by National Geographic magazine, Hu said.Hu loves writing about the city and has finished several novels. He published his first book in 2016 and is now working on a new novel that depicts the lives of early Russian settlers in Harbin."I visited Russia several times in recent years, mainly in search of inspiration for my story," he said.His friends are always curious about his job labels: chef, musician, writer and architect. Which one does he value most?"They are all me," Hu replied.When the restaurant is not busy, he usually reads books in the morning and spends an hour playing the accordion. Hu spends three to four hours writing every day, sometimes until after midnight. He also helps children to learn Western dining etiquette on weekends.In recent years, a growing number of people like Hu have multiple professional and diversified lifestyles."I'll keep on my endeavor to build beautiful architecture, make authentic Russian food and write real stories about Harbin," he said.

                Highest-level landslide, flood alerts issued for western Japan
            </a>
            <p>
                TOKYO - Japan's weather agency on Wednesday issued its highest-level landslide and flood alerts as regions in western Japan were being pummeled by torrential rain.According to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the emergency alerts were issued for the prefectures of Fukuoka, Saga and Nagasaki prefectures in the northern Kyushu region.The JMA said it expects downpours to inundate regions covering wide swathes from western to northern parts of Japan's archipelago.The weather agency said the special warnings were issued because of a low atmospheric pressure system in the Sea of Japan moving along a northeasterly trajectory.Local police in the city of Takeo in Saga Prefecture, said a man may have been killed after being found in his vehicle after it was swept away on a road by floodwaters.In Saga and Taku cities, the weather agency said that 120 mm of rain was recorded in a one-hour period.For northern Kyushu, 200 mm of rain has been forecast by the weather agency and 180 mm in the Kanto-Koshin area, which includes Tokyo, and the Tokai region, is forecast for the 24 hours through 6 am local time on Thursday.

                Japan orders 850,000 to flee heavy rains
            </a>
            <p>
                TOKYO - Two people were confirmed dead on Wednesday as heavy rains pounded southwest Japan, prompting flood and landslide warnings and orders for 850,000 people to seek safety.Nearly 1 million more people were advised to leave their homes after the country's weather agency raised the alert to its highest level for parts of northern Kyushu Island.The emergency warning is issued "if there is a significant likelihood of catastrophes".Officials confirmed two deaths, one in western Saga prefecture where a man was found in a car that had been swept away. A second man died in Fukuoka as he tried to escape from a car trapped in rising floodwaters.Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said a third person, in Saga, was in a state of "cardiorespiratory arrest" - a term usually employed by Japanese officials to indicate a person's death before it is officially confirmed by a doctor."There are many reports of damage in different areas due to flooding of rivers, landslides, and submerged houses, and there is a possibility of serious damage occurring in the coming hours," he added.Evacuation orders and advisories issued by local authorities are not mandatory, although officials urge residents to heed them.For those leaving after such warnings, government shelters are available, and some choose to stay with friends and family as well.The fire and disaster management agency said it had already received multiple reports of flooded houses in Saga and Nagasaki prefectures."We are seeing unprecedented levels of heavy rains in cities where we issued special warnings," a spokesman for the Japan Meteorological Agency, or JMA, told reporters."It is a situation where you should do your best to protect your lives," weather agency official Yasushi Kajiwara said. He also urged those living in areas currently under evacuation advisories to act quickly.In Saga, a woman wearing a life vest in a rescue boat told public broadcaster NHK she had been saved from the floodwaters."I was so scared as I have a little child. I'm worried there could be worse damage because there's an ongoing power outage," she said.'Like a sea'Elsewhere, a man in a shelter in Saga said he was sleeping as the floodwater entered his home."When I woke up, water surged to my feet," he told NHK. "I've never seen anything like this. It's important to evacuate early."The JMA's emergency warnings affect areas in Saga, Fukuoka and Nagasaki, where the severe weather has disrupted transport, forcing the suspension of some train services and some road closures.Toyota Motor Corp said it would suspend work on Wednesday evening at a factory in Kyushu that builds Lexus cars.Television footage showed rivers swollen by the rain and parked cars sitting in muddy brown water nearly up to the vehicles' roofs.Small landslides have already been reported.At a station in Saga, stranded passengers sat on benches with water around their ankles.A woman living near an overflowing river said she had been woken by the sound of heavy rain and a warning alarm on her phone indicating a disaster alert. "This is very rare. Rice fields and other places are flooded. It's like a sea," she told NHK.Japanese authorities regularly urge people to take evacuation orders seriously, particularly after disastrous heavy rains last summer in western Japan killed more than 200 people.Many of the deaths were blamed on delayed evacuation orders and failure to follow evacuation orders. Entire neighborhoods were buried beneath landslides or submerged in floodwaters during the disasters.Agencies
