            <p class="style-content">
                Editor's note: This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.On April 22, 1958, after six years of construction, the Monument to the People's Heroes was completed on Tian'anmen Square in Beijing to commemorate the martyrs of revolutionary struggle during the 19th and 20th centuries.The monument is 37.94 meters high, covering an area of about 3,100 square meters. It contains 17,000 pieces of marble and granite.The lower plinth depicts the country's revolutionary movement－the destruction of opium at Humen in 1839, the Jintian Uprising in 1851, the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, the May 4th Movement in 1925, the Nanchang Uprising in 1927, the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45) and the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign in 1949.An item from April 6, 1982, in China Daily showed students holding a ceremony in memory of the heroes during the Tomb Sweeping Festival.It is estimated that China has about 20 million martyrs. However, only 1.93 million have been named in the government's directory, while the rest could not be identified. The number has grown by about 300 annually in recent years.In 2014, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top legislature, set Sept 30 as Martyrs' Day to honor those who sacrificed their lives for national independence and prosperity.Observers said Martyrs' Day would encourage the Chinese people to contribute to the country's renewal.Earlier this year, the Ministry of Veterans Affairs announced that China will set up dedicated cemeteries for military personnel and their relatives as a way to honor their service and enhance national identity and pride.The remains of more than 1.4 million martyrs are resting in around 4,200 protected memorials, ranging from cemeteries to columbaria, according to the ministry.

                    Michael charges into Southeast after slamming north Florida
                </p>

                PANAMA CITY, Fla. — The most powerful hurricane on record to hit Florida's Panhandle left wide destruction and at least two people dead and wasn't nearly finished Thursday as it crossed Georgia, now as a tropical storm, toward the Carolinas, that are still reeling from epic flooding by Hurricane Florence.A day after the supercharged storm crashed ashore amid white sand beaches, fishing towns and military bases, Michael was no longer a Category 4 monster packing 155 mph (250 kph) winds. As the tropical storm continued to weaken it was still menacing the Southeast with heavy rains, blustery winds and possible spinoff tornadoes.Authorities said at least two people have died, a man killed by a tree falling on a Panhandle home and according to WMAZ-TV, an 11-year-old girl was also killed by a tree falling on a home in southwest Georgia. Search and rescue crews were expected to escalate efforts to reach hardest-hit areas and check for anyone trapped or injured in the storm debris.The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the eye of Michael was about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Macon in central Georgia at 2:00 am Thursday. The storm had top sustained winds of 60 mph (96 kph) and was moving to the northeast at 20 mph (32 kph).After daylight Thursday residents of north Florida would just be beginning to take stock of the enormity of the disaster.

                The stories behind three of the foreigners who were conferred the Shanghai Magnolia Silver Award this year.Editor's note: Named after the city flower, the Shanghai Magnolia Award ranks among the highest honors a foreigner can receive for his or her outstanding contributions to the city's economic and cultural industries. This prestigious award has three levels - Silver, Gold and the Honorary Citizen of Shanghai title. Only those who have won a silver are eligible for the gold, and an individual must have won both these titles before being nominated for the honorary citizen accolade. Fifty foreigners from 19 countries were conferred this year's Magnolia Silver Award during a ceremony held on Sept 12. The winners of this year's award, all of whom have spent several years working in the city, come from a wide range of industries, including economy, trade, finance, science and technology, education and health. China Daily talks to three of them.A Spaniard's quest for excellence in a city that embodies it When Juan Carlos Diaz Vasquez was a child, he aspired to become an archaeologist who could unravel the mysteries of the world.The work he does today could be considered vaguely similar, though it does not involve searching for ancient relics or mummified remains of pharaohs. Rather, what this creative specialist in themed showcases unearths are facts from the past which he presents in innovative, eye-catching ways in exhibitions around the world.One of these exhibitions takes the form of the Shanghai World Expo Museum, the world's first museum which documents the history of such expos since London's Great Exhibition in 1851.Officially opened in May 2017, the Shanghai World Expo Museum was a result of a collaboration between the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) and the Shanghai municipal government.As creative director of the museum's historic section, Vasquez is responsible for all design matters from start to finish, including crafting the philosophy and vision of the space, writing the content plan and supervising the production and installation of the contents.The chance to work on this project, which the Spaniard ranks among his most memorable, came in 2013 when he took up an offer by BIE to develop the creative concept for the facility. Having been fascinated with Chinese culture for many years, Vasquez jumped at the opportunity."My training as an art historian means I feel especially drawn toward Chinese art and culture. I have been very impressed by many of the facilities in the city, including the Shanghai Museum, the Long Museum, the Art West Bund and the Shanghai History Museum," he said."In 1984 I visited an exhibition called 7,000 years of China in Venice which left a huge impression on me. It was the first time I saw the terracotta warriors and the jade burial suit which is now in the National Museum in Beijing. Working in Shanghai more than 30 years later is like rediscovering that incredible, revelatory experience," he added.

                The First World Expo Forum for Development and International Cooperation was held in Shanghai on Dec 13 and 14, gathering international experts to discuss and analyze the influences of world Expos."The forum is vital and meaningful for world Expos, recalling, renewing and expanding the ideas and practices in the former events to create forward momentum," said Vicente G. Loscertales, Secretary General of Bureau International des Expositions.During the forum, experts reinforced the role of Expos as powerful catalysts that can boost the development of culture, economy, international cooperation, as well as urbanization and design."An Expo is a unique urban stage that combines all these aspects. For example, through large-scale investments in infrastructure, the creation of new urban areas, regional development, and social and economic impacts of the Expos are seen and felt by all citizens, before, during and after the event," said Loscertales."For architecture and construction, Expos also provide a blank canvas and an open laboratory for pushing boundaries and fostering creativity, encouraging bold decisions and creative independence for architects and designers to experiment with new forms, shapes and styles," he said.Gao Yan, chairwoman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, said China has always been supporting and participating in World Expos, and will continue to do so to demonstrate the country's vision of building a global community.Xu Kunlin, vice mayor of Shanghai, said the values of World Expos, including education, cooperation and innovation, has had a big impact on the city after the World Expo 2010."The 2010 Expo is a milestone in the city's development path and has always been leading Shanghai in moving toward the direction of a global city of excellence," said Xu.The World Expo, as a global event for showcasing innovation, encouraging collaboration and celebrating human ingenuity, has been held once every five years since 1851. Each Expo lasts for six months.The next Expo will be held on the Dubai South site measuring 4.38 square kilometers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), from October 2020 to April 2021.According to Najeeb Mohammed Al-Ali, executive director of the Dubai Expo 2020 Bureau, the major infrastructure of for the event will be completed by the end of the year.The bureau has already received pledges from 190 countries to be part of the Expo, surpassing the UAE's target of 180 countries at the time of bidding.The forum, Al-Ali said, is a great opportunity for UAE to share the ideas for the world Expo and deliver messages to friends in China."We signed the Chinese pavilion earlier in May, and it will be one of the largest pavilions in the Expo. Dubai has been major destination for many Chinese tourists. With the Expo, we expect to have more visitors from China," he said."It is the first time in the history of world Expos that the Chinese New Year will be celebrated during the World Expo. The winter in Dubai is of a comfortable temperature that all our visitors can enjoy."He pointed out that the Expo site may be reopened after the event to function as a new District 2020 which would house commercial and residential complexes.

                    SAILING SEES MORE CHINESE TAKE TO THE WATER
                </p>

                Sport aims to produce next generation of skilled yachtsmen From dinghies and skiffs to oceangoing racing yachts, Chinese are embracing the sport of sailing in a big way. And what they lack in experience they make up for with enthusiasm, determination and the drive to be among the world's best. Although still considered a niche sport in the country, sailing has captured the imagination of a growing number of men and women. The sport already has its own local heroes, including Vicky Song and Guo Chuan, who blazed trails for ocean racing. Song, the first Chinese woman to circumnavigate the globe when she took part in the 2013-14 Clipper Round the World Race, has become a role model for what can be achieved in sailing, especially for women. "The Clipper Race has changed me totally," Song said in an interview on the Clipper Round the World website as teams prepared for the 2017-18 race. "That year on the boat I learned so much. I think the most important thing is that it made me so much stronger mentally and it gave me so much more understanding of others. "It really gave me a different perspective on life. It just makes you think you are capable of doing things - that if I try, give the time and the effort, I will be able to do it. So that is the best gift of the race." Another star was Guo, who was lost at sea in October 2016 when he attempted to break the record for a solo crossing of the Pacific Ocean. Three years earlier, he became the first Chinese sailor to complete a nonstop solo circumnavigation of the globe. Along China's coastline, marinas and yacht clubs are being built or expanded to cater for the growth in sailing. Some sailing clubs, including the Qingdao International Yacht Club in Shandong province, are gaining international reputations for producing highly skilled sailors. The club is home to Team China, which competed in the 2007 challenge for the coveted America's Cup - the pinnacle of yachting. First contested in 1851, the America's Cup is the oldest trophy in international sport, predating the modern Olympic Games by 45 years. Originally named the 100 Pounds Cup, it was part of The Great Exhibition in London, the first in a series of world expos. At the time, the United Kingdom had invited countries around the world to display their latest technological advances. Six members of the New York Yacht Club built a racing yacht named America and entered it in the Royal Yacht Squadron's race around the Isle of Wight off the coast of southern England. America won decisively in an age when Britannia ruled the waves. The trophy was deeded in trust for international competition and became known as the America's Cup. The New York Yacht Club held on to the trophy for 132 years before Australia won it in 1983. The competition is staged every four years. Formed in 2005, Team China made its international debut two years later when it competed in the Louis Vuitton Cup - the challenger selection trials for the America's Cup. Although Team China put up a spirited fight in the series, it was unsuccessful. It has not challenged for the prestigious cup since, but there is a great deal of speculation in the yachting world that it may make another bid in 2021. Craig Monk, two-time America's Cup winner and New Zealand Olympic medalist, is working with local governments in China that want to develop their cities' waterfronts, offer sailing programs and be represented by competitive sailing teams on the world stage. Speaking to the website Sail World in late 2017, he said: "It's unbelievable how fast sailing is growing here (in China). It's all about growth of business and waterfront development. They're using the model Auckland (in New Zealand) used 25 years ago, to develop cities around sailing. "I have the contacts in the Western world to get China introduced to the best in the sport. My goal is to create an awareness in China and a path and vision for the country's sailors, young and old. They can have a serious sailing program and take New Zealand's lead to develop the sport and make it professional." William Ward, cofounder with Robin Knox-Johnston of Clipper Ventures, the UK organizer of the Clipper Round the World Race, said interest in the sport is huge in China. Ward is also CEO of Clipper Ventures. Knox-Johnston entered the record books in 1969 when he became the first person to sail solo around the world nonstop. The 2017-18 Clipper Round the World Race started in the English port city of Liverpool on Aug 20, 2017, with 12 70-foot ocean racing yachts, and finished in the same city on July 28 last year. Of the fleet, 11 completed the race and one had to withdraw not long after the start. "There is tremendous interest in sailing - particularly in ocean racing," Knox-Johnston said from the port city of Dalian, Liaoning province, where he was looking at sites for possible training schools. Established in 1996, the Clipper race is a test of skill and endurance in some of the world's roughest waters. What makes it different from other races is that about 40 percent of Clipper race crews have no previous sailing experience before signing up. Normally the domain of seasoned professionals, this supreme challenge is taken on by "ordinary, everyday people". Following a rigorous training course, participants are equipped with the latest extreme protection gear to begin the race of their lives. The Clipper race is said to be an endurance test like no other, covering 40,000 nautical miles, or 74,080 kilometers, around the world in 70-foot ocean racing yachts. Divided into eight legs, participants can choose to complete the full circumnavigation or select individual legs. It is the world's only race where the organizers supply a fleet of 12 identical racing yachts, each with a fully qualified skipper to guide the crew. Clipper Ventures' Ward said, "We first went to China with the 2005-06 race and have been there ever since," adding that the Clipper race has captured the imagination of many Chinese. China is now neck and neck with Australia in terms of the number of sailors taking part in the race. With more than 40 nationalities taking part, the biggest number of participants still come from the United Kingdom, followed by the United States, then China and Australia. "The sort of people who sign up for the race, whether it is for one leg or the whole race, tend to be achievers," Ward said. "They seek the adventure and the challenge of the sea." In November, Clipper Ventures announced its biggest expansion to date with the opening of a new division in China to meet demand. Named Clipper China, it aims to become the industry leader in the development of offshore training and sailing events across the country. In addition to running its own academies, Clipper China is building one-design keelboats and offshore racing yacht fleets for use in the new training academies and to compete in regattas. Ward said Clipper Ventures is the world's biggest single provider of offshore sail training. "We have trained over 5,000 sailors to participate in the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race over the past two decades. However, the potential for sailing in China means it could take us just a couple of years to train the same number here," he said. "Interest in sailing in China has never been higher. China has featured on the Clipper race route for the past 14 years and we have signed two additional teams here in the past two years." Ward added that the future for sailing in China looks exciting. Clipper China will work closely with the China Yachting Association - the national governing body for sailing. Zhang Xiaodong, president of the association, said in an interview with Sail World in November: "The Clipper race is the best-known offshore sailing brand in China - with the UK respected for its long-standing sailing heritage. We are in a strong position to help attract and develop our next generation of sailors." According to the association, sailing has become more popular in recent years and the Chinese are now taking part in and supporting more water sports activities than ever. In comparison to just a few regattas held a decade ago, more than 100 are now staged in the country each year. The association expects to see 400-plus yacht clubs with more than 150,000 sailing participants by 2021, an increase of 150 percent on the current level, Zhang said in a statement. Clipper Ventures' Ward said, "We want to do something meaningful for sailing in China." He said that while sailing standards in the country are low, enthusiasm is high. "The Clipper race actually makes a bigger noise in China than in Britain," he said. Ward added that sailing in China also has the potential to help cityscapes, adding, "There is a connection between sailing and the regeneration of waterfronts." Zhuhai, Guangdong province, is the third Chinese host port and team partner in the Clipper Round the World Race, joining Qingdao and Sanya, Hainan province. John Qu, manager of Noahs II, a 21-meter Volvo Ocean class yacht, said, "Yachting is a growing sport in China." Noahs II was the only boat from the Chinese mainland to compete in the 74th Sydney to Hobart yacht race in Australia in December. The boat and crew come from Noahs Yacht Club on the Huangpu River in Shanghai. They achieved the best performance by any boat from the mainland in the annual blue water classic, and 2018 was the fourth year a boat from the mainland had competed in the race. The race started on Dec 26, and the crew finished 12th overall in the 628 nautical mile event and eighth in its division. Noahs II completed the race just after midnight on Dec 29, having taken two days, 11 hours, seven minutes and 22 seconds to finish the course. A fleet of 85 yachts (ranging from the super maxis measuring more than 30 meters in length to those of just 9 meters) and more than 1,000 sailors took part in this year's event, which began under a blue sky and light winds in Sydney Harbor. Li Hongquan, skipper of Noahs II, said the fact that most of the crew had never competed in such a big race was heartening for him. "This was a great opportunity for the crew to familiarize themselves with big-boat ocean racing, and will go a long way to promoting the sport in China," he said. Qu, the boat's manager, said the government is encouraging the growth of "sport on the sea". "For ocean races like the Sydney to Hobart you really have to train outside of China, as we still lack the skill sets for ocean racing, although that is starting to change," Qu added. karlwilson@chinadailyapac.com  The Sanya Serenity Coast team was the overall winner of the 2017-18 Clipper Round the World Race, the first time a Chinese-sponsored team had won the event.Photos Provided To China Daily  Yachts compete in the race in waters off Sanya, Hainan province.Photos Provided To China Daily(China Daily 02/01/2019 page1)

                    Fallacy of the middle-income trap
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China expected to complete transition to high-income country by 2025 In the past decade, the concept of the middle-income trap has attracted wide attention from economists, media, government officials, international organizations and even the general public worldwide. If there are any traps in economic development, low income or poverty will no doubt be one of them. For the majority of the three million years of human history, people lived in poverty - except for a few wealthy ones - due to low economic growth rates and barely changing incomes. It was not until the Industrial Revolution took place in the later half of the 18th century that there was an accelerated growth rate in some countries and regions. In 1827, the Netherlands became the first country to cross over the low-income threshold to become a low-and middle-income country. In the half century afterward, the United Kingdom (1845), Australia (1851), Belgium (1854), New Zealand (1860), the United States (1860), Switzerland (1868), Uruguay (1870), Denmark (1872), France (1874), Germany (1874) and Austria (1876) joined the low-and middle-income club, one after the other. Is there really such a thing as a middle-income trap? When reviewing the past journey traveled by the developed countries in the West, it is seemingly fair to say that the developed countries in the West all struggled to complete the transition from being middle-income to high-income for nearly a century or even longer. However, their experience may not be applicable to emerging economies, at least not universally. In an article published in Foreign Affairs in 2004, Geoffrey Garret, an Australian expert who was teaching in the United States, proposed that middle-income countries could neither race ahead of rich countries through technology, not could they compete with poor countries in offering low prices. To support his point of view, Garret sorted the world's countries into three groupings - low, middle and high income - based on per capita income in 1980, and calculated their respective growth by 2000. The results suggested that the per capita income would increase by roughly 50 percent in high-income economies, 160 percent in low-income economies, but less than 20 percent in the middle-income economies. In 2007, in a report titled An Eastern Asian Renaissance: Ideas for Economic Growth, two World Bank researchers cited Garret's article and used the term "middle-income trap" for the first time. The concept became popular several years later. In fact, neither Garret nor the World Bank report referred to the word "trap" in a strict sense. The former never used the word at all, and the authors of the World Bank report, in an article 10 years later, explained that what they meant was that middle-income countries may enter a stagnant growth stage, not that they were more likely to fall into a growth trap compared with low-income and high-income countries. So why did these researchers pay special attention to the middle-income economies? The reason can be partly ascribed to the lack of satisfactory theory to explain middle-income economies. By contrast, we have the Slow Growth Model to help understand low-income economies and the Endogenous Growth Theory for high-income economies. That's why the authors of the 2007 World Bank report said 10 years later that the middle-income trap was more an "ignorance trap". When the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, it was one of the poorest countries in the world. After 50 years' effort, in 1999 more than 700 million people had been lifted out of poverty and China became a low-and middle-income country, according to World Bank statistics. Since then, all we have heard is warnings that China will be caught in the middle-income trap. On one hand, China does face a multitude of challenges in transforming from being a middle-income country to high-income country. On the other hand, China has the capability to deal with the various challenges. This confidence is firmly grounded upon solid statistics. According to World Bank standards, China only spent 12 years in the low-and middle-income stage before it strode toward the next stage of middle-and high-income. Although China's growth rate slowed down a bit in recent years, it still maintains a medium-high growth momentum. So we have every confidence that it will take China less than 15 years to become a high-income country. In other words, this transition should be accomplished by 2025. Therefore, when it comes to China, the middle-income trap is a fallacy. The author is professor of Tsinghua University and professor emeritus of Chinese University of Hong Kong.

                    Savoring a snack in quaint Quanzhou
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                My appetite for sampling the food of Minnan, or southern Fujian province, led me to take a stroll down Quanzhou's Xijie (West Street), which is lined with the oldest and most authentic snack bars and restaurants in the city. I soon found that many other people had a similar plan for the Spring Festival holiday. Hordes of visitors had already formed long lines in the drizzling rain to buy local delicacies like peanut soup, tusundong (sea worm jelly), hailijian (pan-fried oysters in scrambled egg) and jiangmuya (braised duck with ginger).  Left: Old redbrick buildings, ancient towers, chapels and other historical sites are scattered throughout Quanzhou, suggesting that people from different ethnic and religious groups peacefully coexisted in the city for centuries. Right: The bustling Xijie street in Quanzhou is crowded with visitors seeking local delicacies. Photos by Lin Liangbiao / For China Daily and Xing Wen / China DailyI walked among the noisy crowds before stopping at one shopfront. From the signboard over the door I noticed that the shop owner had been selling manjiangao - a local dessert made of sweet pastry layered with brown sugar, sesame seeds and crushed peanuts - for nearly 40 years. So I decided to join the long line. As I waited I had a look through the open door, where I could see old wooden furniture and a black coal-burning stove inside the store. Near the stove, a middle-aged man was skillfully frying batter in a pan and adding peanuts and other ingredients to it. He was chatting in Hokkien to a woman in a white apron, who was cutting up the finished pastries and packing them before handing them out to the customers waiting in line. About 20 minutes later, I took my first bite of the dessert, which tasted like a moist sandwich cake. It's said that the sweet food was created to feed the Manchu troops serving the Qing emperor in their fight against the armies of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (1851-64) that had marched into Fujian province in 1855. That might explain why it was so filling. Further down the road, there was a viewing platform on the rooftop of the Xijie tourist service center that overlooked the street and surrounding blocks. The old redbrick buildings with their red roof ridges curling up like swallow tails, together with ubiquitous erythrina trees bearing their bright red flowers created a scene quaint as it was vivid. The street, with its long history that can be traced back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907), reminds visitors of the prosperous past of Quanzhou, a city that was the eastern starting point of China's ancient Maritime Silk Road. Ancient towers, chapels, mosques, temples and other historical religious sites and monuments are scattered throughout Quanzhou, suggesting that people from different ethnic and religious groups peacefully coexisted in the city for centuries. That's partly because the port city once attracted merchants, seamen and explorers from all over the world, bringing with them a diverse range of cultures and a wide variety of goods. But what touched me most as I strolled along this historical thoroughfare, was not the time-honored sites themselves, but the strong sense of how daily life once played out here. Vendors still sold their wares from the side of the street as residents dried their clothes on sun terraces. Children burst into fits of laughter as they blew bubbles as snatches of local nanyin music drifted down from open windows. And after turning from the main street into a narrow lane, I came across an old man sitting on a stone bench under a large banyan tree, reading newspapers of the day. These scenes made me feel quite nostalgic for the pleasant neighborhood where I grew up. I found that on the square in the middle of the street two shirtless men teaching onlookers how to perform paixiongwu (a chest-clapping dance) - a traditional folk dance from the Minnan region. They were just one of the grassroots art troupes that the local government employs to stage cultural shows, such as nanyin music, Liyuan Opera and puppet shows. "We often offer a variety of cultural performances and workshops during holidays on Xijie," says Shangguan Zhipeng, the local events manager. "The street is the perfect setting for getting tourists closer to Quanzhou's cultural roots." After my visit, I soon realized that Xijie had much more to offer than delicious local snacks - the city's old quarter is something of a destination in its own right. xingwen@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily 02/19/2019 page16)

                    Petition in deadly boat fire cites 1851 law
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                A maritime expert said it's unlikely a judge would grant a petition by the owners of a dive boat to limit their financial liability for a Labor Day fire on board that resulted in the loss of 34 lives."The limitation of liability act certainly has the potential of limiting the liability to zero in this case, because there's no value to the vessel after the fire, so it has that potential, but from a practical standpoint, I don't expect it will be successful," Charles D. Naylor, a maritime personal injury trial lawyer in California, told China Daily.The 75-foot commercial dive boat Conception caught fire and sank near Santa Cruz Island early in the morning of Sept 2. It had on board 39 people — six crew members and 33 passengers. Only five crew members survived the tragedy.In a petition filed last Thursday, Truth Aquatics Inc., a Santa Barbara, California-based company that owns the Conception, requested exoneration from or limitation of liability, citing the Limitation of Liability Act of 1851.The act allows ship owners to minimize damage claims as long as they have no privity or knowledge to the cause of the incident, for example, personal fault on the part of the shipowner or charterer (the family trust or Truth Aquatics) themselves.The law was enacted by Congress in 1851 to spur investment in the maritime industry. At the time, communication was limited between the owners and the master once the ship departed from the harbor.But in today's society, instantaneous communications means it will be hard for owners to prove they have "no privity or knowledge to the cause of the incident".Naylor expects there will be evidence to show that the Conception wasn't safely equipped, which prevented the passengers from escapingthe fire. He said that could be a problem for the owners."It seems as if though this fire started probably in the galley. At least, that seems the most likely circumstance. Galley fires are not uncommon; it should not have been possible that a fire would get so far out of hand, so fast, that the fire couldn't be put out, and that it would block all exits from the passenger's compartment," he said."If they were maintaining a watch as they were required to do, an effective watch should have discovered that fire before it was out of hand. Just doesn't seem realistic that it could've gotten to that point, blocking all the exits to the passengers by the time it was discovered," Naylor added.Michael Karcher, a practicing maritime lawyer at Karcher, Canning & Karcher in Florida, who also teaches admiralty law at the University of Miami School of Law, said the determination of whether the owners will be granted the limitation of liability requires a two-step analysis."First, the court must determine what acts of negligence or conditions of unseaworthiness caused the accident. Second, the court must determine whether the owner of the vessel had knowledge or privity of those same acts of negligence or conditions of unseaworthiness," he said."Once the opposing party has proved negligence or unseaworthiness, the burden of proof shifts to the owner of the vessel to prove lack of privity or knowledge," he added.Martin Davies, a martime law professor from Tulane University, told China Daily that "on average, petitions for limitation succeed about 50 percent of the time in the US, but averages are of little help – everything depends on the facts of the case, and it's too early to say in the present case".However, filing the petition early helps the owners, or the insurers, to choose the court in which the litigation will take place. If the owner waited until it was sued by one of the families, it could only institute limitation proceedings in the jurisdiction where it was sued, Davies said.If the judge allows the owners to limit their liability, then families of the victims will have to bring their claims against the fund established by the shipowner in the limitation proceedings, he said.Truth Aquatics Inc said in a message posted on its Facebook page Sept 6 that the lawsuit is "another unfortunate side of these tragedies"."This wouldn't be something that we as a family would even consider, yet when something like this happens, insurance companies and numerous stakeholders convene and activate a legal checklist," it said."The timing is on them. Our hearts and minds are on the tragedy and finding answers,"added the company, which describes itself as "a small family-run business" that never had "an incident" in 45 years.
