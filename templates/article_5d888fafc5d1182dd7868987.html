                Tourism to HK tumbles over Mid-Autumn Festival
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                The incessant violent and illegal protests have cast a shadow over the city's festive spirit as arrivals and departures for Hong Kong dropped 24.3 percent compared with the three-day Mid-Autumn Festival holiday last year.Arrivals and departures for Hong Kong over the Mid-Autumn Festival holidays from Sept 12 to 14 saw 2.19 million passengers in total, according to Hong Kong's Immigration Department.The prolonged violence lasting over three months, aroused by the now-withdrawn extradition bill amendments, has taken a rising toll on the city's major business sectors and dampened tourist and consumer sentiment with low hotel occupancy rates and declining restaurant bookings.Simon Wong Ka-wo, chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants & Related Trades, said last Friday that the catering industry took a hit during the Mid-Autumn Festival as restaurant bookings decreased 20 percent compared with the Mid-Autumn Festival last year, which was equivalent to a drop of HK$100 million ($12.78 million) revenue year-on-year.Wong noted that the slump in tourists traveling to Hong Kong made the catering business in tourism hotspots Tsim Sha Tsui, Causeway Bay and Mong Kok much quieter than before.Remote restaurants had almost no bookings recently, said Yeung Wai-sing, chairman of the Association for Hong Kong Catering Services Management Limited. He said some restaurants have taken the unprecedented step of waiving the service charge or offering a 10 percent discount to attract customers and seek a bailout.The Hong Kong hotel industry has suffered as well with low occupancy rates due to fewer tourists than before. According to Ta Kung Pao, hotels and guesthouses in the tourist area of Victoria Harbor were slashing room rates, with some offering HK$400 per night during Mid-Autumn Festival.Sam Lau Kung-shing, chairman of the Tourist Guesthouses Federation, said the general business of hotels and tourist guesthouses tumbled 90 percent in recent months. He added that hotels have grabbed customers by cutting rates while the guesthouse business has gotten worse.The months from June to August are regarded as the peak tourism season in Hong Kong, while this year, the tourism industry was under attack due to the city's ongoing violent demonstrations and vandalism.In August, tourist arrivals to Hong Kong fell 40 percent year-on-year and hotels in some locations had seen occupancy rates drop to about half, while room rates plunged 40 to 70 percent, according to financial secretary Paul Chan Mo-po.Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA), the world's third-busiest hub for international passenger traffic and the world's largest air-cargo aviation hub, has reported a double-digit decline in both passenger and cargo traffic in August.The passenger traffic went down 12.4 percent to 6 million passengers, which marked the biggest one-month drop since June 2009. Passengers traveling to and from the Chinese mainland, Taiwan and Southeast Asia saw a bigger fall compared with August of last year.HKIA said the stagnancy was due to decreasing visitor arrivals amid social instability. More than 20 countries and regions including Japan, South Korea, Australia and the US have issued travel advisories for Hong Kong.The bleak scenario has continued at the beginning of September. In the first 10 days of the month, merely 15 tour groups from the Chinese mainland visited Hong Kong, down 90 percent compared with the same period of last year, according to the figures released by the Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong.The council pointed out that in light of the intensified demonstrations and violent clashes, tourists have lowered their interest in traveling to Hong Kong because of safety issues.During the Mid-Autumn Festival weekend, a fresh wave of mass violence and vandalism rocked the city as riotous protesters blocked roads, set fires, damaged MTR stations and attacked government headquarters on Sunday.

                Protests in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) have not stopped, although Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has repeatedly said the extradition amendment bill, which sparked the protests, is "dead" on different occasions. The continuing protests on Hong Kong's streets are part of a conspiracy between opposition figures, some radicals and external forces.During the past months, these people have been inciting confrontation between the Hong Kong government and citizens, turning initially peaceful protests into illegal violence and even challenging the bottom line of "one country, two systems". Their violent acts exhibit earmarks of a "color revolution". And as the violence is getting more and more intense, "signs of terrorism" are emerging.In such a context, it is of special significance that we review speeches by former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, made on Oct 3, 1984, when he met with a delegation of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots attending the National Day celebrations, and on April 16, 1987, at a meeting with the members of the drafting committee of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR (Basic Law).Hong Kong's achievements today are attributed to "one country, two systems""One country, two systems" is a preferential State policy adopted by the central government toward Hong Kong and Macao. The original purpose of "one country, two systems" is to make Hong Kong and Macao return to China's sovereignty and achieve cross-Straits reunification by allowing a socialist system and capitalist system to coexist in a socialist country. This is a great pioneering initiative, an unprecedented innovation without a doubt. It is just as Deng Xiaoping said when he met with members of the drafting committee of the Basic Law: "This is something new. It was created not by the United States, Japan, the Soviet Union or any European country, but by China; that is why we call it a Chinese characteristic." He added, "We are building socialism suited to Chinese conditions, which is why we were able to formulate the policy of 'one country, two systems' and why we can allow the two different systems to coexist. We would not be able to do this if we lacked courage, the courage that comes from the support of the people. Our people support the socialist system and leadership by the Party."Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy, which even exceeds that of states under some federal governments, if we consider it comparatively. The SAR enjoys an extremely wide range of administrative powers, covering economics, education, science, culture, sports, religion, social services, social security, and exit and entry management. In addition, Hong Kong also enjoys some rights on foreign affairs under central government authorization. But its most important right of autonomy, above all, is in finance and economics. For example, the HKSAR has its own independent tariff system and it does not need to turn over its tax revenue to the central government. Apart from that, Hong Kong also has its own independent monetary system and the Hong Kong dollar can be exchanged to other currencies freely. Although the land of Hong Kong is State-owned, it is managed by the SAR government and the revenues derived from it are exclusively at the disposal of the SAR government.Besides, Hong Kong also enjoys an extremely broad range of legislative powers and can enact laws applicable in the SAR in civil, criminal, commercial and legal proceedings and other aspects in accordance with the Basic Law. The laws previously in force in Hong Kong (that is, the common law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation and customary law) have been maintained, save for any that contravene the Basic Law, and are subject to subsequent amendment by the HKSAR legislature. After the establishment of the HKSAR, the Court of Final Appeal has also been set up to exercise the power of final adjudication in the region. The judicial system previously practiced in Hong Kong has been maintained except for those changes consequent upon the establishment of the Court of Final Appeal. The common law and relevant judicial principles and systems previously practiced in Hong Kong, including the principle of independent adjudication, the principle of stare decisis and the jury system, have continued to apply. When adjudicating cases, the courts of the HKSAR may refer to precedents of other common law jurisdictions, and the Court of Final Appeal may as required invite judges from other common law jurisdictions to sit in the Court of Final Appeal.The wide-ranging and high degree of autonomy has created favorable conditions for Hong Kong's economic development and has promoted and consolidated its status as an international hub of financing, trade and shipping. All these are dividends brought about by "one country, two systems". In addition, the Chinese mainland has been giving priority to meeting the needs of Hong Kong residents in supplies of food, tap water and all kinds of daily necessities. Infrastructure, such as high-speed railway and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, is constructed to help integrate Hong Kong into the national transportation network and make it more convenient for Hong Kong people to travel to the mainland. Apart from that, Hong Kong residents can travel to and from the mainland simply with a Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents, and can stay in the mainland with no time limit. China is also constantly introducing new policies and measures to facilitate Hong Kong people's work, studies and lives on the Chinese mainland. Without the strong support from the motherland, Hong Kong would not be self-sufficient in food, clothing, housing and transportation, let alone become an international financial, trade and shipping center or an international metropolis full of vitality and freedom.After Hong Kong's return to China in 1997, many people in Hong Kong hadn't realized the change of their identity and Hong Kong's constitutional order. Hong Kong people have values and lifestyles similar to the West, so some of them don't have enough understanding of or affective commitment to China. Foreign forces have taken the opportunity to infiltrate. For example, the US has been trying to turn Hong Kong into a pawn to hinder China's development, while the UK, an ally of the US and the former ruler of Hong Kong, often pokes its nose into the administration of the SAR government. In addition, the deep-seated contradictions in Hong Kong society have not been resolved after its return, which leads to mounting public grievances. It was under such conditions that the opposition groups took use of the controversies sparked by the extradition amendment bill to make waves and throw Hong Kong society into turbulence.

                CHICAGO - A packed audience enjoyed the preview showing of Chinese dark comedy Dying to Survive, a teaser for the ninth season of the Asian Pop-Up Cinema film festival in Chicago that kicked off on Aug 28. Asian Pop-Up Cinema, organizer of the eponymous film festival, presented the film at a theater in downtown Chicago. "The word 'nine' rhymes with 'forever' in Chinese," Sophia Wong Boccio, founder and executive director of Asian Pop-Up Cinema, says. "So the ninth season is a special one and we hope it also means that the film festival will continue well into the future." This will also be the "biggest Chinese film screening season", with five films from the Chinese mainland, three from Hong Kong and one from Taiwan to be screened, Boccio says. "We have never featured so many Chinese films in one season before," she adds. Besides the featured preview of Dying to Survive, other films from China include Crossing the Border by Huo Meng, The Enigma of the Arrival by Song Wen, Wushu Orphan by Huang Huang and Shadow by Zhang Yimou. "Films have been thoughtfully curated to represent authentic voices of Asia," says Boccio. "A majority of which will be Chicago premieres." The genres of the films in this season include musicals, courtroom thrillers, family dramas and comedies. Dying to Survive is based on a true story. Cheng Yong is under contract to help a sick man obtain illegally-imported medicine for leukemia. However, he soon finds himself in a gang of unlikely smugglers striving to help thousands of patients get access to the much-needed medicine at reasonable prices, until they're reported to the police. The feature film, which was the debut of director Wen Muye and starred Xu Zheng, won for best actor, best new director and best original screenplay at the 2018 Golden Horse Awards in Taiwan. Veteran attendee of the Asian Pop-Up Cinema film festival, Andy Salk, says: "It's a treat to meet with Asian filmmakers and ask them questions directly at discussion sessions." Boccio says: "Our goal is to help our audiences learn to accept different cultures and be inspired by the stories told by filmmakers from Asia." Seventeen films from China, Japan, South Korea and the Philippines will be shown at the festival, and 15 special guests made up of actors, actresses and filmmakers will meet with the audiences. Asian Pop-Up Cinema's season nine will run from Tuesday through Oct 10. Xinhua (China Daily Global 09/05/2019 page15)

                    Clothing firms must develop brands to boost sales
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Editor's note: People's Daily's overseas edition recently published a set of data on clothing consumption, which, among other things, show that since the fourth quarter of 2017, the sale of different kinds of clothing has declined to varying degrees. The report also asked whether domestic consumers no longer like to buy clothes. 21st Century Business Herald comments:The data showed 54.06 billion pieces of clothing were sold in China last year, 17.85 billion pieces fewer than the 71.91 billion pieces in 2017, which means an average reduction of 12 pieces of clothing per person.Yet the per capita clothing expenditure in 2018 increased to 1,289 yuan ($201), up 4.1 percent year-on-year, 1.2 percentage points higher than the previous year's growth. Which means the increase in clothing prices may be responsible for the growth in people's total clothing consumption despite people buying fewer pieces of clothing. National Bureau of Statistics data show clothing accounted for 6.5 percent of people's total consumer spending in 2018, down 0.3 percentage points year-on-year.One reason behind people's declining clothing consumption is the rising clothing prices.Another reason why people are buying fewer pieces of clothing is possibly the diversified consumer demand and insufficient supply capacity, as many people have shifted their focus to trends. As such, they prefer to buy branded or customized products.China's high-end clothing market is dominated by brands from such countries as France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Korea, while the middle-end market is full of brands from Hong Kong and Taiwan.So Chinese mainland enterprises should build their own brands, streamline their production and reduce their costs to get a bigger share of the market. Only in this way can they gain home advantage in a clothing-making country with a population of more than 1.3 billion.

                    Jay Chou inspires overseas trips to Japan
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                When Taiwan pop singer Jay Chou's new song Won't Cry sold a record high of 3.6 million copies within three hours after its release on Monday evening, the music video, which was shot in Japan, unexpectedly boosted tourism in the country.According to Chinese online travel agency Ctrip, searches for Japanese tourist attractions such as the Tokyo Tower and Sky Tree surged 80 percent overnight. Key search phrases such as "one-day trip in Tokyo" and "kimono experience" also increased by 40 percent.Special itineraries have been created to cater to the rising demand, including one-day trips in Tokyo that cover all the tourist attractions shown in Chou's music video.Ever since the beginning of this month, more than 20,000 people have booked Ctrip travel packages to Japan for National Day Holiday starting from Oct 1, making the country the most popular overseas destination for the seven-day holiday, said the travel agency.Among these the travelers bound for Japan, the majority are younger generations born in the 1980s and 1990s, who happen to be the majority of Chou's fans, said Ctrip.Up to 34 percent of them were born in the 1980s and 20 percent born in the 1990s. It is estimated that the budget for trips to Japan is around 20,000 yuan ($2,821) per person.
