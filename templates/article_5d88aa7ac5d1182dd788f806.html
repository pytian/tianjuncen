                DPRK official proposes meeting with US side in late September
            </a>
            <p>
                PYONGYANG - Choe Son Hui, first vice foreign minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), proposed a meeting with the US side late in September, according to a statement issued on Monday."We have willingness to sit with the US side for comprehensive discussions of the issues we have so far taken up at the time and place to be agreed late in September," Choe said in her statement, which was reported by the Korean Central News Agency on Monday night.Choe mentioned she had noticed recent remarks by high-ranking US officials leading the negotiations with the DPRK that they are ready for bilateral working negotiation.Choe stressed that she believed the US side would come up with a proposal geared to the interests of both sides and based on the calculation method acceptable to the DPRK."If the US side fingers again the worn-out scenario which has nothing to do with the new calculation method at the DPRK-US working negotiation to be held with so much effort, the DPRK-US dealings may come to an end," Choe warned in the statement.

                President sends DPRK best wishes on its 71st anniversary

                China welcomes DPRK-US dialogue resumption
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - China on Thursday said it welcomed the positive signals from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on resuming talks with the United States, calling on the US side to take practical measures to ease tensions and promote talks.State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi made the remarks when responding to a query at a joint news conference held Thursday with Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah."For some time, sound actions between the parties have also accumulated conditions for the resumption of dialogue," Wang said, stressing that China is pleased to see the DPRK and the United States resume dialogue as scheduled in late September.Wang said that imposing a list of conditions or seeking concessions through maximum pressure would never work. "This is true in the DPRK-US dialogue, as well as in other countries' dialogues.""Since last year, the DPRK has taken a series of positive measures, and on these grounds requested the US to meet them halfway with a positive response," he said."We think this is fair and reasonable," said Wang, who hoped that the US side can also take practical measures in this regard, and make due efforts to ease tensions and promote talks.According to news reports, the DPRK is willing to sit with the US side at an agreed-upon time and place in late September to comprehensively discuss issues between the two sides.
