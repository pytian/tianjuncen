                New exhibition celebrates 70 years of China-Hungary ties
            </p>
            <p>
                Four artists from Hungary are presenting a group exhibition in Shanghai titled Art Comes to Life to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Chinese-Hungarian diplomatic relations.The exhibition, which started on Sep 11 and will end on Oct 10, is being held at the Duolun Museum of Modern Art and is jointly presented by the Hungarian Consulate and the museum.Paintings by Barakonyi Zsombor capture the cosmopolitan quality and peculiar timelessness of urban living and Borsi Flora's photos provide a glimpse of the innovative characteristics of Hungary through a fantasy, dreamlike world.Ban Sarolta's works are about the emotional sensitivity of the younger generation, revealing how hard it is to cope with life in the 21st century, while Marcus Goldson, a Kenya-born artist who has made Budapest his home for more than 20 years, is showcasing his works which capture the essence of what it means being a Budapester.

                A delegation consisting of star table tennis players and coaches from China has landed in the United States for a two-week training session with top players from Team USA, an event that organizers said will further enhance communication and friendship between athletes of the two countries."#Pingpong diplomacy has played a pivotal role in #ChinaUS relations. I wish our national #tabletennis team a good visit to the US to further the spirit of friendship and cooperation," Cui Tiankai, Chinese ambassador to the US, said on Twitter.The 58-member delegation, led by Liu Guoliang, a China table tennis legend and chairperson of the Chinese Table Tennis Association, includes many distinguished players in recent ping-pong history, such as Olympic gold medalists Ma Long and Ding Ning, as well as former Olympic and world champions Ma Lin, Chen Qi, Wang Hao and Guo Yan.The Chinese team and US players will practice in a joint training camp at the University of California in Los Angeles from Aug 11 to 25, said Bruce Liu, a member of the board of directors of USA Table Tennis.Team members from the US likely will include players such as Lily Zhang, Wu Yue, Amy Wang, Nikhil Kumar, Kanak Jha and Nicholas Tio."Table tennis plays a pivotal role in the establishment of Sino-US diplomatic relationships. We hope to enhance the friendship between the two countries through the joint practice," Liu said.According to Liu, the idea for the joint training camp came about after the US city of Houston, Texas, and the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu, learned they will host the 2021 and 2022 world table tennis championships, respectively, during the International Table Tennis Federation's annual general meeting in Budapest, Hungary in April.The fact that the US and China will host the world table tennis championships in successive years is significant because 2021 marks the 50th anniversary of Ping-Pong Diplomacy.In 1971, a chance encounter between an American player and Chinese player, Glenn Cowan and Zhuang Zedong, during the 31st World Table Tennis Championships in Nagoya, Japan, led to an unexpected thaw in the long-stalled US-China relationship.As they were prepared to leave Nagoya, the US Table Tennis Team received an all-expense paid invitation to visit China, where they would play a series of friendly matches. In response to the Americans' visit, the Chinese National Table Tennis Team, led by Zhuang Zedong, embarked on an eight-city tour in the US in April 1972.What became known as Ping-Pong Diplomacy paved the way for President Richard Nixon's historic visit to Beijing in February 1972.It also led to the signing of the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations, by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and US President Jimmy Carter, which formally established official relations between the two countries in 1979."This is the first time the Chinese team will bring the entire team and will present a great opportunity for the US players to learn, to build friendship with the Chinese players, and also to build a great partnership between our two associations," said USA Table Tennis CEO Virginia Sung."We hope to make this joint training camp an annual event leading up to the Houston and Chengdu World Championships and the 2028 LA Olympic Games," she added.

                China records surging travelers to Central, Eastern Europe
            </a>
            <p>
                SHANGHAI -- China saw a rapid growth of tourists going to Central and Eastern European countries in the first half of the year, thanks to the opening of more direct flights, according to a new report.The report, jointly issued by the China Tourism Academy and China's largest online travel agency Ctrip, recorded 3 million visits by Chinese tourists to Europe in the first half of the year, marking a 7.4-percent rise year on year.In break-down, the number of Chinese tourists to Croatia and Latvia surged by more than 500 percent, while the increase rates were over 400 percent for visitors to Slovenia and Bulgaria and 300 percent for Estonia and Albania, said the report.The report said favorable visa and exchange rate policies have boosted the surging interest in Central and Eastern Europe. In particular, it gives credit to many newly-opened direct flights to European cities, including the opening of the Shanghai-Budapest flight and the Beijing-Baku flight earlier this year.According to the China Tourism Academy, the number of Chinese tourists to Europe exceeded 6 million in 2018, with Eastern Europe accounting for 36.3 percent, the highest share of the total.

                SHANGHAI - As the 2019 Shanghai Tourism Festival opened Saturday evening, the festival, which began in 1990, has been a witness to China's development and citizens' consumption upgrade over the past few decades.Twenty-five floats, which represent China's well-known tourist destinations such as Nanjing and Suzhou cities in Jiangsu province, and 32 performance groups from 19 countries and regions, including Germany, Switzerland and France, participated in the dance and music show in downtown Shanghai, attracting some 300,000 spectators.

                Festival bears witness to growth of tourism market since 1990
            </a>
            <p>
                SHANGHAI-The Shanghai Tourism Festival, which opened on Saturday night, has borne witness to China's development and the upgrading of people's consumption patterns since it was first staged in 1990.Twenty-five floats representing well-known Chinese tourist destinations such as Nanjing and Suzhou in Jiangsu province, and 32 performance groups from 19 countries and regions, including Germany, Switzerland and France, participated in dance and music shows in downtown Shanghai that attracted some 300,000 spectators.The 2019 festival, running to Oct 6, will feature 100 activities, including some for overseas travelers. An exhibition of folk cultures from countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative will also be held. Dozens of tourist sites, museums and galleries in Shanghai will offer half-price admission during the event.The first tourism festival in Shanghai attracted half a million tourists from home and abroad, while last year's attracted 12.7 million. As people's living standards have improved remarkably, tourism is not a luxury any more, but a necessity for many."In 1995, the company rewarded me with a trip to Hainan. I was so proud and cherished it very much," a 54-year-old Shanghai taxi driver recalled. "Now, our income has increased a lot and travel has become routine for most people who are willing to spend their own money to relax."Thirty years ago, there was a lack of ideal tourism resources, said Lu Guojun, a clerk with Shanghai Huangpu River Cruise Group, citing the swaths of cropland along the eastern coast of the river that flows through the city center.In recent years, with improved infrastructure and rapid development of the service economy, more companies have joined the development of river tourism, Lu said.Dai Bin, president of the China Tourism Academy in Beijing, said people's aspirations for a better life led to high expectations of tourism quality.In August, China issued a guideline to unleash the consumption potential of culture and tourism.On Friday, Shanghai signed agreements with six cities and regions, including Budapest, Phnom Penh and Bangkok, to boost culture and tourism exchanges.Culture and tourism promote mutual friendship and understanding, said Yu Xiufen, head of the Shanghai Municipal Administration of Culture and Tourism.Domestic tourists made 5.54 billion trips last year, up 10.8 percent year-on-year, and the total number of inbound and outbound tourists reached 291 million, up 7.8 percent.Total tourism revenue reached 5.97 trillion yuan ($842.7 billion) last year, up 10.5 percent, data from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism showed.

                BRI praised by Slovakia and Hungary
            </a>
            <p>
                The Belt and Road Initiative is taken as a key source of growth in the next few years for two Central European and two Southeast Asian nations, according to their ministers.In an interview with China Daily, Slovakia's Deputy Finance Minister Dana Meager and Hungarian Minister of State for Financial Policy Affairs Gabor Gion said their countries' geographical positions in Europe made them ideal regional hubs for transportation and logistics network.Meager and Gion were in Hong Kong from Sept 11-12 to attend a meeting on the Belt and Road Initiative.Meager said Slovakia "is in the heart of Europe. (It is) at the crossroads of east-west and north-south connection". Hungary's Gion said his country "is situated at the very center of Europe. From a logistics points of view, it's a great place".Gion said Hungary's strategic location made it possible for the country to host one of the key infrastructure projects under the initiative. He is referring to the 350-kilometer high-speed railway that will connect the Hungarian capital of Budapest with the Serbian capital of Belgrade.Gion said Hungary's involvement in the BRI is in line with his country's "Opening to the East" policy. Launched in 2010, the "Opening to the East" policy aims to expand Hungarian export markets beyond Europe.For Meager, who also serves as the plenipotentiary of the Slovak Government for the negotiations on Belt and Road Initiative, said "Slovakia was one of the first countries to understand the potential of BRI".She said the Belt and Road Initiative is "all about connecting" and Slovakia's strong geographical position has made it ideal for diverse transportation network that can connect people, governments and investors in the BRI.Railway network Meager said the railway networks that pass through Slovakia are the fastest ways to transport cargo, making it easier for businesses to cut costs and be more efficient. She said that delivering cargo from Asia to Europe (or vice versa) through the maritime route usually takes 40 to 45 days. But a railway network can cut the travel time to 10 days and Meager said that Slovakia is even targeting to reduce that to eight days.She said any investment in Slovakia is made in the euro - an international currency. This will help investors to save money as they don't have to incur foreign exchange losses."Efficiency, security and safety. This is what Slovakia offers," Meager said.Meager said Chinese investors can look at the automotive sector, the country's biggest industry. Meager said Slovakia is the world's biggest car producer per capita, manufacturing over 1 million cars each year.Meager said Chinese investors can also form joint ventures in Slovakia's other key sectors such as steel milling, chemical manufacturing and pulp and paper.prime@chinadailyapac.com (China Daily 09/16/2019 page11)
