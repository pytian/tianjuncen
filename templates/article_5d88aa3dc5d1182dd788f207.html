                MAX jet return could vary by region
            </p>
            <p>
                Regulators worldwide may recertify the Boeing 737 MAX jet for commercial service at different times, creating a staggered return of the plane and underscoring a lack of trust in the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), an industry expert said.In the past, overseas regulators have generally followed the lead of the FAA and accepted its findings, but that may change after crashes of MAX jets in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed a total of 346 passengers and crew.Investigators have focused on the MAX's anti-stall device that may have erroneously pointed the nose of the planes down to avoid a mid-air stall and into a fatal plunge."The FAA and its oversight by Congress resulted in destroying the reputation built on half a century of certification expertise," James Hall, managing partner of Hall and Associates in Washington and former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, told China Daily. "When the FAA failed to ground the aircraft after the first accident or immediately after the second — and everyone in aviation knew that had either accident happened in the US, the plane would have been grounded immediately — the FAA forfeited its leadership on aviation issues."China was the first to ground MAX jets. The US grounded the plane only after regulatory agencies around the world had done so.Hall has been critical of the FAA's use of manufacturer's employees as part of the process to declare a plane safe. In an opinion article published in The New York Times, he called it a "worrying move toward industry self-certification".Patrick Ky of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said the FAA's worldwide reputation is in a "very difficult situation"."It's likely that international authorities will want a second — or third — opinion," he told CNN. "And (that) was not the case one year ago. I think that's going to be a very strong change in the overall worldwide hierarchy or relationship between the different authorities."Some analysts said technological innovation in contemporary planes has outstripped the ability of regulators to keep up with advancements. They note that the FAA's practice of relying on industry insiders is no different from the US Food and Drug Administration's reliance on experts from the companies it regulates or state bar associations that certify attorneys and take disciplinary action when needed."I think it's just concern on the part of some regulatory agencies that withdrew their airworthiness certificates before the FAA did," Robert Mann, president of RW Mann and Co in Port Washington, New York, told China Daily."It shows their comfort level is different from the FAA's comfort level. I don't see it as anything other than having a different point of view on how the aircraft is tested for recertification and how pilot training ought to be handled. For example, should regulators require use of flight simulators or is computer training enough?"The FAA said review of the software update continues for the MAX jet's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), the anti-stall system implicated in the two crashes."The FAA has a transparent and collaborative relationship with other civil aviation authorities as we continue our review of changes to software on the Boeing 737 MAX," the agency said in a statement. "Our first priority is safety, and we have set no time frame for when the work will be completed."In a statement given to China Daily on Tuesday, Boeing said it's working "diligently with the FAA and global regulators to support the safe return to service of the MAX".Boeing believes the MAX will be certified to return to commercial service in the fourth quarter.

                LANZHOU -- Nine government officials and medical workers from Liberia, Ethiopia and Madagascar are attending training classes in Lanzhou, capital of Northwest China's Gansu province.The 22-day training, starting on August 28, focuses on reducing the mortality rate of pregnant and puerperant women and infants and is hosted by the International Health Exchange and Cooperation Center under the National Health Commission. The training content includes lectures, teaching and cultural experiences."I am here to learn from China's experience in maternal and child healthcare and the mature structural arrangement of the hospital," said Fokape Beyan Duyenku, a doctor with the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Liberia.Driven by the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, China is intensifying its medical support for African countries. Through experience sharing, technological cooperation and other modes of medical support, China endeavors to help African countries to develop their medical and health undertakings."As the key of health services, talents are vital to stepping up China-Africa cooperation and building a 'healthy' Silk Road," said Liang Baoping, head of international cooperation and exchange office with Health Commission of Gansu Province.

                Ethiopian Day unveiled with a cup of coffee
            </a>
            <p>
                Visitors tasted pure Ethiopian coffee last Friday to celebrate Ethiopian Day during the ongoing International Horticultural Exhibition in Beijing.As one of the Ethiopian Day celebrations, the Ethiopian embassy offered plain Ethiopian coffee at its exhibition area where Ethiopian art crafts and specialties are showcased.Ethiopia is the fifth biggest national coffee producer, with an average annual export of about $800 million, accounting for 25 to 30 percent of the country's total export income.Ethiopia targets the Chinese market for more investment and sales as China has seen a double-digit growth in coffee consumption.Ethiopian Ambassador to China Teshome Toga expressed his gratitude for China organizing the Horticultural Expo in a speech and also vowed to upgrade bilateral cooperation to a new level in investment, trade, tourism and cultural exchanges.Ethiopian Day coincides with the country's New Year -- Ethiopia has a calendar around seven to eight years later than the Gregorian calendar adopted by most countries. A gala event was held with Ethiopian artists dancing and singing to mark the occasion.Themed "Live Green, Live Better", the Beijing horticultural expo is the world's largest of its kind. It opened to the public on April 29 in Yanqing district and will last until Oct 7.Video by Dai Yuanyuan

                Overseas Chinese marks Mid-Autumn Festival
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW YORK - China's Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon Festival, which fell on Sept 13 this year, has brought joy where it was celebrated by overseas Chinese communities around the world on Friday and over the weekend.In the United States, a variety of Mid-Autumn festivities have eased the homesickness of the Chinese communities. In New York, Illinois, California and elsewhere, festival-themed carnivals, galas and markets started from last weekend. Streets in Chinatowns were closed, cruise ships were rented, and top floors of landmark buildings were reserved for get-togethers.In the east African country of Ethiopia, the celebrations of the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival has coincided with the country's New Year. The double festivals have provided a moment for both Ethiopians and Chinese expats to celebrate the two events under a single roof, enjoying the two countries' rich cultural and historical values.On Saturday, Ethiopian and Chinese staff from the local office of a Chinese construction giant, China Civil Engineering Construction Company, gathered in Addis Ababa to mark the two events. Attending the joint celebrations, Chinese and Ethiopian colleagues enjoyed the festive ambience by exchanging gifts and learning each other's language."We celebrated our New Year and the Chinese Mid-Autumn cultural festival together. The ceremony was unique as both events are related to each other," Selam Simegn, assistant to the Manger at the construction office's Ethiopia branch said."The Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival manifests the coming of new harvest season as the full moon glows," said Simegn, an Ethiopian, who added that she is happy to taste the mooncakes baked by her Chinese colleagues.In Turkey's capital city Ankara, celebrations events took place from Saturday to Tuesday in the Hilton Hotel and Atakule, a tower which is one of the landmarks of the city.Attendants of the festival had the pleasure of seeing traditional Chinese folk art related to food, such as dough modeling, sugar painting and music. A face mask changing dance was also presented and very much appreciated by the crowd."This is real art. I marveled at what I'm seeing. I called my staff to see how this gentleman is presenting this centuries-old craft," said a Turkish chef, Erhan Kahraman, in front of the stand where a Chengdu master was meticulously exhibiting his sugar painting craftsmanship.Xinhua
