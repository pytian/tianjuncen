                China clearly enhancing its Nationally Determined Contributions ahead of COP 26 would provide much-needed leadership and a shot of political energy and ambition The European Union's recent failure to agree on strengthening its long-term climate change mitigation target and the division on climate change actions evident at the recent G20 Summit in Osaka have again highlighted the leadership gap and need for greater international cooperation in global environmental governance. Observers have increasingly been looking to China to step up and fill this void. This came through loud and clear at the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development (CCICED) annual general meeting held in Hangzhou in early June, along with the belief that this could revive and galvanize international environmental cooperation. The stage is also set, with the next 18 months providing a number of key opportunities for China to step up and realize its leadership potential, including the UN Secretary-General's Climate Action Summit in New York this September; the 26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 26) in December 2020, when it is hoped countries will present enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement; and the formulation of China's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25). Capitalizing on these opportunities, however, will depend on China's ability to align these international and domestic agendas through forward-thinking policymaking. Despite the weakness of the overall outcome on climate at the just-concluded G20 Osaka Summit, China, France, and the UN produced a communiqu��, on the margins of the summit in Osaka, reaffirming their commitments to combating the climate crisis. Importantly, it included a reaffirmation to enhancing NDCs, which presents a great opportunity for Chinese leadership. Current NDCs have the world on track for a devastating 3 degrees of global warming this century, falling far short of what science tells us is required to avoid dangerous climate change. Although it has been reported that as many as 80 countries are considering strengthening their commitments at COP 26 in 2020, the biggest economy of the world has yet to strongly signal this intent. China is well-positioned to step forward and do so, being already well on track to overachieve its current target of peaking carbon emissions by 2030. Enhancing its NDC would cement its climate leadership role and likely catalyze the ratcheting up of NDCs globally, leaving few excuses left on the table for those who are not. It would also be a powerful boost to broader international climate change cooperation. China clearly committing to enhance its NDC at or before COP 26 could provide the shot of political energy and ambition needed to overcome any inertia. In terms of timing, as some CCICED delegates suggested, the Climate Action Summit in September this year would provide the ideal platform for such a commitment, while still leaving time for the specific revised target to be developed. The first clear way for China to enhance its NDC is to bring forward its target year for emissions peaking. The second, which could complement the first, would be to adopt an absolute emissions control target. This would change China's focus from merely limiting emissions growth to pursuing absolute decarbonization. Establishing an absolute emissions control target before 2030 would also concretize a revised early peaking year, facilitate the integration of emissions reductions with existing absolute pollutant controls of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, and provide a basis for allowances in the national emissions trading scheme that will begin trading in 2020. China updating its NDC aligns with its present environmental priorities, which have advanced significantly since the current NDC was devised in 2015. To be meaningful, however, a more ambitious NDC must be matched with strategies for achieving it, which, in the case of China, will rely on integration into the 14th Five-Year Plan, which is currently under development. At the CCICED annual general meeting, Li Ganjie, the minister of Ecology and Environment, emphasized that the 14th Five-Year Plan should represent an ambitious change of step from previous plans now that China has reached its centennial goal of becoming a "moderately prosperous society" and aims to realize modernization. There is thus a huge opportunity to realize this through aligning an enhanced NDC with ambitious targets and means of implementation in the 14th Five-Year Plan that support its achievement and set the foundation for long-term decarbonization. Achieving this will also be a great test of how deeply the idea of an "ecological civilization" has permeated the Chinese government and also the authority of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. The five-year plan development process is a huge effort involving both the State Council, ministries, and thousands of departments at all levels of local government. All of these will need to be coordinated to provide the backing that makes an enhanced NDC meaningful and achievable. The world is increasingly looking to China for bold leadership. The next 18 months offer clear opportunities for China to assume this, provided it can align international priorities such as NDC enhancement with domestic policies, particularly the 14th Five-Year Plan. Successfully doing so would support China's existing priorities and help galvanize international climate cooperation and ambition. Missing the opportunity, on the other hand, might see the chance of ever doing so may slip away for good. The author is a fellow with the Beijing-based Innovative Green Development Program.

                US should improve its own human rights record
            </a>
            <p>
                Both Republican and Democrat lawmakers reaffirmed on Thursday the United States' "commitment" to democracy and human rights in Hong Kong and "warned" Beijing against its "increased interference" in the territory. US senators and representatives also introduced a "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act", a measure that could lead to the removal of Hong Kong from the US' special trading partners' list. To begin with, the US has no business interfering in China's internal affairs, as Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China. It also has to understand that Beijing's idea of human rights is different from Washington's. Beijing believes in the people-centric principle of human rights that gives priority to the right to life, education and livelihood. It combines the universal principle of human rights with China's actual conditions and protects human rights through the law. Thanks to four decades of economic growth and social development, China has lifted close to 800 million people out of abject poverty, which has greatly promoted the global poverty alleviation work, and improved people's livelihoods, and therefore developed human rights in an all-round way.

                Boeing pledges $100M to help families of 737 Max crash victims in Indonesia, Ethiopia
            </a>
            <p>
                SAN FRANCISCO - Boeing Company announced Wednesday that it has set aside $100 million to address family and community needs of those affected by two deadly air crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia last October and this March.Boeing said the funds are an initial investment to be paid over multiple years to support education, hardship and living expenses of the families of the victims who were killed in the "tragic accidents" of Indonesian Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.The two air crashes, both involving Boeing 737 Max 8 jets, killed a combined 346 people and led to the global grounding of 737 Max aircraft since March."We at Boeing are sorry for the tragic loss of lives in both of these accidents and these lives lost will continue to weigh heavily on our hearts and on our minds for years to come," said Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing chairman, president and CEO.He expressed "deepest sympathies" for the families of those victims, hoping the funds will "help bring them comfort."The victims' families will not have to waive any rights in accepting the money, which is being given independent of any lawsuits, said Boeing spokesman Chaz Bickers, quoted by The Seattle Times.Muilenburg reaffirmed in a tweet Wednesday that the safety of Boeing aircraft and the crew and passengers who fly on them is Boeing's "highest priority."The company will work with local governments and nonprofit organizations to deploy the money over the upcoming years, but it did not explain any details about how the money will be used or apportioned.Boeing said its employees are encouraged to make charitable donations to support the families affected by the accidents, and the company will "match these employee donations through Dec. 31, 2019."The US top aircraft manufacturer has been grilled in recent months over the safety of its 737 airplanes as the US Federal Aviation Administration is pressuring Boeing to update and improve a flight control software that was partially blamed for the two air crashes in five months.Critics have blamed Boeing for rushing to build the 737 MAX aircraft and failing to fully disclose potential problems with the 737 MAX flight control software, also known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which was intended to mimic pitching behavior in low-speed and high angle of attack flight.Although investigators have not determined an official cause of the two fatal crashes, they found clues to a common link in the flight control software that might have read erroneous signals from the aircraft's sensors, which eventually triggered uncontrollable stall that caused both accidents.Over the past months, Boeing has been working on an upgrade to the MCAS anti-stall mechanism and trying to fix other problems, in an effort to bring 737 MAX jets back to commercial operation as soon as possible.

                UN targets terror-crime collusion
            </a>
            <p>
                Forum underscores need to cooperate on combatting organized-crime financingChina's counter-terrorism and de-radicalization campaign is part and parcel of the global fight against terrorism, the Chinese envoy to the UN said on Tuesday."China is also a victim of terrorism," said Ma Zhaoxu, China's permanent ambassador to the UN."Facing the ongoing threat of terrorism and extremism, China has taken decisive measures to carry out counter-terrorism and de-radicalization by law, has effectively contained the high incidences of terrorist activities at different locations, and has best guaranteed the basic right to development and life of people of all ethnicities," he said at an open debate on the linkage between international terrorism and organized crime, held by the Security Council at UN headquarters.He said China's counter-terrorism and de-radicalization campaign is fully consistent with the purposes and principles of the UN in fighting terrorism and protecting basic human rights.China has been rigorously implementing all of the UN's counter-terrorism resolutions and actively participating in global and regional counter-terrorism cooperation, he said."As a state party to the United Nations convention against transnational organized crime, China has been taking a range of measures, including legislation, law enforcement and judiciary measures, actively implementing its obligations under the convention, and advancing relevant international cooperation," Ma said.Ma said China will continue to conduct bilateral and multilateral exchanges and cooperation with all member states, especially developing countries, in fighting terrorism and organized crime, adding that China will do its utmost to provide material assistance to concerned countries in joint endeavors to maintain regional and global peace and stability.Ma also said that terrorist organizations were using organized crime for financing and posed serious threats to international peace and security."It is important to adhere to a unified counter-terrorism standard while respecting the primary responsibilities of the member states and the central coordinating role of the United Nations," Ma said."Terrorism is the public enemy of the mankind, counter-terrorism must not be subject to double standards," he said, adding that counter-terrorism must follow the purposes and principles of the UN charter and must respect the sovereignty, independence, and territory integrity of the countries concerned.Tangible measures must be taken to counter mutual collusion and infiltration between terrorist organizations and organized crime in people, funding, equipment and incitement, he added.Ma called for a comprehensive approach to be adopted "to root out the causes that breed and proliferate terrorism and organized crime."Effective regional cooperation is key, he said, emphasizing a need for United Nations agencies to work more closely together and with the affected regions. Initiatives should also help states that need assistance in combating illegal activities by terrorist and organized crime groups and addressing trafficking in everything from weapons to natural resources. Before delivering his remarks, Ma said this would most likely be his last speech as the permanent representative of China to the UN."I would like to use this opportunity to extend my respect to all of my colleagues at the council," he said."I would also like to express my hope that in the future the Security Council can build up its current momentum to better maintain international peace and security," he added.Yury Fedotov, executive director of the UN's office on drugs and crime, highlighted priority actions to strengthen the global response to the dual threat of terrorism and organized crime. He noted the importance of working towards effective implementation of international commitments and called for more resources to provide technical assistance, including information and intelligencesharing. "The UN clearly has a role to play in encouraging and enabling such networked responses," he said. Also speaking in the open debate was Michele Coninsx, executive director of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate. She said that "events such as today's open debate enable us to reaffirm our joint commitment to combating all forms of support for terrorist groups and individuals, as well as to promoting regional and international cooperation through the dissemination of relevant tools and practices".

                Importance of vaccinations stressed at summit
            </a>
            <p>
                The 2019 Summit on Seasonal Influenza Prevention and Control Strategies Took Place in Beijing recently, whereby vaccination was once again reaffirmed most effective in preventing the flu and its complications.The summit was organized by the Chinese Preventive Medicine Association with support from Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines division of multinational pharmaceutical company Sanofi.The attendees included Weizhong Yang, vice president of CPMA, Lance E. Rodewald, senior advisor of the National Immunization Program of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Zhongjie Li, deputy director of Division of Infectious Disease of China CDC, and Luzhao Feng, researcher of the Division of Infectious Disease of China CDC, as well as experts from different levels of healthcare and disease control institutions. “The State Council’s advice on the ‘Healthy China’ initiative again highlighted the importance of chronic disease management as well as the prevention and control of seasonal influenza," said Weizhong Yang. "Vaccination plays a significant role in disease prevention, and the government encourages people at risk to get their shots prior to the flu season."Unlike the common cold, influenza is an acute infectious disease. The direct invasion of the flu virus through the respiratory system can lead to serious or even fatal complications, such as viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The flu virus mutates every year and causes seasonal epidemics.The severity of the flu and its complications has long been underestimated by the public. According to the estimation by the World Health Organization, seasonal flu epidemics can cause 650,000 deaths per year, equivalent to one death every 48 seconds.Lance E. Rodewald, said: “The morbidity and mortality of influenza have been growing dramatically in recent years. Data from the China CDC shows that there were 1.77 million reported influenza cases in the first 5 months of 2019, exceeding the total cases over the last 4 years.”As a quickly-spreading infectious disease, the flu puts infants, schoolchildren, healthcare workers, pregnant women, people with chronic illnesses and the elderly at risk. Vaccination is the most economical and effective public health intervention for flu prevention and control. Professor Suyun Qian from the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Beijing Children’s Hospital, Capital Medical University, said that 40 percent of children with serious complications have no latent infections. "To reduce the morbidity and mortality of severe influenza, the key is early diagnosis, treatment and prevention as well as raising awareness for vaccination. Children from six months to five years should be the top priority for influenza vaccination. For the families that have infants below six months, the family members and caregivers should be vaccinated to provide a safe environment for the babies," Suyun said.However, the public still hasn’t fully recognized the importance of vaccination. Currently, the average vaccination rate in China is below 2 percent, far behind that in developed countries.Luzhao Feng, researcher from the China CDC, pointed out that government support is of great significance in improving flu vaccination coverage, adding it is important to increase public awareness for the necessity of vaccination through broader education, to encourage government-funded vaccination investment, and to help create a more convenient and accessible vaccination service system.During the Summit, Sanofi Pasteur was named “Pioneer for Education on Influenza Prevention” by CPMA. Heping Zhang, General Manager of Sanofi Pasteur China, said: “As the only multinational vaccine provider with a local production facility, Sanofi Pasteur has established a world-class influenza vaccine production base in Shenzhen. We are looking forward to boosting China’s health education on influenza and its prevention and control, and to contributing to Healthy China as a health journey partner beside people in need.”
