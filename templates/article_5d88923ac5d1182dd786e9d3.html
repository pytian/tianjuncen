                Agreement to help Abu Dhabi win more BRI business
            </p>
            <p>
                Abu Dhabi Ports and Jiangsu Overseas Cooperation Investment Co Ltd (JOCIC) have signed a five-year agreement with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which is expected to facilitate Chinese companies operating at Khalifa Industrial Zone (KIZAD), Abu Dhabi's integrated trade, logistics, industrial and free zone, to further tap business opportunities in Belt and Road Initiative related economies.Abu Dhabi Ports, the operator and manager of the emirate's commercial and community ports, operates 11 ports and terminals across the United Arab Emirates and abroad, as well as KIZAD, and the agreement reiterates the strategic position played by the emirate to the major trade hubs related with the BRI.The three organizations will work together to simplify application processes for services ranging from foreign exchange to financial consultancy and project finance, including speeding up the processing of documents, such as those used to grant land rights within KIZAD, according to the agreement."Abu Dhabi's strategic location and commitment to the BRI has placed the emirate in an advantageous position on the global trade map. Improving the ease of doing business in the emirate for both our current and future clients is a top priority for Abu Dhabi Ports," said Falah Mohammad Al Ahbabi, who is chairman of Abu Dhabi Ports, chairman of the Department of Urban Planning and Municipalities, and a member of the Abu Dhabi Executive Council."Our agreement with ICBC is another successful achievement of these efforts, since navigating finance and banking can be a major obstacle for firms looking to enter into a new market," he said.ICBC becomes a preferred banking partner of Abu Dhabi Ports and JOCIC under the agreement.The three organizations will also facilitate meetings between companies and the bank, to help it tailor its portfolio of products and services to individual needs, making it quicker and easier for companies to start up in KIZAD.In addition, ICBC will raise awareness of KIZAD with clients in China and across other markets.Previously, as part of the UAE's support for the BRI and its aim to attract more trade and investment to Abu Dhabi, the 2.2-square-kilometer China-UAE Industrial Capacity Cooperation Demonstration Zone was established last year at KIZAD under a 50-year agreement.Wang Bin, chairman of JOCIC, said the UAE is an important platform for Chinese enterprises looking to enter Europe and Africa, and a critical gateway through which European and African enterprises can explore the Chinese market."We are proud to be helping Chinese enterprises grow their businesses overseas efficiently and effectively through the demonstration zone at KIZAD," Wang said.Zhou Lisha, a researcher at the research institute of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, said the five-year agreement of the three organizations is helpful to facilitate Chinese companies to operate in KIZAD, especially with related financial support and services.She also said BRI helps related economies benefit from China's financial and technological advantages in the infrastructure sector, and Chinese companies' overseas investments have extended to sectors such as technology, real estate, agriculture and healthcare, from only to energy and mining in the past.

                UAE ambassador impressed by China's tech development
            </a>
            <p>
                Ali Al Dhaheri, the United Arab Emirates Ambassador to China, recently shared his views with China Daily website and China Arab TV on China's development, the Belt and Road Initiative, mutual investment and Chinese culture.Before coming to China, Al Dhaheri thought he knew China very well, but by the time he started working here, he saw how rapid the development was. Al Dhaheri said he "admire" China's technological development and that's what impresses him most.Under the leadership of Chinese government, China has achieved rapid development in many fields, such as energy and railways, Al Dhaheri said.He spoke highly of the Belt and Road Initiative, and said it's an initiative bringing economic and social benefits to participant countries.Companies from the UAE have invested on more than 650 projects in China which cover various industries like energy, ports and banking. "There are many opportunities," Al Dhaheri said.Al Dhaheri's entire family is learning Chinese and he praised Chinese people for their patriotism, hard-work and tenacity.Al Dhaheri said that Chinese civilization has a very long history and contains precious wealth.

                In the future, how an AI utopia would work
            </a>
            <p>
                It is more than 500 years since Sir Thomas More found inspiration for the "Kingdom of Utopia" while taking a stroll on the streets of Antwerp, Belgium. So, when I traveled there from Dubai in May to speak about artificial intelligence (AI), I couldn't help but draw parallels to Raphael Hythloday, the character in Utopia who regales sixteenth-century Britons with tales of a better world.As home to the world's first Minister of AI, as well as museums, academics and foundations dedicated to studying the future, Dubai is on its own Hythloday-esque voyage. While Europe, in general, has grown increasingly anxious about technological threats to employment, the United Arab Emirates has enthusiastically embraced the labor-saving potential of AI and automation.There are practical reasons for this. The ratio of indigenous-to-foreign labor in the Gulf states is highly imbalanced, ranging from a high of 67 percent in Saudi Arabia to a low of 11 percent in the UAE. And because the region's desert environment cannot support further population growth, the prospect of replacing people with machines has become increasingly attractive.But there is also a deeper cultural difference between the two regions. Unlike Western Europe, the birthplace of both the Industrial Revolution and the "Protestant work ethic", Arab societies generally place a greater value on leisure time.In the industrialized West, technological forces threaten social contracts that have long rested on the three pillars of capital, labor and the state. For centuries, capital provided investment in machines, workers operated the machines to produce goods and services, and governments collected taxes, furnished public goods, and redistributed resources as needed. But this division of labor created a social system that is far more complicated than those of the Arab world and other non-industrialized economies.For their part, Arab states have nationalized natural resources, managed major industries and traded internationally. Until recently, population growth and declining revenues from natural resources threatened the social contract. But with technologies that can produce and distribute most of the goods and services required by what is essentially a leisure society, the existing social contract could actually be enhanced, rather than disrupted.In the West, the technological revolution appears to have widened the gap between capital owners and everyone else. While productivity has been increasing, labor's share of total income has shrunk. Apart from the capital owners, a leisure class of yuppies and heirs has also captured a sizable share of the surplus created by productivity-enhancing technologies. The biggest losers are those with low incomes and less education.Yet, even here, focusing on AI's potential impact on the relationship between capital and employment is shortsighted. After all, populism has surged in many Western countries at a time of near-historic lows in unemployment. Arguably, the current discontent reflects a desire for a better quality of life, not more work.The French "yellow vest" protesters were initially responding to policies that would have raised the costs of their commutes; Britons who voted to leave the European Union were hoping that contributions to the bloc would be redirected to public services at home. Most anti-globalization and anti-immigration rhetoric is born of an anxiety about crime, cultural change and other quality-of-life issues, not jobs.The problem is that, under the Western social contract, a desire for more leisure can translate into mutually incompatible demands. Voters want reduced working hours but higher incomes, and they expect governments to continue generating enough tax revenue to provide healthcare, pensions and education. No wonder Western politics has reached an impasse.Fortunately, AI and data-driven innovation could offer a way forward. In what could be perceived as a kind of AI utopia, the paradox of a bigger state with a smaller budget could be reconciled, because the government would have the tools to expand public goods and services at a very small cost.The biggest hurdle would be cultural: As early as 1948, German philosopher Joseph Pieper warned against the "proletarianization" of people and called for leisure to be the basis for culture. Westerners would have to abandon their obsession with the work ethic, as well as their deep-seated resentment toward "free riders". They would have to start differentiating between work that is necessary for a dignified existence, and work that is geared toward amassing wealth and achieving status. The former could potentially be all but eliminated.With the right mindset, all societies could start to forge a new AI-driven social contract, wherein the state would capture a larger share of the return on assets, and distribute the surplus generated by AI and automation to residents. Publicly owned machines would produce a wide range of goods and services, from generic drugs, food, clothes and housing, to basic research, security and transportation.Some will view these outlays as unjustified market intervention; others will worry that the government might fail to meet public demand for various goods and services. But, again, such arguments are shortsighted. Given the pace of advances in AI and automation, state-owned production systems－operating nonstop－will have an almost unlimited supply capacity. The only limitation will be natural resources, a constraint that would continue to drive technological innovation in search of more sustainable management.In an AI utopia, government intervention would be the norm, and private production the exception. The private sector would correct government or collective failures, rather than the government correcting for market failures.Imagine traveling forward in time to 2071, the UAE's centenary. A future Raphael Hythloday visiting Antwerp from Dubai would bear the following news: Where I live, the government owns and operates the machines that produce most necessary goods and services, allowing the people to spend their time on leisure, creative and spiritual pursuits. All worries about employment and tax rates have been consigned to the past. That could be your world, too.The author is director of Strategy and Research at the Dubai Future Foundation and a non-resident fellow at The Lisbon Council.

                Domestic tourists set their sights on long-haul destinations

            <p>
                An increasing number of Chinese visitors are looking to long-haul tourism markets in search of adventures and new traveling experiences, according to a report by OAG, a world leading travel data provider.The analysis of OAG's Traffic Analyzer data found that the number of Chinese passengers in February, when the weeklong Chinese New Year holiday fell, grew by more than 20 percent year-on-year in 15 countries, online media ChinaTravelNews reported.The data company attributed the remarkable surge to the rising services of direct flights provided to link more Chinese cities, especially those of the second tier, to long-haul tourism markets.Of the 15 countries, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates grabbed the top two positions in February, reporting growth of 39 percent and 28 percent, respectively, from a year before.The lure of the UK, as OAG indicates, lies in that visitors can see everything from Buckingham Palace to the Tower of London, and then head north to the wilds of Scotland to see castles and sample whisky in Speyside.The European nation attracted more than 1 million Chinese visitors in 2018.The UAE, a leisure destination offering luxury shopping malls and opulent hotels, has attracted big-spending visitors from China, according to the report. It welcomed more than 672,000 Chinese visitors last year.The report showed that 10 of the 15 countries with the biggest growth of Chinese visitors are in Europe, including Switzerland, Belgium and Serbia, reflecting the growing desire of Chinese travelers to seek out new and authentic experiences off the traditional tourist trail.Iceland, the smallest country market among the top 15, has seen a 79 percent increase, or 2,000 Chinese visitors, in February.Though the figure is small, it represents a strong growth trend as the total Chinese visitors numbered nearly 16,000 for the full year of 2018, the report said. It attracts tourists with its unspoiled natural scenery, fresh air and a chance to see the Aurora Borealis, said the report.Mexico stood out in South America, where the number of Chinese visitors surged 64 percent year-on-year in February.In 2018, about 95,000 passengers traveled from China to Mexico, up 26 percent from the previous year.Besides its cultural heritage and historical sites, the great efforts of the country's national tourism board, Visit Mexico, should be praised, according to the report.While fully embracing the use of WeChat, a popular Chinese social media platform, as a tool to communicate with potential Chinese visitors, the tourism board has also launched a website in Mandarin and has recently started a new tourism campaign designed to attract Chinese tourists.
