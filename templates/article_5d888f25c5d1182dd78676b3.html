                Tough Brexit road ahead for Johnson

                On his first day as British prime minister on Thursday, Boris Johnson told Parliament that he hoped the European Union would rethink its refusal to make any changes to the Brexit deal. Stressing that no "self-respecting" country could accept the "withdrawal agreement", Johnson said that with energy and optimism, the EU could be convinced.But, he added, if Brussels couldn't be persuaded to do so, "we will of course have to leave ... without an agreement". He stressed that Britain is better prepared for that scenario than many would like to believe, but more work has to be done for that outcome. "In the 98 days that remain to us, we must turbo-charge our preparations to make sure there is as little disruption as possible to our national life," Johnson said, referring to the Brexit deadline of Oct 31.After winning the Conservative Party's leadership election on Tuesday and a day before he was sworn in as the prime minister, Johnson had vowed to deliver Brexit, unite the country, energize the economy and defeat the opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.But will this "can do" spirit help Johnson bridge the divide in the country and overcome its external challenges?The Brexit impasse has already cost the Conservative Party dear in the local elections as well as the European Parliament election, which eventually forced Theresa May to resign as prime minister. Yet it is still unclear how Johnson will break the impasse.As an ideal opposition party leader, Corbyn didn't waste time in reminding the members of Parliament on Thursday that Johnson backed May's Brexit deal, saying: "Can he explain this flip-flopping?" And quoting US President Donald Trump's remark that Johnson was "Britain's Trump", Corbyn said that the failure to "take back control" ("Vote Leave" slogan during the Brexit referendum) could make the United Kingdom "a vassal state of Trump's America".Which shows how tough the Brexit road ahead for Johnson is. On the one hand, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president-elect, has indicated the EU could extend the Brexit deadline but not reopen the negotiation on the Brexit deal. On the other hand, Johnson has vowed to not seek further extension of the deadline, and even reiterated the UK will leave the EU on Oct 31, with or without a deal.More important, since the British Parliament is in recess and will open only on Sept 3, Johnson has less than two months to break the Brexit deadlock in Parliament or face a "no-deal" Brexit.The majority of MPs have rejected a "no-deal" Brexit. Which is perhaps the only thing they seem to have agreed on. But Johnson insists Britain would leave the EU on Oct 31 even without a deal. These conflicting views could set Parliament and the new government on a clash course.Even if Johnson somehow manages to deliver Brexit - on Oct 31 or later - he will still have the arduous task of navigating Britain through the post-Brexit turmoil. The pound sterling has already dropped by about 15 percent since the referendum on Brexit was announced. And investment in Britain has stagnated, with some reports even indicating the country already has one foot in recession.Even with a soft Brexit, the UK's service industry will take a big hit, as the current agreed deal covers only commodity trade and not services. In particular, after leaving the EU, Britain's robust financial service industry will have to depend on the EU's "equivalence" arrangement, a patchwork of rules that gives different services different degrees of access to the EU states, which would be nowhere near the current unfettered access Britain has to the EU market.Externally, although Trump has welcomed Johnson's prime ministership, the leaked memo of Kim Darroch, former British ambassador to the US, has soured US-UK relations.And while the seizure of a British oil tanker by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz has created a new crisis, Britain's traditional partners - the United States and the 27 EU states - are at loggerheads over Iran, with the EU still trying to salvage the Iran nuclear deal despite the US threatening to impose more sanctions on Iran.As for Sino-British relations, Johnson is a well-known figure in China, because as London mayor, he was in Beijing to receive the Olympic flag at the closing ceremony of the 2008 Olympic Games since London was to host the 2012 Olympics.Johnson also welcomed Chinese developers to participate in several high-profile building projects in London. And in 2013, China and Britain forged a deal which made London the biggest offshore renminbi clearing center. Last year, the renminbi's trading volumes eclipsed those of the pound against the euro - a milestone in bilateral financial ties.Observers on both sides expect Johnson to strengthen Sino-British trade relations, because as British foreign minister in the May Cabinet, he advocated free trade with China. In particular, since a large part of Johnson's leadership campaign focused on the possible post-Brexit deals with non-EU economies, it is possible that under his prime ministership, Britain will become the first European country to sign a free trade agreement with China.The author is an assistant professor at Hunan University's School of Public Management and a visiting researcher at Tsinghua University's Belt and Road Research Institute.

                    EU's ties with US among challenges for its new chief

                Rising trade tensions, sharp differences on multilateralism await von der LeyenUrsula von der Leyen, the upcoming first female president of the European Commission, is expected to face multiple challenges in managing relations with the United States.A trade war may be looming between the traditional allies in addition to their sharp differences on issues ranging from climate change and the Iran nuclear deal to multilateralism and the reform of the World Trade Organization.Sabine Weyand, the European Commission's director-general of trade, said in Washington on Monday that the European Union would not be bullied by the threat of sanctions that it views as illegal under WTO rules, and will retaliate if the US imposes punitive tariffs on European cars, according to a Reuters report.The US has threatened to impose 25 percent punitive tariffs on imported European cars in the name of national security, while the EU has said it will retaliate with its own tariffs targeting 20 billion euros ($22.4 billion) in US exports."We will not negotiate under WTO illegal action. Nor will we go down the road of managed trade," Weyand said at an event sponsored by the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies.Weyand and Deputy US Trade Representative Jeffrey Gerrish held talks in Washington on Monday and Tuesday. The talks came days after a renewed threat, made by US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland in an interview with Politico, that the US remains ready to impose car tariffs, or other actions, with "immediate financial consequences" for the EU if there is no progress in bilateral trade talks, or if countries such as France and the United Kingdom go ahead with plans for a digital services tax.France recently approved a 3 percent tax on revenue generated by large digital companies in its territory, targeting companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. A Washington Post editorial on Sunday said the digital services tax could set off another trade war.The Office of the US Trade Representative launched an investigation into the case last week under Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, which would give it the power to impose retaliatory tariffs in response to unfair trade practices.Jean-Claude Juncker, the outgoing European Commission president, reached a truce with US President Donald Trump in July last year to hold off on carrying out tariff threats. But the two sides have failed to reach a compromise on key issues.The US has demanded the inclusion of agriculture in the talks, but EU directives exclude any agricultural products. Cecilia Malmstrom, the EU's trade chief, reiterated last week that the EU is not ready to discuss agriculture as part of the talks.Since the EU's trade negotiation directives are set by EU member states, von der Leyen does not have room for concessions. France has been firm against the inclusion of agriculture in trade talks.In February, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a close ally of former German defense minister von der Leyen, called the Trump administration's suggestion that European cars are a threat to US national security a "shock".Trump said in May that imports of cars and certain car parts from the EU and Japan "threaten to impair the national security of the United States" and directed US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to address the threat in trade talks with those countries in the following six months. The potential November deadline will come just days after von der Leyen takes office.Shada Islam, the director of Europe and geopolitics at the Brussels-based think tank Friends of Europe, said von der Leyen has so far focused more on domestic EU policies than on foreign relations."Her focus will be on crafting a 21st century industrial policy and competition policy which will make the EU a more self-confident global economic actor," Islam said.Islam said von der Leyen's key foreign policy priority will be to manage the troubled transatlantic relationship, with a focus on avoiding an escalation of trade tensions."Do not expect her to be 'softer' than Juncker, but she will try and get off to a good start. However, differences over Iran, the Middle East and trade are likely to make this difficult," Islam told China Daily.In its summary for an upcoming report, Bruegel, an economic think tank based in Brussels, said the Trump presidency has created serious doubts in the US about the reliability and implications of the alliance."Moreover, the Trump administration has actively reduced the support it gives to the multilateral order and has used its unique position within the global economic order to extract immediate economic gains or secure geopolitical goals," it said.

                 Boris Johnson sets out his vision for future on first day as national leaderBoris Johnson began the task of forming the United Kingdom's next government on Wednesday after his comfortable victory over rival Jeremy Hunt in the race to replace Theresa May as Conservative Party leader and Britain's prime minister.The Oxford-educated one-time journalist and former mayor of London officially took over the reins after an audience with Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, becoming the 14th person to serve as UK prime minister since she was crowned in 1952.The BBC said Johnson's priority will be to put together a team that will reflect "modern Britain" and that will include more women and more people from ethnic minorities, as well as one that will unite his divided party.He is expected to continue making appointments to his Cabinet for several days, including for the crucial position of finance minister following the resignation of Philip Hammond on Wednesday, who stood down in protest at Johnson's Brexit stance.Speaking outside 10 Downing Street, Johnson praised May for her "fortitude and patience" and for her "deep sense of public service" but said he will now focus on not only Brexit but on improving social care, education, and law and order."The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts," he said while praising British values and insisting that a favorable deal with the EU is still possible."Do not underestimate our country," he added.May, meanwhile, formally tendered her resignation to the queen after her final Prime Minister's Questions, during which MPs, both friends and foes alike, thanked her for her efforts and wished her well.

                    Mike Pompeo wraps up Brussels trip
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Top US diplomat seeks 'reset' with EU yet Trump tweet disparages the blocUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrapped a two-day visit to Brussels on Tuesday aimed to "reset" a fast deteriorating relationship, but the transatlantic divide is growing wider on many critical issues.In Brussels, Pompeo met new European Parliament President David Sassoli as well as three incoming leaders: Ursula von der Leyen, the next president of the European Commission; Charles Michel, the next president of the European Council; and next top EU diplomat, Josep Borrell. The three will take office in the coming months.Pompeo did not meet outgoing EU leaders such as European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, European Council President Donald Tusk and EU foreign policy chief Federica Morgherini.A European Commission spokeswoman did not comment on the meetings at daily briefings. The US State Department released a brief statement, saying Pompeo and Van der Leyen "reaffirmed that a strong US-EU partnership is critical to prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic and around the world"."The two expressed a shared commitment to working together on a broad range of global issues," said the statement.US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland described the trip as "solely and exclusively to see the four leaders with the objective of resetting our relationship", according to Reuters."Our relationship had reached multiple impasses on multiple fronts and resulted in a lot of uncomfortable, cranky conversations," Sondland said, adding that US President Donald Trump had endorsed the trip.But the words were immediately followed by Trump's tweet on Tuesday, saying those who want him to "get together with the EU and others to go after China trade practice remember, the EU & all treat us VERY unfairly on Trade also. Will change!"The transatlantic relations have taken a dramatic downturn since Trump took office in January 2017. Trump's decisions to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal have shocked EU leaders, who see the landmark deals as their major achievements on global stage.The US and the EU are also risking a trade war. Both have threatened punitive tariffs on each other over aircraft subsidy row involving Boeing and Airbus.While they reached a deal last month to boost US beef export to Europe, Trump has indicated that additional tariffs on European cars are never off the table, an especially disturbing message to EU's largest economy Germany, which is a major car exporter to US and experiencing an economic slowdown.Trump has also threatened to slap punitive tariffs on French wines if France goes ahead with the digital services tax that targets tech giants such as Google, Facebook and Amazon.At the G7 summit in France late last month, Tusk, the European Council president, vowed that EU will "respond in kind" if Trump punishes French products. He said the EU "will protect French wine with genuine determination" and "France can count on our loyalty".Besides opposing Trump's "America First" unilateralism and protectionist trade policy, EU leaders are angry at Trump's support for Brexit and no-deal Brexit and his disdain for the EU as an institution.In its memos made public on Tuesday to the new EU leadership, Bruegel, a leading European think tank based in Brussels, said "the US has become a less reliable partner than it was five years ago and some even doubt how strongly it will defend liberal democracy".It said while the EU is traditionally closer to the US, the Trump administration's rejection of multilateralism has made the EU uncomfortable with the US position, and has opened the door to closer political relations with China, which has assumed the mantle of multilateralism, according to the memos compiled by the think tank's scholars who are meeting in Brussels on Sept 4-5 for their annual meeting.

                    Brussels must fight protectionism with Beijing: China Daily editorial

                With the United States indiscriminately wielding the baton of trade protectionism, no country including its allies is immune to the toxic effects of the US' policies. Therefore, it is a relief to see the incoming European Union leadership determined to buttress multilateralism and oppose US protectionism.Naming her 27-member team on Tuesday, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission's president-elect, said: "I want the European Union to be the guardian of multilateralism. Because we know that we are stronger by doing together what we cannot do alone."Such a stance, consistent with the outgoing EC's leadership, is comforting in these times of unilateralism. It not only sends a positive signal to the world, including the EU's partners, such as China, but also shows how the bloc can cope with the many challenges that lie ahead.Indeed, at a time when the US administration shows an increasing penchant for intensifying the trade war, even Washington's closest allies in Europe could soon feel the full force of the US' "America first" strategy.That there is obvious anxiety in the EU leadership over trans-Atlantic trade frictions is reflected in the remarks of the EC's incoming trade representative, Phil Hogan, who pledged to seek to convince the US leader to see "the error of his ways" and abandon some of his "reckless" trade policies.Yet, aside from trade, European leaders cannot see eye to eye with the US leadership about other important global issues, too, including climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, as the US president has single-handedly torn apart important international and multilateral agreements.Admittedly, multilateralism, which helps build consensus to resolve disputes through negotiations and diplomatic efforts, is facing increasing challenges as the winds of unilateralism continue to blow from the US.Fortunately, influential international organizations such as the EU still promote multilateralism and free trade. Facing multifaceted challenges, the world needs cooperation, not confrontation.By resorting to confrontation, no country can expect to solve any of its problems. Instead, by so doing, it will cause even greater damage to itself and create more uncertainties for the world.With China and the EU both advocating multilateralism and cooperation, and sharing similar views on many global issues, it is hoped the new leadership in Brussels will join hands with Beijing in eliminating the threats posed by the US' protectionist and unilateral policies.

The parliament will convene next week in Strasbourg, France, but approval of all nominees is not certain.All nominees will have to appear at parliamentary hearings expected to start on Sept 30 before a final vote on the entire team at a plenary session in October.The executive team picked by the first woman to lead the commission for five years consists of 13 women and 14 men and includes a member from each state of the European Union.There are three executive vice-presidents, five vice-presidents and 18 commissioners."The team will shape the European way: We will take bold action against climate change, build our partnership with the United States, define our relations with a more self-assertive China and be a reliable neighbor, for example to Africa," she said on Tuesday, without elaboration on the relations with China."My commission will be a geopolitical commission committed to sustainable policies. And I want the European Union to be the guardian of multilateralism."Among the five vice-presidential nominees, Josep Borrell, a former Spanish foreign minister, would serve at High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Policy and Security Policy.Frans Timmermans of the Netherlands, who has been an executive vice-president overseeing regulations and interinstitutional relations, would now oversee the European Green Deal and climate action policy, an issue that is top of the EU's agenda."I want the European Green Deal to become Europe's hallmark. At the heart of it is our commitment to becoming the world's first climate-neutral continent," von der Leyen said.Margrethe Vestager of Denmark is tasked with an agenda of "Europe Fit for the Digital Age" and would continue as commissioner for competition. Vestager has already made a name as an commissioner under outgoing Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker for promoting strong antitrust regulations, drawing criticism from US President Donald Trump's administration.As an executive vice-president, Valdis Dombrovskis from Latvia would oversee an "Economy that Works for People" and be the commissioner for financial services.Phil Hogan, from Ireland, the incumbent commissioner for agriculture, would take over the commission's trade portfolio.Sharper trade weaponsVon der Leyen called for sharper trade weapons to take on Trump and tasked Hogan with developing new retaliation powers to hit back specially against countries that are blocking the dispute settlement system of the World Trade Organization, a message clearly directed at the US, according to the Politico news website.If approved by the European Parliament, the new commission members would assume office only one day after the scheduled Oct 31 deadline for Britain's departure from the EU, a major challenge facing the bloc.To pave way for the parliamentary approval, von der Leyen met on Tuesday afternoon with leaders of the main political groups in the parliament, including Manfred Weber from the conservative European People's Party, Iratxe Garcia from the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, and Dacian Ciolos of the liberal Renew Europe.Politico quoted officials from the main political groups as saying they would start work on assessing backgrounds and portfolios of commissioners at internal meetings in the coming days.
