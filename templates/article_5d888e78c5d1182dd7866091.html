                Inquiry: Sales of concert tickets a 'fixed game'
            </p>
            <p>
                Had a hard time getting a ticket to a concert or sporting event? New York's attorney general said that's probably because more than half of tickets to many events are held for industry insiders or otherwise unavailable to the general public. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a report released on Thursday that his investigation of the industry was prompted by consumer complaints, which his office receives regularly. "Ticketing, to put it bluntly, is a fixed game," the report said. Investigators found abuses and practices that prevent consumers from buying tickets at affordable prices or sometimes even getting them at all.

He also won the prize for 2007's 'There Will Be Blood' and 1989's 'My Left Foot', and has been nominated for his part in 'Gangs of New York' and 'In the Name of the Father' in previous years too.Meanwhile, Lawrence - who won an Oscar for widow Tiffany Maxwell in David O.Russell's 'Silver Linings Playbook' in 2013 - has been nominated for Best Supporting Actress for 'American Hustle' at the forthcoming 86th Academy Awards.'American Hustle' and 'Gravity' are currently in the lead at this year's Oscars with ten nominations each, while '12 Years A Slave' follows closely behind with nine.

                'Frozen,' famous musicians in fierce fight for best song Oscar
            </a>
            <p>
                Actor Josh Gad, voice talent for "Olaf" in the animated film "Frozen", poses at the 51st annual Publicists Guild Awards in Beverly Hills, California February 28, 2014. [Photo/Agencies]A recent Grammy winner, a legendary rock band, a Broadway star belting out a girl-power ballad and an impossibly cool indie rocker have found themselves at the juncture of one of the most compelling Oscar races of the year: best original song.It's a category that has drawn big names and some drama of its own, and a lot of buzz around one song in particular that many girls and their parents are now playing in their heads; "Let It Go," from Disney's blockbuster animated film "Frozen.""The song category is the most interesting category in my opinion, and it's drawn the biggest campaigning this year," said Matthew Belloni, executive editor of trade magazine The Hollywood Reporter.The best original song category drew attention early in the race when Oscars organizers revoked a nomination for "Alone Yet Not Alone," from an independent Christian faith movie of the same name, citing improper campaigning by the songwriter.The remaining four contenders span a wide spectrum of genres: Grammy winner Pharrell Williams' upbeat R&B ditty "Happy" from "Despicable Me 2," Broadway star Idina Menzel's inspirational interpretation of "Let It Go," indie rocker Karen O's dreamy ballad "The Moon Song" from "Her," and U2's rock-infused "Ordinary Love" from "Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom."All four acts will lend their star power on the Oscars stage on Sunday to sing the nominated tunes.

                No surprise: The new U2 album shines
            </a>
            <p>
                Everything about U2's new album, Songs of Innocence, is unexpected. Like its very existence, for one, after the Irish rock band dropped it on iTunes users on Tuesday in a surprise move.Then there's its intriguingly narrow and personal scope. And its playful musical adventurousness, which amounts to a smooth shifting of gears over variable terrain on a road course as the group works through songs inspired by things that seemingly have little do with each other. Each, however, is an experience from youth and young manhood for singer Bono, guitarist The Edge, bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr.Anthemic opener The Miracle (of Joey Ramone) is a tribute to The Ramones, the band that fired Bono's imagination as a teen. The band wraps punk-like power chords in its usual finery and transforms a monosyllabic garage rock "ohohohoh" chorus into an ethereal gospel-tinged hallelujah. "Everything I ever lost now has been returned, the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard," Bono sings.

                Stars divided ahead of Scottish vote
            </a>
            <p>
                Scotland's independence battle is a tough one to call. The Yes side has James Bond, but the No campaign has Harry Potter.Former 007 Sean Connery has long been a vocal Scottish nationalist - from his home in the Bahamas. Earlier this year, he backed independence and said the "core democratic value that the people of Scotland are the best guardians of their own future".In the other corner stands J.K. Rowling, Edinburgh-based creator of the boy wizard. When she said independence might be "a historically bad mistake" - and backed it up with a million-pound ($1.6 million) donation to the No campaign - it sent a Dementor-like chill through the Yes camp.

                U2's One named as perfect bedtime lullaby
            </a>
            <p>
                Irish rock band U2 is one of the most popular groups in the world, estimated to have sold more than 150 million albums worldwide during the course of a recording career spanning four decades and playing to sell-out crowds across the globe. But now they have earned an unlikely new honor after researchers judged one of their most popular songs to be the formulaic perfect lullaby.Children's bedding company Cuckooland teamed up with online music streaming platform Spotify, looking at 4,500 different songs that are regularly chosen for bedtime playlists, before selecting the track One, from U2's 1991 appropriately named release Achtung Baby, as the ideal soothing bedtime music.Analyzing popular choices on Spotify, the researchers calculated the average beats per minute, key and time signatures to close in on the ideal formula."The function of a lullaby is to soothe a baby and put them to sleep, so common features we would expect to see in lullabies would be, a slow (ish) tempo, relatively quiet dynamics, simple rhythm pattern-potentially one that imitates a rocking movement－a simple melody that's easier to memorize and easier to sing, predictability achieved by repetitive phrases and verses, and a high pitch due to the connotations that mothers/females usually sing lullabies," said Annaliese Grimaud from the school of music and science at Durham University in the UK.In contrast to many of U2's more upbeat tracks, One is a slower, more somber tune, which band singer Bono has described as being "a song about coming together, but it's not the old hippie idea of 'Let's all live together'.It is, in fact, the opposite. It's saying, We are one, but we're not the same."The lyrics of the chorus read "One life, You got to do what you should/One life, With each other, Sisters and my brothers/One life, But we're not the same, We get to carry each other, carry each other."It has been covered by many artists and released as a fundraising track for people affected by Aids, and the turbulent European political backdrop against which it was produced in the early 1990s have made it an anthem of hope in situations of strife and conflict.In an interview for Rolling Stone magazine, Bono said how it was recorded in Germany at the end of the Cold War, produced in Ireland and then performed "going around Europe when stuff was going on in Bosnia, sometimes 300 miles from where we were playing", all places of upheaval and conflict, which make it an unlikely choice for a lullaby.In the book U2 by U2, Bono told author Neil McCormick "It's a reminder that we have no choice…. Like it or not, the only way out of here is if I give you a leg up the wall and you pull me after you.There's something very unromantic about that."
