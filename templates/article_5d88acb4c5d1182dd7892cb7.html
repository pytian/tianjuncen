                Hurricane Dorian lumbers along US Atlantic coast
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Hurricane Dorian drifted up Florida's east coast on Tuesday, weaker in strength but larger in size, according to the National Hurricane Center.After battering the Bahamas with storm surges that killed five people and destroyed 13,000 homes, Dorian became a slow-moving Category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 mph by Tuesday afternoon.As of 7 pm EDT, the hurricane was 125 miles east of Melbourne, Florida, moving northwest at 6 mph, according to weather.com.More than 2 million residents in the coastal regions of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina have been urged to evacuate to avoid widespread flooding that Dorian could bring even if the storm's center stayed offshore.Walt Disney World and SeaWorld in Orlando planned to close.After days of warnings to flee the storm, many residents of Florida's coast remained unsure whether to wait it out or evacuate."I know it's a mandatory evacuation, but everyone I talked to is staying, and I don't know what to do. But I'm going to be ready and packed up in case I need to get on the road if they close those bridges," said Linda Cassano, a 53-year-old beautician who lives on Jacksonville Beach, as she stocked up on water and food.South Carolina Governor Brian Kemp said of his state's preparations: "We're taking the 'better safe than sorry' attitude."NHC's projections showed North Carolina also could get hit hard later in the week.As of Tuesday evening, the eye of the hurricane had moved away from Grand Bahama but was expected to continue to pummel the island through the evening.Hurricane Dorian's 24-hour onslaught in the Bahamas left people trapped in their attics. The storm destroyed houses, left cars stacked on top of each other and overturned boats, according to The Associated Press.Dorian also killed one person in Puerto Rico. When the hurricane first hit the island on Sunday, it had sustained winds of 185 mph and gusts of up to 220 mph.The storm's high winds and torrential rain turned into brown floodwater streaming down streets while winds buffeted palm trees and houses in Abaco and Grand Bahama, which have a population of about 70,000.The US Coast Guard airlifted at least 21 people from Abaco Island after Dorian first hit on Sunday.The US military has been authorized to provide logistics, health and engineering support to the Bahamas for up for 14 days if needed, General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, the head of US Northern Command, told reporters Tuesday.Red Cross spokesman Matthew Cochrane said more than 13,000 houses in Grand Bahama and Abaco were believed to be severely damaged or destroyed.The United Nations said more than 60,000 people on the islands will need food, and the Red Cross said that 62,000 will need clean drinking water.Health Minister Duane Sands said that Dorian had left the main hospital unusable. He said he planned to send a medical team to the Abaco islands.Theo Neilly, the Bahamian consul general in Washington, said the damage on Grand Bahama was expected to be "very devastating".Lia Head-Rigby helps run a local hurricane relief organization and surveyed the damage while she flew over Abaco Island."It's total devastation. It's decimated. Apocalyptic," she told AP. "It looks like a bomb went off. It's not rebuilding something that was there; we have to start again."She said a colleague on Abaco told her "there's a lot more dead", and that the bodies were being collected.Crews were trying to airlift several kidney patients from Abaco who had not received dialysis treatment since Friday, AP reported.Videos of desperate residents trapped in the storm surfaced on social media."Please pray for us, please pray for us everyone. … Me and my baby and everyone that stays in our apartment building our stuck right here … pray for Abaco … my baby's only 4 months old," an unnamed woman pleaded in a video posted on social media.Reuters contributed to this story.

                    Pompeo: Taliban 'overreached' in attack that killed American
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that Taliban "overreached" with a car bomb attack in Kabul that killed an American soldier, leading President Donald Trump to call off closely-held Afghanistan peace talks planned for Camp David.Pompeo said the Trump administration has recalled envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who has been negotiating with Taliban leaders for months in Qatar, and it will be up to the insurgent group whether talks will resume.Critics denounced Trump's plan to hold the Camp David meeting just days before the 18th anniversary of the Sept 11 attacks, and they said Trump was giving legitimacy to extremists who are responsible for the deaths of more than 2,400 US service members in America's longest war.Pompeo said Trump wanted to look the Taliban leaders "in the eye" while Khalilzad worked to finalize an agreement that would allow the US to start withdrawing troops. Pompeo defended Trump's planned talks, saying the presidential retreat in Maryland was an "appropriate place", given that it had been the venue for Mideast peace negotiations and other diplomatic meetings.Trump tweeted Saturday night that he canceled negotiations with the Taliban in the wake of Thursday's car bombing that killed an American soldier, a Romanian service member and 10 civilians in a busy diplomatic area near the US Embassy in the Afghan capital. The bombing was one of many attacks by the Taliban in recent days. Sgt. 1st Class Elis A. Barreto Ortiz, 34, was the fourth US service member killed in the past two weeks in Afghanistan."They tried to use terror to improve their negotiating position," said Pompeo, who appeared on five Sunday TV talk shows. "The Taliban overreached."Pompeo said the agreement in principle that had been negotiated with the Taliban included their commitment to break with al-Qaida. The Taliban harbored al-Qaida before that group conducted the 9/11 attacks against the United States."And then the Taliban failed to live up to a series of commitments that they had made, and when that happened President Trump said, 'I'm not going to take that deal. I'm not going to work with someone that can't deliver on their commitments,'" Pompeo said.The Afghan government says it doesn't believe talks between the United States and Taliban will continue "at this stage." Taliban said Americans would be the ones who suffer from Trump's cancellation of the talks.Afghan presidential spokesman Sediq Sediqqi confirmed that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had wanted to go to Washington to speak with Trump about his concerns "but I am not able to go into the details of the particular trip." The details of the US-Taliban deal that had been shown to Ghani last week "were not convincing," Sediqqi said. "Let's see the future."The Taliban said canceling the talks damages "the credibility" of the US, but that they think the US will return to the negotiations.AP

                    Google faces new multi-state anti-trust investigation over allegations of monopoly
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                SAN FRANCISCO - US search giant Google LLC is facing a new multi-state anti-trust probe by 50 attorneys general (AG), Texas AG Ken Paxton's office said Monday.The bipartisan investigation will probe the "anticompetitive practices of Google that harm consumers," Paxton tweeted.The probe will mainly focus on Google's advertising and search businesses as Paxton accused Google of dominating all aspects of advertising on the Internet and searching on the Internet."This investigation is not a lawsuit. It is an investigation to determine the facts," Paxton told a press conference, suggesting the probe may be expanded to other areas, according to a video clip posted online by Paxton's office."The facts will lead where the facts will lead," he said.A report by The Washington Post said Google is expected to yield more than $48 billion in digital ad revenue on the US market this year, capturing 75 percent of all spending on US search advertising.The probe includes AGs from 48 US states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, with California and Alabama the only two states whose AGs are not involved.Google has become a frequent target of regulatory and public scrutiny recently as many people grow more skeptical about it growing into a "too big" company that dwarfs its rivals.The European Union has imposed $9 billion on the US hi-tech company in competition-related fines over the past three years.
