                On Aug 5, Chinese currency renminbi (RMB) breached the 7-yuan-per-1 dollar mark in both onshore and offshore forex markets for the first time since the 2015 exchange rate reform.What exactly does this indicate?As early as the beginning of this year, at the CEIBS Financial Management Salon, I made it clear that like in the stock market, where volatility is the norm, the RMB volatility is the norm in the foreign exchange market. "There is no need to panic over the RMB breaching the 7-yuan-per-dollar threshold," I said at the event.According to the country's balance of payments, China has enjoyed many years' of trade surplus (that is, exports were larger than imports) and capital account surplus, which have helped it to build massive foreign exchange reserves.This leads to a fundamental question: Is it a case of "more is better "when it comes to foreign exchange reserves? The answer is no.Let's look at it from a monetary policy perspective.The most important component of any monetary policy is money supply. In the graph alongside, the red line represents China's economic growth, and the blue one shows China's money supply. We can see that the blue line is significantly above the red one. This phenomenon is called an excess supply of money.So, has the People's Bank of China put more money on the market than is needed? No. As a penny of collateral corresponds to the same amount of money, more collateral naturally means more money supplied. It just means that we have more collateral. Where does the collateral come from? Obviously, the bulk of it is in foreign exchange reserves.Under the previous monetary policy, China's money supply was largely based on the amount of foreign exchange reserves it had. As the amount of RMB put on the market was largely dependent on dollar inflows and outflows, the PBOC's power over money supply was effectively controlled by the US Fed.In this sense, the yuan was not an independent currency, but a "sub-currency" affiliated to the dollar. Obviously, this was not helpful for the internationalization of the renminbi. To reform the money supply system, China had to eliminate its reliance on the yuan funds outstanding for foreign exchange.In 2015, the PBOC introduced a new mechanism called "commercial bank credit asset collateral", under which the central bank allows commercial banks to use credit asset collateral to re-lend. Financial institutions have more wiggle room with lending, and their loan business is expected to grow bigger and more significant.What comes to mind when you hear the RMB exchange rate? The first thing you think of might be 6.9 or 6.8. That's the dollar exchange rate against the yuan, not the RMB exchange rate as we know it.This misconception is due to the fact that the renminbi was pegged to the dollar for a long period of time. You might wonder what the dollar exchange rate is. In fact, the dollar exchange rate is called the "dollar index", a measure of the value of the dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies. As this basket does not contain the renminbi, the yuan does not have equal status relative to the dollar.The RMB index stood at 100 at the end of 2014, and five years on, it is now around 95 or 96. We can see that although the yuan has slipped past 7 to the dollar, the RMB index has remained stable, with only a slight decline.As the RMB index is a measure of the yuan's exchange rate against a basket of its peers, and as the strength of the dollar means varying degrees of weakness of a basket of currencies, the RMB index is lower naturally.In the past, the yuan was pegged only to the dollar. That's why, people thought of the yuan/dollar exchange rate when they heard the renminbi exchange rate. In its exchange rate policy reform, the PBOC pegged the yuan to a basket of currencies.As a result, the yuan/dollar exchange rate is no longer fixed, but is a floating one. So, it is worth reiterating here: Like in the stock market, where volatility is the norm, the yuan volatility is the norm in the foreign exchange market. There is no need to make a fuss about the yuan breaching 7.0.We've heard a lot about the need to internationalize the RMB. What is an international currency like? The dollar is an international currency, and how does it circulate around the world?The US trade deficit with trading partners is a major cause of outflows of dollars, while in the US Treasury market, the world's largest financial market with massive inflows and outflows of dollars, there are substantial foreign holdings of US government debt denominated in US dollars.In addition, international trade in oil and commodities is also settled in dollars, serving as the final link in the global circulation cycle of the dollar.But there is yet to be such a cycle for the yuan.First of all, China is a trade surplus country. More goods are exported than imported, resulting in net inflows of the renminbi from overseas.Second of all, China inbound investment has always exceeded outbound investment, meaning that inflows of the yuan are greater than outflows. So, in order to turn the renminbi into a global currency, China has to create a global circulation cycle, and the key lies in opening up new capital accounts.Last year marks the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up. Having successfully upgraded itself from a labor-intensive economy to a capital-intensive economy, China should start to export capital overseas according to the principle of comparative advantage.China's capital intensity ratio was 1 percent in 2001, and as of 2016, it was 18 percent, marking an 18-fold growth. Now, with overcapacity, and excess inventory and capital, China should go global supported by capital accounts, facilitating outflows of the renminbi through overseas investment and export of capital. Meanwhile, China should bring back the renminbi by exporting industrial products. Then, a full circulation cycle of the yuan will be completed.On the international level, there are two pillars underpinning the renminbi's internationalization. The first is the creditworthiness of China as the world's second-largest economy; and the second is China's gold reserves. As well as foreign exchange reserves, central banks are also major holders of gold and other securities. The PBOC has built up vast gold reserves, which are of great significance to the internationalization of the renminbi.Businesses investing overseas may not be fully appreciative of the risks related to cross-border investment - including political, regulatory, market, foreign exchange, and legal compliance risks - but financial institutions as service providers for businesses must be fully prepared to mitigate such risks as they go global themselves.Zhang Yimin is a professor of finance at the China Europe International Business School (CEIBS).

                 Chinese culture promoted around the worldEditor's note: In "Footprint", a series of stories recalling important examples of China interacting with the rest of the world, we follow the path the country has taken in the past seven decades.Park Kyung-na is proud of being the first person employed by the world's first Confucius Institute, a China-funded organization that promotes the country's language and culture globally.Park vividly remembers the institute's official launch in Seoul, South Korea, in November 2004."The opening ceremony was full of joy and was attended by representatives from all sectors, from government officials to cultural figures," said Park, who is deputy director of the Confucius Institute in Seoul, or CIS."It took us almost a year to get everything ready. I was very excited about the role the Confucius Institute was going to play" in teaching the language and cultural exchanges, Park said."Over the past 15 years, CIS has developed in leaps and bounds, together with the rapid expansion of the whole Confucius Institutes global network," Park said. "The operation has become more systematic and we can now offer a lot more programs."There are now 536 Confucius Institutes and 1,139 Confucius Classrooms in 157 countries, providing educational opportunities to some 11 million students.CIS Director Lee Joon-sik said the ultimate goal is to help the people of the Republic of Korea to understand China better through language.A fundamental mission of the institute is to popularize the Chinese language while enhancing communication between the ROK and China in education and culture, said Lee, who has led CIS since 2015.After China and the Republic of Korea established diplomatic relations in 1992, Chinese-language education became increasingly popular in the country, leading to the formation of CIS in 2004.With 23 in total, the ROK is now home to the most Confucius Institutes in Asia, according to the Confucius Institute Headquarters.The Confucius Institute Headquarters said the centers are often situated at universities and schools.A staff member from the Headquarters said: “The Confucius Institute has created a unique model of cooperation with local universities. Only when there is a need to learn Chinese somewhere and apply to us, will we build a Confucius Institute with local universities.”Although the first Confucius Institute has helped people in the ROK to learn Chinese and be-come more familiar with Chinese culture, Koreans have a long history of using Chinese characters, as the Korean alphabet was only created in the mid-15th century. Today, many secondary schools in the ROK continue to offer Chinese lessons.Lee said: “Koreans have been interested in Chinese culture since ancient times. The older generation, in particular, is familiar with important Chinese works such as the Analects of Confucius, classic novels like Romance of the Three Kingdoms and famous poets such as Li Bai and Du Fu.”Recognized standardToday, more than 500 students visit CIS each month to learn Chinese, from primary school and university students, to office workers and retirees. Most of them hope to improve their speaking skills and pass the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi, or HSK, the Chinese Proficiency Test, to improve their job prospects.The HSK result is a generally recognized standard to judge the level of a student’s Chinese by many schools in the ROK, Lee said. “The main reason these students learn Chinese is because they think ROK-China relations will become closer, so learning the Chinese language and culture will be conducive for their development.”However, some students are learning purely out of interest, Lee said.The ability to speak Chinese has become an important measure of talent in many companies in the ROK. As China is the country’s biggest trading partner, and a free trade agreement between the two nations was signed in 2015, many ROK enterprises, including the conglomerates Samsung, LG and SK, see passing the HSK test as a bonus for their job candidates.Li Hong, education counselor at the Chinese embassy in the ROK, told People’s Daily in May that last year, the number of students sitting the HSK in the ROK exceeded 110,000, more than any other country. Some 500 students sat the test when it was first held in the ROK in 1993.To meet demand, CIS offers a wide range of lectures on Chinese classical literature, economy, culture, tourism and poems. It also holds the annual “Chinese Bridge” Language Competition, along with Chinese singing and calligraphy contests in the ROK.CIS also works with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences on a quarterly Chinese-language magazine called Contemporary Korea, bringing together researchers from both countries as well as those around the region to examine the latest news on ROK politics, economy, culture and education.CIS can not only promote Chinese-language education in the ROK, it is also acts like a bridge for mutual communication,” said Lee, the CIS director.As China’s economy and standing on the world stage have made rapid advances, there has also been a sharp increase in the global demand to learn Chinese.China began establishing non-profit public institutions which the aim of promoting Chinese language and culture in other countries 15 years ago. The institutions were named the ancient Chinese thinker Confucius.“Teaching the Chinese language and culture promotes global diversity and is an important channel for advancing common development that benefits China as well as the host countries,” the Headquarters said.The Confucius Institute has helped to promote cultural exchanges by advancing teaching methods and offering a wide range of educational and cultural activities.For example, it offers Chinese-language education, training for Chinese-language teachers, con-ducts Chinese-language tests and issues teachers’ certificates. It provides consultancy services on Chinese language and education, as well as hosting language and cultural exchange events between China and other countries.Since its establishment, cultural activities held by Confucius Institutes worldwide have attracted more than 100 million people.More than 10,000 Chinese directors of Confucius Institutes, teachers and volunteers are selected and sent each year to teach Chinese in various countries.Language competitionEvery year, more than 100,000 teenagers worldwide take part in the preliminary rounds and finals of the “Chinese Bridge” Language Competition. The institute also welcomes tens of thou-sands of education officials, school principals, teachers and students to China each year to experience Chinese culture.Lee Hambee, 28, a student taking the Chinese translation and interpretation course at the Confucius Institute in Seoul, said she chose to study there because she believes she can receive more formal Chinese language training at the institute, as it is directly managed by the Confucius Institute Headquarters in China.Lee lived in China for several years as her mother ran a business in the country, but did not formally start learning Chinese until she returned to the ROK. Now working in the entertainment industry, she hopes that mastering Chinese can lead to more career opportunities.“CIS has helped me to find the right method to learn Chinese, and teachers here also give accurate guidelines for learning,” Lee said.Han Minhwa, Lee’s teacher and head instructor at CIS, joined the institute in 2016. Han believes that practice is the key to learning a language. Every day, she gets up at 6 am and listens to Himalaya FM, one of the most popular podcast apps in China, before going to work.“At first, I was just doing this to find teaching resources, but now it has become a habit,” Han said.CIS now has some 30 teachers, including part-timers. In addition to locals such as Han, about one-third of its instructors are Chinese sent by the Headquarters, who are also responsible for CIS training courses aimed at nurturing prospective Chinese-language teachers.Volunteer groupsYang Xue and Shen Feifei, both Chinese-language teachers, come from Northeast China. Living in an area geographically close to the ROK, they have been exposed to the global popularity of the country’s pop culture.In 2012, Yang was among the first group of volunteer teachers from China to join a national ex-change program between the two countries to mark the 20th anniversary of bilateral ties. Later, she taught successively at Saint-Joseph University’s Confucius Institute in Lebanon and Shenyang Normal University in Liaoning province.Yang returned to the ROK to teach in 2016.Shen, a former volunteer for the program, believes that friendship between countries starts with individuals, and uses her spare time to deepen her understanding of the ROK.“Before I first arrived in the country (in 2016), I didn’t really know much about it … but I feel people here are very hospitable and polite,” said Shen, who has passed the highest level of the Test of Proficiency in Korean.After classes, Chinese and Korean teachers often sit together to discuss methods of instruction.“While Chinese instructors have the natural advantage of being native speakers, Koreans also have their advantages as learners, because they are more familiar with issues that ROK students may face,” Yang said. “By having meetings regularly, we use each other’s advantages to improve the overall teaching quality at CIS.”Encouraged by Confucius Institutes, more than 60 countries now include Chinese- language teaching in their national education systems, and over 170 nations have established Chinese-language courses or majors. Before 2004, there were fewer than 30 million Chinese learners worldwide. Now, the number exceeds 100 million.Students learning Chinese in the ROK have a higher goal than merely passing the HSK.Lee, the director, said CIS is in talks with several Chinese universities to launch an advanced Chinese-language training course by the end of this year for ROK high school students interested in studying in China.“In the past, ROK students mainly studied majors such as Chinese language and literature, but now they are interested in every subject, from history and business management, to science and engineering,” said Lee, who has worked in Chinese-language education for nearly 40 years.With this year marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China and the 15th anniversary of CIS, Lee said the institute will organize a series of events, including an international symposium on Chinese-language education in October.“Language is the prerequisite for communication,” said Lee, who is also a professor of Chinese language and literature at Sungkyunkwan University in the ROK. “When people understand Chinese themselves, instead of knowing China through third-party sources such as media reports, they can experience Chinese culture and learn about the country directly.”

                A golden opportunity for China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to synergize their development outlooks and deepen cooperation, that is what the 16th China-ASEAN Expo provides. No wonder Vice-Premier Han Zheng sounded upbeat while delivering a speech at the expo, which opened in Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, on Saturday. He emphasized that relations between China and ASEAN member states have entered a new stage of all-round development. Indeed, as regional partners that have been steadily strengthening mutually beneficial cooperation, China and ASEAN have seen their trade and economic partnership prosper at an increasing pace over the years. They will reap even more mutual benefits by dovetailing the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative with the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025.

                    China's grain output rises nearly 6 times in 70 years

                China will have another harvest of grains provided there are no major natural disasters this autumn, said an agriculture official, as the country's grain output last year reached 657.89 million tons, almost 6 times that of 1949.The general situation for grain production remains positive across the country, showing a trend of increasing production, except for draughts and floods in some areas, said an official with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.China has already reaped a harvest of summer grains and early season rice, and farmers started to harvest in some places, said the official, and a bumper harvest is expected if no disasters like typhoons or chilly winds occur.In 70 years, China's grain production has stepped up to a new level, changing from a shortage of grain supply in general to a basic balance of supply and demand.The country's grain output stood at 657.89 million tons in 2018, down by 3.71 million tons or 0.6 percent from a year earlier, according to official data. In 1949, the grain output was only 113.18 million tons.The grain output reached 300 million tons in 1978, 500 million tons in 1996, and 600 million tons in 2012.The output per mu (666.67 square meters) was 68.6 kilograms in 1949, 100 kilograms in 1965, 200 kilograms in 1982, 300 kilograms in 1998 and 374.7 kilograms in 2018.The per capita grain possession was 209 kilograms in 1949 and more than 470 kilograms in 2018, higher than the world average level.In 70 years, agricultural science and technology, such as water-saving irrigation and plastic film mulching, have been widely promoted and contributed much to agricultural production. The contribution rate reached 58.3 percent in 2018.At present, the utilization rates of pesticides and fertilizers hit 38.8 percent and 37.8 percent, respectively, in planting rice, wheat and corn.China has 43 million hectares of farmland built with high standards which have a high and stable yield, while farmland with effective irrigation exceeds 67 million hectares.China also boasts a high level of agricultural mechanization. In 1949, China had only 13 combine harvesters, and in 2018, there were 22.38 million tractors, including more than 2 million combine harvesters.
