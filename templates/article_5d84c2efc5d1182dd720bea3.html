                Chengdu and Dubai bolstering trade ties
            </p>
            <p>
                Chengdu, capital of Southwest China's Sichuan province, has strengthened economic cooperation with Dubai in the United Arab Emirates under the Belt and Road Initiative, through a trade cooperation conference held in Dubai earlier this month. Dubai is a transport hub in the Middle East, linking West Asia and North Africa. The city is also a center for commerce, logistics, exhibitions and finance, ranked ninth among the top 10 world cities by Globalization and World Cities in 2018. Chengdu is also an important gateway to Southwest China. As a key point on the trade routes of the BRI, it plays an active role in promoting international exchanges, and has acted as a business hub in Southwest China from ancient times to the present. In early September, the Chengdu-Dubai Economic and Trade Cooperation Conference was held in Dubai, where eight companies from Chengdu signed agreements with six companies in Dubai, with a total investment value of 37.4 billion yuan ($5.3 billion). Chengdu Xgimi Technology, a manufacturer of high-performance multifunctional smart projectors, is one of the beneficiaries. "Many companies in Dubai, including the biggest shopping mall in the country, Dubai Mall, have shown great interest in our products," said an executive from the company. According to Chengdu Xgimi, the conference provided a platform to find out more about customer demands in Dubai. At the same time, the company said it hoped to find high-quality distributors at the conference, who will assist in showcasing the company's products and expand its market share in the country. Also at the conference, Sheme, a woman's shoe brand from Chengdu, announced it was in talks with Dubai Mall to open a store there. The Chengdu logistics office shared the Chinese city's concepts and practices in building an international logistics hub in western China and the Chengdu Association of Building Economy Promotion briefed participants on international cooperation projects in Chengdu. Cooperation between the two cities dates back to 2011, when Chengdu and Dubai International Financial Center launched a joint financial project. Chengdu opened a direct flight to Dubai in 2016, and in June this year, the two cities signed an agreement to build an international airport shopping center. "Chengdu is an important trade and logistics center in Southwest China, a high-tech industrial base and a transportation hub with strong comprehensive strength and enormous development prospects," Li Xuhang, consul general of China in Dubai, told the conference. "The city has become a preferred place for many domestic and foreign companies to launch investment," Li said. He said the development plans for Chengdu and Dubai are highly complementary and have great potential under the BRI. Many Chengdu companies have opened branches in Dubai, which plays an important role in accelerating the pace of Chinese companies going global and expanding Chinese companies' international influence, Li added. At the conference, the Chengdu delegation brought with them special local ingredients and cooked traditional food, including dandan noodles, mapo tofu and minced beef pancakes. Hu Jiafeng, head of Chengdu's cooking association, said:"As one of the important exchanges between Chengdu and Dubai, cuisine can promote extensive cooperation in culture, economy, trade and tourism between the two cities." Giant pandas and cuisine are the most iconic calling cards of Chengdu. In addition to its delicious food, the city staff also dressed up as pandas at Dubai Mall on Sept 6, attracting much local attention. A resident named Abdulla said it was amazing to see a panda from Chengdu in Dubai and added he was interested in hotpot and the history of the Chinese city. Chengdu officials said they have realized that their city cannot gain such momentum without cooperation with other cities worldwide and that they hope to seize more opportunities to work with global companies. Based on the development of its business, tourism, finance and technology, Chengdu is looking forward to partnering with Dubai, an official with the Chengdu bureau of commerce said at the conference. According to official statistics, foreign trade between Chengdu and the UAE totaled 3 billion yuan in 2018, increasing 19.9 percent year-on-year. The figure reached 1.7 billion yuan in the first half of this year, jumping 42.1 percent compared with same period last year. An official from the Chengdu bureau of commerce said the city is looking forward to launching more projects with Dubai in business, advanced technology, financial services, commerce and logistics, aviation and tourism, as well as strengthening communication in culture, education, technology, sports and environmental protection. "We hope to deepen cooperation and attract more Arab companies to invest in Chengdu and expand their market in western China, as efforts to promote the development of the industries and companies in the two cities and achieve a win-win situation," the official said. caoyingying@chinadaily.com.cn  Deals with a total investment value of 37.4 billion yuan ($5.3 billion) are signed during the ChengduDubai Economic and Trade Cooperation Conference held in Dubai earlier this month.

                Growth strategy powered by innovation
            </a>
            <p>
                Xinwu district in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, is exploring an innovative path for high-quality development and Yangtze River Delta regional integration, local officials said. The district is home to the Wuxi National Hi-tech District. Government data show that there are more than 26,000 businesses in Xinwu, including 20 publicly traded companies in China and abroad. Of those businesses, 1,674 have a registered capital of $32.5 billion from Japanese, South Korean, European and US investors. Also, 437 have been granted the title of national high-tech enterprises. In 2018, foreign capital worth $1.3 billion was paid into Xinwu, enabling the district to keep its No 1 position across the city for the third year. Driven by this flourishing investment, the district registered high growth in major economic indicators in 2018. Its GDP topped 180 billion yuan ($25.32 billion), ranking first in the city. Per capita GDP surpassed 300,000 yuan. Foreign trade exceeded $50 billion, also topping the city. The momentum continued in the first half of this year. Investment in local industries and fixed assets increased by 11.6 percent and 5.2 percent from the same period of last year respectively. Foreign trade grew 7 percent year-on-year. Countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative contributed more than half to the amount. Deals with BRI countries and regions were worth $13.86 billion, an increase of 7.6 percent year-on-year. Between January and June, local authorities approved 50 industrial projects. The total investment value reached 30.38 billion yuan, a record high. Of the new paid-in foreign capital, 88.4 percent went to strategic and emerging sectors. As for domestic investment during the period, investors from 17 provinces and municipalities poured 13.29 billion yuan into major projects. They contributed 70.7 percent to the district's target investment value in 2019. Behind these bustling industries is a business-friendly environment and sound industrial structure. As a forerunner in the internet of things industry, the district made marked progress in integrating IoT technology with traditional sectors, advancing their transformation and upgrades. At the same time, revolving around the IoT sector, authorities optimized the district's industrial structure and have been developing emerging industries. These include new-generation information technology; advanced machinery and equipment manufacturing; renewable energy and new energy vehicles; life sciences; artificial intelligence and modern services. High-level human resources are key to the district's sustainable growth. During that six-month period, nearly 260 experts and specialists were brought in to the district. Also, more than 460 high-tech companies were added to the local business circle, a rise of 53 percent year-on-year. The addition helped the high-tech sector generate 140 billion yuan in output value in the first six months. It accounted for 66.6 percent of the district's total. Spending on research and development accounted for 3.8 percent of the district's GDP during the period, up 0.36 percentage points year-on-year. "We will continue our industry-powered, innovation-driven growth strategy to advance reform and opening-up, accelerate regional integrated development and make a greater contribution to the city's high-quality development," said Wang Jinjian, vice-mayor of Wuxi and Party secretary of Xinwu district.  From left: Visitors experience a system combining internet of things technology and medical services at an innovation center funded by biopharmaceuticals company AstraZeneca in the district.

                China story: 70 years of success
            </a>
            <p>
                In 1949 the People’s Republic of China (PRC) was established and within few decades became the world’s second-largest economy. The remarkable success achieved economically, technologically and scientifically is worthy of consideration by other countries, especially developing nations.After the founding of PRC, the new state faced considerable problems, which needed immediate attention. The Asian nation, ravaged by war with Japan during the WWII, was poor and its huge population compared with the gross output was weak. The country’s policies centered then on self-sufficiency relying on agriculture, but that was not enough to build a robust economy.In 1978, China ushered in a new era of modernization and industrialization adopting a policy based on comprehensive reforms and opening-up to the world. The chief architect of modern China, Deng Xiaoping, who held office as head of state and general secretary of the Communist Party, drew up a strategy dealing with four sectors, namely agriculture, industry, science and technology, and the military. Being aware of importance of education in his long-term plans, he also sent thousands of Chinese abroad to study and contribute to building and modernizing the country.Deng is seen as inspiring leader by those who succeeded him and took his approach to put China at forefront of the world’s major industrial economies.Now President Xi Jinping is carrying out the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to serve the whole world.BRI, which revives the old Silk Route, provides a lot of opportunities in areas of trade, investment, and employment. With principles of mutual cooperation and benefits, 68 countries have already signed the BRI agreement and this number is expected to increase in the future.While staying in China for 10 months to take part in a program, hosted by International Press Communication Centre, affiliated to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, I witnessed a lot of striking signs of enormous progress in this country. I saw how Chinese people use high-quality technology in all spheres of life. I could buy anything and everything using mobile apps. The Beijing subway with more than 20 lines links almost all parts of the city. Through my visits to factories and industrial zones, I realized how China was reaping the benefits of reform and opening-up which have uplifted the state to prosperity.The country’s huge GDP is a major factor that has helped the world’s most populous country make major strides in economic growth and in different fields.According to official figures, China's GDP stood at 90 trillion yuan ($13 trillion) in 2018, nearly 20 percent of the world economy.With China pressing ahead with development projects across the country, the nation has maintained a steady annual growth rate of more than 6 percent over the last two decades.Although the US launched a trade war against China in the middle of last year, China’s economic growth amounted to 6.3 percent, in the first half of 2019, the highest rate in the world, according to the National Bureau of statistics of China.China did not achieve so much progress through luck. The goals were determined and the successive governments worked to achieve those goals.And people rose to the challenge and through sheer ingenuity, hard work and perseverance made sure that China achieved its rightful place in the world.It’s time other nations followed China’s example.The author is the head of the foreign affairs department at Al-Gomhuria newspaper in Egypt.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                China made thousands of dreams come true
            </a>
            <p>
                Oct 1 is the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The founding of the People's Republic of China was officially proclaimed by Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong on Oct 1, 1949 at Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Seventy years after the founding of the China, the country has transformed from a poor and backward nation to a developing power and an important player on the world stage.The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), launched by China in 2013, is not just for the liberalization of the flow of goods, services, capital and skilled labor, but the liberalization of human capital through mutually accepted college and professional training programs, through joint degree arrangements, and through the exchange of students and faculty members. The BRI could provide a platform not only to improve the capability of training health professionals by exchanging health personnel, but also to address the geographical misdistribution of health workers in underserved areas among the BRI partners by providing primary healthcare in those countries.Like me, getting a higher academic or clinical degree or doing post-graduate study is a dream of so many students from underdeveloped or developing countries. The Chinese government is making it possible for us by offering thousands of government and local scholarships every year in almost every field, which is eventually a golden chance for us. By getting this chance in September2017, I came to China for the very first time. This is my second year in Chongqing. After listening to and watching so many developments in China, on my first day here when I took my first step outside the airport, for a moment I could not believe my eyes that I was here. The whole way from the airport to Chongqing Medical University I did not close my eyes even for a second, though I was so tired. I just looked outside and saw all the natural beauty and the high-rise buildings, roads and other structures. Undoubtedly, I really realized why people are saying so much about China.Being a medical graduate, a doctor, I worked a few years in my home country and abroad. But when I started my classes at Chongqing Medical University and First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, I was just surprised at seeing their updated technologies, and medical and surgical equipment. With its ancient tradition of herbal remedies, combined with its cutting-edge biomedical research enterprises, China offers unique opportunities to advance scientific discoveries and improve health across the globe. China has been a valuable partner with the US in medical research for more than 30 years.While getting my training in the hospital, one thing I realized is that the treatment strategy and the surgical operation skills of the Chinese doctors are smoother than so many other doctors from all around the world. Their use and availability of equipment are still a dream for so many students and even some doctors. The availability of different robotic and laparoscopic instruments is really a dream for many doctors coming from an underdeveloped or developing country like me in the field of minimal invasive operations and the future of modern surgery. China makes this dream come true.Not only by teaching the students in Chinese medical universities, but also inviting so many foreign doctors and surgeons here, they are giving them hands-on training with international-level facilities. This is totally unimaginable to get in some other developed countries or training centers abroad. Rather than this, over past few years Chinese experienced medical teams are going to other countries to share their medical training and teach them updated medical and surgical training skills.Now here in China, Chinese students are achieving outstanding success in the field of research. They now hold second place in research and publishing in the world, which is splendid. It is not possible to bring change and improve any system without doing updated research. So, I believe China is doing great in this sector as well and we are also getting used to how we can improve ourselves, which only became possible by coming to China. We are so very grateful to China and to the Chinese government for giving us these chances over the past few years. And we also hope this will continue in the future to make the dreams of thousands of students come true, each to become a good doctor and a great human being.China is now arranging so many international conferences every year. A noticeable number of foreign doctor’s and students are attending these seminars and conferences. They get the chance to become familiar with many of the latest Chinese inventions, which is really a successful story for China in the past few years.In a nutshell I just want to say that, after working in the hospital and attending so many local and international conferences here in China, one thing that just comes to my realization is that in spite of having some language barriers, China is definitely doing awesome work in the health sector, which can easily make some other countries envious of China. I am so very grateful to the Chinese government for giving me the chance of making my dream come true.The author is a final year student from Bangladesh working on a master’s degree in urology at First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                Former US senior diplomat hails Belt and Road Initiative as 'valuable concept'
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - The Belt and Road Initiative is a "valuable concept", said former US senior diplomat Charles W Freeman.The BRI is "a means of developing commerce, increasing prosperity, reducing costs, making trade more efficient," Freeman said.Freeman was the chief interpreter for then US President Richard Nixon during his 1972 maiden trip to China and served as assistant secretary of defense in the 1990s."I think it's very good. And I don't think the United States can influence it by standing outside and cursing it," Freeman said, adding that "we have to get inside and cooperate".

                Urumqi mediation room resolves BRI disputes
            </a>
            <p>
                A mediation room used to resolve international commercial disputes involving countries in the Belt and Road Initiative has been in operation in the Tianshan District People's Court in Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.The mediation room, jointly established by the court and the B&R International Commercial Mediation Center, aims to diversify resolution options and improve the quality of legal services among countries involved in the initiative.Xinjiang has witnessed a rise of economic disputes in recent years."If every case is solved by litigation, the cost for both sides will be increased, and sometimes a lawsuit might not be the best way to alleviate conflicts," said Yin Jun, the court's president.Yin said the court is the first in China's northwestern region to build such a mediation room, and services will be offered in other languages of ethnic groups."We'll integrate mediation resources, offering an open environment for litigants to solve disputes and also to assist in the construction of the initiative," he said.The room's establishment was based on research and negotiations between the court and the center, "and we hope our cooperation in mediation will benefit more litigants," he added.The center has cooperated with mediation-related institutes in more than 70 countries, including France, Spain, Sweden and Brazil, since it was built in 2016, according to a report on Ts.cn, a news portal affiliated with the regional government.By Aug 31, the center had participated in 585 disputes, of which 65 percent were resolved successfully, it said."We'll work closer with the court to study how to resolve more disputes through mediation and further promote the regional development and the initiative's construction," said Wang Li, the center's director."China's soft power and international influence will be strengthened if we can better resolve international commercial cases," she said.The Belt and Road Initiative, forwarded by the central leadership in 2013, includes the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.
