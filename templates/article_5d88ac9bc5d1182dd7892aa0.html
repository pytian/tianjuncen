                Scholar: China en route to becoming IP powerhouse
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                China's achievements in the construction of an intellectual property system since its entry to the World Trade Organization show the country has become a big IP filer and is embarking on a journey toward becoming an IP powerhouse. Shan Xiaoguang, president of Tongji University School of Law, made the remark in his recently published essay. He will host a forum on IP monetization in the context of economic globalization in a session of the 10th China Intellectual Property Annual Conference scheduled for early September in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. "The international economy is transitioning from being driven by resources, capital and technology to becoming IP-driven, as exemplified by the cases of the United States, the European Union and China," Shan said. According to an official report, IP-intensive industries contributed $5.06 trillion, or 34.8 percent, to the US GDP in 2010 and produced 40 million jobs, 27.7 percent of the country's total. From 2008 to 2010, IP-intensive industries in the EU generated 4.7 trillion euros ($5.22 trillion) in average annual output value, accounting for 39 percent of GDP in the region and creating about 76 million jobs directly and indirectly. Similarly, IP-intensive industries have seen rapid growth in China. A report from the National Intellectual Property Administration found that by the beginning of 2018, the added value of China's patent-intensive industries accounted for 12.4 percent of national GDP and was increasing year by year, Shan said. "China's copyright-intensive industries have also made great contribution to the country's economic growth, job opportunities and foreign trade, a sign of China's success in IP protection," Shan added. Now the fourth industrial revolution is shaking up the world and countries and industries are increasingly interdependent, Shan said that it is more important than ever for China to optimize its IP system to stimulate innovation and technology diffusion. Yang Jin, vice-president of Purplevine IP Operating, a Shenzhen-based company, said that for businesses, the most valuable asset is often intangible, and the value of intangible assets cannot be realized if they only appear in the company's financial statements without any proper operation." The company, affiliated with Guangdong-headquartered electronics giant TCL, has performed remarkably among Chinese enterprises that have invested in IP protection in the global market. "Established in 2018, it is our response to the increasingly complex and competitive IP environment," Yang said. Within a year, Purplevine has flexed its muscles in IP operation. For instance, it has valuated Shenzhen China Star Optoelectronics Technology's 500 patents at more than 1.2 billion yuan. The valuation helped Star obtain patent-collateralized loans. "We are developing solutions for companies to navigate the global mar. We identify patent risks in the main target markets and offer countermeasures," Yang said. "Together with many clients involved in international patent lawsuits, we strive for the best settlement results. "Moreover, we have set up an industry patent operating platform for hundreds of members to conduct patent exchanges and transactions," he added. Shan said the content of IP-intensive industries is never fixed. Whenever there is an emerging science and technological trend, innovations and IP-intensive industries will also break through. yinruowei@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily 08/29/2019 page17)

                    IVF procedures overseas may not be necessary, experts say
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Many Chinese couples have been traveling overseas for in vitro fertilization, in the belief that this procedure will be more successful than at home, but according to experts, there is no need for them to make such trips.A report by business consultants Frost & Sullivan showed that in 2017 about 15,000 Chinese traveled overseas for assisted reproductive technology services. Among them, 4,500 traveled to the United States, an increase from 2,600 in 2013.Jin Lei, director of reproductive medicine at Tongji Hospital affiliated with the Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, Hubei province, said the pregnancy rate from IVF procedures in China is about 50 percent, and the infant delivery rate is 30 to 45 percent.In the years immediately after the birth of the first test-tube baby on the Chinese mainland in 1988, the pregnancy rate from domestic IVF procedures was only about 6 percent.Some foreign agencies advertising IVF trips overseas claim they will result in a pregnancy rate as high as 70 to 80 percent, but experts said the claim is most likely to be commercial publicity.Sun Xiaoxi, deputy president of the Shanghai Ji'ai Genetics and IVF Institute affiliated with the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University, said: "This is like a game of numbers. If we only take into account young patients, who usually have less complicated reasons for infertility, the success rate is also higher in Chinese hospitals."Qiao Jie, president of Peking University Third Hospital in Beijing, said assisted reproductive technologies in China are mature and a large number are carried out every year."Chinese doctors have rich experience and excellent team collaboration. We are not inferior to our colleagues overseas," she said.Yu Wei Siang, chairman of the Borderless Healthcare Group in Singapore, said, "I believe the final delivery rates of infants through IVF at medical institutions in China and other countries are almost the same - between 30 and 40 percent."Doctors also said that not all couples have to use the "third-generation" test-tube baby technique, which has been advocated by agencies selling overseas trips. This technology can diagnose problems in the genetic makeup of embryos and ensure that only those that are healthy are placed in mothers' wombs.Huang Hefeng, president of the International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital of China Welfare Institute in Shanghai, said: "The 'third-generation' technique has been used in about 50 hospitals in China. It targets patients who have disorders in their chromosomes. In other words, it is redundant for other patients."Industry insiders said many Chinese patients could be looking for more privacy and better service when they travel abroad for IVF procedures.Some people also travel overseas for services such as choosing the baby's gender, surrogacy and freezing eggs, which are not available at home, they said.Yu said: "At an overseas center, patients can not only meet doctors but also counselors, who provide comprehensive psychological counseling throughout the IVF procedure."We have also witnessed a rising number of women, mostly those born in the 1980s and even the '90s, traveling overseas in recent years to have their eggs frozen. They told me it is a good way to ensure that they can take their time before finding the right man."

                Guidance underpins city's advantages - a comprehensive industrial chain, growing startup culture, strong human capitalShanghai has set itself on a long-term trajectory to become the nation's, and even the world's leader in artificial intelligence. Its comprehensive industrial chain, growing startup culture, and strong human capital are all working to catapult the city to the AI forefront. But to attain a decisive AI lead in an industry that requires constant input of time and money, consistent policy guidance and support are critical.To decipher Shanghai's AI dream, China Daily has compiled a list of mechanisms, including national and city-level policies, industrial clusters and an army of AI-themed activities and pilot projects - all of which are under the auspices of the government - that will enable Shanghai to lead the AI pack.City-level goals Shanghai's AI ambition was first outlined in a municipal plan issued in November 2017, when the city authorities pledged to expand the scale of the industry to more than 100 billion yuan ($14.2 billion) by 2020. Along with this goal in industrial output, the city is looking to set up a dedicated industrial fund, introduce 60 emerging AI technologies from local companies, and host six demonstration zones and 60 AI applications in the same period of time.National pilot project Shanghai's AI ambition was taken up a notch thanks to the decision by the central government to build the nation's first pilot zone for the innovation and application of AI.Dubbed "Shanghai National Pilot Area for the Innovative Development of New-Generation AI", the dedicated area, approved by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in May, has three main goals: to establish an AI core industrial cluster; to promote AI applications; and to build a supporting system for AI innovation.Application scenarios The lifeline to AI's materialization is the number and variety of real-life scenarios to put the technology into daily practice. The city has rolled out a plan to both solicit applicable AI solutions and promote a suite of indigenous AI technologies to speed up the widespread application of AI.Since the end of last year, two scenarios have been published by the metropolis thus far, calling for tangible AI solutions for education, healthcare, transportation, manufacturing and city management, among others. Meanwhile, initiatives such as AI-powered diagnosis, cargo transportation and civic services are being promoted through roadshows and AI-themed forums.Industrial alliance All industries require economies of scale and AI is no exception. To facilitate Shanghai's pioneering of the latest AI technologies, the city has set up a special AI industrial alliance dedicated to resource matchmaking.The 22-member bloc consists of leading AI enterprises ranging from domestic internet giants such as Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu to international powerhouses such as the Microsoft Asia Research Center (Shanghai) and ABB, a Swiss conglomerate that also specializes in robotics and automation technology. The alliance aims to provide resources matchmaking for participating enterprises, providing them with rich application scenarios where an AI-makeover is deemed essential.Incubator - AI Space The first physical incubator was unveiled in May as Shanghai strives to make AI a cornerstone of its industrial transformation. Launched in Shanghai's Wujiaochang, an area home to multiple leading research houses such as Fudan University and Tongji University, the first 3,000 square-meter AI Space serves as an accelerator to turn abstract AI ideas into prototypes and potentially into tangible products.The facility will provide working space, databases, technical support, financing and resources matchmaking with application scenarios. Such a model will be duplicated across the city in due time. Five AI startups have signed memorandums of understanding with the first AI Space, covering areas such as the combination of AI and medical care, education and big data.WAIC+AIWIN competition The World Artificial Intelligence Conference, which debuted in September, brings together the world's top AI luminaries, entrepreneurs and academicians to share their insights on the latest development of this technology. While the inaugural meeting attracted a host of high-profile personalities including Turing Award winner Raj Reddy, this year's event, which is scheduled to run from Aug 29 to 31, will expand both in scale and depth. Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk's participation is already a strong indication that the WAIC is gaining traction globally. To pave the way for the conference and attract AI startups, notably those from abroad, an AI competition called AIWIN will be held ahead of the WAIC. Awards in four subcategories will be given to winning teams. Local authorities have ratcheted it up a notch this year by recruiting overseas teams through roadshows in Israel, France, and the United Kingdom.AIsland Among the six AI demonstration zones that the city plans to construct, AIsland serves as an ideal prototype mimicking what future metropolitan life could look like. The 66,000 square-meter special zone in Zhangjiang Science City, Shanghai's science and technology hub, will conduct a number of pilot programs such as smart parking, intelligent lighting, environment monitoring and unmanned convenience stores. The first batch of entrants includes international and domestic technology luminaries IBM, Microsoft, Alibaba, Tencent, SenseTime, and a research facility affiliated to Tongji University. The zone will feature the city's first 5G+AI pilot zone and host over 8,000 research and development personnel.

                    Study plan changes welcome at Chinese universities
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                As the school year starts, many freshmen are excited to embark on a new academic journey, while some are worrying if the major they chose as a senior high graduate will be the right choice for their future career path.As high school graduates, some make the four-year commitment with limited understanding of their chosen field, or under pressure from family. Some go into their majors based on the scores of their national college entrance examinations, also known as gaokao, which limit students to certain majors offered by the universities. Either way, students often find themselves wanting to pursue a different major than they originally selected.Starting this fall at Shanghai's Tongji University, all incoming students will be admitted into the School of New Students to have one year of general education courses before choosing a major at the beginning of their sophomore year.According to Huang Yiru, dean of Tongji's School of New Students, it's not just students who didn't get an ideal score who find this new arrangement helpful. The architecture department, one of the institute's most renowned majors, has also had students try to transfer to other majors, as they found more passion and interest in other fields.With a year of introductory courses consisting of workshops and seminars, students will be more informed and confident about choosing an area to study in-depth.To reduce any "buyer's remorse" attached to the decision, Tongji has created learning communities for freshmen, allowing them to take modules from majors that can be grouped under larger academic umbrellas.Exposing students to a broad range of studies may also help them realize that going into a major does not necessarily confine them to that specific career path, but rather an entire field of interest with a wide range of career opportunities.The arrangement is part of an effort by educators to engage students in the teaching plan and place the development of students at the center of teaching. By giving the students one more year of learning experience and a grace period before the big decision, more and more universities may start to realize the varied abilities and interests of students need to be accommodated in order to make independent and informed choices.These efforts will not only create a more open academic environment but also make sense from a practical standpoint. Most students don't know with 100 percent certainty what they want to do with the rest of their life. Asking them to choose a specific major after a year of supported studying will allow students to more confidently commit to their future – and give incoming freshmen one less thing to worry about.As of 2018, around 20 universities across the country including Peking University, Sichuan University and Shandong University have pledged to give students the chance transfer to another major after being admitted into the university.

                    Servier and Sanofi join hand fighting depression in China
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Pharmaceutical companies of Servier China and Sanofi China have signed an exclusive strategic cooperation agreement for the new antidepressant marketed as Valdoxan.Sanofi China is fully responsible for the marketing and medical information promotion of the unique adult depression treatment developed by Servier.Both companies will work with China's leading experts in the field of mental health to launch an awareness-raising campaign known as "Hand in Hand to Cure Depression, Lighting Up the Future," which aims to integrate the advantages of the two sides' resources to further enhance awareness of the disease and its treatment.According to the World Health Organization, more than 300 million people worldwide suffer depression .In China, the prevalence of depression stands at 6.8%, with more than 95 million people suffering other conditions like anxiety."A lack of joy and happiness is the most typical symptom of depression. Worse, Asian people mostly being conservative and restrained people are less likely to seek mental treatment for fear of potential discrimination and social stigma," said Professor Wu Wenyuan of Tongji Hospital, affiliated with Tongji University.According to her, more than 90% of the patients in China are left untreated."Many with initial symptoms are reluctant to receive professional treatment. That, however, would affect the patient's work and social ability. Without intervention, the state of pleasure loss will continue regardless of the degree of the severity. A proper understanding of the problem is the first step for the patients to seek professional help and get back to a normal life," she added.In addition to the lack of pleasure and low mood, people with depression often suffer abnormalities in body weight, appetite, sleep and behavioral activities, experts said.In severe cases, they even cause self-harm and suicide. Depression not only brings mental pain to the patient, but also causes a heavy financial burden on the patient, and the patient feels no sense of happiness.International studies showed depression is expected to be the second-largest disease burden after cardiovascular disease by 2020.Servier China and Sanofi China together are bringing to China the new antidepressant, which can help alleviate depressive symptoms, significantly improve the lack of pleasure, directly hitting the core of depression.Since being approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2009, the innovative drug has been approved in 99 countries worldwide and listed as a first-line antidepressant by several domestic and foreign guidelines.Fang Yiru, a senior mental health specialist with Shanghai Mental Health Center affiliated with Tongji University said: "Following the whole process of standardized treatment, and good drug compliance can effectively reduce the probability of recurrence, effectively reduce problems such as sexual dysfunction, gastrointestinal side effects and weight gain, and help patients return to normal life as soon as possible."

                    Covestro's innovative solutions turning wheel of circular economy
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Circular economy may be an abstract phrase, but when it is connected to a materials maker, it becomes easier to understand. Key for a circular economy is that resources are efficiently used and recycled. It features recycling, reusing and remanufacturing to reduce resource input and waste. The closed system is opposite to the traditional "take, make, dispose" linear economy, said a senior executive from Covestro, a world-leading manufacturer of high-tech polymer materials. Markus Steilemann, CEO of the company, made the remarks at the China Development Forum 2019 held in Beijing in March. He said the circularity focuses on the whole cycle: from raw material purchase, production and use of products to waste treatment. The circular economy should be an impetus for the plastics industry to jump out of the current model of "taking, making and wasting". Instead, it should pay attention to pollution prevention and control and the use of clean energy, he said. Among the company's moves to support such an economy is using carbon dioxide as an alternative raw material to make foam components. The industrial waste gas is used with crude oil to first make a precursor for soft foam with a white powder catalyst, and finally polyurethane foam is produced. Chemically bound, the carbon dioxide cannot escape back into the atmosphere. The foam can be used for binders used in mattresses and sports floors. The company said the big advantage is saving on crude oil, the conventional raw material of the chemical and plastics industry. "I am sure we will be seeing more applications here," said Persefoni Hilken, project manager at Covestro, quoted from the company's website. Researchers at RWTH Aachen University, together with experts from Covestro and those from the Technical University of Berlin, have succeeded in producing synthetic fibers using carbon dioxide on a large scale and processing them to create clothing. A salt water recycling system is another example of Covestro's contribution to the circular economy. During polycarbonate production at Covestro's integrated site in Shanghai, waste salt water is generated. But it can be further processed into the raw material chlorine and water. The site has set up a project recycling waste salt water from polycarbonate facilities with a local chloralkali company. It reduces the discharge of waste water and converts it into brine products, building a circular economy industrial chain, the company said. Up to 15 percent of its salt water has been reused since 2016. Employees at the Shanghai site have been invited to support the circular economy in daily life, commuting in electric buses provided by the company. In the past, transport involved diesel buses. The 59 vehicles of the Shanghai site together drive more than 2 million kilometers per year, which is equivalent to a lap around the globe per week, according to the company. Participation has also been expanded to universities. Tongji University in Shanghai and Covestro have worked to develop sustainable material solutions in China. The university and then Bayer MaterialScience, predecessor of Covestro, established an innovation academy in 2011. It aims to promote innovative models and results based on their strengths in the field of materials. Enhancing the performance of electric automobile batteries is one of the academy's research focuses. Teachers and students from Tongji University have visited Covestro sites worldwide during summer vacations over the past few years, including tours to Covestro's headquarters in Leverkusen, Germany, in 2018 and to Covestro's Innovation Center Japan this year. The trips enabled the participants to learn more about developments in circular economy, such as the use of industrial waste water and materials production using carbon dioxide. Tongji has become an important partner of Covestro in China, together training young professionals to develop sustainable materials solutions. In order to live up to the growing significance of circular business models and the need for more efficient use of resources, a central coordinating office for circular economy was established at Covestro in 2017. It approves cooperative projects within the entire value chain and validates future potential for development projects across companies. Insiders said plastics have opened up a world of opportunities and revolutionized medicine, lightened vehicles and modernized life. Global production of plastic has increased from 2.3 million metric tons in the 1950s to 335 million tons in 2016. The planet may struggle with such a high production of plastic if its total life cycle is not managed in a sustainable way, they said. Covestro said post-consumer recycled - known as PCR in the industry - plastic is an important solution. It refers to plastic that has been recycled and reprocessed from products which have been used by consumers. The company's team in China has developed more than 10 PCR polycarbonate products that can be used in laptops, printers and electric chargers. Early this year, Covestro also stepped up its measures against the uncontrolled disposal of plastic waste by joining the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, a new network of companies from across the globe, which is aimed at better managing and minimizing litter especially in the oceans while promoting meaningful plastic post-use solutions. In China, Covestro said it will soon launch a picture book app to raise awareness of marine litter pollution among the young generation. The move will be part of a partnership with this year's "21st Century Cup" National English Speaking Competition, launched by China Daily earlier this month. songmengxing@chinadaily.com.cn  Students from Tongji University visit Covestro's Innovation Center Japan in Amagasaki in July.Photos Provided To China Daily The world's first hockey field made using carbon dioxide in Krefeld, Germany.(China Daily 09/07/2019 page11)

                BEIJING -- The utility tunnel project at the new Beijing Daxing International Airport has passed an initial inspection with world-leading culvert jacking technology.The utility tunnel is a passage built underground to carry utility lines such as electricity, water and sewer pipes, as well as communication utilities like fiber optics and telephone cables, guaranteeing energy supply to the airport.According to China Railway 24th Bureau Group Co., Ltd, the utility tunnel at the new airport goes underneath the Beijing-Kowloon Railway.Compared to similar projects at home and abroad, the construction is quite difficult as it has to guarantee the daily operation of the railway and cannot fall behind schedule.Engineers from China Railway 24th Bureau Group Co., Ltd and Tongji University jacked a large box culvert under the railway, a trenchless construction method that does not interrupt the traffic above.With a digitally rendered 3D model for the jacking, engineers adapted the jacking machine to large-span and long-distance construction with precise direction control.A review committee from China Railway Construction Cooperation Limited said the key technologies of large-span jacking and precision control facilitated the project construction and have reached an internationally advanced level in the field.
