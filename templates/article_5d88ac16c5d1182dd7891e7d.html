                Sinopec arm rides BRI, advantages of geography and price, for edge in more than 20 overseas markets"The Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China promotes regional economic cooperation and coordinated development, and offers new opportunities for Chinese enterprises to go global," said Gu Xin, general manager of the international department of Sinopec Lubricant Co Ltd, at a recent lubricant promotion meeting in Thailand.Gu is also in charge of the company's subsidiary in Singapore, Sinopec's first lubricant plant outside China. The plant sits in the industrial park at Tuas at the southwestern tip of the island.Covering an area of 242,811 square meters, the plant has an initial annual production capacity of 100,000 metric tons of lubricants, and was established to produce high-end products to meet the increasing regional demand for high-grade lubricants and grease."We began to explore overseas markets in 2003. In 2005, the company set up a three-step strategy of 'explore overseas markets first, then set up overseas plants, and finally establish a global service network'," the company said in a statement.With a total investment of 548 million yuan ($79.9 million), Sinopec Lubricant (Singapore) Pte Ltd was successfully established and put into operation on July 11, 2013.Sinopec's first overseas lubricant plant was set up in Singapore because of the city-state's geographical advantage. Singapore is known as the financial capital of Southeast Asia as well as an entrepot, facilitating trade between the region and the rest of the world. It has transparent investment policies and a relatively stable environment. Many major oil companies in the world chose to build plants in Singapore.In addition, in Singapore, there are many refineries that produce base oil, as well as multiple manufacturing bases that make additives, fully satisfying the raw material supply for lubricants.Sinopec's Singapore lubricant plant is helping the parent to expand its international business. Sinopec has seven overseas business representative offices in Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Australia. Twenty market developers were sent from China to overseas, while 10 market developers were recruited locally.With years of efforts, the overseas sales volume of Sinopec's lubricant business increased from the initial several thousand tons per year to 30,000 tons per year, covering more than 60 countries and regions worldwide.The average annual growth rate of the production of the plant in Singapore reached 22 percent. It helped establish the primary international service network for the company.Asked about the secret of Sinopec's success in Singapore, company executives attributed it to the "international practices" the subsidiary adopts. There are only three departments: administrative and financial; production; and business."Under the premise that major risks are controllable, we (at the parent company) fully authorized the plant in Singapore to streamline processes and improve operational efficiency," a Sinopec senior executive said.The lubricant plant in Singapore took full advantage of the local government's favorable policies. Through active communication with the Singaporean government, the company was granted several favorable policies such as income tax incentives, employee training subsidies, special quotas for foreign staff and property tax deductions. These policies supported its operations.The plant also serves as a platform to help Sinopec develop its marine oil business. According to the company, compared to the domestic model, the plant in Singapore has a price advantage because base oil and additives can be sourced locally.Apart from certain special products that cannot be manufactured in Singapore, the company tries to produce and supply all of its overseas products in Singapore. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the marine oil production in Singapore could reach 10,000 tons.Li Li, energy research director at ICIS China, a think tank focusing on energy trends, said: "Singapore is a logistics fortress for petrochemical products in the Asia-Pacific region. It is also an international financial hub. In addition, there are few language and cultural barriers between China and Singapore. Therefore, many Chinese enterprises implemented their go-global strategy by establishing subsidiaries in Singapore first."To further explore overseas markets, Sinopec took advantage of opportunities brought by the Belt and Road Initiative, particularly in the fields of foreign project contracting, foreign trade and foreign investment. It selected several industries that are deeply related to lubricants, such as road and bridge construction, electric power construction, petroleum engineering, equipment exports and overseas plant construction. In consideration of local geographical factors, it worked out specific project schedules and assigned specific people to complete the projects.To raise the company's image overseas, Sinopec has organized over 20 major lubricant promotion meetings since 2015 in its target countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates, attracting thousands of Chinese and foreign clients.More than 200 one-on-one exchange meetings were held with focus on technologies, in order to offer potential clients a better understanding of the company's products and services.Up till now, Sinopec has worked on 304 Chinese-funded projects in more than 20 countries and regions, and successfully inked deals with 122 clients and began supplies to them.For example, it is now offering lubricant services to the overseas projects of many renowned companies, including China Communication Construction, China Railway Construction Corp Ltd, China Power, Sany Group and XCMG.To improve its overseas service network, Sinopec lays emphasis on close interactions with its clients. Since 2015, it has been paying track visits to 84 overseas and 50 domestic clients. More than 10,000 visits have been made already.The company said that in the coming years, the lubricant plant in Singapore would continue to give full play to its geographical and price advantages, to improve its international operations and increase production.In addition, the subsidiary would learn more about lubricant-related products and techniques, as well as the market trends. It would actively explore new approaches to cooperate with international enterprises, to expand room for development and improve brand image.

                    Chinese enterprises smell opportunities in 5G, new energy
                </p>

                FUZHOU - Chinese companies are tapping new opportunities in emerging industries including 5G technology and green energy.Kunshan Q Technology, located in eastern China's Jiangsu province, is a leading manufacturer of cameras and fingerprint recognition modules for cell phones and tablets. It has ramped up technological innovations as the company looks to the country's huge 5G market."You need a new phone to enjoy the high-speed connectivity of 5G. And it won't take long for 5G smartphones to take over the market, which will unlock enormous potential," said Terry Liu, deputy operating general manager of the company.In early June, China granted 5G licenses for commercial use, marking the beginning of a new era in the country's telecommunications industry.Affordable 5G phones have started to hit the market as the domestic market leaders like Huawei and ZTE have rolled out their 5G handsets.Liu has witnessed the number of cameras installed in a single phone increase from only one to four or five and the resolution from two megapixels to 48 megapixels nowadays, which made him realize that the demand for high-quality products may help boost the sustainable growth of the market."There will be more cameras with higher resolutions on phones in the future," Liu said. "Our confidence also comes from the continuing upgrade of electronic devices."While trending toward high-tech like 5G, artificial intelligence and big data have also opened up new possibilities. Some enterprises in the manufacturing sector are gaining steam from clean energy, as China looks toward a greener economy.Snowman Group, a manufacturer of industrial and commercial refrigeration and cold storage units, now finds itself in an influential position on the track of the new energy vehicle industry.Headquartered in Fuzhou, eastern China's Fujian province, the company has developed into a major developer and producer of high-level compressors through global mergers and acquisitions. It is the owner of a number of prestigious compressor brands including SRM from Sweden and RefComp from Italy."We noticed the SRM had been developing air compressors used in hydrogen fuel cells since the 1990s, so we decided to go one step further to tap into the hydrogen vehicle market," said Lin Rujie, the company's deputy general manager.It has inked deals with 21 automakers and engine companies including Dongfeng Motors and Yutong Bus to supply air compressors for hydrogen vehicles. The company has also developed a hydrogen bus prototype by cooperating with bus manufacturer King Long Motor."We expect the mass production of our hydrogen-powered buses within this year," said Lin. "It will be a very positive momentum to our growth."Analysts believe that China has huge potential in developing hydrogen energy and China's development of the hydrogen industry is also in accordance with the global strategy on energy transmission.According to this year's government work report, China continues preferential policies on the purchase of new energy vehicles and facilitates the construction of charging and hydrogenation facilities to boost the automobile industry.

                    Embracing China, Italian port regains shine
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                VADO LIGURE, Italy -- Not far from an abandoned industrial site with rusted metals reminiscent of its manufacturing past, the port of Vado Ligure carries the promise of the Italian city's future.Neighboring an old reefer terminal that has so far handled mostly bananas and pineapples, new Vado Gateway terminal, under a partnership between European and Chinese businesses, will be opened in December and become one of the most capable terminals in Europe.COSCO SHIPPING Ports, under the world's largest integrated shipping enterprise China Ocean Shipping Corporation (COSCO), bought a 40-percent stake in the terminal, second to the Netherlands-based APM Terminals, part of the Danish conglomerate Maersk."The arrival of COSCO in APM was welcomed as an important turning point, it has strengthened this group and it has provided an exceptional chance that we wouldn't have had in an Italian investment scenario," Monica Giuliano, mayor of Vado Ligure, told Xinhua.JOB CREATIONThings did not go well for employment in Italy, one of the most indebted economies in the European Union (EU).In Liguira region, where Vado Ligure is located, the unemployment rate of 37.9 percent among young people aged 15-24 is the highest among all age groups, according to EU statistics.The city used to boast factories and industries, but many of them have closed in recent years. However, Chinese businesses came with confidence in the port, also bringing confidence to locals."I see the Chinese investments in Vado in a positive way, because we are undergoing a period of crisis," Danilo Causa, who is in charge of the local transport federation under the Italian Confederation of Trade Unions, told Xinhua.APM Terminals expects its number of employees to grow from 240 in December 2019 to 300 by the end of 2020 and around 400 at full operation, in the city of 8,500 citizens, said Paolo Cornetto, managing director of APM Terminals at Vado Ligure.A vibrant port could also create other jobs, as some study has showed each direct job can generate two indirect jobs, Cornetto told Xinhua.SHOT OF ENERGYBeyond jobs, the ongoing upgrading will enable Vado Ligure to have "the only terminal in the region at the moment that can handle" ultra large container vessels, according to Cornetto.Chinese partners "add value to our presence in Vado (Ligure), both commercially (and) technically," he added.The new terminal will have an annual capacity of 900,000 TEUs (20-foot equivalent unit), three times more than the old terminal, and enable Vado Ligure to compete with better known European ports.Huge, blue cranes bearing their manufacturers' acronym name ZPMC -- Zhenhua Port Machinery Company, another Chinese company -- will create the most automated stacking yard in Italy.A new off-dock four-lane rail facility with a capacity for 14 trains per day will also provide rapid access to central and northern Europe such as Switzerland, Germany and France.NEW SILK ROADThe bond between China and Italy could trace back over seven centuries to Venetian merchant and explorer Marco Polo's trailblazing journey along the ancient Silk Road to China.Continuing the tradition, Italy earlier this year inked a memorandum of understanding with China on the Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to bring the world closer through infrastructure improvement and other efforts.Noting Italy is the first country of the Group of Seven to sign such an agreement, Gian Enzo Duci, professor at the University of Genoa and president of Italian National Federation of Ship Brokers and Agents, said "moving on that line, there will be a big part of cargo of the present and the future (through Italy). And if we are able to update and upgrade our road and rail infrastructure, we can be the Chinese door to Central Europe."Cisco Wang, the representative of COSCO SHIPPING Ports in Vado Ligure, said his company would expand investment along the Belt and Road in a win-win spirit.China is Italy's largest trading partner in Asia, with their bilateral trade growing 9.1 percent to 54.24 billion U.S. dollars last year.WIN-WIN AHEADThe ongoing construction in Vado Ligure is the largest program for Italian ports these years."Chinese investments, like the one done in Vado Ligure, are necessary; if we want to develop a certain area, we need to welcome these investments. We can't stop progress," said Giancarlo Vinacci, deputy mayor of nearby port city Genoa which boasts Italy's busiest port.Last year, Genoa tragically lost the Morandi Bridge in a collapse, which reflected an urgent need for Italy to improve infrastructure.Li Shaofeng, counsellor of commerce at the Chinese Consulate-General in Milan, said the two countries have seen great potential for cooperation in infrastructure construction, since China has financial resources and technical expertise and that's exactly what Italy needs.Paolo Firpo, container operation manager at APM Terminals, said the biggest change at the port has been the transformation from "a 'family' port business to a multinational business.""It is clear that the involvement of Maersk and COSCO has brought an upgrade of the port; the fact of working with a different culture and different methods has brought a professional upgrade that I find very exiting," he said. "We have the operational and commercial aspect, where we have seen positive indications."

                A strategic cooperation framework agreement was signed Thursday between 10 State-owned enterprises and the Shanghai municipal government during a ceremony, which saw a handful of major projects inked and several science and technology innovative institutes unveiled, an official source said.The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council on behalf of the State-owned enterprises, and the municipal government of Shanghai announced they will deepen their collaboration in advancing national strategies and local government tasks.The climate is mature for furthering the opening-up of Shanghai, said Li Qiang, the Party chief of Shanghai, citing the expansion of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone to the Lingang New Area, the establishment of the science and technology innovation board, the integration of the Yangtze River Delta region, as well as the China International Import Expo (CIIE).China Communications Construction and China Resources are going to put more of their industrial resources into the integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta region, while Sinochem Group and ChemChina expressed their interest in exploring opportunities from the expansion of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone. China Baowu Steel Group, China COSCO Shipping and China Resources will support the listing of their innovation-oriented arms on the newly launched STAR Market, or science and technology innovation board.Since launching the strategic collaboration with the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) in August 2017, Shanghai has attracted 22 State-owned enterprises and financial institutions to sign 20 cooperative agreements in sectors including intelligent manufacturing, new energy, marine engineering equipment and biomedical.Liu Qitao, chairman of China Communications Construction Co Ltd, one of the country's largest infrastructure project builders, said the group is about to make Shanghai its global headquarters along with the existing headquarters in Beijing.

                Often departing from the beaten track in remote parts of China, a photographer evokes the refinement of Chinese paintings and of nature itself.Michael Cherney loves taking pictures of mountains. And he loves taking those pictures the way they were painted by ancient Chinese landscape artists centuries or millennia ago.One frame, a narrow strip of rolling hills taken on the plateaus of northwestern China, is dominated by the interplay between black and white and the multiple shades of gray in between. A meandering, monochrome composition, it is evocative of those ancient Chinese works in which ink was applied to paper in a few sweeping strokes to maximize the sense of grandeur.And it's not just the wide-angled pictures. Close-up shots of wrinkled mountain ridges fill the entire frame in one view from his Yi Mountain Passages series. The rugged texture of the land has often been created by dragging a dry brush across the paper, and by dabbing a few dots of ink here and there.Then there are the trees on the mountains. In his Level Trees, Distant Mountains series, wintry branches are fully revealed against the dusky sky. Such austerity recalls the equally frugal depictions of trees often found in landscapes from the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), which Cherney adored for having embraced "reductionism" in art.
