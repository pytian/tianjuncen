                Beijing horticultural expo finishes filmmaking of botanical documentary
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                BEIJING -- Three months after the opening of the Beijing horticultural expo, a botanical documentary, "The Journey of Chinese plants", has been brought to completion and will meet audiences soon, said the expo's coordination bureau on Monday.The documentary will have 10 episodes covering tea trees, mulberry, rice, soybeans, bamboo, gardens and flowers, and each episode will run for about 50 minutes. It will show the life journey of 28 plants through stories of how they have affected the world.The film is an important exhibition for the expo and is expected to guide the audience to appreciate the modesty and gratitude that Chinese civilization has shown to nature through the exploration of the plant world, according to Zhou Jianping, executive deputy director of the bureau.The documentary took the production team nearly three years to complete, and more than 200 people have participated in the making of this documentary.A total of 133 photographers visited 93 regions in 27 provinces and cities in China and seven countries including the United Kingdom, New Zealand, India and Madagascar during the filmmaking process."We used cameras to record the stories of the plants and build up life archives for the plants via images. We gained reverence for life during the filmmaking process," said Li Chengcai, chief director of the documentary.The Beijing horticultural expo, themed "Live Green, Live Better," is open until Oct 7 and features a vast collection of flowers, fruit trees, Chinese herbal medicines and plant landscaping techniques, as well as ideas for green development.

                    Sector requires investment and regulation, experts say
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Nature education requires greater regulation and investment, and schools and parents need to be more aware of the sector's importance, according to insiders and industry reports.Luo Peng, founder of EcoAction, a nature education institute in Beijing, said some practitioners lack both professional qualifications and environmental awareness."The classes they organize cannot be called nature education, because they just popularize common knowledge, which makes no difference or sense," she said.She added that some practitioners breach unwritten guidelines, and there have been several news stories about "teachers" who provided inaccurate information that resulted in children destroying nature rather than protecting it.For example, in February, a self-styled insect expert led a team of children on a nature course in Madagascar.However, he and the mother of one of the students were detained at an airport on the island after they were found to have concealed a chameleon and a lizard in their luggage.Meanwhile, in October, an explorer who took a group of children on a trip to a tropical rainforest in Sumatra allowed them to deliberately tear the delicate wings of bats and hold wild bats, which not only injured the animals, but also posed a threat to the children's health.Last year, a report by the Nature Education Network, an online group in China that organizes an annual forum for people in the sector, noted that the industry is relatively new and still needs time to find its feet."This is a promising industry, but also a fragile one. A few negative news reports can easily destroy the reputation and public trust that practitioners have painstakingly built," the report said."Lack of talent is the biggest bottleneck to the sector's development, followed by the problem of raising funds. The development of the industry urgently requires greater public awareness of nature education, professional research and policy support from the government."According to the report, most nature schools are small-scale operations. Last year, only 14 percent of the 398 such institutions in China employed more than 20 staff members.It added that many practitioners are over-reliant on personal experience or training courses and forums held by industry groups to improve their skills and knowledge. Moreover, many lack relevant professional and educational qualifications."This is because there are not enough related majors at universities and research institutes in China," the report said.Other problems include safety concerns, copying each others' programs, brand infringement and damage to the environment and animals.These factors can make parents, schools and society lose confidence in the sector, it added.In November, the network released a self-discipline regulation of the nature education industry, aimed at promoting healthy development by connecting institutions and individuals in the field.The regulation includes provisions such as respect for nature and intellectual property rights, and emphasizes the need to ensure children's safety when they come into contact with wild animals.Chen Zhiqiang, the network's secretary-general, said the organization will continue to promote research on the development of the sector and the building of a talent-certification system."The level of development varies from place to place, and the problems encountered by nature education programs also vary," he said, speaking at the China Nature Education Forum in Chengdu, Sichuan province, in November."To solve the problem, it may be more effective to establish local networks as a way of promoting the sector's overall development."

                    British adventurer completes yearlong Yangtze walk
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                A British explorer is claiming to be the first person to walk the length of the Yangtze River in China after enduring freezing temperatures, blistering heat, and altitudes of more than 5,000 meters during his epic trek.Ash Dykes, from Old Colwyn in North Wales, finished the 6,437-kilometer journey on Monday after he was delayed by a couple of days because of Typhoon Lekima.The 28-year-old said he felt great after crossing the finish line in Shanghai, where he was greeted by family, media, and Chinese supporters."As soon as I was on the final stretch, people started to join and we sort of ran to the finish and popped the champagne," Dykes said.The expedition took two years to plan and 352 days to complete.At the start of the trek, the source of the Yangtze River was difficult to reach and four members of his team left the expedition before it began because of altitude sickness. There were also fears over the possibility of bear and wolf attacks."One day, I was told by locals that a woman was killed by a pack of wolves and for the next two days we were followed by a pack of wolves, so that was very intimidating," Dykes said. "We thought bears would leave us alone but the locals told us otherwise ... so we would try and shelter with the locals or, if I was in my tent, I wouldn't get food out. We had to stay alert and focus."He said he wanted to use his journey to highlight conservation projects by partnering with the World Wide Fund for Nature, Green Development Foundation, and Water to Go.The explorer said raising awareness of conservation work during the expedition "makes it far more worthwhile" because "protection of the environment is a huge passion of mine".The idea of trekking the Yangtze River formulated after Dykes visited China in 2010 and felt such a journey would take him "to the heart of the country".Dykes said that the journey was not only about challenging himself but about meeting people along the way and he said "the sheer scale and diversity that constantly changed across China" made it fun."It was about the locals, the different cultures, customs, and traditions. It has just been amazing," he said. "I was able to take time out and really soak up the experience because it wasn't about a speed record, it's a first and so there was no time limit."The expedition along the world's third-longest river is Dyke's third noteworthy achievement. In 2014, he claimed to have become the first person to walk the length of Mongolia, solo and unsupported, something he managed in 78 days. And, in 2016, he was described as the first person to have traversed the length of inland Madagascar, a journey of 2,574 kilometers that took 155 days.Dykes is already thinking about his next adventure and says he would like to do something in China."I'd like to do something shorter but just as ambitious and make it more interactive and educational," he said.
