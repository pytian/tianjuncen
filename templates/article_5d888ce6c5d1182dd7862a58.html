                Mogao Caves look beyond past to focus on cultural heritage
            </p>
            <p>
                When I first visited the famous Mogao Caves in Dunhuang 10 years ago, the beauty of the ancient Buddhist art was not the most moving part of the experience.Instead, the emptied Cave 17, known infamously as the "Library Cave" because of the priceless frescoes, sculptures, scrolls, books and other artifacts that were stolen by foreigners from at least five countries in the early 20th century, spurred me enough to call for the rightful of the treasures to China, which is now fully capable of preserving them for posterity.The first grotto near the Silk Road oasis in Gansu province is believed to have been carved out in AD 366. In the following millennia, the site grew to become of the world's finest repositories of Buddhist art whose influence continues to be felt beyond the religious, cultural and historical fields.The Library Cave used to contain more than 50,000 manuscripts and documents dating from AD 406. But a decade after the grotto was discovered in 1900, foreign explorers made off with the findings.Briton Aurel Stein is said to have taken at least 7,000 complete manuscripts and 6,000 fragments, including the Diamond Sutra (the world's oldest dated, printed book), while French rival Paul Pelliot apparently stayed in the cave to choose by candlelight the most valuable works because he could read the writings.Today, a fraction of the original pieces from the Library Cave are said to remain in China.Many people may also be upset by these events, especially when they see Mogao for themselves. But when I returned to the iconic site in July, most of the tourists and staff members exhibited none of the anger, bitterness or sense of loss stemming from the notorious looting.Researchers at the Dunhuang Academy, which manages and studies Mogao, as well as visiting scholars from across the world drawn to the caves, seemed singularly focused on sharing its rich cultural heritage with future generations at home and abroad.In the past few decades, through international collaborations, advanced technology and sheer passion, the academy has successfully preserved Mogao's relics.It is suitably proud of those achievements and is even applying its expertise to heritage sites in developing countries such as Cambodia's Angkor Wat temple. Academy researchers have traveled to India, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan to enhance more cultural interaction and understanding. The academy also uses state-of-the-art imaging and archiving technology in a major digitization move to allow the world to enjoy the art of Mogao. Nearly half of the 492 caves containing important Buddhist artifacts have been digitally archived, with 30 cave renderings made available online.Its scholars are also studying how the historic role that Dunhuang played in the ancient Silk Road as a hub of East-West economic and cultural exchange continues to be relevant today, in line with the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative global infrastructure and development drive.All these are a clear reflection of how Mogao has looked beyond the ravages of time and damage it suffered, to build bridges of common understanding and share its cultural heritage with the world.

                Chinese lessons in poverty alleviation
            </a>
            <p>
                The world could benefit a lot by taking a leaf out of Beijing's great experience in lifting 740 million people out of poverty since opening-up Poverty seriously affects the quality of people's life and undermines their basic right to live. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has made remarkable economic and social achievements, and achieved great progress in poverty alleviation. Since reform and opening-up, a total of 740 million people, more than the total population of Latin America, have been lifted out of poverty in China. In the process, China has accumulated experience in poverty alleviation, which it is ready to share with other poor countries. However, some Western countries are prejudiced in their view that China achieved all this by seizing special opportunities. In their opinion, China took advantage of the transfer of the world production system to become a global factory. Also, they believe China utilized cheaper labor force to make its economy develop rapidly and its success is just an accidental phenomenon. In my view, these scholars look at economic development in a mechanical way and misunderstand the logical relationship between economic development and poverty alleviation. Each era has its own opportunities for development, and economic growth does not necessarily lead to large-scale poverty reduction. Instead, it may lead to polarization and increase the relatively poor population. Economic development is just part of China's success in poverty reduction. The concept of poverty reduction and the role the government played are also crucial. Developed countries boast of relatively mature economic and social models. The proportion of the poor population is decided and a sound comprehensive aid system established between the government, private sector and enterprises. China's experience in poverty reduction may have little reference for developed countries, but can be of great positive significance for a majority of developing countries. In my view, these countries should pay attention to the following points when it comes to poverty reduction. First, they should unify the methods and goals for poverty alleviation. The ultimate goal of reducing poverty is to ensure basic living conditions for the people and improve their quality of life. Before China's reform and opening up, poverty reduction was mainly achieved by improving people's overall living conditions. Although per capita income is relatively low by world standards, the people's quality of life has improved. The "targeted poverty alleviation "work carried out by the Communist Party of China since the 18th National Congress emphasized on establishment of a long-term poverty alleviation mechanism to prevent returning to a state of poverty. Poverty alleviation cannot be solely achieved by offering material support like money, food or medicine. It is also necessary to build appropriate infrastructure to improve quality of life and their living capacity. Second, they should address poverty problems in the development process. We should increase investment in poverty reduction work in the development process, so that the impoverished can enjoy the dividend of growth. Also, polarization should be checked and social income distribution level should be rationally adjusted. Third, a balance should be struck between the leading role played by the government and people's initiative. Due to the positive external significance of poverty alleviation work, the government is sparing no effort to promote the work. To reduce poverty at the national level, it is necessary to make overall plans, coordinate the interests and relationships of all parties, and comprehensively utilize various resources. The government has advantages in these areas. Poverty reduction undertakings need a lot of financial support, and it is beneficial to use funds with the endorsement of government credit. Smooth progress of poverty alleviation work requires a country to develop a detailed plan through the government, from the top to the bottom, and establish an effective monitoring feedback mechanism. They should also fully respect people's initiative, correctly treat people's innovation and exploration in the cause of poverty alleviation, and rationalize and legalize related experience with the help of the government. Only thus can we promote positive interactions, mobilize people's enthusiasm and ensure the success of poverty reduction undertakings. China's experience in poverty alleviation is worth promoting for the benefit of other countries. Developing countries should be able to reduce poverty through aid projects, which China has actively participated in, especially in Africa. With the help of China, many railways, highways, hospitals and other infrastructures have been built, which has greatly improved the living conditions of locals. Developed countries often just offer material support to African countries. But China, by helping African countries promote their industries and improve their economic level, aims to help Africa fundamentally solve poverty problems. Through aid projects, China has brought advanced technologies and ideas to developing countries and established a bond of friendship with them. It is a direct way to promote China's poverty reduction experience. China's poverty alleviation experience can be disseminated through China-led international organizations such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Asian Investment Bank. China has undergone dramatic changes in growth and is aware of the real needs of poverty alleviation in developing countries. However, it becomes difficult for China to promote its valuable ideas among international organizations, which are often led by Western countries. But many new international organizations led by China, such as Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and Shanghai Cooperation Organization, can become platforms for China's voice to be heard. For instance, specialized poverty alleviation institutions can be established in these international organizations with the Chinese playing a vital role; a sub-forum on poverty reduction can be set up in international conferences to highlight Chinese experience and give more developing countries the opportunity to learn from China. China's achievements in recent decades have attracted officials from many developing countries to have a careful study here. A systematic training can help these officials learn more about China's programs. Also, special workshops combined with field work can help these officials understand the essence of China's poverty alleviation experience and better plan such undertakings in their own countries.

                Xi emphasizes cultural preservation
            </a>
            <p>
                At Dunhuang, site of celebrated grottoes, he says 'quintessence' of nation should be promoted to the worldWith a long history and splendid cultural heritage, Dunhuang in northwest China's Gansu province has long been seen as a precious pearl along the Silk Road, where different cultures met and conducted exchanges.So when President Xi Jinping began a four-day inspection tour in Gansu province last week, he made the first stop at Dunhuang, home of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Mogao Grottoes, as he sees the fine traditional culture as important in rejuvenating the Chinese nation and promoting inclusive international cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative.Touring the grottoes, Xi, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, inspected the work of cultural relics protection and research, and stressed the need to preserve the finer features of the nation's culture.At the Dunhuang Academy, he learned from a local official of the production and performance of major cultural shows like Silk Road, Flower Rain, a classical Chinese dance drama, and their international exchanges.Xi hailed the Dunhuang culture as a result of long-term cultural exchanges and mutual learning between Chinese and foreign civilizations, and called for more efforts in cultural interactions.The president stressed the need to step up support in carrying forward and promoting the Dunhuang culture to preserve "our quintessence".Dunhuang, an oasis located at a religious and cultural crossroads on the Silk Road, boasts more than 2,000 sculptures and 45,000 square meters of murals in 735 cliff caves.Digging of the Mogao Grottoes began in 366. They symbolize the great achievements of China's Buddhist art from the fourth century to the 14th century. They also showcase the cultural integration and mutual learning among the diverse civilizations along the ancient Silk Road.At a seminar attended by scholars, experts and officials in the Dunhuang Academy, Xi said that as the nation strives to rejuvenate its culture, it needs to be more inclusive to extensively develop cultural exchanges with other countries and actively draw on the outstanding achievements of civilizations around the world.Dunhuang displays the Chinese nation's confidence in its culture, and only a self-confident civilization can absorb and draw on the achievements of other civilizations in an inclusive manner while maintaining its own features.He encouraged cultural experts to tell the stories of Dunhuang and spread the voice of China to the rest of the world in an effort to promote international cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative.Fan Jinshi, an archaeologist who began working in Dunhuang in 1963 at the age of 25 and is now honorary president of the Dunhuang Academy, said she was excited at Xi's placing so much importance on the protection of cultural relics, China Central Television reported.Xi mentioned many times in his remarks the need to increase support for the protection of cultural relics, Fan said, adding that he also suggested employing high technology in protecting cultural relics.Xi has underlined the importance of preserving traditional Chinese culture on many occasions. Since he was elected the general secretary of the CPC Central Committee in 2012, he has often made stops at cultural heritage sites when conducting inspection tours nationwide.In a written instruction to a national meeting on cultural relics protection in April 2016, Xi called cultural relics "a valuable legacy from our ancestors", and stressed that conservation will benefit future generations.During a group study session of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee in October 2014, Xi stressed that good governance of today's China requires an in-depth understanding of the nation's history and traditional culture, and must draw on the experiences and wisdom of ancient governors.Xi has also talked about history and culture on international occasions, highlighting the importance of cultural exchanges in promoting relations between China and the rest of the world.During his first overseas foreign visit to Italy this year, Xi told participants of a cultural event in Rome that both China and Italy have a long history and attach importance to the inheritance of cultures, which laid the foundation for the two nations to understand each other and have a long-standing friendship.In March, when Xi visited France, French President Emmanuel Macron presented him with the original French version of An Introduction to the Analects of Confucius, which was published in 1688, as a national gift. It testifies to the long-standing cultural bonds between the two nations, which establishes a solid foundation for people of today to deepen their relationships.Speaking at the opening of the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations held in Beijing in May, Xi called for exchanges and mutual learning among countries and cultures around the world to strengthen support for jointly building a community with a shared future for mankind.

                World is heading toward multipolarity. But what kind?
            </a>
            <p>
                The year of the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China - now one of the key players in world politics and global development - offers a good occasion for a discussion of the current state and further evolution of the international system.However, various turbulences of day-to-day politics make such a discussion difficult. The trade war launched by US President Donald Trump against China is testing China’s resilience and has caused a slowdown in global growth. The technological competition has focused much international attention on the tensions around 5G technology, on the restrictions that the US has imposed on the export of some of its technological products to China and on the legal wrangling around the Huawei company. These developments are occupying much international attention and create an impression that the world is now witnessing an incipient “cold war” between the US and China.But is this an accurate perception? The American tariff hikes have a limited impact on the global economy. Technological progress can be slowed down as a result of American restrictions, but it cannot be stopped no matter how hard the current US president tries. The world has changed and the era of a seeming unipolarity with the US at the top is irreversibly over. The real question is what kind of multipolar world will emerge in the 21st Century. Its contours can be detected already and it will be, to a large extent, defined by China.Serious reflection is called for. A new multipolar world will not emerge instantaneously and it will not be dominated by a single power. While international systems in the past two centuries have been described with a reference to a single leading power - Pax Britannica in the large part of the 19th century and Pax Americana in the second half of the 20th century - no such characterization is likely in the 21st century. A “Pax Sinica” is neither desired by China nor likely in the emerging multipolarity of the 21st century. For one, China is committed to its domestic agenda: Developing China’s internal market, promoting entrepreneurship and innovation, improving the environment and overall coordinating economic progress and social development. These are demanding tasks that will enjoy the highest priority. They belong to the domestic agenda, but will also require another generation of opening up of China. At the same time, the international system will involve several agile great powers and a series of smaller players. It will increasingly include countries of the developing world, in continuation of the process started with decolonization seven decades ago. All this makes repetition of history highly unlikely.So what kind of multipolarity should be expected? The multipolarity of our era is reaching more deeply than traditional power politics and balance of power considerations. It will be characterized both by deep interdependence and, at the same time, by significant diversity of conceptions of modernity, domestic order and legitimacy of the state. Multipolarity in our era already includes different development models that are nevertheless capable of productive cooperation and cross-fertilization.This represents an opportunity for the 21st century, an opportunity that must not be missed. In the emerging world there are no natural enemies and no forever allies. States have to be able to cooperate and compete at the same time. Political alliances are likely to be flexible, short lived and judged by actual achievement. There will always be more than two powerful players involved in every question of global significance. The world of the 21st century is likely to be a world of constant interaction among a variety of players, some old and some new ones. While the relations between China and the US will be important, they are highly unlikely to lead to bipolarity, let alone to binary patterns known in the Cold War era.Obviously, the crystallization of a new system of international relations will take time and will require sensible management. Is this possible within the existing global normative and institutional order? Unsurprisingly, the answer is - yes. The basic normative framework of the world, enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, represents the necessary normative platform and contains nothing that would impede global development in the 21st century. It is based on the principle of respect for sovereign equality of all states, the rule of international law and on the objective of an ever more intense global cooperation.Significantly, the institutional framework of the UN Charter allows for an evolution that can be of great help in developing the international system of the 21st century. Chapter VIII of the UN Charter speaks about regional arrangements that can be put in place to resolve regional problems, in conformity with the basic principles of international law and the UN Charter. Since the creation of the UN in 1945, the number and variety of regional arrangements have grown and offered answers to the new needs of international cooperation. China has contributed imaginative innovations. The creation of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in 2001 is an example. The more recent creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is another. Organizations like these two are regional in their immediate geographic reach, while at the same time they offer answers to some of the questions of global importance. They represent a valuable supplement to the existing global institutional architecture. In addition, they provide a welcome element of competition and an incentive for reform of the global institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.Chapter VIII of the UN Charter poses no limits to innovation and creation of new institutional frameworks needed for an intensified international cooperation. The experience in the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative, launched five years ago, offers opportunities for further innovation. These opportunities should be at the center of thinking about the evolution of the international system at the time of the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China.Danilo Türk was president of the Republic of Slovenia from 2007 to 2012.

                Sino-Russian ties apt example of win-win partnership
            </a>
            <p>
                Beijing-Moscow relations went through many ups and downs before beginning to dramatically improve in the early 1990s, proving that a resilient and robust Sino-Russian partnership is of vital interest to both sides.On Oct 2, 1949, the day after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union became the first country to establish diplomatic relations with China, ushering in years of friendly cooperation.In the early 1950s, several bilateral treaties were signed, including the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, with the Soviet Union providing support for China in various fields, including helping construct more than 150 major projects during the First Five-Year Plan (1953-1957) period. The Soviet Union also provided military support for China after the latter joined the Korean War (1950-53) to safeguard its border. And China appreciated the contributions of the Soviet Union during its early stages of development.
