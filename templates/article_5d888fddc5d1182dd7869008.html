                Artists around the globe today are working in a variety of media, although some still prefer painting as the primary presentation of their art and thought.Intriguing Uncertainties, an ongoing exhibition through Oct 21 at Beijing's Parkview Museum, is dedicated to such efforts, showing dozens of paintings by artists from across the world.Exhibition curator Lorand Hegyi has picked up works that reveal to the audience phenomena of obscurity and irrationality, which not only exist in people's imaginations but also happen in daily life.The works, done in an intriguing and poetic manner, invite people to appreciate the beauty of the creative mind and the uncertainties of the relationship between human society and the universe.Not only do these paintings inspire viewers to imagine, they renew the role of painting as an important way to share one's individual experiences and private feelings, like that of writing.

                    San Francisco close to vaping ban
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                San Francisco is on its way to becoming the first city in the United States to ban sales of electronic cigarettes.The San Francisco Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously approved the first reading of a proposal that would restrict the sale, manufacture and distribution of e-cigarettes in the city until the US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has weighed in with a review of the impact of e-cigarette vapors on public health.The measure will undergo a second reading on June 25. If passed, it will be sent to the mayor's office for signing."Over the past two years, we have seen an increase in nicotine addiction, primarily for young children, also middle-school children and high-school students, because of e-cigarettes," Supervisor Shamann Walton, a main sponsor of the measure, told China Daily.Walton said the city has seen a 36 percent uptick in middle-and high-school students' usage of nicotine from 2017 to 2018."E-cigarette companies are aggressively putting these products in the hands of young people, and so we wanted to make sure that we did everything we could to protect our young people from further addiction to nicotine," he added.According to the FDA, 3.62 million US middle-and high-school students were using e-cigarettes in 2018.E-cigarette use increased 78 percent among high-school students in 2017-18, and 48 percent among middle-school students, the administration said.Georgetown Law Professor Eric Lindblom, a former FDA tobacco control official, said the impact of the ban will unlikely be large."The ban on e-cigarette sales, at best, will reduce purchases of e-cigarettes by youth and by e-cigarette users that do not regularly go outside of the city's boundaries, where e-cigarettes will still be readily available. That should be helpful to the extent that it stops e-cigarette use by youth or adults who would not otherwise smoke. But it might also reduce e-cigarette use as a smoking substitute by some smokers," he said."Banning e-cigarette sales while still allowing cigarette sales is a bit backward, if the goal is reducing tobacco-nicotine use harm," he added.San Francisco is the home of Juul Labs, a leading e-cigarette company.

                    San Francisco bans sale of e-cigarettes
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Through a landmark decision at a Board of Supervisors meeting on Tuesday, San Francisco became the nation's first city to ban the sale of e-cigarettes.The supervisors approved the second and final reading of a measure that prohibits the sale of electronic cigarettes and flavored tobacco products that have not received FDA approval for their marketing, a decision its proponents say will combat the epidemic of youth vaping.Along with the e-cigarette sale ban, the supervisors also passed a measure that prohibits the sale, manufacture and distribution of tobacco products on city property.The ordinance will be sent to Mayor London Breed's office for signing. The mayor has 10 days to either sign or not sign it."I support the legislation authored by City Attorney Dennis Herrera and Supervisor Shamann Walton to suspend the sale of e-cigarettes in San Francisco until the Food and Drug Administration concludes a review of the impacts of vaping on public health," Breed said in a statement Tuesday."There is so much we don't know about the health impacts of these products, but we do know that e-cigarette companies are targeting our kids in their advertising and getting them hooked on addictive nicotine products. We need to take action to protect the health of San Francisco's youth and prevent the next generation of San Franciscans from becoming addicted to these products," she added.The measure will become effective 30 days after signing. However, it will take another six months for the measure to be fully-implemented.What's ironic about the vote is that San Francisco is the home of leading electronic-cigarette maker Juul, which announced on June 18 the purchase of the 123 Mission Street building in the city as additional office space, the same day that the Board of Supervisors passed the first reading of the bans.Responding to the passage of the measure, Ted Kwong, a spokesman for Juul, said the bans will drive adult smokers back to cigarettes by making an alternative option less accessible."This full prohibition will drive former adult smokers who successfully switched to vapor products back to deadly cigarettes, deny the opportunity to switch for current adult smokers, and create a thriving black market instead of addressing the actual causes of underage access and use," Kwong said."We have already taken the most aggressive actions in the industry to keep our products out of the hands of those underage and are taking steps to do more," he added.The company is preparing its own ballot initiative, which would "enact stronger regulation and enforcement rather than prohibition," Kwong said.The initiative includes such proposals as a requirement for retailers to use electronic scanning technology to verify the buyers' information. It would also prohibit the marketing of vapor products to minors.Kwong told China Daily that the company has the required signatures to put the initiative on the ballot for the upcoming November election, but it was "preserving all options".In a previous interview, Supervisor Shamann Walton, a main sponsor for the measure, said that many of Juul's proposed regulations are already in place in the city.If voters approve Juul's proposal, the supervisors' e-cigarette sale ban could be rendered unenforceable, some insiders said.Dr. Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University and the founder and executive director of Tobacco Prevention Toolkit, an online curricular aimed at reducing and preventing tobacco use among youths, said the vote will send a clear message to e-cigarette companies to be compliant with the FDA regulations and for the FDA to enforce their laws. The point of the decision was to restrict the sale of e-cigarettes in San Francisco until the e-cigarette companies take the proper steps to submit a pre-market application to the FDA for authorization, she said.According to the 2016 FDA Deeming Rule, all e-cigarette companies must submit this application for review. Since this was not done, the marketing and sales of e-cigarettes is essentially not allowed. "While adult cigarette smokers switching to exclusive adult e-cigarette use may be safer, e-cigarettes are still not safe," Halpern-Felsher said. "There are numerous studies showing the effects of vaping on cardiovascular and lung health.  "My concern is with youth," she added. "Youth aren't initiating tobacco use through cigarettes, but through e-cigarettes.  So the comparison for youth isn't e-cigarettes vs cigarettes, but e-cigarettes vs no tobacco use."

                    Michigan first state to ban flavored e-cigs
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Michigan on Wednesday became the first US state to ban flavored e-cigarettes as more than 200 people in at least 25 states have come down with a lung illness that appears to be linked to e-cigarettes and has caused two deaths.Governor Gretchen Whitmer ordered the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to issue emergency rules banning the sale of sweet, fruity and menthol e-cigarettes, which studies say are more likely to get young people hooked on vaping.The rules ban vaping products in retail stores and online. They will also prohibit "misleading marketing" of vapor products using terms like "clean," "safe" and "healthy", the state said.The emergency rules will go into effect immediately and will last for six months but can be renewed as officials develop permanent regulations.Michigan's ban comes after the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) said that youth vaping constitutes a public health emergency for the state, and after the state reported last week that it is investigating six cases of severe respiratory illnesses linked to vaping.On Tuesday, Oregon health officials said that a middle-age Oregonian died in July from a severe respiratory illness after using an e-cigarette vaping device that burned cannabis.On Friday, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported the first known death from the illness. It said an adult hospitalized with severe respiratory illness after vaping died in August. The department didn't give details on the patient or the exact circumstances of their death.Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that there were 215 cases of severe respiratory disease in 25 states since late June. All patients are teenagers or young adults. Health officials said they believe their illnesses are associated with vaping, but they haven't been able to single out which ingredient or device may be causing the problem.NBC News reported Wednesday that its survey of state health departments has revealed at least 329 confirmed or possible cases.The CDC said that "many patients have reported using e-cigarettes containing cannabinoid products such as THC or CBD", and it warned teenagers and other consumers to stop buying bootleg and street cannabis and e-cigarette products, and to stop modifying devices to vape adulterated substances.Symptoms of the vaping-related lung disease include difficulty breathing, shortness of breath and chest pain, health officials said. Fatigue, diarrhea and vomiting also have been reported."As governor, my number one priority is keeping our kids safe," Whitmer, a Democrat, said in a statement. "And right now, companies selling vaping products are using candy flavors to hook children on nicotine and misleading claims to promote the belief that these products are safe. That ends today."The American Vaping Association, which promotes e-cigarettes as a way to help smokers quit traditional cigarettes, said it would support lawsuits challenging the ban.Association President Greg Conley called Whitmer's move a "shameless attempt at backdoor prohibition''. He said it will "close down several hundred Michigan small businesses and could send tens of thousands of ex-smokers back to deadly combustible cigarettes"."No other state has done something like this by rule-making, probably because lawyers will tell most governors that, 'Hey, you're not a king or queen,'" Conley told The Detroit News.In June, San Francisco – where leading e-cigarette maker Juul Labs is headquartered — became the first major US city to ban e-cigarette sales. The ban includes sales in brick-and-mortar stores, as well as online sales shipped to a San Francisco address. The ordinance also applies to flavored tobacco products in addition to e-cigarettes. The measure doesn't ban the use of vapes among people 21 and older.In Michigan, the ban comes not by executive order from Whitmer, but through Michigan's administrative rules process, which allows state agencies to create regulations or policies that, once authorized, act as laws.The vaping ban rule hasn't yet been filed but will be effective immediately once complete in a few weeks, Whitmer's spokesperson said. Then the ban will last six months and will give Michigan businesses 30 days to comply.Michigan officials said they will develop permanent regulations banning flavored e-cigarettes. The state Legislature could try to block those rules, but such legislation would face a veto, they said.In 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said 3.62 million middle and high school students reported using e-cigarettes in 2018. The FDA noted a 78 percent increase among high school students from 2017, and a 48 percent increase among middle schoolers.A 2013-2014 survey on e-cigarette use found that 81 percent of young e-cigarette users said the appealing flavor options were a major reason for their use. Kevin Burns, CEO of Juul Labs, maker of the blockbuster e-cigarette device blamed by many for the surge in teenage vaping, said in a recent television interview that he didn't know of evidence linking the recent illnesses to Juul's products.In a statement given to China Daily on Wednesday, Juul said it hasn't yet reviewed the Michigan decision, but "we believe that strong and serious actions need to be taken around certain flavored products, which is why we already stopped selling our non-tobacco/non-menthol based JUULpods to traditional retail stores''.The company said it's "aggressively fighting against counterfeit and compatible flavored products which can appeal to youth and can be made with unknown ingredients, under unknown quality and manufacturing standards''.The Associated Press contributed to this story.

                    US FDA warns Juul over its marketing practices
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The US Food and Drug Administration said on Monday it had issued a warning letter to Juul Labs Inc over its marketing practices for e-cigarettes, the latest in the agency's efforts to curb the use of the devices that have become extremely popular among teens.The agency said Juul's labeling and advertising of its vaping devices can lead to consumers believing that the products present a lower risk of tobacco-related diseases or are less harmful than other commercially marketed tobacco products.Juul did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.Juul has already come under scrutiny for its marketing efforts, including its use of social media influencers to promote its vaping devices, with the Federal Trade Commission launching an investigation last month.The FDA said it was concerned that Juul's representation of products may look like switching to its vaping device was a safer alternative to cigarettes.Juul uses a nicotine concentration of 5 percent in its products, which could potentially increase their addictiveness, and nicotine salts that are used to mask the harshness of nicotine, the agency said questioning their usage.The FDA has also asked Juul to provide a written response within 15 days outlining its plan to correct its violations and to provide requested documents and information within 30 days of the date of the letter.Last year, the agency had requested documents from Juul to examine the high rates of youth use and had conducted a surprise inspection at Juul's San Francisco headquarter and seized documents.Reuters

                The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) told Juul Labs, the dominant maker of e-cigarettes, to immediately correct marketing that the agency said violates federal regulations by advertising nicotine pods as a safer alternative to cigarettes without approval from the agency.Federal law prohibits companies from marketing their products as safer than cigarettes or as a safe alternative without proving those claims to the FDA.In a warning letter to Juul CEO Kevin Burns made public Monday, the FDA listed various claims by Juul, including that its products are a "much safer than cigarettes". The agency has been investigating Juul for months but had not previously warned the company. The FDA also warned Juul about a statement by Burns that had appeared on the Juul website stating that the Juul vaping system is designed to "heat nicotine liquid and deliver smokers the satisfaction that they want without the combustion and harm associated with it".The letter said Juul "should immediately correct the violations". The company has 15 days to respond to the FDA and detail steps it is taking to correct the violations or it could face penalties and potentially have its products seized.The agency also asked Juul to provide requested documents and information within 30 days of the date of the letter.In a statement, a spokesman for the San Francisco-based company said, "We are reviewing the letters and will fully cooperate."The FDA action comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Monday that more than 450 cases of vaping-related lung illnesses are under investigation to determine if e-cigarette usage could have been a factor. Public health investigators haven't determined the cause but have cited the use of both cannabis-related and nicotine vaping products from a number of companies as possible suspects.The CDC said the agency "has advised that individuals consider not using e-cigarettes because as of now, this is the primary means of preventing this type of severe lung disease".Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless said in a statement: "Regardless of where products like e-cigarettes fall on the continuum of tobacco product risk, the law is clear that, before marketing tobacco products for reduced risk, companies must demonstrate with scientific evidence that their specific product does in fact pose less risk or is less harmful. JUUL has ignored the law, and very concerningly, has made some of these statements in school to our nation's youth."In another letter, the FDA also requested more information about the company's outreach to students, health insurers, employers and Native American tribes.

                    US mulls flavored e-cigarette ban
                </p>

                US President Donald Trump said Wednesday that his administration will seek to ban all flavors used in e-cigarettes amid growing concern about their health hazards and use by teenagers.The proposal would ban popular fruit flavors, as well as menthol and mint e-cigarettes from stores and online sellers, leaving just tobacco-flavored products.The administration's move comes as health officials are investigating more than 450 cases of lung disease across the US that some officials believe were triggered by vaping. Six deaths have been attributed to the disease, the exact cause of which hasn't yet been discovered.Trump described vaping as a "new problem in the country''. "We can't allow people to get sick. And we can't have our kids be so affected," he said.Trump made his comments after a meeting in the Oval Office with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and acting Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Ned Sharpless.First lady Melania Trump was in the room, and Trump said she feels "very, very strongly" about the issue because of their 13-year-old son Barron.Earlier this week, she urged more regulation of vaping products, writing on Twitter: "I am deeply concerned about the growing epidemic of e-cigarette use in our children. We need to do all we can to protect the public from tobacco-related disease and death and prevent e-cigarettes from becoming an on-ramp to nicotine addiction for a generation of youth."More than 80 percent of underage teens who use e-cigarettes say they chose the product because it comes in flavors they like, according to government surveys.The administration's proposal would apply only to nicotine vaping products regulated by the FDA. Azar told reporters it will take several weeks to develop the restrictions, which will be subject to public input before taking effect.He said preliminary data from the 2019 National Youth Tobacco Survey showed a continued, troubling rise in youth e-cigarette use. The data showed more than a quarter of high school students have used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days — up from a little over a fifth in 2018. The overwhelming majority of students said they used fruity or menthol or mint flavors.Azar said flavored products could apply for FDA permission to re-enter the market. But under agency standards, only products that represent a net benefit to the nation's public health can win FDA approval.He said the administration would allow tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes to remain available for adult smokers. But he said that if children begin using those products "we will take enforcement action there also".It is unclear whether vaping companies could take legal action to block a ban on flavors, which would be a major blow to the vaping industry, including companies such as Juul Labs, the dominant e-cigarette maker in the US that has been blamed for a rise in vaping among American teenagers."We strongly agree with the need for aggressive category-wide action on flavored products. We will fully comply with the final FDA policy when effective," San Francisco-based Juul said in a statement Wednesday.Juul sought to curb teen vaping in the US by stopping the sale of mango, fruit, creme and cucumber-flavored pods at brick-and-mortar stores last year, but that has increased Juul's sales of its mint-flavored pods, the New York Post reported Wednesday.Mint pods now account for 74.1 percent of the company's total sales, up from 35 percent before the other flavors were pulled, according to proprietary Nielsen numbers the newspaper said it obtained. Other Nielsen data shows that the figure represents a 200 percent surge in annualized revenue over the last 10 months to $2.36 billion, according to the Post.Juul said it kept its mint flavor on the market to help adult smokers quit the habit.Juul launched its products in more than a dozen countries this week, but the company isn't setting the same limits overseas that it imposed on its e-cigarette sales to combat underage vaping in the US, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.Overseas, Juul sells online to 18-year-olds, and flavors such as mango, berry and apple are available on store shelves around the world, the newspaper reported.Juul had $1.27 billion in global revenue, including more than $100 million outside the US, in the first half of 2019, according to people familiar with the matter, according to the Journal.Juul entered its 19th country Monday with its launch in China, which has the world's most smokers, 350 million, the newspaper reported.The company's products are available on Chinese e-commerce sites JD and Tmall, a marketplace owned by Alibaba, according to the Journal. Those sites will verify that purchasers are 18 or older, Juul said. Its products aren't yet available in physical stores in China.E-cigarettes like those made by Juul, which use vapors from liquid pods to deliver nicotine, are still mostly allowed in China, where dozens of e-cigarette startups have raised millions of dollars to launch their products.The global e-vapor market grew to $15.8 billion in 2018 from $3.7 billion in 2013, according to Euromonitor International. China represented only $750 million of that market last year.China's National Health Commission has said it plans to introduce legislation to regulate the vaping industry. Shenzhen, which manufactures the majority of e-cigarette devices worldwide, in June banned their use in public places.
