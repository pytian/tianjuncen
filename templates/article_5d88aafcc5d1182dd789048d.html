                SEOUL - Republic of Korea (ROK) on Tuesday decided to set the compulsory military service period at 21 months amid growing concerns over a weakening of defense capabilities in the wake of a series of provocations by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).  Related readings: ROK reopens sea route to Yeonpyeong Island SKorean troops bracing for possible NKorean attack Anti-war and pro-unification activists in Seoul DPRK says drills 'not worth response'Early this month, the Presidential Commission for National Security Review called on the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae to extend the compulsory military service period to 24 months. However, Cheong Wa Dae had remained hesitant to pursue the idea for fear of a public backlash.  The government settled for a compromise that calls for freezing the Army service at 21 months, Navy service at 23 months and Air Force service at 24 months, the Ministry of National Defense said in a statement.  Currently, all able-bodied ROK men must serve slightly more than 21 months in the military.

                South Korea's Hanjin Shipping Co's container carrier "Hanjin Tianjin" is seen in this undated handout photo released by Yonhap news agency on April 21, 2011. [Photo/Agencies]A second ship, an Italian-flagged vessel with 21 crew, was also hijacked by Somali pirates Thursday, the European Union's anti-piracy task force said.Hanjin Shipping Co spokeswoman Sonya Cho said the South Korean commando raid was carried out by the Choi Young, a helicopter-carrying warship with a crew of 200.She said the pirates who attacked the 75,000-ton Hanjin Tianjin about 250 miles (400 kilometers) east of Yemen's Socotra island were not found by the commandos.The South Korean ship sustained "some damage" in the attack but the 14 South Korean and six Indonesian crew members retreated to a specially designed shelter and were unhurt, she said."Our crew stopped the engine and hid in the citadel to protect themselves from the pirate attack," she said.Cmdr. Paddy O'Kennedy of the European Union Naval Force said according to his information the ship was attacked, but there was no solid confirmation that pirates had boarded it."The Koreans boarded the ship but there were no pirates on board," he said.Hanjin said it had lost contact with the ship earlier in the day after it sent a coded distress message indicating it had been attacked by pirates.Cho Byung-jae, a spokesman for South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, confirmed that the Choi Young had been deployed for a possible rescue attempt."It has been our government's consistent position that we do not negotiate with pirates," he said. "This will not change."In recent years Somali pirates operating off the east African coast have hijacked at least eight South Korean ships, all of which were released, many after South Korean companies paid a ransom.In January, however, South Korean commandos attacked the Samho Jewelry after it had been hijacked, killing eight pirates and arresting five others, with no loss of life to crew members. The surviving pirates were brought back to South Korea and are awaiting trial.Also Thursday, the European Union's anti-piracy task force said Somali pirates hijacked the Italian-flagged MV Rosalia D'Amato as it sailed about 400 miles (650 kilometers) southeast of the Omani port of Salalah in the Indian Ocean.It said the 74,500-ton ship was on its way to Iran from Brazil when it was attacked by a single skiff.Coalition warships had contacted the vessel but were told to stay away as pirates had already boarded the vessel, it said.There was no further information on the status of the ship's six Italian and 15 Filipino crew members.The task force also said Thursday that it had returned 18 suspected pirates to Somalia after several countries with an interest in their case declined to prosecute them.The suspects were detained after an attack April 5 on the Singapore-flagged MV Pacific Opal.The task force did not name the countries, but normally nations that seize pirates have the right to prosecute them or request other states to put them on trial on their behalf.Many countries are unwilling to shoulder the burden of a court case or face possible reprisals from other pirates.According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime's anti-piracy initiative, more than 1,000 Somalis have been convicted or are on trial for suspected piracy.

                    US: Storms, floods kill 5 in Arkansas

                VILONIA, Arkansas -- Violent storms carved out a swatch of damage three miles (five kilometers) wide Monday night in central Arkansas, leaving at least two residents of a small town dead, authorities said.Three others were killed when floodwaters swept their vehicles off the road in the northwest corner of the state, authorities said.The National Weather Service said it was extremely likely a tornado swept through Vilonia, where at least two people died, according to Arkansas Department of Emergency Management spokesman Tommy Jackson."The town's gone," Vilonia resident Sheldon Brock said outside a gas station a few miles (kilometers) outside of town.Related readings: SKorean commandos storm ship after pirate attack 35 dead in 6 US states after storm's rampage Pro-Gadhafi forces storm into AjdabiyaAuthorities closed roadways surrounding the central Arkansas town, some 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Little Rock, and cautioned residents not to venture back with chainsaws to help clear the debris.John Robinson, a meteorologist for the weather service in Little Rock, said it was likely a tornado hit Vilonia. He said tornadoes were also likely at the Little Rock Air Force Base in Jacksonville, Arkansas, as well as in Garland and Polk counties."It wouldn't surprise me if it were 10 or 12 tornadoes," Robinson said.Meanwhile, in northwestern Arkansas, emergency officials said three other people died after floodwaters swept their vehicles off the road.In Madison County, emergency management coordinator Lori McConnell said a man and a woman died after floodwaters swept their car off the road. In neighboring Washington County, sheriff's spokeswoman Kelly Cantrell said a woman died when her car was swept off Arkansas 265 in the southern part of the county. The woman's 11-year-old son survived.The spokeswoman said the sheriff's office had performed more than 10 water rescues during the day, from homes and vehicles.Gov. Mike Beebe declared a state of emergency, retroactive to April 19, when another series of violent storms moved through Arkansas. Beebe plans to tour affected areas after the extent of damage is better known after daybreak.

                    Military: SKorean marine troubled before shooting
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                SEOUL, South Korea - A South Korean marine expressed anger about being shunned and slighted and showed signs of mental illness before he killed four colleagues at a front-line base, military officials said Tuesday.The 19-year-old corporal, surnamed Kim, also wounded another marine Monday when he opened fire at a Ganghwa Island base just south of the tense maritime border with North Korea, officials said.Chief investigator Kwon Yeong-jae told reporters Kim had a "psychological problem" and referred to a note in which Kim was said to have lamented the state of his life. Kim was also monitored by superiors due to worries that he might cause trouble, Kwon said.Kim tried unsuccessfully to kill himself by detonating a grenade after the shooting, Kwon said.Another military official, who declined to be named because Kim was still being questioned, later said Kim wrote in a memo to an investigator that his fellow marines had treated him with little respect.The official said the situation lasted for a while and fellow marines found Kim's behavior to be a problem.According to a defense ministry report obtained by the office of opposition lawmaker Shin Hak-yong, Kim showed "anxiety, personality disorder and schizophrenia" in psychology tests during his training as a recruit. Kim's colleagues said the corporal was "hot-tempered and unstable," the report added.A defense official, who also would not be named because of office policy, said one of Kim's memos to investigators read: "Ostracizing must disappear." The official would not give further details.All able-bodied South Korean men must serve about two years in the military under a conscription system aimed at countering aggression from North Korea. Marines, however, volunteer for service and are considered the toughest branch of South Korea's 650,000-member military.Kim's base is one of a cluster that sit on islands on the inter-Korean front line, and tensions there have taken a toll.The waters are claimed by both countries. Boats routinely jostle for position during crab catching season, and three deadly naval clashes since 1999 have taken a few dozen lives.Since the North bombarded a South Korean island near Ganghwa last year, the South has beefed up its high-tech weapons systems and the marines' combat readiness.The shooting is the worst in South Korea's military since 2005, when a soldier tossed a hand grenade and opened fire at a front-line army unit in a rampage that killed eight colleagues and injured several others. Pfc. Kim Dong-min told investigators he was enraged at superiors who verbally abused him.The shootings have raised questions about the level of discipline in South Korea's military. Kwon said Kim's base failed to maintain proper security before the attack. Kwon said there was only one person with access to the base armory, instead of the required two.

                    IOC drops plagiarism probe into SKorean member

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                LAUSANNE, Switzerland - The International Olympic Committee has dropped an ethics investigation into a South Korean member accused of plagiarism. IOC President Thomas Bach says the ethics commission closed the case into athlete member Moon Dae-sung, a former gold medalist in taekwondo who was accused of plagiarizing much of his university doctorate thesis. The investigation began in April 2012. Bach says the IOC repeatedly asked the university for its own findings but has yet to receive its decision. As a result, Bach says, the ethics panel ``decided to close this file at least for the time being'' but it could be reopened if new facts emerge. In May, the IOC reprimanded Hungarian member and former Hungarian president Pal Schmitt after a university panel found that much of his thesis had been plagiarized.

                SEOUL, South Korea — Imprisoned former South Korean President Park Geun-hye on Wednesday requested a temporarily release so she can be treated for health problems her lawyer says are causing "burning" and "cutting" pain.An official from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office said it will soon review Park's request. He spoke on condition of anonymity, citing office rules against speaking to the media.South Korean criminal law allows prisoners with serious health problems to be treated at hospitals under the eye of prosecutors before returning to prison after recovery.Yoo Young-ha, Park's lawyer, said she has been dealing with disc problems and spinal stenosis, a narrowing of the passageways for spinal nerves, in her neck and back areas, which he said have caused intense pain and sleeping problems.While Park has been permitted to make several visits to a Seoul hospital to receive pain management treatments, her conditions have worsened to a point where more serious medical care and surgery are required, Yoo said.Park "has been struggling with a level of pain that makes it impossible for her to sleep normally, but she has been persevering with superhuman will," Yoo said. "It's no longer possible to treat the conditions while she stays in prison."The prosecution official did not confirm any details on Park's health.AP
