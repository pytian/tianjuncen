                Efforts to fight female illiteracy, boost gender equality lauded in white paper
            </p>
            <p>
                China has made significant progress in curbing female illiteracy, according to a white paper on Thursday. Released by the State Council Information Office to mark the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in October, the report lauded the progress in several chapters - alongside other gender equality and women's welfare improvements - in a host of areas, ranging from financial and political status to maternal health. The illiteracy rate among women aged 15 and older has seen a drastic decline over the last 70 years, from 90 percent to 7.3 percent as of 2017, the report said.

                Philippines starts reintegrating former Mindanao rebels into society
            </a>
            <p>
                MANILA - The Philippines has started the reintegration of former rebels into the society, a move Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said will bring "lasting peace" in the southern Mindanao region.On Saturday, the chair of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, or MILF, and interim chief minister of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Al Haj Murad Ebrahim, handed over an assault rifle to Duterte at the start of a decommissioning ceremony in Simuay, Sultan Kudarat, in the southern province of Maguindanao.Murad said the assault rifle was "a token" by MILF for its "very strong appreciation for what (Duterte) has done to the Bangsamoro people and our homeland".The decommissioning process of 1,060 MILF militants is part of the implementation of the "normalization" guaranteed by the 2014 Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro. This first batch of 12,000 soldiers amounts to about 30 percent of the 40,000-strong MILF-Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces members to be decommissioned by April next year.The decommissioning also includes the handover of 920 weapons and nearly 20 heavy weapons and more than 600 rounds for seven rocket launchers.Duterte lauded the "significant progress" in the implementation of the comprehensive agreement."This is indeed a huge step toward our goal of achieving lasting peace for Mindanao," Duterte said in a speech on Saturday night. "Let us celebrate this milestone."Duterte assured the MILF combatants "that the government will assist you as you reintegrate into society and enjoy fruitful and productive civilian lives"."Let us set aside our differences and avoid further armed conflict," Duterte said, assuring the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region, the MILF, and the people of Mindanao that "this administration will always listen to your grievances".Duterte urged "all concerned stakeholders to continue working with government so that our gains for many years of peace-building efforts will never go to waste".Under the normalization track, the combatants, their families and communities will receive social protection packages, sustainable livelihood programs, capacity-building training, health benefits and educational assistance.It is envisioned that the ex-fighters will be able to return to mainstream society and six MILF camps and communities will be transformed into peaceful, productive and resilient communities.Saturday's decommissioning ceremony took place seven months after the organic law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region was ratified in a plebiscite.Since 1997, the government and the MILF have engaged in on-again, off-again negotiations on a settlement and political arrangement that would provide substantial autonomy to Muslims in Mindanao and put an end to the decades-old military conflict that started in the late 1960s.About 150,000 people died in the conflict.Xinhua

            </a>
            <p>
                Platform builds cooperation between countries and boosts economic growthThe Second Shanghai Forum on the Belt and Road Initiative was held on Wednesday in Shanghai amid the Eighth World Forum on China Studies, bringing together 60 international experts to discuss the promotion of high-quality Belt and Road Initiative partnerships."The initiative is entirely open to all countries and regions, and we have seen its global growth gaining momentum," Zhang Daogen, president of Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, said during the keynote speech.In the financial and economic arenas, Zhang said, the initiative pushes forward international rules and accelerates global dialogues."It also facilitates interconnectivity and interdependence among the Belt and Road Initiative countries. We also believe BRI is based on economic cooperation and development, both in China and internationally," he added.In terms of culture, Wang Zhan, president of the Shanghai Federation of Social Science Associations, stressed that China and the BRI countries have benefited from each other."People learn from each other through cultural exchanges and the initiative boosts this communication between China and the rest of the world, advancing mutual civilization covering food, dance and music," he added.Lee Sze Wei, president of Tunku Abdul Rahman University College in Malaysia, highlighted the significance of talent cultivation during the implementation of the BRI.Lee has conducted an initial investigation on the topic. The investigation has found that about 15,000 colleges and universities are in the BRI regions with diverse education resources regarding academic standards and technology."More multilateral and multilingual cooperation and exchanges in higher education can be achieved in the future," he said. "Modes of collaboration are limitless, such as study tours, joint-ventures and research and development cooperation."The forum also included several panels focused on the BRI.Experts put forward building an open, inclusive, pragmatic and effective model of international cooperation and promoting third-party market cooperation, such as connections between China and Japan or South Korea. They said they believe that it will help enterprises inject new power into the economic development of all countries.Participants emphasized sustainable development during implementation of the BRI, which will create a brighter future for the whole world.Experts also reached a consensus to create a fair, convenient business environment, which is the basic element for economic growth, to attract foreign investment.They pointed out that a healthy business environment will reduce the transaction costs of trade and strengthen the high-quality development for win-win results and common prosperity.Huang Kunming, head of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said the past six years have seen the initiative evolve to become the largest platform for international cooperation."The BRI has fueled economic development in participating countries and promoted global growth. More than 160 countries and international organizations are involved, making it a truly global consensus," Huang said at the opening ceremony of the world forum on Tuesday. "The initiative is now reaching an early harvest and has a promising future of great expectations."The world forum concluded on Wednesday.

                Beijing lauds Solomon Islands' move to break ties with Taiwan authorities
            </a>
            <p>
                China highly commends the decision of the Solomon Islands' government to recognize the one-China principle and sever the so-called "diplomatic ties" with the Taiwan authorities, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said late on Monday.Hua's comment came as the Pacific island nation decided earlier on Monday at a cabinet meeting that it would break the so-called "diplomatic ties" with the Taiwan authorities and establish diplomatic relationship with Beijing.Hua said in an online statement that Beijing supports the Solomon Islands' government in "making such an important decision as a sovereign and independent country".Beijing has made it clear that there is but one China in the world, that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government that represents the whole of China, and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. On the basis of the one-China principle, China has established official diplomatic relationships with 178 countries.The decision of the Solomon Islands' government once again "fully testifies to the fact that the one-China principle meets the shared aspiration of the people and constitutes an irresistible trend of the times," Hua said.She added that the people of China and the Solomon Islands enjoy friendly exchanges and sentiments toward each other.Saying the relations between China and the Pacific island countries maintain a momentum for rapid development, Hua mentioned President Xi Jinping's meeting with leaders of the Pacific island countries having diplomatic ties with China in November 2018 when he visited Papua New Guinea.She said the meeting opened up a new chapter in the relationship between China and the Pacific island countries."We welcome the Solomon Islands' integration into the big family of China-Pacific islands cooperation on the basis of the one-China principle at an early date by seizing the historical opportunity," Hua said. "We stand ready to work with the Solomon Islands to open new broad prospects for our bilateral relations."Earlier on Monday, Taiwan announced the termination of its ties with the Solomon Islands after learning the Cabinet of Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare had approved a decision to establish diplomatic ties with Beijing.Taiwan authorities now has formal relations with only 16 countries. Before the split with Solomon Islands, El Salvador became in August 2018 the last country to sever official ties with Taiwan authorities and established diplomatic relations with Beijing.
