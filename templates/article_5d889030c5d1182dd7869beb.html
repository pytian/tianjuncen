                Xi Zhiyong said on Friday he believes his research results will be fruitful, play a major role in pest control and prevent or reduce the spread of diseases in the future.Xi and his team managed to completely eradicate a population of a mosquito species in Guangdong province in two years by releasing millions of insects specially bred to be infertile."Using mosquitoes to eliminate mosquitoes is an efficient and environmentally friendly way to eliminate insects that might spread dengue fever, the Zika virus and other tropical diseases," said the microbiology professor from Guangzhou's Sun Yat-sen University after his thesis, Incompatible and Sterile Insect Techniques Combined Eliminate Mosquitoes, was published.The article appeared in the academic journal Nature on Thursday and led to widespread discussion within academic circles and in the industry, according to a statement from the university on Friday.Xi, director of the university's Laboratory of Tropical Disease Control and Prevention, a key lab under the Ministry of Education, said his team has begun to apply the research results to be used in other areas, such as agricultural pest prevention and control, with the aim of gradually reducing the use of chemical pesticides that may damage the environment."The article has provided a complete story on how mosquitoes eliminate mosquitoes, including from lab to field, industrial production, cost accounting, community education and other aspects, and that the technology will help bring great changes in the industry in the future," Xi told China Daily."We are not producing or selling only the (specially bred) mosquitoes, but in fact, they are also microbial pesticides that will become a real industry in the coming years," he said.Lin Lifeng, deputy director of Guangdong Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said Xi's research results have great significance."It will help prevent and reduce the spread of dengue fever and other epidemics that are passed to people by mosquitoes in Guangdong province－a province with a population of more than 100 million," he said.The center said hundreds of dengue fever cases are confirmed each year in the country's most populous province, known as the window of China's reform and opening-up and the southern gateway of the country.Xi and his team, including experts from China and the United States, have started to pilot the study in which mosquitoes are used to help eradicate other mosquitoes after a special "mosquito factory" was built in a suburb of Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, several years ago.Last year, Xi's team, in collaboration with local disease control and prevention centers, extended the release of male mosquitoes from suburban areas to the old city centers where dengue fever outbreaks have been reported to help combat the disease. More than 1 million male mosquitoes could be released in 22 hectares in the populous old city centers in just four minutes through drones.The mosquito factory in Guangzhou, the largest of its kind in the world, can produce more than 10 million male mosquitoes a week.And the male mosquitoes that have been infected with Wolbachia, a bacteria that exists widely in many insects, including mosquitoes, do not bite humans.Research findings have shown that the eggs produced by female mosquitoes that mate with Wolbachia-infected male counterparts are infertile and that helps lead to reduced mosquito populations in the area.More than 200 million such male mosquitoes produced in the mosquito factory have been released since 2016.

                    Dengue cases in Philippines surge to nearly 116,000 with 491 deaths
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                MANILA -- Dengue cases in the Philippines are continuing to surge and have reached 115,986 nationwide, with 491 deaths from January 1 to July 6, the Department of Health of the Philippines said on Saturday.From June 30 to July 6 alone, the health department said 5,744 more dengue cases were recorded, or a 22 percent spike from last year's 4,703 cases.The most affected area is Western Visayas region, which has the greatest number of reported dengue cases so far this year with 15,826, followed by Calabarzon with 12,780 cases, Soccsksargen with 9,572 cases, Northern Mindanao with 9,354 cases, and Central Visayas with 9,259 cases.On Monday, the government declared a national dengue alert amid the surge in reported cases of the mosquito-borne viral illness.The national dengue alert was issued to urge regional health offices to step up dengue surveillance, case management and outbreak response in primary health facilities and hospitals, as well as through community and school-based health education campaigns, clean-up drives, surveillance activities, case investigations, vector control, and logistics support for dengue control like insecticides, rapid diagnostics tests, and medicine.The government is undertaking a nationwide public information campaign to follow what it calls as the "4-S method" which stands for "search and destroy" mosquito-breeding sites, employ "self-protection measures" such as wearing pants and long-sleeved shirts, and daily use of mosquito repellent, "seek early consultation," and "support fogging or spraying" in areas where an increase in cases is registered for two consecutive weeks to prevent an impending outbreak.Dengue cases in the Philippines have been observed to peak every three to four years. The last peak occurred in 2016.Given the pattern, the health department expects an increase in cases this year.Dengue is a viral disease with no known vaccine or specific antibiotics. Effective surveillance helps in reducing cases and deaths if areas with clustering of cases are identified early.Signs and symptoms of the disease are severe headache, pain behind the eyes, severe joint and muscle pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and skin rashes.

                    Scientists develop new method to control mosquitoes
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                BEIJING -- Chinese scientists have developed a new method to control the population of mosquitoes, the Science and Technology Daily reported Monday.Scientists from the Sun Yat-Sen University have conducted a four-year field test in controlling the population of the Asian tiger mosquito, one of the world's most invasive mosquito species that carries dengue, the Zika virus and many other devastating diseases.Through microinjection and radiation, scientists sterilized male mosquitoes and released them into the environment to mate with wild female mosquitoes, resulting in no offspring and a declining population over time. They also exposed male mosquitoes to a strain of Wolbachia bacteria, which rendered the females sterile.With this method, the mosquito population has been almost eliminated in the field test, with the annual number of wild mosquito species decreasing by about 83 to 94 percent. No mosquitoes were detected for up to six weeks.The research was published in the journal Nature.This successful field trial demonstrated that the technique could be used to establish a protected area free of mosquito-borne disease and mosquito harassment, the report cited Xi Zhiyong, the leading researcher as saying.

                    Dengue fever infections surge in Vietnam in 7 months

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                HANOI -- Between Jan 1 and July 29, Vietnam spotted over 105,000 dengue fever patients, more than trebling the cases in the same period last year, Vietnam News Agency reported on Tuesday.Of the over 105,000 dengue fever patients, 10 have died, the agency quoted the country's Health Ministry as saying.On Monday, health minister instructed health departments of cities and provinces nationwide to intensify early detection and rapid containment of dengue fever outbreaks. The localities were asked to launch big campaigns on killing mosquito larvae, and to well treat dengue fever patients.The ministry will send dengue-related inspection delegations in August to 18 central and southern localities, including Ho Chi Minh City, Binh Duong, Dong Nai and Da Nang.Most of Vietnamese dengue fever patients live in the country's southern region whose weather conditions and local people's habit of storing rainwater in containers for domestic use create favorable conditions for the development of mosquitoes, the disease's transmitter, local epidemiologists said.In March, Vietnam established a satellite-based dengue forecasting system which uses a combination of satellite information, weather forecasting and historical data on previous outbreaks to create an early warning system, up to eight months in advance, for potential epidemics.Through the system, local communities receive direction on where to focus their efforts to reduce mosquito-breeding sites to prevent outbreaks of dengue.

                DHAKA - The situation of dengue has deteriorated in Bangladesh as the mosquito-borne viral disease spread out in most parts of the country in less than a month.A total of 1,096 fresh cases of dengue were reported from the capital Dhaka and elsewhere in the country in the last 24 hours as of 8:00 am local time Monday, Abdur Rahim, a Health Ministry control room official told Xinhua on Tuesday.He said the total number of confirmed cases as of Monday in the country since Jan 1 rose to 13,637, registering a record high.The data reported by the Bangladeshi Ministry of Health gave an alert as Dhaka has seen a rapid surge of the disease.The number of dengue patients in the first 29 days of July rose to 11,450, which reportedly had surpassed the total number of patients in any past year.Ayesha Akhter, assistant director at the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), told Xinhua the number of dengue patients was 946 in July last year, saying some 10,148 people were infected with dengue fever in 2018 and 26 of them died.Officials said Dhaka and its neighboring districts are more vulnerable to the risk of mosquito-borne diseases and most hospitals in Dhaka and clinics are now crammed with hundreds of new dengue patients every day.Eight people have died of dengue so far this year, the Health Ministry official records showed.However, local media Prothom Alo reported on Tuesday that the death toll was registered at 47, saying the disease has spread to 59 out of 64 districts.Another local media Somoy TV reported on Tuesday that four people who had been diagnosed with dengue fever, died in hospitals in Dhaka and southern Barisal town, some 180 km south of Dhaka, in the early hours of Tuesday.Health and Family Welfare Minister Zahid Malik earlier said in a press conference that the government has taken actions.The minister asked all city corporations and municipalities to take necessary steps to destroy the breeding grounds of the Aedes mosquitoes.Dengue is transmitted by several species of mosquito within the genus Aedes. The first case of mosquito-borne viral infection was reported in Bangladesh in 2000, and some 100 people died from the disease from 2000 to 2003.Impoverished states are especially vulnerable to viruses because of insufficient biosecurity, deficient disease surveillance and protection measures.The monsoon period from June to September is usually the peak season of dengue fever in Bangladesh and transmission becomes rampant in the country.

                MANILA - Dengue cases and deaths continue to surge in the Philippines, prompting the Department of Health to declare on Tuesday the country's dengue outbreak a national epidemic.Philippine Health Secretary Francisco Duque said the move is to allow local governments to draw on a special quick response fund needed in the fight against the mosquito-borne viral disease.From January to July 20 this year, Duque said the health department had recorded some 146,000 dengue cases across the country, or 98 percent more than the same period in 2018. The outbreak has caused 622 deaths, he added.Duque said it is important to declare a national epidemic to identify where the localized response is needed and enable local government units to use their quick response to address the situation.From July 14-20 alone, Duque said the Department of Health had recorded 10,502 dengue cases in 14 regions nationwide. This was 71 percent higher than the figures gathered in the same period in 2018, he added.Last month, the government declared a national dengue alert and urged regional health offices to step up dengue surveillance, case management and outbreak response in primary health facilities and hospitals, as well as through community and school-based health education campaigns, clean-up drives, surveillance activities, case investigations, vector control, and logistics support for dengue control like insecticides, rapid diagnostics tests, and medicine.The government is undertaking a nationwide public information campaign to follow what it calls as the "4S method" which stands for "search and destroy" mosquito-breeding sites, employ "self-protection measures" such as wearing pants and long-sleeved shirts, and daily use of mosquito repellent, "seek early consultation," and "support fogging or spraying" in areas where an increase in cases is registered for two consecutive weeks to prevent an impending outbreak.Dengue cases in the Philippines have been observed to peak every three to four years. The last peak occurred in 2016. Given the pattern, the health department expects an increase in cases this year.Dengue is a viral disease with no known vaccine or specific antibiotics. Effective surveillance helps in reducing cases and deaths if areas with clustering of cases are identified early.Signs and symptoms of the disease are severe headache, pain behind the eyes, severe joint and muscle pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and skin rashes.

                SUVA - Fiji has recorded 1,894 dengue cases in the first four months this year, which is predicted to go down as the dengue-preventing program goes forward, according to the Ministry of Health on Tuesday.Last year, the island nation reported nine deaths and 4,000 cases of dengue fever.Dip Chand, chief health inspector of the ministry, said on Tuesday that it is encouraging to see the increasing levels of mosquitoes carrying dengue-preventing Wolbachia bacteria.The World Mosquito Program has stopped releasing Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes as the population of mosquitoes can now be sustained.Project coordinator Aminiasi Tavui said it will take time for Wolbachia to fully establish in the local mosquito population but they are confident in seeing a long-term reduction in dengue fever cases.He added the organisation is now releasing mosquitoes in Nadi, Lautoka and Nausori.Wolbachia is a naturally occurring bacteria in 60 percent of insect species such as butterflies and moths, which blocks the transmission of the dengue virus.Meanwhile, the ministry said in a separated statement that four adults and two children in Fiji have died from meningococcal disease with another 10 infected with the bacterial infection this year.

                Residential area in Qingyuan achieves 80% success in overcoming menaceWhen the residents of a high-end residential community in Qingyuan, northern Guangdong province, complained about mosquito menace and rashes because of mosquito bites, the company managing the property got into action immediately. It tried every means possible, including installing mosquito killer lamps and spraying pesticides, but with little success.Finally, an army of male mosquitoes - one million of them three times a week - were released in the 40-hectare Meilin Lake community and surrounding areas to take on the female mosquitoes head-on. The results were phenomenal."Since the project started in May, about 80 percent of female mosquitoes in the (experimental) area have been eliminated," said Qian Wei, deputy general manager of Guangzhou Wolbaki Biotech Co, the company that helped the community to successfully combat the menace."Our goal is 90 percent, which is to be achieved probably by October," said Qian.Yao Hanfen, a manager of the company that manages the property, said she was relieved the situation in the community has greatly improved because of the mosquito army."This community has large green areas. Last year, you could just not stand here. You would get bites all over even in daylight," said Yao."I hope they can continue (the project)," said Yan Yunying, who lives in the community, while acknowledging its success.The technology used by Guangzhou Wolbaki is based on a research led by Xi Zhiyong, the chairman of the company and director of the Laboratory of Tropical Disease Control and Prevention in Guangzhou-based Sun Yat-sen University.The research involved infecting male mosquitoes with Wolbachia, a bacteria that exists in many insects, including mosquitoes, but does not infect mammals.Eggs produced by female mosquitoes that mate with Wolbachia-infected male counterparts are infertile, which leads to reduced mosquito population. And only female mosquitoes bite humans.In Xi's mosquito factory, male mosquitoes are separated from the female ones and low radiation is used to render the few female mosquitoes remaining in the male throng infertile.The male mosquitoes die within 7 to 10 days of their release, and the Wolbachia bacteria they carry also die with them, said Xi.An article on the study, titled Incompatible and Sterile Insect Techniques Combined Eliminate Mosquitoes, appeared in the academic journal Nature in July.Xi's team started trials in the islands of Shazai and Dadaosha, south of Guangzhou city, in 2015.The technology "nearly eliminated two field populations of A. albopictus over a two-year period. The few mosquitoes remaining were probably migrants from outside the study area, as indicated by population genetic analyses and their presence in areas with good transport links, whereas isolated areas were mosquito-free," reads the article in Nature.Aedes albopictus is a mosquito native to the tropical and subtropical areas of Southeast Asia. However, in the past few decades, this species has spread to many countries.The release of male mosquitoes has stopped on the island of Dadaosha to study the time needed for the local mosquito population to recover.Sterile insect technology using radiation has been used worldwide to control species, including the New World screwworm, Mediterranean fruit fly and melon fly from Japan's Okinawa islands in the past few decades, Xi said. "Such technology has failed in controlling pathogen-transmitting mosquitoes."The existing efforts fall short of being effective in disease prevention in places with repeated dengue fever cases in Guangzhou, said Zhang Zhoubin, the deputy director of Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention.According to Zhang, a combination of the old and new technologies is desired. His center is working with Xi's team to conduct trials in some places in Guangzhou city.The traditional method of using pesticides to kill mosquitoes leads to drug resistance in the species, said Xi, who is also a professor of the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics of Michigan State University. He said there was no foreseeable threat from the new technology.Mosquitoes pose grave threat to humans by transmitting pathogens, especially those causing dengue fever, yellow fever, malaria and Zika in some countries and regions, said Yang Dazhu, deputy director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, at a conference on the technology developed by Xi's team in Guangzhou this month.Mosquito-transmitted malaria virus infected 200 million people and killed more than 400,000 in 2017, he said, citing the World Health Organization. About two-fifths of the world's population faces threat of dengue fever.Yang said the IAEA provides technological support in the research. It has also made efforts in the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy, especially in preventing, controlling and diagnosing diseases in developing countries in the past six decades.A few months ago, Sun Yat-sen University provided training to some Asian developing countries on mosquito control technology, and the training will be extended to some Latin American countries later this year, he said.The research should identify possible problems in the large-scale application of the technology and the ways to solve them, Yang said.Guangzhou Wolbaki has helped establish a mosquito factory in Mexico, which is capable of breeding 250,000 mosquitoes a week. Its capacity will be expanded four times.Smaller mosquito factories are being established in countries like Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia. An international pharmaceutical company is holding talks with Guangzhou Wolbaki in this regard.Li Xiangmiao contributed to this story.

                    Chinese scientists suggest new control method for dengue virus

                BEIJING -- Having an iron-rich diet may be an effective way to control dengue virus as mosquitoes are more likely to acquire the virus when they feed on iron-deficient blood, according to recent Chinese research.Dengue virus is a mosquito-borne arbovirus, and blood is the primary route through which mosquitoes acquire dengue virus infections. Blood components or their metabolites may influence the spread of dengue virus.Researchers from Tsinghua University, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the University of Connecticut have conducted a series of screenings on blood components and found that serum iron in human blood modulates dengue virus acquisition by mosquitoes. Dengue virus acquisition by mosquitoes was inversely correlated with the iron concentration in serum from human donors.This study showed that mosquitoes are less likely to acquire dengue virus when they feed on blood with high levels of iron. When the iron in the serum is acquired into the mosquito gut, it will help produce more reactive oxygen species, which controls the spread of the virus in mosquitoes.This study indicates that iron supplementation reduces dengue transmission by mosquitoes, providing a new perspective for controlling the disease.The results were published in the journal Nature Microbiology.
