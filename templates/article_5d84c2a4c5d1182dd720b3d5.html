                NEW YORK - Shanghai-based Orient International (Holding) aims to connect the cultures of China's 56 ethnic groups with the world's leading fashion designers through an initiative to aid the development of China's fashion industry and cultural heritage, said a senior company executive. The initiative, known as Top 100 Global Designers Alliance, aims to inspire the world's leading fashion designers with China's traditional culture from 56 ethnic groups, Tong Jisheng, chairman of the company, said in an interview with Xinhua on the sidelines of the New York Fashion Week earlier this month. "The alliance will work as a platform for international designers who have excellent design skills but limited commercial access to the Chinese market," Tong said. As a trial, the alliance cooperated with Wang Tao, a noted Chinese designer as well as a regular at the NYFW, to transform China's intangible cultural heritage Yi embroidery into urban fashion for the catwalk. In the spring/summer 2020 collection of Taoray Taoray, the youth line of designer Taoray Wang, Yi embroidery and bright colors were incorporated in daily wear such as camisoles, T-shirts, hoodies and denim jackets. "Most of the people buy Yi embroidery as souvenirs. We want to break the stereotype that traditional embroidery cannot be fashionable," said Wang on the sidelines of her runway show. "I think fashion is the best way to introduce culture." Tong said he believes that a combination of ethnic heritage and fashion design would have huge market potential. "The trends of fashion will have to integrate the East and the West and be extracted from the culture. These are the pursuit of modern consumers," he said. The cooperation was also part of the efforts to improve life standards of residents in the Chuxiong Yi autonomous prefecture in Southwest China's Yunnan province. In Chuxiong, more than 70,000 women are involved in embroidery. The industry is worth more than 100 million yuan ($14.11 million), according to Xu Xiaomei, head of the prefecture's publicity department. Xu said Yi embroidery's appearance at the NYFW successfully promoted intangible cultural heritage on the world stage. As more people learn to appreciate the aesthetic of the technique, the industry will grow at a faster pace and Chuxiong's female embroiders can live a more decent life, she said. "How do we help the female embroiders in Chuxiong to live a more decent life? We should transform their embroidery works into merchandise and put them on the market," Tong said.

                Legendary performer Yanni to play at Beijing Pop Festival
            </a>
            <p>
                In 1997, Greek composer and performer, Yanni, was the first Western artist to perform at the historic Forbidden City in Beijing, which made him one of the most popular Western musicians among Chinese fans. Between 1997 and 2015, the Grammy-nominated musician launched five tours to China that have included visits to more cities, including Shanghai, Chengdu in Sichuan province and Guangzhou in Guangdong province. On Nov 9 and 10, Yanni will return to China with two performances at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing that will feature one of his most famous songs, Nightingale, which he wrote for China after that first concert in 1997.Yanni's performances will be part of the upcoming annual Beijing International Pop Music Festival, which will be held in the capital from October to November.Featuring live concerts, master classes and forums, the festival will gather together international acts including German piano duo Olha Chipak and Oleksiy Kushnir, Inner Mongolian rock band Hanggai, and Beijing-based folk band Xiaojuan and Residents From the Valley.Jiang Tao, general manager of Chia Tai Music Group, the organizer of the festival, notes that the event was first launched in 2015 with six indoor concerts held in the capital.From 2015 to 2018, the festival has hosted 35 groups from across the globe and has, so far, attracted a total audience of over 8 million both on the internet and at the festival's live venues."This year, we present the festival with the theme 'crossover'. We've confirmed four acts so far, but more will follow and will cover a diverse range of music genres," Jiang says in Beijing.The eponymous lead vocalist of the band Xiaojuan and Residents From the Valley, is known for her soothing voice and original folk sounds. Founded 10 years ago by Xiaojuan and her husband, guitarist Li Qiang, the band performs in Beijing every spring on the day of Guyu, which literally translates as "grain rain", one of the 24 traditional Chinese solar terms."This year, we perform during autumn and the theme of our show will be to use music to portray a man's entire life, from his childhood to his twilight years," says Xiaojuan, adding that, as well as the four members of the band, a contemporary dancer and an electronic musician will join the group for the performance.In 2018, about 24,000 indoor concerts were held around the country, an increase of more than 8.5 percent compared to the previous year, showcasing the booming market for live music performances, says Song Guanlin, deputy director of the China Association of Performing Arts.Song adds that Chinese audiences have embraced a variety of music styles ever since the country started to produce its own original pop material during the early 1980s."We will also bring international musicians to campuses to host master classes and forums, providing the next generation with the latest information about, and developments in, the world of pop music," Song says.

                Australia's fire season gets severe
            </a>
            <p>
                Extraordinary drought on eastern seaboard and role of climate change fuel grim outlook Spring has only just begun and bushfires have already ravaged thousands of hectares along Australia's eastern seaboard in a prelude to what could be one of the worst fire seasons on record.It is the first time Australia has seen such intense fires so early in the bushfire season, and scientists are saying they will only get worse as the world's temperatures continue to rise.What has exacerbated the fires now burning across vast swaths of bush and farmland in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland is that many areas are experiencing their worst drought on record.Scientists say the drought, combined with an abnormally warm winter in Australia, has helped fuel this year's grim fire outlook.The bushfire season has started earlier than it used to, said Dale Dominey-Howes, professor of hazard and disaster risk sciences at The University of Sydney."But it is important to understand that fires can start at any time of the year if the circumstances are right," he said.He said the climatic conditions - average temperature, average rainfall, wind speed and humidity - vary from location to location."We can't generalize for the whole continent, and that is why climate scientists say it is complicated when looking at climate change and its impact."Already (Australia) has experienced its driest, warmest winter on record and the eastern seaboard is in the midst of an extraordinary drought."It goes without saying that drought is a feature of the Australian landscape. When it comes to the role climate change plays in bushfires, it's a roll of the dice."The extreme weather and the changing climate will mean this fire season is more severe, Dominey-Howes said. He also made the point that there are now more Australians living in bush land where fires naturally start."Heat, drought, flood and fire are not new phenomena for Australia," said Richard Thornton, CEO of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre."We have seen this before and we will see it again," he said."What is different now is that there is an underlying one degree Celsius (increase) in average temperatures, which means that the variability of 'normal' events sits on top of that."Our extreme weather will be more extreme - hotter and windier - and when we do see rain it will be more severe."We are seeing weather records routinely being broken, and all indications are that we are on a trajectory that will see temperatures continue to increase," Thornton said."Yes, climate change is causing more severe weather, but demographic changes are having an equal impact and deserve just as much of our attention."These challenges are complex and we should be wary of quick fix solutions."He said the bushfires in Queensland and New South Wales states show just how dry it is now."Our Australian Seasonal Bushfire Outlook 2019, released on Aug 28, illustrates this."Northern New South Wales into southeastern Queensland are into their third year of dry conditions. Once a bushfire starts in those conditions, they can be hard to stop, even in areas that do not regularly see these types of severe bushfires."Andrew Watkins, senior climatologist at Australia's Bureau of Meteorology, said the southern half of Australia has experienced the driest January to August on record."When we take into account temperatures as well, which have been highest on record for winter in some of those bushfire areas, we've had high evaporation," he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation recently.The warm, dry conditions that have led to the early fires are predicted to continue for the rest of the year, he added.Climate change expert Andrew King, at Melbourne University, said "we can expect to see more intense fires" in the coming years."It's quite clear that the type of hot weather associated with bushfires is becoming more frequent and more intense," he said."And it is more likely to occur earlier on in the warm season," he said.He said attributing climate change to bushfires is complicated."Bushfire weather is a combination of a number of factors such as high temperatures, low rainfall, strong winds and low humidity."What we are seeing now is (that) the high temperature component associated with bushfires is now becoming more frequent and arriving earlier in the bushfire season."King said drawing a direct link between climate change and increased bushfire activity is difficult "because there are many complex factors"."But there is no disputing the link between climate change and weather."Former Fire and Rescue NSW commissioner Greg Mullins, who now sits on the Climate Council, a national climate change communications body, said bushfire conditions in Australia are becoming more extreme and unpredictable as a result of climate change.The fire seasons are becoming longer and more severe, Mullins said. October used to be recognized as the start of the NSW fire season, but with the season starting in August "we are now facing a new reality".karlwilson@chinadailyapac.com

                Decades of growth spur rise in overseas travel
            </a>
            <p>
                In the past 20-plus years, China has become the world's leading source of international tourists. Cheng Si reports.Editor's note: To celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we are publishing a series of stories reflecting changes and developments in fields such as law, education, transportation and the environment. This is the fourth in the series.Outbound tourism is no longer a privilege enjoyed only by people on business trips or political visits.Now, it is a commonplace activity for most Chinese, as a result of the nation's economic growth, the relaxation of visa policies and people's growing desire to travel.In 2017, Chinese nationals made 143 million outbound trips, while in 1995 the figure was 5 million, and the average annual rise over the period was 17 percent, according to a report published by the National Bureau of Statistics last month.It said that in 2013, the number of outbound Chinese travelers hit the top spot globally for the first time, and has stayed there ever since.Moreover, the amount spent by Chinese travelers at overseas destinations has soared in the past two decades.

                From economic researcher to globe-trotting guru
            </a>
            <p>
                "The first time I traveled abroad was on a business trip to Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand when I worked for Beijing International Studies University in 2001," said Dai Bin, president of the China Tourism Academy.Recalling the trip, Dai gave a shy smile. "Everything I looked at then was novel to me. Outbound tourism was not a popular activity for most Chinese at the time. For me, it was an eye-opening trip," he said.Having graduated from Anhui University of Finance and Economics with a master's in economics in 1995, Dai was once an economic researcher, rather than a tourism guru."When I sought advice from my mentor for future research, I was told that tourism was a new area in which academic research had yet to be fully developed," he recalled.During almost 20 years immersed in tourism, Dai has witnessed dramatic changes in the industry, especially the ever-booming outbound sector.He said that years ago Chinese people were not interested in tourism overseas because they lacked both the money and the time to take vacations and travel."The old Chinese saying goes, 'It's better to travel 10,000 miles than read 10,000 books', but in the 1980s and even'90s, most Chinese had difficulty gaining access to travel," he said."We used to provide travel services for foreign guests rather than enjoying the services ourselves."According to Dai, the situation changed in 1999 with the introduction of the "Golden Week" policy, when longer breaks were instituted during Spring Festival, National Day and Labor Day."Golden Week provided the basic element for the development of tourism－enough time for leisure－and then the economy, which was thriving in the wake of reform and opening-up, implemented in 1978, helped raise incomes. The government also called on the public to travel more," he said, with reference to official attempts to boost the economy via greater consumption.The year that marked a turning point for tourism, both domestic and outbound, was 1999, he said."One of my friends went on a trip to Paris, but he wasn't aware of the time difference between China and France, so he made a phone call at midnight to show off that he was in traveling in Paris," he said.In the past 20 years, outbound tourism has evolved, and is no longer an exclusive privilege for a small group, but a regular activity for people, he said."Perceptions of outbound tourism and people's behavior when visiting overseas destinations have undergone great changes," he said.Dai recalled that when he led a business group to Frankfurt, Germany, in 2004, the team members－many of them 20-somethings－rushed to luxury stores during what was intended to be a rest period."Now, travelers prefer to slow their schedule so they can experience life at their destination overseas rather than sightseeing in a rush－their shopping behavior is more rational," he said.

                Archaeologists determine age of North China prehistoric settlement
            </a>
            <p>
                HOHHOT -- A recent analysis has validated the exact age of a prehistoric settlement in northern China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region, local experts said Friday.The carbon-14 test conducted by a US laboratory showed the Simagou ruins in Huade county could date back to 9,000 years ago in the Neolithic period, according to the regional institute of cultural relics and archaeology.Bao Qingchuan, a researcher with the institute, said the ruins were believed to be the earliest site of the Neolithic period ever found in vast steppes of northern China, and the discovery is of great significance to Chinese archaeology.From 2017 to 2019, archaeologists discovered 19 houses and 19 outdoor cooking ranges covering an area of over 2,200 square meters on the Simagou site. The houses are of different shapes, including circle and rectangle.So far, over 4,000 items such as stone tools, bone artifacts and pottery shards have been unearthed from the Simagou ruins.Archaeologists said the ruins might be related to the Yumin ruins, another prehistoric settlement found in the same county. They are likely to have belonged to the same clan, which migrated to the Simagou settlement in spring and summer and moved to the Yumin ruins when temperatures dropped."The discovery can provide clues for archaeologists to probe into the origin of the culture of the Neolithic age and the advent of primitive agriculture and animal husbandry in northern China," Bao said.
