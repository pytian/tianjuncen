                Greek govt vows to improve refugee situation on island after fire
            </p>
            <p>
                A migrant stands among the remains of a burned tent at the Moria migrant camp, after a fire that ripped through tents and destroyed containers during violence among residents, on the Lesvos island, Greece, Sept 20, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]A ship is to be leased to operate as a floating hot spot at the port of Mytilene until the Moria accommodation center is fully functional again, the Ministry of Citizen Protection and the General Secretary of the Aegean and Island Policy announced on Tuesday.Refugee and migrant families are the priority, the General Secretary of the Aegean and Island Policy Giannis Giannelis told Xinhua."The ship will have a capacity of over 1,000 people and will be used as a hostel in order for the situation to be eased, after yesterday's incidents," Giannelis said.In addition, extra police forces will be sent to Lesvos, he said.People were forced to flee Moria and many spent the night in the streets without shelter or food, when a fire broke out during clashes among refugees of different nationalities in the hot spot on Lesvos island.The fire spread through the camp and destroyed 50 tents and three containers, including personal belongings. Nobody was hurt by the fire.Dozens of people escaped through small openings in the fence.Most of them left all their personal belongings behind and some even walked to reach the city of Mytilene.The Greek government is seeking ways to decongest all the eastern Aegean islands which continue to receive immigrants and refugees, Giannelis added.More than 10,000 people out of the 60,000 currently stranded in Greece, according to data released on Tuesday from the North Aegean Regional Police Department, have remained trapped on Lesvos, Chios, and Samos since March, when the EU-Turkey agreement to stem the influx was implemented.During the last 24 hours, 65 immigrants and refugees have arrived on the northern Aegean islands.Boats keep coming as tensions on the islands, in particular Lesvos, have dramatically risen lately.

                Single market to boost African-made brands
            </a>
            <p>
                Chinese garment firm in Rwanda backs AU passport, negations on continental free trade zoneA Chinese garment manufacturer with factories in Rwanda, Kenya and Ethiopia has welcomed talk of an African single market, saying it will unlock the continent's vast growth potential.The African Union launched a passport last month that allows citizens visa-free movement between member states.Saidi Hitimana, assistant general manager of C&H Garments Ltd, says Africa is a Chinese major investment destination. Lucie Morangi / China DailyThe announcement came during a summit in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, where also on the agenda was the Continental Free Trade Zone, which will create a single market for goods and services. Although still in negotiation, talk of the zone has buoyed the expectations of businesses, especially those looking to expand in Africa.C&H Garments Ltd is one such example. The Chinese company has a factory just 15 minutes from the Kigali Convention Center, which hosted the AU summit.The plant, opened in March last year, recently recruited 400 workers, taking its total up to 500, to handle an increase in orders from Europe and North America, according to its assistant general manager, Saidi Hitimana."We expect to have a workforce of 1,500 by the end of the year," he says, adding that the number could even be higher if the garment factory gains free access to the continental market. Currently, 80 percent of its products are shipped outside Africa due to low consumption in Rwanda.Rwanda has about 12 million people. Official data show 57 percent live below the poverty line, with 37 percent living in "extreme poverty".The landlocked nation is a member of the East Africa Community, along with Burundi, Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. Together, they have a population of over 140 million.However, Hitimana says C&H still has to contend with tariffs and nontariff barriers as well as high transportation costs and regular delays.Shipping costs in Africa are among the highest in the world, 50 percent more on average than in European Union countries and the United States, according to Trademark East Africa, a nonprofit group. In eastern areas, these costs can be as much as 75 percent of exports' value.Plus, there are 36 roadblocks on the route from Mombasa in Kenya to Kigali, and 30 between Rusumo in eastern Rwanda and Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania."This doesn't only erode our margins, but also caps what we can produce in Rwanda," Hitimana says, explaining that his factory mainly produces uniforms because purchasers of such items allow extended delivery times. "Other garments have shorter timelines of less than three months, and we're unable to meet this because time is eaten up on the road."Imported Chinese textiles arriving at Mombasa Port take two months to arrive in Kigali. Production takes two months, and then shipping for export takes two more.Hitimana says the company has explored the option of buying textiles from Kenya, but the costs are relatively high. "One kilogram from Kenya costs $6.50, while we can buy the same fabric for $3.20 from China. The price difference hits our bottom line," he says, although the plant occasionally does pay the extra to meet orders from South Africa.He adds that C&H believes bringing down the borders would solve such challenges as underdeveloped infrastructure, a lack of local suppliers and high energy costs.According to the United Nations Conference on Trade And Development, full liberalization would have raised the share of intra-African trade as part of the continent's total trade from 10.2 percent to 15.5 percent between 2010 and 2020.The East African region last year imported $151 million worth of secondhand clothing from Europe and North America, which poses a major challenge for Africa-made brands. Heads of the East Africa Community in February agreed to ban such imports, effective in three years, to breathe life into local manufacturing.In addition to its base in Rwanda, C&H also has a factory on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, with 200 workers, and 5,000 workers in Kenya under the company name Future Garments. Hitimana says the AU passport, which allows people free movement to explore job opportunities in other countries, will rapidly shore up the skill shortage.C&H employs 20 technicians from Kenya. Not only have they trained 40 Rwandans, who are now ready to take over, but they have also helped the plant to meet the quality standards set by international customers, the senior manager says.Three months after opening last year, the Rwandan factory received an initial order worth $1 million to make reflective jackets for a customer in the United Kingdom. The company also received orders from the US in January and is now in discussions with French agents.China's rising salaries and aging population, and increasing interest among Chinese investors in support Africa's industrialization, means the future looks bright for the continent, Hitimana says. He disputes claims that the wages paid by Chinese factories are unsustainably low, saying incentives such as bonuses bump up basic wages."We encourage productivity, and Rwandans are known to be more hardworking than their neighbors," he says, adding that if government support continues, C&H hopes to move to a factory that can house up to 5,000 workers.Last year, Kigali introduced a preferential corporate income tax of 15 percent, down from 30 percent, for investors in priority sectors such as transport, energy, financial services, affordable housing and logistics. Those who put in more than $50 million in strategic areas such as energy, tourism, manufacturing, information technology or healthcare can also enjoy a tax holiday of up to seven years.Rwanda has received more than $170 million in Chinese investment in the past five years, according to official data.lucymorangi@chinadaily.com.cn( China Daily Africa Weekly 08/05/2016 page27)

                China's funding of giant projects helps goal of integration
            </a>
            <p>
                China's affinity for funding mega infrastructure projects has buoyed the number of cross-border initiatives brought into the market, says a transportation expert. Amos Phiri, who heads the coordination team at the New Partnership for Africa's Development, an African Union agency, is currently marketing 12 projects that require about $13 billion investment in nine countries across the continent. This is in addition to 30 investment ready projects developed by foreign private investors in partnership with governments that were showcased during a two-day infrastructure summit held in May in Abuja, Nigeria. They included energy, natural resources and transportation projects. Commercial projects include Dar es Salaam Port expansion, autonomous Port of Cotonou expansion and power production and transmission line projects in Zambia, Tanzania and Kenya. Phiri says the strategy borrows from China's strong interest in projects such as the Ethiopia-Djibouti railway and the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway in Kenya, that is expected to expand to Uganda, Rwanda and eventually the Democratic Republic of Congo. "Africa's ambition right now is to develop projects that accelerate integration. China is strongly supporting us," he says. Phiri, who is heading the team promoting selected projects falling under the Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa, reveals that Africa's transportation and energy projects have received overwhelming support from China. He adds that despite the projects being new, the team is optimistic of quick uptake by Chinese companies based on strengthening the China-Africa relationship. Some of the PIDA projects have been articulated under the Belt and Road Initiative, like the new modern railway network in East Africa, says Phiri. "We hope that Chinese investors will find these projects attractive," he says, adding that Africa hopes to latch onto the $124 billion Silk Road Fund. He discloses that his team has made deliberate efforts to increase engagement between the AU and China. "In our recently-concluded investors' conference in March, we received a very big delegation from China. I think we are on the right path." The pan-African initiative is anchored in the 2063 Agenda and was also promoted at the World Economic Forum in May 2014 as a strategy promising to deliver tangible solutions to the continent's infrastructure deficit while fueling industrialization. The cross-border infrastructure promises to open up regional markets, link production clusters in different countries and promote free exchange of people, goods, services and capital across the borders. Isatou Touray, Gambian minister of trade, regional integration, economic affairs and employment, says such projects will help countries that are emerging from conflict to integrate more quickly with neighbors and accelerate development. "Instability in countries like The Gambia, South Sudan and others have destroyed institutions required to support governance and development. Young people are impatient and want change that takes time. But cross-border infrastructure will easily allow us to tap into regional resources," she says. But the realization of these programs has been bedeviled by financial problems, sovereignty issues and delayed harmonization of policy and regulation among neighboring countries. Political instability has also been a hindrance. But while acknowledging these challenges, the New Partnership for Africa's Development is slowly reaping success in some quarters. The Batoka Gorge Hydropower Project, jointly sponsored by the governments of Zambia and Zimbabwe, has ironed out most of the political, social and environmental bottlenecks and is ready for financing. Phiri says that the $6 billion project is expected to generate 1,600 megawatts once completed and plug the power shortfalls in the southern Africa region, with further prospects of exporting to Tanzania and Kenya. lucymorangi@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Africa Weekly 06/23/2017 page16)

                Less chaos expected as new travel ban takes effect
            </a>
            <p>
                An protester holds a sign reading "No Ban, No Wall" at a protest against US President Donald Trump's limited travel ban, approved by the US Supreme Court, in New York City, US, June 29, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]WASHINGTON — A scaled-back version of President Donald Trump's travel ban takes effect Thursday evening, stripped of provisions that brought protests and chaos at airports worldwide in January yet still likely to generate a new round of court fights.The new rules, the product of months of legal wrangling, aren't so much an outright ban as a tightening of already-tough visa policies affecting citizens from six Muslim-majority countries. Refugees are covered, too.Administration officials predicted that implementation, beginning at 8 pm EDT (0000 GMT), would be orderly. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Dan Hetlage said his agency expected "business as usual at our ports of entry." Yet amid vows from immigration and refugee advocates to challenge the new requirements, the administration sometimes struggled to explain how the new requirements would make the United States safer.Under the temporary rules, citizens from Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Iran and Yemen who already have visas will be allowed into the United States. But people from those countries who need new visas will now have to prove a close family relationship or an existing relationship with an entity like a school or business in the US.It's unclear to what degree the new rules will affect travel. Few people in most of the countries have the means for leisure travel, and those that do already face intensive screenings before being issued visas.Still, human rights groups on Thursday girded for new legal battles. The American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups challenging the ban, called the new criteria "extremely restrictive," "arbitrary" in their exclusions and designed to "disparage and condemn Muslims." Much of the confusion in January, when Trump's first ban took effect, resulted from travelers with previously approved visas being kept off flights or barred entry on arrival in the United States. Immigration officials were instructed Thursday not to block anyone with valid travel documents and otherwise eligible to visit the United States.Karen Tumlin, legal director of the National Immigration Law Center, said the rules "would slam the door shut on so many who have waited for months or years to be reunited with their families.Trump, who made a tough approach to immigration a cornerstone of his election campaign, issued a ban on travelers from the six countries, plus Iraq, shortly after taking office in January. That ban also blocked refugees from any country. Trump said these were temporary measures needed to prevent terrorism until vetting procedures could be reviewed. Opponents noted that visa and refugee vetting were already strict and said there was no evidence that refugees or citizens of those six countries posed a threat. They saw the ban as part of Trump's campaign promise to bar Muslims from entering the United States.Lower courts blocked the initial order and, later, a revised Trump order intended to overcome legal hurdles. The Supreme Court on Monday partially reinstated the revised ban but exempted travelers who could prove a "bona fide relationship" with a US person or entity. The court offered only broad guidelines.In guidance issued late Wednesday, the State Department said the personal relationships would include a parent, spouse, son, daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling already in the United States. It does not include other relationships such as grandparents, grandchildren, aunts and uncles.Business or professional links must be "formal, documented and formed in the ordinary course rather than for the purpose of evading" the ban. Journalists, students, workers or lecturers who have valid invitations or employment contracts in the US would be exempt from the ban. The exemption does not apply to those who seek a relationship with an American business or educational institution purely for the purpose of avoiding the rules.Refugees from any country will face similar requirements. But the US has almost filled its quota of 50,000 refugees for the budget year ending in September and the new rules won't apply to the few remaining slots. With the Supreme Court set to consider the overall ban in October, the rules could change again.The travel ban may have the largest impact on Iranians. In 2015, the most recently available data, nearly 26,000 Iranians were allowed into the United States on visitor or tourist visas. Iranian's made up the lion's share of the roughly 65,000 foreigners from the six countries who visited with temporary, or non-immigrant visas that year.American journalist Paul Gottinger, said he and his Iranian fiancee applied for a visa nearly a year ago but are still waiting on a decision. Gottinger says they were to wed at a Japanese garden in his parents' home state of Minnesota this month but postponed the ceremony until August because they had not yet received the visa.Now, he expects they will have to delay again."Every twist and turn of the courts, we're holding our hearts and our stomachs are falling to the floor," he said by phone from Turkey.The new regulations are also affecting the wedding plans of Rama Issa-Ibrahim, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York,.She is Syrian-American and had planned to get married this fall. While her father in Syria may be able to get a visa, her aunts and uncles may well be blocked."I would love for them to be at this wedding, and unfortunately, they aren't going to be able to be here," she said, adding that the ceremony would be postponed.AP

The scanners, provided by the Chinese government, bring to four the number of scanners deployed at the port, buoying the Kenya Revenue Authority's capacity to tighten its fight against an illicit economy that is estimated to cost Kenya's taxpayers millions of dollars annually in unpaid duty and taxes. According to John Njiraini, the KRA's commissioner-general, the nonintrusive tools are part of the agency's strategic plan to use technology to improve efficiency, increasing the number of containers scanned daily from 500 to about 750.  Guo Ce (left), economic and commercial counselor of the Chinese embassy in Kenya, and John Njiraini (second left), KRA's commissioner-general, visit the operation office for container scanners. Provided to China Daily"Aside from the three units, the Chinese government is also donating another 10 smaller scanners for use in baggage screening at our airports. We expect to have this equipment delivered and installed this year, a fact which will dramatically help in improving customer facilitation at our airport terminals," Njiraini says. "It is clear from these two initiatives that Kenya-China collaboration in customs matters, including cooperation between China Customs and KRA, is set to take on great importance in the coming years," he adds. Guo Ce, the economic and commercial counselor of the Chinese embassy in Kenya, says the scanners will play an important role in fighting crime, while boosting revenue collection. "I believe these three modern and advanced container scanners can help Mombasa Port be operated more efficiently and safely, so as to drive local economic development and tremendously spur Kenya's, as well as the East Africa's, economic growth," he says. The modern scanners come at a time when the Port of Mombasa is witnessing rapid transformation to support the country's economic ambitions. The port's total annual freight handling is expected to exceed 50 million tons by 2030, doubling from 24 million in 2015. Recent undertakings by the government, including the port's expansion and construction of the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway, have been geared toward making the port more competitive regionally. But as the capacity of the port has expanded, delays in clearing containers has been a major challenge. The scanners are intended to ease congestion. "This is a step to the right direction," says Meshack Kipturgo, the managing director of Siginon Group, a logistics company in Kenya. "It will speed up the turnaround of trucks at the port that delays cargo clearance," he adds. Gilbert Langat, chief executive officer of the Shippers Council, says: "Scanners provide nonintrusive cargo verification. It is expected that they will improve the productivity and efficiency of cargo clearance. But what is important is for the scanners to be networked with the clearance system to enable online clearance. If the reports and bookings have a human element, then we lose the benefit of efficiency and handicap our ultimate goals of going paperless." The Port of Mombasa is the biggest port in East Africa. It is the region's gateway to such countries as Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan. Last year, its container traffic increased by 2.4 percent as it handled imports of fuel and consumer goods and exports of tea and coffee. lucymorangi@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Africa Weekly 09/01/2017 page28)

                Africa's landmark free trade area aims to transform global and intra-continental exchanges, boost manufacturing and create jobsBefore investing $400,000 to set up a transformer manufacturing plant in Kenya, the managing director of Yocean Group Ltd, Dylan Yu, conducted a feasibility study that found manufacturing locally would be costly due to poor value chains. So Yu opted to establish a repair workshop while building his company.Beginning in 2014, he marketed himself as a local manufacturer and competed against foreign imports, mostly from India, until 2016, when he won a lucrative government deal to supply 2,400 locally assembled transformers valued at about $16 million.Yu, who has an established market share and competes against seven other local companies, has mixed feelings about the establishment of the African Continental Free Trade Area, an agreement launched in March after 44 African countries committed to open up their borders and ease tariffs to facilitate trade within the continent."I think the first beneficiaries will be manufacturers of fast-moving consumer goods," he says, adding that they will need to have the right price for a quality product, unlike his business, in which entry requirements are stringent."Governments insist on companies having a presence locally. In addition, you must prove your technical capacity and qualifications, among other requirements, to be considered by utility companies that are largely state-owned. Price is sometimes not the primary issue," Yu says.The AfCFTA, if realized, will create the world's biggest trading bloc - 1.2 billion people with a GDP of over $3 trillion, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. It will buoy consumer spending to about $1.4 trillion in 2020 and increase intra-Africa trade by as much as $35 billion per year, or 52 percent above the baseline, by 2022, UNECA says.Momentum is already building. On May 13 and 14, ministers of finance, planning and economic development gathered in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to discuss how to phase out tariffs, scale up infrastructure investments to improve connectivity, eliminate non-tariff trade barriers such as excessive documentation and customs delays, increase manufacturing and processing capacity, and prepare for the digital economy.Africa's manufacturing sector is growing, albeit slowly. According to UN Industrial Development Organization statistics for the third quarter of 2017, the sector grew at a rate of 1.3 percent of the world's total manufacturing output - an increase of 0.8 percent from the previous quarter - compared with 26.8 percent for the Asia-Pacific region and 16 percent for East Asia, with China logging 19.3 percent and North America 20 percent.The sector in Africa has remained relatively undiversified, with exports predominantly being extractive and nonextractive products such as oil, gas and minerals. Manufacturing is seen as the path to guaranteeing more sustainable growth and creating structural reforms and decent jobs for the continent's largely youthful population.However, it is expected to be an uphill task. Intra-Africa trade has been low, at about 16 percent of the continent's total exports, compared with intra-Asia trade, at 59 percent, and intra-Europe trade, at 69 percent, UNECA says. Moreover, local manufacturers have faced the highest tariffs globally, at 6.9 percent, when trading within Africa.However, one expert says Chinese manufacturers have laid the foundation for success on the continent."China is Africa's biggest trading partner, and its private sector has managed to penetrate our markets," says Stephen Karingi, the director of the capacity development division at the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. "It is therefore possible to examine their success and strategies to enable us to design our national strategies."According to data from China's Ministry of Commerce, privately owned Chinese companies are making more than 150 investments a year in the manufacturing sector in Africa, up from only two in 2000. A recent report by McKinsey & Co says more than 10,000 Chinese companies are operating on the continent, with 44 percent of the 1,073 Chinese companies interviewed in eight African countries making capital-intensive investments.A World Bank report indicated that at the end of 2011, China's cumulative investment stock in the manufacturing sector in Africa had grown by 10 percent year-on-year to $2.4 billion, and in 2013, it accounted for 15 percent of Chinese foreign direct investment. In terms of green-field projects, between 2003 and 2014, the largest share of Chinese capital investment and the largest number of such projects were in manufacturing, the report said.The report, Manufacturing FDI in Sub-Saharan Africa: Trends, Determinants and Impact, said that between 2011 and 2014, China was the top investor in Ethiopia, accounting for 2 percent of GDP.Manufacturing is the largest recipient of foreign direct investment, both by level of investment (76 percent of the total) and number of projects (41 percent). It was also the largest nonagriculture sector in terms of job-creating FDI between 2008 and 2014, at 28 percent, compared with 54 percent for agriculture, the report said.On infrastructure, China has expanded its participation in funding and construction. According to a World Bank report titled Building Bridges: China's Growing Role as Infrastructure Financier for Sub-Saharan Africa, Chinese investment often goes to large-scale infrastructure projects, with a particular focus on hydropower generation and railways. "More than 35 African countries are engaging with China on infrastructure finance deals, with the biggest recipients being Nigeria, Angola, Sudan and Ethiopia," the report said.Meanwhile, Ethiopia is already riding on the success of a growing manufacturing sector. With sustained expansion - GDP growth averages 10 percent annually - the East African nation's manufacturing sector exports brought in $437 million in the country's fiscal year 2016-17. According to a World Bank report, the country's growth in the past decade has helped to significantly reduce poverty.Ethiopia has embarked on an ambitious program of upgrading its infrastructure, building industrial parks and formulating industrial policies and strategies to support the development of industrialization. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed says this has led to meaningful improvements in foreign direct investment."Our efforts have yielded tangible results as evidenced in the growing share of the industrial sector's contribution to our economy, " he said during a conference of African ministers of finance, planning and economic development in Addis Ababa. "With the (AfCFTA) in place, and once it enters into force in particular, I am confident that the opportunities for us to attract more investments will only increase."

                Sudanese protesters suspend talks with military
            </a>
            <p>
                KHARTOUM, Sudan — The organizers of Sudan's protests said Sunday they have suspended talks with the ruling military council because it has failed to meet their demands for an immediate transfer to a civilian government following the overthrow of President Omar al-Bashir.Mohammed al-Amin Abdel Aziz, a spokesman for the Sudanese Professionals Association, said Sunday that the political committee of the military council is too close to al-Bashir, who has been jailed in the capital, Khartoum."The military council is delaying its response to our proposals, saying that they are considering proposals from all political forces," he said.He said the SPA is calling for more protests, and repeated its demand for an immediate transfer to a transitional civilian government that would rule for four years.The SPA led four months of protests that eventually ended al-Bashir's 30-year reign, which was marred by multiple armed conflicts and widespread corruption. The umbrella group of unions says around 100 people were killed by security forces since December, when the protests were sparked by a hike in the price of basic goods.The Sudanese military overthrew and arrested al-Bashir on April 11, and has appointed a military council that says it will rule for up to two years while elections are organized. The military has arrested senior officials from al-Bashir's government and sacked top judges and prosecutors.Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, the head of the military council, told state TV Sunday that the council is "ready to hand over power tomorrow to a civilian government agreed by political forces."He said the military is waiting for the various political factions behind the protests to submit the names of the proposed members of a transitional government, something the organizers had said they would do on Sunday. He said the military is considering the protesters' demands for a civilian council with a military representative."Our role is to complete the uprising and the blessed revolution," he added.The protesters fear the military — which is still dominated by al-Bashir appointees — will cling to power or appoint another general in his place.Mohammed al-Asam, a senior member of the SPA, told The Associated Press late Saturday that "we are ready with a clear plan for a transition with qualified names."The association had said it would announce the names at a press conference Sunday outside the military's headquarters in Khartoum, where thousands of protesters have kept up a sit-in since April 6. It was not immediately clear whether the announcement had been cancelled or delayed."We want a civil council immediately with a military representation. This is our demand," said al-Asam, who was detained for more than three months before being released after al-Bashir's ouster. He was held in the Koper prison in Khartoum, where al-Bashir and other top officials now reside.The 28-year-old doctor urged the international community to press the military to hand over power to civilians. He said the military council is becoming more powerful every day and that "this is dangerous to the revolution."Burhan said the military council will send a delegation to the United States later this month for talks on removing Sudan from the US list of state sponsors of terror, a designation that dates back to the early 1990s, when the country briefly hosted Osama bin Laden."We expect a breakthrough in this issue," he said.The military has also reached out to the African Union, saying it is working to "create an environment so political forces can rule in a peaceful and democratic way," according to the state-run SUNA news agency.SUNA said Lt. Gen. Omer Zain-al-Abdin, head of the political committee of the military council, met with AU commission chairman Moussa Faki in Khartoum on Saturday.The African Union on Monday gave Sudan's military 15 days to hand over power to a "civilian-led political authority" or face suspension from AU activities. The AU said a civilian authority should hold elections "as quickly as possible."Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates meanwhile announced a $3 billion aid package for Sudan. The Saudi state-run news agency said Sunday that $500 million would be deposited in Sudan's central bank, while the remaining amount will be used to purchase food, medicine and fuel.Burhan said authorities recently searched a presidential residence, where they found more than 7 million euros ($7.8 million) and $350,000 in US currency. The protesters have accused al-Bashir and his family of pillaging state resources during his three decades in power.AP
