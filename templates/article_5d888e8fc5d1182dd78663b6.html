                'Straw Hat University' keeps founder busy
            </p>

                WeChat group helps spread drought-resistant techniques for growing organic watermelons and tomatoesFarmer Liu Xiao has become much busier since he founded his "Straw Hat University" in May.Liu, 56, is famous among fellow farmers in Liulin county, in northern China's Shanxi province, for his independently researched drought-resistant farming techniques."Straw Hat University is just the nickname of a WeChat group," he said. "On May 26, I set up the WeChat group to give technical guidance to farmers attending the launch ceremony of a planting base for organic watermelons and tomatoes. More than 400 farmers present, each wearing a straw hat, joined in the group, hence the name."Liu uses the WeChat group to give local farmers specialized courses to improve their planting techniques and to seek channels to bring pesticide-free agricultural products to cities.Frequent droughts in the region and the lack of agricultural technology services have severely restricted the development of agriculture and farmers' incomes, according to the local government."Every evening, I will spend two or three hours in the WeChat group, hoping to help the farmers learn how to plant scientifically instead of only depending on experience," Liu said. "I also believe that they can achieve the transformation from poverty to wealth through hard work."Liu was born in an extremely poor family in Liulin and became disabled from the bone disease rickets when a child.Despite good grades at school, his disability prevented him from going on to college.In the eight years after graduating from high school he attempted to start different businesses, including raising chickens and planting mushrooms, but none succeeded.In 1983, he noticed an article in a local newspaper introducing the technology of plastic mulching.After reading it carefully, he decided to have a try.He borrowed money to buy plastic film and watermelon seeds, and started cultivating his 800 square meter field.Almost all his relatives and friends advised him to change his mind."They told me that nobody could successfully grow watermelons on the dry land," he said. "I could understand their concerns, but the attempt was my last straw. I had to stick to it."The results did not disappoint him.His watermelon seedlings grew from the mulch after a drought and he welcomed a bumper harvest three months later."I still remember selling 800 kilograms of watermelons for 1,600 yuan, which was really a large sum of money at that time," Liu said. "I counted the money over and over again with tears and smiles."

                G7 nations pledge $40 million to fight Amazon fires
            </a>
            <p>
                PORTO VELHO, Brazil — The Group of Seven nations on Monday pledged tens of millions of dollars to help fight raging wildfires in the Amazon and protect its rainforest, even as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro accused rich countries of treating the region like a "colony."The international pledges at a G7 summit in France included $20 million from the group, as well as a separate $12 million from Britain and $11 million from Canada. Ottawa has also offered to send firefighting planes to Brazil.Other groups are contributing support for a region whose rainforests are a major absorber of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Earth Alliance, a new environmental foundation backed by Leonardo DiCaprio, is pledging $5 million in aid, saying the Amazon is one of the "best defenses" against climate change.The funds are widely seen as critical support, but a relatively small amount for dealing with an environmental crisis of such scale threatening what French President Emmanuel Macron called "the lungs of the planet."More than $1 billion, for example, has been paid into a fund to help the Amazon in the past decade. And major donors Germany and Norway recently cut donations to Brazilian forestry projects, saying Bolsonaro's administration isn't committed to curbing deforestation.It was unclear how exactly the new money would be administered. Bureaucracy can slow and reduce the amount that reaches programs in the field. Brazil's environment minister, Ricardo Salles, said the aid was welcome and that Brazil should decide how the resources are used.More global funding and political will in Brazil will be needed once the fires are extinguished, said John Robinson, chief conservation officer at the Wildlife Conservation Society.Brazil needs "legislation and regulations that set clear limits preventing landowners — especially large ones — from burning the forest and converting it to agriculture and rangeland, backed by incentives and investment in alternatives," Robinson said.The international pledges came despite tensions between European countries and the Brazilian president, who suggested the West was angling to exploit Brazil's natural resources.The Brazilian leader says he is committed to protecting the Amazon and prosecuting anyone involved in illegal fires, many of which appear to be to have been set in already deforested areas to clear land for farming.But Bolsonaro initially questioned whether activist groups might have started the fires in an effort to damage the credibility of his government, which has called for looser environmental regulations in the world's largest rainforest to spur development."We believe that there are many mining companies and lumber companies and farmers who feel that the president has their backs," said Raoni Metuktire, a Brazilian indigenous chief and environmentalist who traveled to the G-7 summit in Biarritz.In response, European leaders threatened to block a major trade deal with Brazil that would benefit the very agricultural interests accused of driving deforestation.The impact of the fires and smoke has disrupted life for many in the Amazon region. The airport in Porto Velho, the capital of Rondonia state, was closed for more than an hour Monday morning because of poor visibility. On Sunday, a soccer match of a lower-tier national league was briefly suspended because of smoke in Rio Branco, capital of Acre state, as fire burned in a field outside the stadium.Macron said the Amazon, while mostly Brazilian, is a world issue and that his message to Bolsonaro is: "We cannot allow you to destroy everything."Brazil's sovereignty must be respected, Macron said, but the world can help Brazil reforest and build its economy "while respecting the natural balance."About 60 percent of the Amazon region is in Brazil; the vast forest also spans parts of Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru and Suriname.Speaking on French TV after hosting the G-7 summit, Macron acknowledged that Europe, by importing soya from Brazil, shares some blame for the agricultural pressure on the rainforest.He added that Europe's dependence on imported proteins, including soya, for animal feed is "a very bad choice" and that he wants Europe to develop alternate sources of protein.Bolsonaro has accused Macron of treating the region "as if we were a colony."Bolsonaro has announced he would send 44,000 soldiers to help battle the blazes, and military planes began dumping water on fires in the Amazon state of Rondonia.The move was welcomed by many critics, but some say it's not enough and comes too late.In violating environmental agreements, Brazil has been discredited and "unable to exercise any type of leadership on the international stage," said Mauricio Santoro, an international relations professor at Rio de Janeiro State University.Critics say the large number of fires this year has been stoked by Bolsonaro's encouragement of farmers, loggers and ranchers to speed efforts to strip away forest. Although Bolsonaro has now vowed to protect the area, they say it is only out of fear of a diplomatic crisis and economic losses.Fires are common during Brazil's dry season, but the numbers surged this year. The country's National Space Research Institute, which monitors deforestation, has recorded more than 77,000 wildfires in Brazil this year, a record since the institute began keeping track in 2013. That is an 85% rise over last year, and about half of the fires have been in the Amazon region — with more than half of those coming just in the past month.AP

                The planet's future burns along with Amazon
            </a>
            <p>
                The nearly 73,000 fires, most of them set illegally to clear and prepare land for agriculture, cattle farming and property speculation, have prompted the state of Amazonas to declare an emergency. The fires have decimated the Amazon rainforest, which could be devastating for an ecosystem that produces a huge amount of the planet's oxygen, sparking international concerns over the destruction of one of the world's largest carbon sinks.From frustration to mourning, the community of concerned individuals and organizations the world over are trying to find ways of curbing the man-made devastation in the Amazon."Our house is burning," tweeted French President Emmanuel Macron, calling for emergency talks on the issue at the just concluded G7 summit in Biarritz in France.Although wildfires in the Amazon are an annual occurrence, especially in the dry season which begins in July and continues up to September, this year they increased 84 percent compared with last year.Many climate skeptics and those who never get tired of denying that global warming is man-made have claimed the Amazon fires this year are a natural phenomenon, but environmentalists assert humans are the root cause of the fires.Scientists say the ongoing destruction will have dire consequences for Brazil and the world. The Guardian quoted Carlos Nobre, a senior researcher at the Institute of Advanced Studies at the University of Sao Paulo, as saying the increase in deforestation was taking the rainforest closer to a tipping point beyond which swaths of the usually humid forest would become a dry savannah, with dire consequences for the climate, wildlife and forest dwellers.Deforestation was on course to rise by 20-30 percent this year, Nobre said, adding that it was "very likely" to pass 10,000 square kilometers for the first time in more than 10 years.Nobre told The Guardian: "A very large number of these fires are due to the cultural push that ministers are giving. They are pushing deforestation because it is good for the economy.""Good for the economy" in the short term, perhaps, but considering the devastating effects of massive forest fires and deforestation in the long log run, it could mean the end of economic development as we know it.In Mato Grosso, a soy frontier, which has seen more fires than anywhere else in Brazil this year, burning has been detected inside indigenous people's lands and nature reserves.Nobre told The Guardian that one of the only remaining ways to prevent a dangerous loss of forests was through external protests and consumer actions. "Politicians in Brazil pay more attention to international pressure than the voice of Brazilians," he said.But in the run-up to the G7 summit, the developed world's response to the crisis was mixed. Norway and Germany halted donations to the Brazilian government's Amazon fund, but the United Kingdom spent last week focusing on post-Brexit business with Brazil.Also last week, British Trade Minister Conor Burns was shaking hands with his Brazilian counterpart in Brasilia, saying the UK is eager to deepen relations with Brazil. Worse, asked about the Amazon fires, Burns refused to comment but reportedly said the Bolsonaro government had "legitimate ambitions to bring prosperity to its people".Thomas Lovejoy, a co-author of the tipping point study and who has worked for more than 50 years in the Brazilian rainforest, said this is one of its darkest moments for the Amazon. "There have always been some ups and downs, but the overall trajectory has been towards improvement. Now, Brazil is headed in the other direction. Under normal circumstances, the outside world would endeavor to help, but this Brazilian government is not interested in help."However, the $20 million the outside world, more precisely the G7, has pledged to douse the Amazon fires has been dismissed as "chump change" by environmentalists, as the amount is mainly aimed at sending firefighting aircraft to tackle the conflagrations.More worryingly, the world is divided when it comes to fighting climate change, as was evident in the empty chair of the US leader at the G7 meeting on climate change.It seems those hell-bent on boosting economic growth at any cost are holding the future of the world's forests, rather the future of the planet, to ransom. But without forests there won't be any development.The author is a senior editor with China Daily.

Zou Shuo reports from Lanzhou.Born into a "dirt poor" family in a small village in mountainous Beichuan Qiang autonomous county, Sichuan province, Duan Zhixiu never imagined she would have the opportunity to go to university."Since I was a little girl, my parents told me they were willing to sell everything in the house to send me to a good university, but I knew that even if they sold everything, it would still not be enough," she said.

                Coffee shop with a difference helps rural children
            </a>
            <p>
                Jian Chuntian runs a coffee shop in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, that is helping him realize his dream of helping poor rural children.His method is a little different - he gives free ice creams to those who donate items such as clothes and toys, which he sends to children in poverty stricken areas.Jian, who used to work for a health and education NGO, started his shop in 2016. From the day it opened, he made it a policy to encourage people to help those in need in more interesting ways.In three years, the 35-year-old has received more than 15,000 toys and sent them to poor villages in counties like Tongguan and Shanyang in Shaanxi."When I was a volunteer teacher in rural areas, I found that many children there didn't lack facilities like desks and chairs or pens, instead they needed company and something to play with," he said."The toy donation project is environmentally friendly and can bring rural children happiness. Also, urban children who donate toys can also find it interesting because they get their favorite ice cream as a reward."Since Jian's shop is close to two primary schools, students regularly visit it after school to play or do their homework. Sometimes, they want to eat ice cream but have no money or used toys to exchange.So Jian came up with another idea - offering ice cream in exchange for cigarette butts collected by the children. Twenty cigarette butts earn one ice cream and Jian estimates the children have picked up about 50,000 butts in the past three years."I hope that one day, when they grow up, they can still remember that they earned themselves an ice cream by picking up trash one summer, which was meaningful and interesting," he said. "I want to arouse children's awareness of protecting the environment by doing this."Jian worked for several NGOs from 2007, including China-Dolls Center for Rare Disorders in Beijing, Marie Stopes International China - which provides sexual and reproductive healthcare services - and Chunshan Education Foundation in Shaanxi, which focuses on rural education in Xi'an, the provincial capital.In 2013, he quit his full-time job and tried to create his own brand to help the public and provide social services. After three years of seeking a suitable way to realize his vision, he started the coffee shop, which he named Lyulyu - green donkey in Chinese."When I was a child, I used to think that a donkey would turn green if it ate green grass all the time," Jian said. "The name reminds me of childhood."He said that since the income from the coffee shop is not enough to live on, he also works as a part-time photographer."My current goal is to strike a balance between pursuing my dream and making money and use the money to support some of my fun ideas about social work," Jian said."Interesting ideas can sometimes give people who live a predictable life a surprise, just like children are happy to get ice cream as a reward for donating toys. These ideas can encourage more people to participate in these activities that can benefit the public."He said that even though most people who just wanted to earn money viewed such loss-making activities or ideas as useless, he believes they are an important part of people's spiritual lives.Jian used to sell cocktails at his coffee shop and allow customers to decide how much to pay. He said the uncertainty added fun to his life."I prefer to choose to do social work in a way that sounds like a fairy tale," he said. "I hope these things can influence more people to live a positive and interesting life and feel happy when helping others."

                Grandma on a mission
            </a>
            <p>
                Many girls from families living in poverty are returning to schools in Ningxia, thanks to the efforts of an elderly woman, Hu Dongmei and Zhang Xiaomin report in Yinchuan. Jiang Lijuan sits in her chair and slowly goes through a photo album, page by page. The 88-year-old knows the stories behind the pictures - stories of several thousand girls from remote areas of the Ningxia Hui autonomous region whom she once helped to return to school after they had dropped out because they couldn't afford the 80 yuan ($11) tuition fee. Over the past 25 years, Jiang has raised 5 million yuan to help girls from poor families, but she doesn't focus on the money. She's more interested in the people. "Look at these two little girls," she says. "They envied the kids who had leather shoes." She knows every child in every photo. "This is Du Juan from Yanchi county. I saw her frequently until she went to college. There are many college students whom I supported. We took this picture when we went to Guyuan together," Jiang says. Jiang's story started in 1994, when she learned from TV news that 17,000 girls in Guyuan had lost their chance for an education because their families couldn't pay tuition. She was shocked. "It's only 80 yuan, which isn't much," she says. "But it's a big deal for girls to be educated. Girls today are the mothers of the future, and their education levels will directly affect the lives of their kids. They have a great responsibility to change the backwardness in remote areas, and we have to help them." Previously, Jiang was a staff member of a residential committee in Yinchuan, the regional capital. She mobilized her family to support three girls. Then, she enlisted the help of seven female colleagues to send another nine girls back to school. After that came her letter to the Ningxia Women's Federation asking for donations from the 29 units of the Spring Buds project in Ningxia. The project, led by the All-China Women's Federation, a government agency, was launched in 1989 with the aim of getting girls back into classrooms and to improve conditions for teachers in impoverished areas. Jiang bustled around government institutions and companies, and met with ordinary people to raise money. Many were moved by the stories of the girls, and some donated immediately. Sometimes, Jiang was met with sharp rebuffs. She remembers the criticism of people who didn't want to give, and their words hurt. "Is this a big deal that you need to worry about?" some asked. "There are so many poor people in the world. How can you help them all?" Worse, they attacked her age and retirement status: "At your age, people usually rest at home. What are you running around for?" Jiang let the negativity roll off. She focused on finding the next generous giver. In September 1996, the first Spring Buds course sponsored by the Xiguan residential committee, where Jiang had worked, opened in Guyuan with 46 girls in attendance. In the following years, more courses started in Ningxia, including in Yanchi, Tongxin, Xiji, Haiyuan and Pengyang. Jiang was fondly called the "Spring Buds grandma". "I found her!" Ding Caiting recalls exclaiming to her 10-year-old daughter as she read a book, Living Like Lei Feng, about people who have followed the example of selfless Chinese role models. "The 'Spring Buds grandma' is the one who helped me when I was your age!" Today, Ding is a doctor in Yinchuan's Xingqing district. She'd picked up the book while participating in a volunteer activity. "I never imagined that the person sponsoring me would be a grandma," Ding says. "She has great love." From the book, she discovered that Jiang was not rich, as she had thought earlier, but was an ordinary person who lived on a pension. With tenacious perseverance, she had overcome the pain of hypertension, a heart disease and diabetes to work on behalf of the children. "My daughter said we should thank Grandma Jiang. If I hadn't returned to school with her support, I would not have such a good life today," Ding adds. Jiang's story has inspired many to join the effort. In her handwritten Spring Buds notebook, she has recorded the details of contributors - their names, telephone numbers, places of residence and the amount of money donated. It lists more than 500 people from different walks of life. In 2007, a Chinese person living in the United States contacted Jiang and donated more than 1.4 million yuan after reading a media report about her. Jiang has been awarded as a "charity leader" in China. Her work has boosted the development of education in Ningxia, observers say. "Our family doesn't care too much about the awards," says Cui Wei, Jiang's daughter. "My mother is just doing what she likes." More people are now doing charity work, she adds. Jiang shares her motivation for helping others: "I'm an orphan. I know the feeling of loneliness and what it means to need help." She was 13 when both of her parents died, and she had to live with her relatives. In recent years, with the implementation of the compulsory nine-year education in the country, the enrollment rate of primary and secondary school students has risen, so Jiang has shifted her focus to supporting students in high schools and colleges.
