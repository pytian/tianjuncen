                The United States always has its hands full trying to force its laws and values upon other countries and, if resisted, to impose sanctions on them. But as usual, it has failed with its filthy trick in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by openly supporting the violent demonstrators and introducing the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act" in Congress.So now it is trying to extend its dirty hands into the Tibet autonomous region, by unveiling a new bill that would prohibit Beijing from opening any new consulates on US soil until Washington is permitted to establish its own diplomatic office in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet autonomous region. And all in the name of human rights protection.As is its wont, Washington cannot bear to see peace and stability anywhere, except within its borders, for it has mastered the art of fishing in troubled waters. No wonder the bill also has provisions for the US taking punitive action against any Chinese officials who "interfere" in the Dalai Lama's succession. Which should make it clear the real purpose of the bill is to prevent the Chinese central government from using its authority to approve the successor to the octogenarian Dalai Lama after he dies.Perhaps US lawmakers, especially Massachusetts Democrat James McGovern who introduced the bill in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, and Florida Republican Marco Rubio who has been screaming his head off in support of the Hong Kong demonstrators, have forgotten that Tibet is an inseparable part of China, a fact the US, too, recognizes. As such, any attempt to interfere in Tibet's affairs would be a violation of China's sovereignty.More important, supporting the Dalai Lama is like mollycoddling a separatist, for his activities over the past decades to split Tibet from China make him exactly that. The economic development and social progress Tibetans have been enjoying fly in the face of the US congressmen, who without any knowledge about the region, have been beating their democracy and human rights drum.In keeping up with the US' practice of poking its nose into other countries' matters, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomed Hong Kong protesters on Wednesday. She even thanked them for unleashing violence and holding the city to ransom, and warned the US administration not to allow commercial interests to drive foreign policy in the region.The double standard resorted to by the self-proclaimed guardians of human rights becomes even more evident when they applaud rioters in other countries and deal with protesters in their own country with an iron hand.Have American values also come to mean hypocrisy?

                    Sino-Russian partnership gets verve to improve world order: China Daily editorial
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                To the China-Russia partnership, the 24th regular meeting between their heads of government, which concluded in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Wednesday, gave a shot in the arm. There is no better way for the two sides to secure international support as both have come under increasing external pressure to change their diplomatic maneuvering on the global stage.The joint communiqué Beijing and Moscow issued proves the claim that the Sino-Russian partnership, now officially described as comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era, has reached a historical high. Not least because the document literally instills the idea of comprehensive strategic partnership into all aspects of bilateral relations, showcasing the two sides' shared commitment to formulating a new kind of Sino-Russian partnership in global governance.Emphatically, it reiterates the importance of securing mutual support. With both under pressure of externally imposed economic hardships, Beijing and Moscow are laying unprecedented emphasis on tapping the full potential of bilateral collaboration. And given their highly complementary economic structures as well as economic conditions, they do have room for such endeavors.The document they issued on Wednesday vows to raise bilateral trade, which surpassed $100 billion in 2018, to $200 billion by 2024 through trade facilitation. Besides promises of dovetailing their respective key development strategies, the Beijing-proposed Belt and Road Initiative and Moscow's Eurasian Economic Union, they have pledged to make joint efforts to address current issues, from collaboration on soy production to avoiding risks of sanctions from the West.While making their partnership true to its comprehensive nature, China and Russia have made it clear in the joint communiqué that their cooperation is not limited to bilateral affairs. Despite being a little less specific when it comes to such issues, the document does indicate the clear orientation of the two countries to work more closely together in the international arena. As responsible major countries, it says, China and Russia share the obligation for improving global governance and safeguarding international justice.That Beijing and Moscow have vowed to deepen cooperation on such multilateral international platforms as the United Nations, World Trade Organization, Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS reflects the seriousness with which they intend to work to build a world order that is fairer and more representative of nations.Since the current pattern of Sino-Russian interaction is the outcome of de facto Western isolation, it should come as no surprise if the two are found acting more in unison against rising protectionism and unilateralism that have cast a shadow over the world.

                    Using law to safeguard rule of law: China Daily editorial

                That the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government has canceled the annual National Day fireworks show on Oct 1 and Hong Kong Jockey Club called off Wednesday's Happy Valley race, both for security reasons, speaks volumes of the damage the violent demonstrations have caused to the city.Under the garb of democracy, signified by the masks they've worn to hide their identity, the insurrectionists have attacked police officers and stations, and tried to break into the Legislative Council building. It is absurd indeed that, despite claiming to fight for "democracy" and "righteousness", they are afraid of revealing their true identity.On Saturday, a middle-aged Hong Kong resident pulled the mask off a radical's face when the latter was showering a group of people singing China's national anthem with invectives. Instead of facing up to the situation, the radical punched the middle-aged man, cutting open his left brow ridge, covered his face with his arm and fled the scene.Immediately after being uploaded online, the video, recorded by a bystander, drew wide attention. And the violent protester was, ironically, identified as a 25-year-old civil servant working for Hong Kong customs, giving rise to a heated debate on whether the SAR should have a special law banning protesters from covering their faces with masks.Masks seem to have put the demonstrators above the law, simply because they cannot be identified. Which has seriously compromised the rule of law in Hong Kong.So it is good to hear Hong Kong Secretary of Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah saying the city's legislators are studying the feasibility of making such a law — which has been on their agenda for three years since the Mong Kok riots took place.In many countries and regions, such a law plays an important role in demarcating the legal and moral boundaries of demonstrators.There are enough reasons to believe such a law would be backed by public opinion, because it is already a consensus among the sane elements in the city that the rule of law must be safeguarded by putting an end to the violence in the city.Since too many radical protesters have been released on bail within hours of being detained under the current Hong Kong law, it is necessary and urgent to address the issue using legal means to remove their masks.Tough times call for tough measures.

                    Advancing political consultation to serve national rejuvenation: China Daily editorial
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The system of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference should be upheld, and its work of political consultation, democratic oversight, and participation in State affairs improved. This message for the CPPCC came from Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, on Friday, the eve of its 70th anniversary.The CPPCC, whose national committee is China's top political advisory body, is a bridge between the people and the government, and a reliable consultant for decision-makers at the highest level. Originating from the national united front against Japanese aggression under the leadership of the CPC in the 1930s, the CPPCC is today indispensable to China's national development.China's fast-paced economic development has only made the CPPCC more important. Take the 13th CPPCC National Committee for example. Its 2,158 members, experts from 34 major sections of society and classified into 10 special committees, carry out research in different fields, conduct in-depth studies, hold group discussions, and only then do they put forward proposals for public policies for the central government's consideration.At its annual meeting in March, the 13th CPPCC National Committee submitted a total of 5,113 proposals, of which 1,121 were accepted as advice and suggestions by the central government. And many of those have led to new policies or changes in policies.The CPPCC — which has local committees at county, city and provincial levels that function in a similar way to help local officials better serve the people — is not only a broad platform for multiparty cooperation, its original mission, but also helps build an inclusive atmosphere for consultative politics and institutional guarantee for people's democracy.Its institutional arrangement, which has developed with the changing times, ensures that all proposals are based on thorough research and analyzed to verify their feasibility before they are submitted to the government.The fact that the CPPCC is not averse to the idea of embracing new applications of information and communications technology shows its welcoming attitude toward modern technology and innovation. Which in turn has remarkably improved its efficiency, and made it more responsive to people's practical needs and governance problems.The CPPCC should not only maintain the momentum of its good work, increase its interaction with the people and carry out self-reform, but more importantly, as Xi said, improve its work of political consultation, democratic oversight, and participation in State affairs, particularly in fields that are directly related to the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, so as to make concerted efforts together with the CPC and the Chinese people to realize national rejuvenation.If the CPPCC succeeds in its tasks, it will better serve the people, which is its bounden duty.
