                Chinese outfits delight crowd at Fashion Week
            </p>
            <p>
                Professors' historically inspired designs caused a stir as they hit the catwalk SUVA - With lively music and lighting, models on Friday night displayed designers' outfits during Fiji Fashion Week in the country's capital, Suva. This year, costumes designed by two Chinese professors from Shanghai-based Donghua University caught the spotlight, winning applause and cheers from the audience. It was the second time for Chen Bin, a professor and veteran designer, to participate in Fiji Fashion Week. This year, he brought Lijin, a type of folk brocade originating from the Li ethnic group in China's Hainan province.  A dance is performed to showcase the local culture during the Fiji Fashion Week. File PhotoLijin, with a history of more than 3,000 years, has been listed on UNESCO's "Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding". In his works, Chen aimed to integrate the traditional technique with modern design under the theme of "regeneration". Mao Dan, a Chinese professor and designer, was excited and nervous to attend Fiji Fashion Week for her first time. Mao got her inspiration from Du Fu, a poet in the Tang Dynasty (618-907). The poetry created in the Tang Dynasty, mostly romantic and vivid, was an important part of the culture. In Mao's works, the combination of Chinese poetry and the texture of silk creates a dynamic and magnificent sense of time and space. Chen and Mao work in the design department of a fashion institute in Donghua University. They think China has a long history with rich culture and costume designers should take advantage of this. The pair claim that by combining Chinese culture with designs and by entering more international fashion events, designers are likely to enjoy success. "The Chinese costume design industry has great potential. What we should do is keep abreast with the times and design our costumes with a sense of innovation, and in particular with Chinese characteristics," they said. Yang Hui, Chinese director of the Confucius Institute at the University of the South Pacific, said that by bringing their works to Fiji Fashion Week, the designers did not just introduce modern Chinese costume to the region. They also offered local people a new perspective to understand Chinese culture, as well as its fast-growing fashion industry. Ellen Whippy-Knight, organizer and founder of Fiji Fashion Week, said she was impressed by the Chinese designers and their works. "I believe fashion and designing have a great future and thank the two Chinese designers for bringing their wonderful costumes to our fashion week - they really helped the event," she said. Fiji Fashion Week, first held in 2008, has attracted many local and international designers over the past few years. The theme for this year was based on the environment.

                Acrobatics turns over fortunes of county in Anhui
            </a>
            <p>
                HEFEI - As the music from a violin starts to echo across the room, Hu Jun and his daughter Hu Siyuan begin to spin and dance gracefully while suspended by ropes in the air.The performance, titled How Did Time Slip By, consists of many difficult acrobatic movements. Under the spotlight, the dance moves make what was once called "the tricks of the clowns" a spectacular show."Acrobatics is not just about the tricks and dance movements," said Hu Jun, 50, head of the Feitian Acrobatics Troupe. "We need to bring new vitality to the performances to allow people to enjoy the traditional art."Hu Jun has been performing acrobatics for more than 40 years and is among more than 20,000 acrobats in Linquan county, Anhui province.Linquan, one of the most populous counties in China with about 2.3 million registered residents, is known as the "hometown of acrobatics" due to its large number of acrobats. In the past, a huge population and limited land forced many locals to resort to performing acrobatics to make a living.China pays great attention to the development of the performing art, with the Ministry of Culture and Tourism recently announcing that a national performing season of acrobatics will be held in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region in July.Hu Jun's hometown, Weixiaozhuang village, is the center of acrobatics in Linquan, with 27 troupes from 44 families. In the village, acrobatics is a basic skill, "just like farming", he said."I began to perform in acrobatics when I was nine years old," he said, later following his master and performing around the country."We usually chose a site, built a makeshift shelter and just performed tricks like fire blowing or balancing chairs on our heads," he said. "The crowds would go wild!"Despite simple equipment and a simple environment, their shows were always sold out as people did not have much choice in entertainment and tickets were quite cheap.In 1997, Hu Jun established his own troupe and focused on aerial performances. Venues evolved from makeshift shelters to big theaters across China, with each show grossing more than 1,000 yuan ($145).Even though the performances brought good perks, the public ridiculed his acrobatics as "the clown shows", driving him to improve."People would say we were clowns, but I wanted to prove to them that we could perform on stage gracefully," he said.His daughter Hu Siyuan loved playing the violin and dancing, which inspired the senior Hu. The father and daughter decided to tell stories with acrobatics, music, dance moves and even yoga incorporated into their performances.Their shows, including How Did Time Slip By and Standing on Ropes, stole the spotlight and brought their artistic skills to the next level.Like the Hu family, many acrobats in Linquan began to incorporate modern elements into their shows.As the Chinese government has promoted cultural activities in rural China in recent years and a large number of theme parks have mushroomed, Linquan's acrobatics became a big industry, generating more than 500 million yuan in revenue each year.However, behind the enthusiasm is a lack of young talent. As the performances require vigorous training and can be dangerous, many parents refuse to let their children take on the profession.In Linquan, there are currently six acrobatics schools, including one established by performer Hou Jie and his father, Hou Zhongyi. The school was built in 2009, and with the support of the local government, it offers free classes and accommodation."It is difficult to enroll students," the junior Hou said. "We provide regular classes to students in the daytime and acrobatics training in the early morning and at night."Music and dance classes are also offered."Acrobatics was more about exciting and sometimes dangerous performances in the past," Hou Jie said. "But now we focus more on stage presence and the beauty of the art.""Acrobatics is the calling card of Linquan, and we hope to use the performing art to bolster the tourism industry," said local official Xu Hongyan. "We hope to provide more jobs and stable income for acrobatic performers."Xinhua

                A first 'stubborn' step on the path to solo stardom
            </a>
            <p>
                "The harder the path, the firmer my step," Meng Meiqi sings, in high-pitched tones over a backdrop of pulsating electronica music, showing the 20-year-old's determination to overcome any obstacle she might face in her performing career.That's a part of the title track of her first extended play record, for which she has written some of the lyrics."I want to unveil my inner world to the listeners via the songs on this record," says Meng.The EP, Jiang (which translates as "stubbornness"), released on April 23, has already racked up about 8 million yuan ($1.16 million) in digital sales, topping the album charts on QQ Music, a major streaming music platform in China.This is not the first time the young performer has impressed the public with her singing and dancing. Arguably, her biggest achievement to date came via last year's hit online talent show, Produce 101, where she quickly stood out and secured her big break into China's entertainment industry as a member of the 11-piece girl band, Rocket Girls 101.After that, Meng opened the door to a large domestic fan base, garnering more than 20 million followers on the Chinese micro-blogging site, Sina Weibo."She is a wonderful performer as she knows how to control her facial expressions and body movements perfectly onstage. I'm fascinated by the expressive power of her performances," says Wang Yiru, 24, a Shanghai-based office worker and a keen fan of Meng.In the music video for Jiang, a scene where she stares into the camera through eyes lined with bright pink makeup while performing powerfully choreographed dance moves was captured in one continuous tracking shot. A scene like this requires the artist to display sophisticated dance techniques and performance skills, and that is exactly what Meng has been learning since the age of 12.Meng recalls that it was a street dance video she saw in 2010 that inspired her to learn the genre at a dance club. Supported by her parents, Meng's love of dance grew stronger and, four years later, the then 15-year-old made the decision to leave her hometown of Luoyang city, Henan province, to become a teen trainee with an entertainment company in South Korea.

                1970s ping-pong did produce a diplomat
            </a>
            <p>
                The curtain went down. The spotlight was on. Jan Berris, whose hair was in two braids to match her Chinese counterpart, walked briskly onto the stage of the auditorium to announce the next program. The audience waited with bated breath, having just been delighted by a riotous lion's dance.It was December 1972 in Chicago. The Shenyang Acrobatic Troupe from northeastern China was touring the US. And the braids, most popular among Chinese young women at the time, were meant to be a nod to the guests.Barely eight months before, the Chinese Table Tennis Team had come to the states, touring and playing friendly matches with their US counterparts. The visit itself was reciprocal because in April the previous year, the US Table Tennis Team had been invited to visit China, the first American delegation since 1949.Dubbed "ping-pong diplomacy", these mutual gestures symbolized a thaw in what was once seen as a perennially frozen bilateral relationship.In a fateful twist of events, the games also set Berris, a promising young diplomat stationed in the US consulate in Hong Kong, on a different career path. Berris is today the vice-president of the New York-based National Committee on US-China Relations, a nonprofit organization founded by those who saw "the potentials not the limitations" in the two countries' futures."In June 1971, I was invited by a former professor of mine who was the chairman of the National Committee to join the organization and help prepare for the coming visit of the Chinese ping-pong team," said Berris, who was with the Chinese players during their entire stay in the US."That trip was so successful that the Chinese decided to send the acrobatics. Chicago was their first stop," said Berris, the project's coordinator, who also found time to be part of the troupe's performance as the stage announcer. "There I was, announcing the second act when all of a sudden I saw, out of the corner of my eye, that one of our security officers was running to the back of the auditorium. The bright stage lights were on so I couldn't see clearly, but I could tell that there was some sort of commotion. The minute I walked off stage, I said to our stage director: 'Don't pull up the curtain.'"It turned out that someone in the audience had thrown tear gas toward the stage ¡ª the auditorium, filled with the burning, acrid smell, had to be cleared and everyone had to get out."My National Committee colleagues and I went backstage to talk to the head of the Chinese delegation. We basically explained the situation and said: 'It's up to you as to whether you want to continue the show or not. If the answer is yes, we'll wait for an hour before bringing back the audience; if it's no, we'll just miss this one performance and will begin again tomorrow,'" recalled Berris. "After conferring briefly, they said: 'Yes, we want to do it.'""It was a freezing-cold night in Chicago, yet the majority of the audience chose to stay instead of going home and having their ticket money refunded," she continued. "When they were finally allowed back into the theater, there was only a faint whiff of the tear gas there. But it was a lot stronger up on the stage, where the acrobats were doing some very difficult tasks that required plenty of energy and therefore air into one's body. They got a lot of credit from the audience and the media which reported on it afterwards."The incident, not entirely unexpected given all the "misperceptions the two people had harbored towards each other", nonetheless allowed Berris to see the commonalities."There's a phrase in the American theater: 'The show must go on.' The Chinese decision was very much in that flavor," said Berris, who has a BA in Chinese studies from the University of Michigan and whose Chinese name, Bai Lijuan, translates into "white jasmine".However, this "jasmine" was no fragile flower, but a workaholic and multitasker who over the past half century has brought hundreds of Chinese delegations to the US, in addition to traveling to China more than 160 times, taking with her various groups from governors, mayors and a Supreme Court justice, to business leaders, scholars and tennis players."I was driven by a strong desire to bring people together," said Berris, who reputedly drove her staff crazy in those early days by insisting that they carry electric tea kettles so that the Chinese delegation members would always be able to have hot water in their rooms. She also went to great lengths to make sure that the hotel chef knew how to make xifan, or Chinese rice soup, the way the Chinese would like to have it, with no butter or salt.In February, 1979, one month after China and the US normalized their relationship, Deng Xiaoping, the then vice-premier, visited a number of US cities. Berris was tasked by the State Department to coordinate Chinese press activities throughout the trip.In Simonton, Texas, while watching a rodeo show, the Chinese leader symbolically donned a cowboy hat, wowing the world press that was present, including more than 30 journalists from China."It was a real surprise. … Deng had the intuition to sense what would play well for the American public, and had the confidence to do it, " said Berris, who was also responsible for organizing and running the 1980 delegation of provincial leaders to the United States, headed by Xi Zhongxun, the late father of Chinese President Xi Jinping, and then governor of Guangdong province."He was a very thoughtful man," said Berris, who calls herself "a stronger believer in engagement and exchanges", and who, at a farewell party at the end of Deng's visit, arranged for a Chinese journalist to sing the song Getting to Know You from the 1950s American musical film The King and I, joined on stage by the American security personnel involved in the landmark visit."Up till recently, there have always been people on both sides who felt that a strong, stable relationship between the two countries was paramount," she said. "Unfortunately, that coalition is fraying, and the relationship, at least on the governmental level, is spiraling downward at a dizzying rate. But I still believe in the importance of the relationship and that there are things that both sides could and should do."What we are trying to do here at the National Committee is to work against this narrative that has somehow grown up, that engagement has been counterproductive and has not been positive for the United States," she said. "Engagement is essential for all of us. It must be done in a reciprocal, mutually beneficial and constructive way. But this idea of decoupling, of minimizing the amount of contact between the two peoples, is a path toward disaster."Talking about the Chinese ping-pong players of the 1972 visit, Berris said: "They didn't conform to Americans' image of Communists, they didn't act like that. They were fun, playful, just as enthusiastic as any group of young people might be."When it was time to say goodbye, Berris found herself futilely fighting back tears, despite the presence of a big swarm of reporters."The next year, when I visited China, people would come up to me and say: 'Are you that crying girl?'"

                Playing with technology
            </a>
            <p>
                Thought-provoking stage productions abound at the second installment of Inside-Out Theater's Tech-Art Festival, Xing Wen reports. To a backdrop of pulsating sounds, actors arrive onstage with beams of torchlight piercing the pitch-blackness. From just the wordless cast's body language and the myriad flashing lights in a plethora of different colors, surprisingly, it's easy for the audience to comprehend the experimental play's storyline. The play, Light, is an original production of Ad Infinitum, an ensemble from Bristol in the United Kingdom. Inspired by the former US National Security Agency operative Edward Snowden's shocking revelations about the Prism surveillance program, the drama troupe uses innovative storytelling and experimental styles to conjure the image of a dystopian future, where a totalitarian regime monitors the thoughts of its citizens through high-tech implants. It's designed to provoke the audience into thinking about the consequences that can stem from the misapplication of science and technology. Recently, the play was staged at the Inside-Out Theater in Beijing's Haidian district as a part of the venue's second Tech-Art Festival, which ran from Sept 5 to 15. During the 10-day event, audiences watched domestic and foreign theater works, all focusing on how people's daily lives have been, and will be, influenced by the development of science and technology, especially the rapid growth of digital media. The event enabled attendees to join silent disco parties, dance workshops, a physical theater master class or various salons where playwrights, directors and data engineers shared their reflections on the connection between science and art. Located close to Zhongguancun Science Park, the theater launched the festival in a bid to explore the practicality of cooperating with high-tech service providers to create more science-themed art. "By associating with such a trending topic, the festival also helps to expand our reach among younger generations," says Man Ding, artistic director of the theater. He says that the diverse range of drama plays during the festival all shone a spotlight on technology-related phenomena, which showed the ability to view a topic from multiple angles. At the same time, hosting the festival improved the program planning and management skills of the theater staff. Man has set a long-term goal for the annual event to grow into a theater carnival where original plays will be staged by domestic artists and audiences will always enjoy a refreshing experience. This year, a step forward has been taken toward that, as two original plays - created by the theater staff and a collection of young artists - made their debut at the festival. "We always encourage domestic theater practitioners to make some noise here as after witnessing the rapid development of science and technology in China over the past two decades, they do have perceptions which differ from those of foreign artists," says Man. He points out that due to the mainstream market's low level of tolerance for mistakes, it's hard for novice or untried playwrights to find a production group to cooperate with, or a platform from which to present their works. In this sense, the theater is willing to provide these for them. "Fledgling artists are not going to mature overnight. They need the support from not only an experienced production unit, but also from a willing audience," says Man."We'd like to offer them a relatively tolerant atmosphere here at the Tech-Art Festival, allowing them to make their novel ideas a reality." Hu Xuanyi, a 25-year-old playwright, is among the beneficiaries of the event, with the theater acting as an incubator for her first commercial show, Still Barking. An experienced director, actors and actresses were invited by the theater to support Hu's show, which raised the curtain on this year's festival. "It's a rare opportunity for me to turn my script into a commercial play," says Hu, a graduate of journalism from Sichuan Normal University who later got her master's degree in drama from a university in Taiwan. "During the whole process, I realized how important it is to efficiently communicate with my partners. I also learned how to appropriately manage trivial matters that, back in my college years, I wouldn't have cared much about, such as placing seats and adjusting the temperature level of the air conditioners." Inspired by the fact that her father installed a monitoring camera at home to ensure her grandmother's safety, Hu wrote the script of Still Barking. In the play, an anthropomorphic camera observes, and tells the story of, an aged widow's subtle changes in her mind and behaviors in response to the surveillance. Speaking about the play, an audience member said: "The show reminds me that the nanny cameras we use to express our love and care for the elders might sometimes turn out to be a ruthless invasion of their privacy." And the 48-year-old audience member after watching the play's debut performance on Sept 5, added: "We should lean more on face-to-face conversations than on interactions through electromagnetic waves." He Qi, 27, a graduate of Chinese language and literature from Fudan University who later obtained her master's degree in drama and theater at a university in Taiwan, took inspiration from modern day smartphone and internet addiction to create her one-woman show for the festival. The play, titled JPEG, portrays a member of an online community who gets extremely upset after being informed that the website that hosts the community will be shut down; an online dating app addict who sinks into a state of torpor in the face of an overwhelming number of flirty messages; and a divorced woman who tries to pretend that she's fine without her ex-husband on her WeChat Moments ... each exposing the negative side of people's constant attachment to social media. "Over recent years, social media and short-video-streaming apps have spread widely throughout the country. We are so accustomed to the existence of our smartphones that sometimes we don't know how to express ourselves without one," she explains. "Some of the stories in my play are based on my personal experience, as I do relate to the topic." Man adds that we should look at technology-centered subjects dialectically and take the responsibility to discuss how the advancement of science and technology influences social structure and our humanity. "We must be alert to any irresistible changes and delve into them, which will allow us to deliver a rational judgment or decision in face of such uncertainties in the future," he adds.

                China's Xu Xi dances into spotlight
            </a>
            <p>
                Chinese dancer lines up on top British TV showDancer Xu Xi says she hopes to become a role model and fly the flag for Chinese dancers overseas when she joins the cast for the latest season of the hugely popular BBC primetime entertainment show Strictly Come Dancing this weekend.This year's staging of the series which inspired the international hit Dancing with the Stars will be the 17th, and in an interview with China Daily, the 28-year-old from Huaihua in Hunan Province said she feels a sense of responsibility as the show's first Chinese dancer."I am very proud to be Chinese," said Xu. "With this opportunity, I hope to be a role model, I want to present an accurate image of Chinese dancers. I hope to prove that I did not get to where I am due to luck, but due to my devotion to this profession, and my hard work."Xu - who goes by the name of Nancy Xu in the United Kingdom - said it was a "dream come true" when she was officially announced as a cast member on the show, known to fans as Strictly, in August.The show sees professional dancers paired with celebrities, who compete in a series of televised dance contests in front of a panel of judges. It is consistently one of the best-performing series on British television, averaging around 9.5 million viewers per episode.Strictly is also notorious for placing pressure on cast members, who contend with an unforgiving schedule and intense media scrutiny. Several previous contestants have experienced relationship troubles during filming.But Xu says her boyfriend - Italian singer and dancer Mikee Introna Michele -- has been nothing but supportive since she was selected for the show."I'm not concerned about all that other stuff," Xu said. "I'm just focused and I want to do my best. It's the best stage in the whole world. And it's the same with all the other performers, we want to show the world that we belong there."Xu will not be paired with a celebrity partner in her debut season, and will instead take part in the group performances of each episode. She said she hopes to prove herself and earn a shot at couples dancing in future series."I just have to stay ready - you never know when it will come," she said.Xu says she takes motivation from knowing her parents will be cheering her on from China this weekend."When I told my mom that I got the show she started crying," said Xu. "She told me, 'you left home at a very young age and each step has been challenging. You only share your good news, never your difficulties. Finally, your dreams have come true! I am so happy for you'."Xu said she rarely battles with nerves before a performance, and attributes the majority of her success to hard work rather than innate talent. She started dancing at the age of eight, and quickly showed promise, gaining entry to Guangdong Dance School in Guangzhou three years later."I have always had a passion for dancing since I was little, but I never really made the decision to do it professionally, it just came to me," she said.Xu racked up some solid results at international competitions in her teens and early 20s, reaching the finals of four major Latin dance championships between 2010 and 2013, but she said performing on stage in front of an audience, rather in competitions, brings out the best in her."It's the live band, the music, the audience, everything - I love it all," she said.Xu broke into showbusiness in China in 2014, when she competed on two televised shows similar to Strictly. In 2015, Xu's talents took her to Broadway in New York and London's West End in live dance show Burn the Floor.Xu said she has not set goals beyond Strictly, believing instead that new opportunities will present themselves if she keeps applying herself."I don't have any particular things in mind for the future," Xu said. "I am ambitious, of course, but I believe if you work hard you get the luck you deserve."
