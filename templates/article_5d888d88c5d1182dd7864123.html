                Former vice-chairman of Kweichow Moutai arrested
            </p>
            <p>
                Liu Zili, former vice-chairman of Kweichow Moutai Group, has been arrested by Guizhou Provincial People's Procuratorate on suspicion of accepting bribes, according to Supreme People's Procuratorate on Friday.The case is under further investigation, according to the SPP.He was recently placed under investigation for "serious violations of Party disciplines and laws" by Guizhou Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and Guizhou Provincial Commission of Supervision.According to Guizhou Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection, he didn't truthfully report his personal matters and resisted the Party organization.It said he took advantage of his job to get others promoted and then accepted huge bribes either paid in cash or kind.Moreover, he abused power to help others to illegally obtain the management right of Moutai wines, and traded his power with sex services, according to the SPP.He was expelled from the Party.Earlier this month, Yuan Renguo, former chairman of Kweichow Moutai Group, pleaded guilty for alleged bribery during the court hearing.He confessed to his crimes and showed remorse on the court trial and the court verdict will be issued at a later date.Yuan, 63, was suspected of using his job to gain benefits for others and accepted bribes in return. In June, he was charged with bribery by Guiyang city People's Procuratorate, Guizhou province.

                Former Trump campaign manager uncooperative at House hearing
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - Corey Lewandowski, former campaign manager for US President Donald Trump, showed an uncooperative attitude on Tuesday at a congressional hearing on alleged presidential obstruction of justice and abuse of power."We as a nation would be better served if elected officials like you concentrated your efforts to combat the true crises facing our country as opposed to going down rabbit holes like this hearing," Lewandowski said in his opening remarks before the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee.Lewandowski was the first witness of what some Democrats have called an impeachment investigation against Trump.The hearing came less than two months after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified about his report on a 22-month probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election and Trump's actions to obstruct the inquiry.As the hearing began, Lewandowski demanded that Democrats provide him a copy of the report before reading directly from it and making it clear that he wouldn't say much beyond Mueller's findings."He's filibustering," said Jerrold Nadler, chair of the Judiciary Committee and a New York Democrat.Trump praised Lewandowski's performance on Twitter.A public version of the Mueller report released earlier this year stated that there was no evidence that Trump's campaign conspired with Moscow during the 2016 election but didn't offer any conclusions about the obstruction case.There were two episodes in which Trump asked Lewandowski to direct then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit Mueller's investigation, according to the report.The uncooperative attitude from Lewandowski was expected as the White House had tried to limit the scope of his testimony.In a letter to the House panel on Monday, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone said that Lewandowski could not testify about conversations with Trump after he became president or with his senior advisers."The White House has directed Mr. Lewandowski not to provide information about such communications beyond the information provided in the portions of the Report that have already been disclosed to the Committee," according to the letter.The White House also ordered two other witnesses, former Trump White House aides Rob Porter and Rick Dearborn, not to testify at Tuesday's hearing.Lewandowski, 45, served as campaign manager for Trump's 2016 campaign from Jan 2015 to June 2016. He is mulling a run for the US Senate.

                British PM slammed in court battle over suspension of parliament
            </a>
            <p>
                 LONDON - Prime Minister Boris Johnson came under a stinging attack Wednesday on the second day of a court case to decide if he had unlawfully suspended the British Parliament.Britain's highest court, the Supreme Court in London, is hearing two separate appeals linked to the way Johnson prorogued, or suspended parliament for five weeks.Hours after the British government's own lawyer in the case argued that legal cases from the past showed the suspension of parliament had been used by British governments to gain a legislative and political advantage.James Eadie, the barrister representing the British government argued that courts do not have the right to rule the suspension of parliament unlawful because Johnson was using a prerogative power that is not subject to an adjudication by the courts.Aidan O'Neill, representing Joanna Cherry, MP for the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP), used his closing speech to attack Johnson.Cherry and the other parliamentarians first took the case to the Scottish Court of Session, the highest court in Scotland which ruled that the suspension of the British Parliament by Johnson had been unlawful.In a reference to Johnson, he told 11 of the most senior judges in Britain: "Rather than allowing lies to triumph, listen to the angels of your better nature and rule that this prorogation is unlawful and an abuse of power which has been entrusted to the government."He said Johnson's government was showing itself unworthy of trust as it used the powers of its office in a manner that is corrosive of the constitution and destructive of the system of parliamentary representative democracy on which the polity of the UK is founded.O'Neill said it appeared the prime minister's actions in proroguing parliament has had the intent and effect of preventing parliament, impeding parliament, from holding the government politically to account at a time when the government is taking decisions which will have constitutional and irreversible impacts on the country.Legal and media commentators following the case described O'Neill's speech as the most passionate and outspoken of the four submissions heard so far by the court.The court will conclude the case Thursday, with a ruling to come later.Meanwhile Simon Byrne, the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland, said Wednesday his police officers could be killed if they had to patrol checkpoints along the border with the Irish Republic in the event of a hard Brexit.Byrne told the London-based Guardian newspaper he opposed officers having to patrol checkpoints on a physical border, adding his officers who were already under huge strain would be placed in danger policing any checkpoints.Byrne said: "People do not want a return to the images of 20-30 years ago, where history shows us that far more police officers and 20,000 soldiers could not protect the border, so I doubt we are going to do it now."He described how the 500-kilometer border was porous, with half a field in one country, and half in another.They want to carry on with the fact they can take the kids to school without going through checkpoints and all that sort of anxiety.He warned there could be "civil protest where people from the farming community, for example, block roads."We are also looking at the potential for protest in different forms, depending on which community sees Brexit in terms of winners and losers," added Byrne.

                US expels two of Cuba's UN diplomats, citing 'influence operations'
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - The Trump administration on Thursday ordered the expulsion from the United States of two members of Cuba's delegation to the United Nations and restricted travel of the remaining mission members to Manhattan, drawing strong condemnation from Havana.In an announcement just days before world leaders gather for the annual UN General Assembly, the US State Department accused the two Cuban diplomats of trying to "conduct influence operations" harmful to US national security but did not elaborate on the accusations or release their names.It was the latest sign of deteriorating US relations with Cuba, since US President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, which has rolled back the detente initiated by his predecessor Barack Obama."The Department of State today notified the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the United States requires the imminent departure of two members of Cuba's Permanent Mission to the United Nations for abusing their privileges of residence," said Morgan Ortagus, the department spokesperson, in a statement."This is due to their attempts to conduct influence operations against the United States," the spokesperson added, without providing further details on the issue.Besides, the US required Cuba's UN mission's travel should "essentially be restricted to the island of Manhattan," according to the statement.Agencies-Xinhua

                It's time Hong Kong residents helped police end violence and restore order
            </a>
            <p>
                After more than 100 days of chaos, many of the original reasons and excuses of the demonstrators in Hong Kong no longer hold water. The truth has gradually emerged and the nature of the chaos has become increasingly clear.If the demonstrators were protesting against just the planned amendment to the extradition law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, their aim was achieved almost three months ago.So why did they prolong the demonstrations, turning it from one of “peace, reason and nonviolence” to mayhem? Perhaps the organizers and supporters of the violent demonstrations had other schemes in mind from the very beginning.Past protests in Hong Kong were largely peaceful, and ended when the purpose was met. But the on-going demonstrations have lasted more than 100 days, and it seems the demonstrations will not stop until the insurrectionists realize the ultimate goal of destabilizing the SAR and destroying its economy, and in the process destabilize the country and check its development.The nature of the protests has changed; they have become increasingly violent and complex. So it is time to abandon our illusions, prepare for the worst-case scenario and implement long-term and targeted measures in a bid to avoid the worst-case scenario.The most urgent task now is to end the violence and restore order. It has become clear that the turbulence in Hong Kong is neither about freedom and democracy nor about human rights. Nor is it about the Hong Kong SAR government cracking down on people’s rights and freedom.In essence, it is naked violence, and gross distortion and abuse of human rights and freedom, given that some of the violent acts of the radical demonstrators have crossed the bottom line of civil morality and rule of law. Yet some foreign media outlets are painting a different picture to smear the SAR and China.To end the on-going violence, we have to rely on the Hong Kong police force. The Hong Kong police, on their part, have to enforce the law professionally, effectively and strictly, and use appropriate means to end the violence and chaos and defend the law.While supporting the police to take practical and effective measures to strictly enforce the law, we also expect Hong Kong residents to make efforts to end the violence and restore order. Expecting the Hong Kong government and the police alone to restore social order would be akin to asking for the sky, for no society can maintain peace and order without the active support of the people.Hong Kong residents have suffered a lot, and they all want the violence to end, and law and order to be restored as soon as possible. A society gets its strength from the public, and it is time Hong Kong residents ceased to be passive onlookers and instead made efforts to protect their city and country.As for Chinese compatriots on the Chinese mainland and overseas, especially netizens, they should control their emotions, and refrain from doing anything that would make antagonist foreign forces happy and increase the pain of the Chinese people, because by so doing they would deal another blow to Hong Kong residents. In the past, whenever the country faced trouble, Hong Kong compatriots were the first to extend a hand, and we will never forget their huge contributions.The chaos in the SAR has pained all Chinese. No country loves the SAR, expects it to further prosper and wants its residents to live and work in peace under the “one country, two systems” more than China. Some vested interests and foreign forces cannot bear to see the Chinese people prosper, so they are trying to create differences between the mainland and Hong Kong.We have to be alert and avoid falling into the trap set by the evil forces, and should help Hong Kong residents solve their problems. More important, we should not allow the on-going demonstrations to change our attitude toward our Hong Kong compatriots and lose confidence in their ability to overcome all odds. The Chinese nation has survived many a severe test in its 5,000-year history, and it is confident that Hong Kong compatriots will overcome the present exigency.The turmoil Hong Kong is facing is a challenge to the rule of law. If violence damages the social order beyond repair, Hong Kong as well as the country would suffer.The best way to safeguard the rule of law in Hong Kong is to make good use of the rule of law. So we should make full use all legal means, including the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR to safeguard the law and restore order in the SAR.The violence in Hong Kong is a test for the country’s Constitution and the Basic Law of the SAR. But only by resorting to the Constitution and the Basic Law can we pass this severe test, and restore the glory of Hong Kong.“One country, two systems” is a long-term national strategy, which the central government has always been serious about. “One country, two systems” has proved very successful in its 22-year-old history. And despite facing a severe challenge, the central government will continue to unswervingly implement “one country, two systems”.“One country, two systems” serves the interests of all stakeholders in Hong Kong. And anyone who tries to undermine “one country, two systems” is doomed to failure. The chaos in Hong Kong has exposed the true reason behind the West’s obsession with spreading Western-style human rights, freedom and democracy. Of course, the recent happenings, including the violent demonstrations, in Hong Kong should prompt us to analyze the problems and shortcomings in the implementation of “one country, two systems” and take effective measures to ensure it is implemented both in letter and spirit so as to guarantee its steady and sustained development.The author is director of Center for Hong Kong and Macao Research, Tsinghua University.
