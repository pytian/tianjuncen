                Rafa refutes claim money was his main motivation
            </p>
            <p>
                New Dalian Yifang head coach Rafa Benitez has hit back at claims from Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley that he only moved to China for the money, instead referring to the Chinese Super League side as his "best option".Having won praise for establishing the Magpies in the Premier League on a meager budget, Benitez left St James' Park after his contract ended in June to sign a two-and-a-half-year deal with Dalian reportedly worth around $14.5 million per year.That prompted Ashley to accuse the Spaniard of being motivated primarily by money and "taking the soft option".However, in an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Benitez responded to Ashley, saying he turned down several more lucrative offers while still under contract at Newcastle."I was not happy when he was talking about me leaving Newcastle because of the money," Benitez said."I said no to very, very big offers, and even last year, I was saying no to big offers. But I decided to stay because of the fans, the city and the potential."We were waiting for a solution at Newcastle which was not forthcoming. We had options (to go to different clubs) but when we had to decide, it was a very simple decision because Dalian was the best option we had."People were saying it was because of big money, but Dalian pushed really hard to get me and my staff, and we are really pleased because they showed so much interest."Benitez, a Champions League winner with Liverpool in 2005, said his decision to join Dalian was swayed by the club's commitment to investing in youth and training facilities, areas he felt were neglected at Newcastle."I am a professional and I want to win, but I also want to build something and leave a legacy," noted the 59-year-old."Dalian's training ground and its project with the youth system is amazing. This year, we are creating (soccer) schools for 6-10 year olds, bringing in coaches from Spain, so we will organize everything in terms of the academy and youth system."In coming to Dalian, Benitez is reunited with former players Marek Hamsik and Salomon Rondon, who played under the Spaniard at Napoli and Newcastle respectively.While the influx of established foreign stars to the CSL in recent years has turned many heads, Benitez stressed it is the league's homegrown players who hold the key to any success a team may have."The Chinese players make the difference, because there are eight of them on the pitch," said Benitez, citing CSL regulations restricting the number of imports on the field to three."The foreign players can win some games, but you have to be sure that the others keep you in the game. You can try to find the best foreign players, but the key is to have very good Chinese players with the right mentality."Semifinal loss Since taking over at Dalian on July 2, Benitez has seen the team climb from 10th to seventh in the CSL standings, although its CFA Cup progress was tempered by a 3-2 semifinal loss to Shanghai Shenhua on Monday night.Slovakian playmaker Hamsik headed home to break the deadlock for the host at Dalian Sports Center. However, a brace from former AC Milan and Roma forward Stephan El Shaarawy put Shenhua ahead 2-1 at the break.Substitute Giovanni Moreno slotted home to all but seal Shenhua's passage in the 61st minute, although Zheng Long's late strike made for a nervous final six minutes for the visitor.Meanwhile, back in northeast England, Newcastle looks like it is in for a season of prolonged struggle.The Magpies are already in the relegation zone after losing their opening two Premier League matches - to Arsenal and newly promoted Norwich City.XINHUA

                The picture of patience
            </a>
            <p>
                Earlier this year, photographer Chu Weimin spent a week in the far reaches of the Arctic where he waited for hours to capture the image that would win him the coveted 2019 Travel Photo prize from National Geographic, Li Yingxue reports.The dusk casts an otherworldly hue over the packed snow and frozen sea ahead. The cold bites through the layers of clothing, driven by an occasional wind so icy, it could cut glass. The weather burrows its way into the heart of the man, standing patiently, silently and staring into middle distance through the clouds formed by his warm breath hitting the frigid air.This was the third time that landscape photographer Chu Weimin, who also goes by the name of Thomas, had visited Greenland. But this was the first time that the 29-year-old had trained his lens on the remote northwesterly fishing town of Upernavik.With its population of around 1,000, Chu originally planned to stay just two days, but the lack of flights at that time of year forced him to extend his visit to a week.Fortune smiled, it seems, because on the last night of his trip, Chu found himself waiting on a slope near the remote conurbation's airport which had an expansive view of the colorful houses below. He found the ideal angle-where the structure, color and mood all aligned-it just needed one more thing. His stoicism was rewarded when a family of three appeared center frame. Click.Chu named the photo Winter in Greenland.

                Bilateral relations backlash feared after US president postpones visit to Denmark
            </a>
            <p>
                COPENHAGEN - Danish political pundits fear serious repercussions for the Danish-US relationship in the future after US President Donald Trump announced postponing his visit to Denmark in a Tweet Tuesday night.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksens has earlier clearly refused to discuss a possible sale of Greenland to the United States."Greenland is not for sale," said the prime minister," Greenland is not Danish. Greenland is Greenlandic. I persistently hope that it is not something that is seriously meant."In a follow-up post on the tweet, Trump acknowledged the Danish prime minister's "direct" rejection of his offer."....The Prime Minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the United States and Denmark by being so direct. I thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future!"Trump's cancellation comes as a surprise to Lene Balleby, head of communications at the Danish Royal House which had "no comment" to make about the postponement."The situation may seem unrealistic, but no matter how you turn and turn it, it is a problem for any sitting Danish government to get so skewed in the relationship with the country's most important allies," said Mirco Reimer-Elster, Denmark's TV 2 US analyst.Danish political pundits also fear the refusal to discuss the sale of Greenland with Trump might have serious repercussions for the Danish-US relationship in the future."It's not just about money. It is also about honor. If Trump succeeded in buying Greenland, he will then be included in the history books. So Greenland means something to him," says Svenning Dalgaard speaking to TV2."So Mr. Trump you have now decided to postpone your visit to Denmark. Why not just cancel? We are so busy with other things," tweeted Soeren Espersen, foreign ministry spokesperson of the right-wing Danish People's Party, in response to the US president.Trump was originally scheduled to visit Denmark from September 2 to 3.
