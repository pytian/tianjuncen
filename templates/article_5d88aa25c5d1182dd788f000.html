                Former US ambassador urges China, US to work together
            </a>
            <p>
                CHICAGO - Former US Ambassador to China Max Baucus has urged China and the United States to work together for the benefit of both."We desperately need each other in so many ways," both economically and geopolitically，Baucus said in a recent interview with Xinhua. "There are areas that we can cooperate. Our future is more assured if we do a better job for our people.""There's distrust on both sides," which is a big issue between the two countries, Baucus said. "Both countries want to trade more or to invest more in their own countries and also with each other. And there is some competition in new industries of new technologies: the AI, big data and machine learning and so forth."To solve this, Baucus suggests the two countries sit down and talk. "It's very hard work. But it must be done."Serving as US ambassador from 2014 to 2017, Baucus knows China well. Though there's a big cultural difference, "Chinese people are just like American people. They have the same hopes and desires, the concerns.""Both people, both countries want food on the table, decent income, education for the kids, decent healthcare, clean air and clean water ... basically we all live their lives and pursue their dreams," he said."I love Chinese people," Baucus told Xinhua. "Chinese people are energetic. They are practical, pragmatic, like to get things done."Baucus enjoyed his job as the US ambassador to China very much. "The reward of working on the relationship between the United States and China is so important for the wellbeing of our kids and our grandkids.""I try to be an ambassador both ways ... I also wanted to build bridges to the United States in China. That was even more important for me," he said. Enditem

                HK economic reform trailblazer dies at 85
            </a>
            <p>
                Tsang Hin-chi, who was born into poverty, created a business empire and became a pioneer in China's industrial development, is remembered for his patriotism and outstanding contributions to the country's development.Tsang died on Friday in the town where he was born, Meizhou, Guangdong province. He was 85 years old.His death was announced by Goldlion Group, the menswear company Tsang founded in 1971 that became an iconic brand.Tsang was one of the most respected entrepreneurs in Hong Kong, taking the lead in investing on the Chinese mainland during the early days of reform and opening-up in the 1970s. He also provided advice to the mainland as it worked to create the Chinese miracle.Tsang's outstanding contribution to China's advancement earned him a medal of recognition as a "reform pioneer" in 2018. He was one of only four Hong Kong residents - among a total of 100 - honored with the title by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor expressed deep sorrow on Friday over Tsang's death. She called him a trailblazer who contributed to China's economic reform that started 41 years ago.Lam added that Tsang's efforts contributed to Hong Kong's smooth transition in its return to China in 1997.Wang Zhimin, director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong, described Tsang as "an elder of noble character and high prestige".Wang praised Tsang as a dedicated patriot and prominent member of Hong Kong's business community.As a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress - the country's top legislature - from 1994 to 2008, Tsang performed his duties to promote democracy, the rule of law and the development of industry and commerce on the mainland, Wang said.Choy So-yuk, a Hong Kong deputy to the NPC, said she was saddened to learn of Tsang's death. She spoke of the philanthropic entrepreneur's patriotism, noting that when NPC deputies visited impoverished areas on the mainland, Tsang would donate to the construction of new facilities there.Another NPC deputy in Hong Kong, Ng Leung-sing, recalled that although Tsang became seriously ill in his later years, he continued to attend celebrations marking the mother land's achievements. His patriotism became a model for the younger generation, Ng said.Albert Au Yeung, a senior Hong Kong journalist who interviewed Tsang over 10 years ago, recalled him as an easygoing man who was well disposed to sharing his thoughts with journalists. Even in those days, Tsang had health problems, but he carried on with his charity work for the country, Au Yeung said.Tsang also organized numerous media tours to the mainland to help journalists in the special administrative region to understand China's development, he said.Meixian county, where Tsang was born in 1934, is now a district of the city of Meizhou, Guangdong province. Tsang moved to Hong Kong in 1968 and there started building his empire making clothes in his small workshop.In the late 1970s, Tsang became one of the first investors when the Chinese mainland declared itself open for business. He suspended his plans to set up companies in the United States and moved his production base to his hometown in Guangdong.At the same time, he started funding developments in education, aviation, sports, science and healthcare, contributing more than HK$1.2 billion ($153 million) to the mainland over the past 40 years.Tsang supported China's national sovereignty over Hong Kong. More than a decade before the transition took place, Tsang was appointed as a member of the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee in the 1980s.He was among the first to be awarded Hong Kong's Grand Bauhinia Medal, in 1997 - the highest award under Hong Kong's honors system.Tsang was elected a member of the 8th NPC's Standing Committee in 1994 and served three consecutive terms, until 2008. After his retirement, he continued to follow the developments on the mainland and Hong Kong.Tsang spoke out during the illegal "Occupy Central" movement in Hong Kong in 2014, cautioning that the city needed stability to stay prosperous."The people of Hong Kong should show love for the city and oppose those thugs, so that we can all live and work in peace and contentment. Those people who arbitrarily vent their tempers and do whatever they want, did not realize that they were breaking the law," he said.He called on young people in Hong Kong to understand more about their society, about the Hong Kong SAR, and about their motherland China.
