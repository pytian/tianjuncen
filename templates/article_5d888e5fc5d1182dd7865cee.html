                Servier and Sanofi join hand fighting depression in China
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Pharmaceutical companies of Servier China and Sanofi China have signed an exclusive strategic cooperation agreement for the new antidepressant marketed as Valdoxan.Sanofi China is fully responsible for the marketing and medical information promotion of the unique adult depression treatment developed by Servier.Both companies will work with China's leading experts in the field of mental health to launch an awareness-raising campaign known as "Hand in Hand to Cure Depression, Lighting Up the Future," which aims to integrate the advantages of the two sides' resources to further enhance awareness of the disease and its treatment.According to the World Health Organization, more than 300 million people worldwide suffer depression .In China, the prevalence of depression stands at 6.8%, with more than 95 million people suffering other conditions like anxiety."A lack of joy and happiness is the most typical symptom of depression. Worse, Asian people mostly being conservative and restrained people are less likely to seek mental treatment for fear of potential discrimination and social stigma," said Professor Wu Wenyuan of Tongji Hospital, affiliated with Tongji University.According to her, more than 90% of the patients in China are left untreated."Many with initial symptoms are reluctant to receive professional treatment. That, however, would affect the patient's work and social ability. Without intervention, the state of pleasure loss will continue regardless of the degree of the severity. A proper understanding of the problem is the first step for the patients to seek professional help and get back to a normal life," she added.In addition to the lack of pleasure and low mood, people with depression often suffer abnormalities in body weight, appetite, sleep and behavioral activities, experts said.In severe cases, they even cause self-harm and suicide. Depression not only brings mental pain to the patient, but also causes a heavy financial burden on the patient, and the patient feels no sense of happiness.International studies showed depression is expected to be the second-largest disease burden after cardiovascular disease by 2020.Servier China and Sanofi China together are bringing to China the new antidepressant, which can help alleviate depressive symptoms, significantly improve the lack of pleasure, directly hitting the core of depression.Since being approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2009, the innovative drug has been approved in 99 countries worldwide and listed as a first-line antidepressant by several domestic and foreign guidelines.Fang Yiru, a senior mental health specialist with Shanghai Mental Health Center affiliated with Tongji University said: "Following the whole process of standardized treatment, and good drug compliance can effectively reduce the probability of recurrence, effectively reduce problems such as sexual dysfunction, gastrointestinal side effects and weight gain, and help patients return to normal life as soon as possible."

                    Project seeks uniformity in treatment of heart disease, China's No 1 killer
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                A nationwide project involving nearly 100 hospitals was launched on Saturday, aiming to standardize medical treatment for heart attacks and provide more uniformity between various doctors, as well as better long-term management of patients.The project is the latest effort by the China Cardiovascular Association to reduce the rate of rehospitalization and death among heart attack patients - whose five-year survival rate is worse than cancer, experts say - and promote better diagnoses and treatment of heart disease.Heart failure is the serious, often late-stage, manifestation of cardiovascular disease, China's No 1 killer. Its incidence has risen year-on-year.Nearly 1 percent of Chinese adults have had heart attacks, said Zhou Jingmin, a professor at Zhongshan Hospital affiliated with Fudan University in Shanghai and one of the leading experts at the China Heart Failure Center.The project was launched in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, on the third anniversary of the association, of which the center is a part.Two main challenges in the clinical treatment of the disease lie in patients' low compliance with doctors' orders after discharge from the hospital, which results in a rehospitalization rate within three months of nearly 25 percent, and doctors giving treatment plans based on their own experience rather than a uniform procedure, Zhou said."As the average age of China's population continues to rise, the incidence of chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity, are also the rise, and the prevalence of heart failure will increase accordingly," said Huo Yong, vice-president of the alliance and chief physician in the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at Peking University First Hospital. He added that the association will carry out campaigns, including initiatives to raise public awareness.Zhou said the yearlong project, sponsored by Servier, a French pharmaceutical company, will collect data on 1,200 patients and their corresponding treatment plans from doctors nationwide. Top experts in the field will review them, and the doctors responsible for the good outcomes will tour the country to give speeches about their cases, which will finally be collected as a book to be distributed to doctors."Training from top experts and case studies will also be included in the project to better standardize the treatment plans of doctors, especially the young ones," Zhou said.Also, at least 8,000 patients will be recruited to report their heart rates and medication on a daily basis to the doctor in charge through a smartphone application, so that their health conditions can be continuously updated and seen by the doctors."It may make a difference in patient management," Zhou said. "A patient undergoes a vulnerable period of three months after being discharged. Such tracking and interaction - rather than losing contact between doctor and patient, as happens typically now - will help the patient keep his or her heart rate at a desirable level."

                    Campaign targeting chronic disease treatment launched
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                A campaign promoting family doctors' treatment of patients with chronic disease was on Tuesday officially launched in Beijing.Initiated by the China Association of Health Promotion and Education, the project is sponsored by Servier China, the French pharmaceutical's Chinese arm, and will be implemented by Beijing Archimedes Medical Science, a healthcare-focused IT service provider.The project aims to improve community hospital care with the introduction of digital and personalized tools. The campaign is aimed particularly at improving healthcare and health management for chronic disease patients and seniors.High blood pressure, diabetes, and coronary heart disease patients are the three largest patient groups in China's community hospitals, accounting for nearly one third of the total patient population.The high blood pressure control rate among patients however is only 13.8 percent in China. For diabetes it is even lower, at 3.08 percent, according to project organizers.China has been building a tiered medical care system since 2009. In this system large and specialist hospitals take care of complicated and severe illnesses, while community hospitals treat chronic disease and provide health-management services. It is therefore important to improve chronic disease care in community hospitals, to provide patients with better medical care and help them establish healthy lifestyles, organizers said.The project will use mobile internet technologies and will establish health-management call centers, with the aim of enabling family doctors to conduct one-to-one, follow-up telephone interviews with patients, and provide personalized health management to those whose conditions are poorly controlled, such as those with high blood pressure, diabetes and coronary heart disease.Patients will be able to send home test results, such as readings of blood glucose, blood pressure, and frequencies of angina attacks, to their family doctors over the phone, so that the medical professionals can give medical and lifestyle guidance online.A competition will be held to encourage family doctors to submit cases and share their experiences, with the aim of enhancing doctors' professional skills and abilities, organizers said.Wang Lingling, deputy secretary-general of the association, said she believes the development and application of innovative tools in community hospitals are helpful in controlling chronic disease.Bradley Lloyd, an executive with Servier, said the company's disease care solutions in China focus on chronic disease, and is proud to take part in the project.

                    Pharma giant meets with healthcare startups in Shanghai
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                French pharmaceutical company Servier on Wednesday met with Chinese healthcare startups in Shanghai to explore potential partnerships.The meeting also dealt with the development of therapeutic solutions to serve patient needs in China and other countries.The network and expertise of Servier, which entered China four decades ago, will help local startups to further develop and distribute solutions domestically, and support them in exporting products to the international market, said David Guez, general manager of Servier's e-health department, WeHealth.WeHealth works in cooperation with startup partners to create medical services and devices that improve patient care, capitalizing on company expertise in cardiovascular and metabolic fields in China and worldwide.Guez said that there have been several results of such partnerships in Europe and the US over the the last two years, and that company aims to develop similar collaborations in China."We can also assist a local startup to partner with a counterpart in a foreign country, designing new products or services combining their respective strengths," said Stephane Mascarau, general manager of Servier China.Guez said internet and AI technologies, including machine learning and deep learning, have made rapid progress in China in recent years. Servier therefore believe that it is the right time in China, when the country's healthcare reform continues to deepen, to avail of AI in producing new healthcare solutions."Doctors at primary community hospitals will assume more workload of diagnosing patients than ever before, and AI will be a wonderful tool to function in pre-diagnosis," said Mascarau.Zeng Mingfa, founder and CEO of Beijing Kang Information Technology, said that the startup hopes that Servier's network of patients and doctors at home and abroad will help it reach a bigger market.The startup's products, wearable devices to monitor blood pressure around the clock and smart watches to measure heartbeat and blood pressure, are available in the domestic market.

                    Type 2 diabetes treatment to hit Chinese market
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Servier China and Mitsubishi Tanabe Group has recently signed an exclusive strategic agreement to promote the type 2 diabetes drug Tenelia. Servier China will provide support for the drug's pre-market work in Chinese mainland and be responsible for the post-market medical promotion of the leading international hypoglycemic drug to bring one more highly efficient hypoglycemic treatment to the vast number of type 2 diabetes patients in China, and meet the need for personalized high-quality innovative drug treatment among different patients.The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Chinese adults has reached 10.9%. If left unchecked, the number of patients suffering from diabetes in China will increase to 150 million by 2040. The rate of diagnosis and treatment is only about a third, and more than half of patients who are treated do not reach the level of blood sugar control recommended by physicians. Thus, further effective glucose reduction is still the primary goal of diabetes prevention and control.Hypoglycemia is understood to be one of the most common adverse reactions, significantly increasing the risk of microvascular disease and large vascular disease. Among people with type 2 diabetes in China, the prevalence of nephropathy is 30-50%, an average reduction of 16 years compared to normal life expectancy and a three-fold increase in the risk of death."Kidney function, hypoglycemia and weight gain, which appear to be irrelevant, are a vicious cycle that hamper blood sugar levels," said Professor Ji Linong from the Department of Endocrinology at Peking University People's Hospital. "Because hypoglycemia and weight gain are among the factors that affect compliance, renal insufficiency affects the choice of hypoglycemic drugs, while substandard blood sugar can accelerate the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Ultimately, it creates a heavy burden on patients.Considering treatment objectives, preventing complications and improving quality of life, taking the individualized treatment needs of patients as the core consideration is increasingly becoming the standard for the development of treatment strategies for diabetes patients."In recent years, the advantages of DPP-4 inhibitor in single-drug and combined therapy have gradually grown in prominence. DPP-4 can inactivate glucagon like peptide-1, a hormone excreted from the gastrointestinal tract in response to food ingestion. It can improve the multiple pathophysiological mechanism of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and it is safe, efficient and widely used. It has also successfully deciphered the malignancy of the blood sugar standard and become the selected drug recommended by the guidelines for first line and dual-drug treatment.

            <p class="style-content">
                Chronic diseases account for 87.2% of all deaths in China. Deaths from cardiovascular disease outnumber deaths from tumors and other diseases, accounting for more than 40% of deaths from diseases. The death rate from cardiovascular disease in China continues to climb.Ge Junbo, a member of the CPPCC National Committee and President of the China Cardiovascular Association, said: "The overall improvement of cardiovascular disease awareness and scientific prevention and control in China is urgent."According to the latest figures from the National Centre for Cardiovascular Diseases, there are 290 million people with cardiovascular disease in China, including 270 million with hypertension, 11 million with coronary heart disease and 10 million with heart failure.Huo Yong with the Heart Center of the First Hospital at Peking University and vice president of the association, said: "The cardiovascular disease family not only causes patients endless pain, but also creates a huge burden on patients’families as well as the society."In order to curb the problem and promote the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, the association and Servier China signed a strategic cooperation agreement for hypertension, coronary heart disease, heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases. They will carry out four major cooperative projects to improve the overall disease prevention and control.Some studies have confirmed that the application of new internet technology can greatly improve the blood pressure compliance. Facing the current situation of low blood pressure compliance in China, the association has joined hands with Servier China to launch the E•START – China blood pressure control project for Chinese hypertension patients.The internet will be used to carry out blood pressure investigation, provide patient education and drug guidance, strengthen the concept of medical blood pressure management, help patients with high blood pressure to reach acceptable standards, and improve the compliance rate.Sun Ningling from the Department of Cardiology at Peking University People's Hospital said at the launch ceremony: "Through Jingdong and WeChat, two major Chinese internet application platforms, the E-START project will be a full closed-loop or semi-closed-loop model for patient consultation, prescriptions, drug purchase, patient education and patient teaching and other links. It will explore the mechanism to optimize patient management."One thousand doctors will enter the Jingdong internet hospital or E•START project exclusive to a WeChat public account, using live and educational classrooms to address 20,000 people with hypertension, reminding them to take medication, receive follow-up and record blood preServier's partnership with the China Cardiovascular Association dates back four years to the founding of the China Cardiovascular Association. The patient-first concept has become the cornerstone of close cooperation between the two sides and brought health benefits to patients with cardiovascular disease. At the meeting and in recognition of the 40 years of commitment, Ge and Huo, respectively, conferred the titles of "Outstanding contribution to cardiovascular disease prevention and public welfare enterprises in China" and "Pioneer of public welfare in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases in China" to Stephane Mascarau, General Manager of Servier China.He became the first foreign charity ambassador for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases in China.Mascarau said: "Servier is one of the first multinational pharmaceutical companies to enter China and in 2019 we celebrate the 40th anniversary of our activities in the country. The honors given to us by the China Cardiovascular Association offer recognition and encouragement, making Servier China's 40th anniversary an even more historic moment.""Servier China acknowledged the challenges facing China today with increasing rates of cardiovascular disease. As a company we are fully committed to supporting initiatives that raise disease awareness and control in order to improve the quality and length of life for patients suffering with these debilitating and chronic conditions. We are very grateful to the China Cardiovascular Association for providing us the opportunity to continue our work together," he added.

                International independent pharmaceutical company Servier celebrated recently its 40th anniversary in China. On this occasion, Servier held a celebration in Beijing in the presence of Olivier Laureau, President of Servier, the Group Executive Committee members, medical practitioners and partners.Laureau stressed the strategic importance of China for Servier and the Group's commitment to continue to invest over the long term to meet the growing medical needs of patients.In 1979, the first Sino-French medical forum was held in Beijing. Shortly after, Servier began its operations in China, making Servier one of the very first multinational pharmaceutical companies to establish a presence in the country."Servier is committed to therapeutic progress to serve patient needs. In China, more than3 million people are treated with our medicines daily. For 40 years, our ambition has been to offer therapeutic innovations that address major health issues such as chronic diseases. We are ready to address tomorrow's health challenges in China, as illustrated by the expansion of the Tianjin site which will double its annual production capacity to meet the growing medical needs of patients in China," said Laureau.Today more than 2000 people are employed by the company in China for promotion, research and development, and production.Over the past 40 years, Servier China has established a strong reputation within the clinical and scientific community. Recently, Servier China was recognized by the China Cardiovascular Association for "Outstanding Contribution to Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Control.""Servier is very proud to have received this award from such an influential association in cardiovascular medicine. This recognition reflects the longstanding commitment of all employees to improve the lives of patients in China suffering from chronic diseases. It provides strong motivation for us to continue this important work. In the future, and in partnership with health care professionals, Servier China will retain its strong focus on patients with chronic diseases, helping to achieve the goals of Healthy China 2030, the ambitious plan to improve the health and welfare of the Chinese citizens," said Stephane Mascarau, General Manager of Servier China.Servier China is committed to bringing new therapies to the Chinese market, providing additional options for physicians and patients. In 2019, Coveram was launched in China and in 2020, thanks to the partnership with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, Servier is expected to make available a new drug in the DPP4 inhibitor class.Servier China also plans to enter the oncology domain, one of the Group's strategic priorities, launching innovative therapies to meet patients' needs suffering from cancer. As a result of strong R&D activity, Servier China also strives to play an increasing role in the clinical development of innovative oncology drugs."There is an encouragement in China for the participation of the country in international multi-centric clinical trials and global early phases. The local regulations are also becoming globally harmonized and these changes bring new opportunities to involve even more China in our global trials," commented Marcia Matos, director of International Center of Therapeutic Research, Servier.To support this continued development, a large extension to the manufacturing plant in Tianjin will be completed in 2020. This major investment will allow the plant to more than double its production capacity."We aim to put our production and supply close to the health care professionals and close to the patients, to provide a better service, and to lay a solid foundation for Servier to best meet medical needs in China," said Jianmin Zhang, General Manager of the Servier Tianjin Plant.

                    Awareness campaigns on blood pressure measurement launched in Beijing

                The May Measurement Month project, a global blood pressure awareness campaign, as well as the "#BecauseIsayso" charity activity have been launched to mark the World Hypertension Day.The project is co-hosted by the International Society of Hypertension (ISH), the World Hypertension League and the Lancet Hypertension Council.The "#BecauseIsayso" charity activity is co-sponsored by China Hypertension League and Shanghai Institute of Hypertension led by Wang Jiguang, chairman of China Hypertension League, and strongly supported by Servier China.Wu Jing, head of the Division of Infectious Diseases, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said: "The project sets an excellent example of building a disease control platform with the full commitment of companies with social responsibilities, which can carry out comprehensive education on disease prevention, and promote a healthy lifestyle for the public not only in the field of hypertension, but also in a wider range of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer."As one of the most common major chronic diseases in the world, hypertension is the "silent killer" among cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. It not only has high disability and mortality rate, but also puts a severe strain on limited medical resources, which places a heavy burden on families and society. In China, the prevalence of hypertension is 23.2% and the affected age group is gradually becoming younger. It is estimated that the number of patients has reached 270 million.On average, one out of every four people suffers from high blood pressure. However, the awareness rate and treatment rate of hypertension in China and the control rate is still at a low level.Wang Jiguang, director of the Shanghai Institute of Hypertension, said: “Inadequate awareness of hypertension and poor medication compliance have become an important factor affecting the treatment rate and control rate of hypertension. Therefore, the knowledge of hypertension has yet to be popularized, and the management of hypertension still has a long way to go."

                An awareness raising event was jointly held in Beijing by the Beijing Community Health Association and Beijing Community Health Promotion Council to mark the World Family Doctor Day, which falls on May 19th each year.Representatives from National Health Commission, Beijing City Health Commission and several district health commissions, the staff of community health management center of Beijing city and districts and Servier China volunteers participated in the 7-kilometer walking activity together with more than 2000 family doctors and patients from community hospitals to promote a healthy life.In addition to the walk, a variety of disease knowledge sharing, patient education and free consultation activities were organized to improve public awareness of the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases, and promote scientific and healthy lifestyle.Senior physicians Kong Yu and Wang Ning from Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University participated in the event and provided free consultation onsite to the patients."Large hospitals should join hands with community ones to better curb chronic diseases and improve public health," said Kong.With a fast aging population in China, the number of patients with chronic diseases is also increasing substantially. Official statistics showed hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease have become three common chronic diseases at community hospitals, accounting for nearly 34 percent of all daily visits.Meanwhile, the control rate of Chinese patients with hypertension is only 13.8%, and the rate for diabetes patients is only 3.08%. Improving the treatment outcome particularly at community hospitals for patients with chronic diseases and allowing them of better disease treatment and healthcare management has become an urgent issue, experts said.

                    Angina patient education initiative launched in Beijing

            <p class="style-content">
                The "Your Heartache, My Responsibility" patient education initiative has been launched at Peking University First Hospital in Beijing.This event marked the start of the International Angina Week in China, part of an International campaign to help enhance angina awareness.Some eight medical experts in the field gave lectures and on-site consultations for hundreds of patients.Nowadays, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for the Chinese as the number of the patients has reached 290 million, official statistics showed. Among them, 11 million suffer from heart disease.Angina is a common symptom in patients with coronary heart disease. Although the development of drugs has made great progress in treatment, many patients still suffer regular symptoms and their prognosis remains poor.According to Li Jianping, deputy director of the Angiocardiopathy Institute at Peking University First Hospital, a significant percentage of patients with myocardial ischemia do not develop a marked pain.Even if they feel pain, they may exhibit pain in other areas, such as back pain, shoulder pain and arm pain. These misunderstandings cause many patients with angina not to be treated timely, he explained."Correcting misunderstandings and strengthening public awareness will greatly improve angina management in China," he added.Stephane Mascarau, general manager of Servier China, said: "through the latest initiative Servier China demonstrates its commitment to the care of Chinese patients suffering cardiovascular disease and the company will continue to work with the China Cardiovascular Association and healthcare professionals to provide innovative treatments and programs for patients."
