                Teenager in court over Tate Modern incident
            </p>
            <p>
                A 17-year-old boy appeared in court in Bromley, South London, on Tuesday, charged with attempted murder after a six-year-old boy was allegedly thrown from a tenth-floor viewing gallery at the Tate Modern art gallery, one of the United Kingdom's most popular tourist attractions, on Sunday afternoon.The court was told that the child, a French national visiting London with his family, fractured his spine, arm and leg in the incident, and also suffered a "deep" bleed to his brain.Police have confirmed there is no connection between the suspect and the victim, who landed on a fifth floor roof, and have appealed for any witnesses who may have seen the incident to come forward, in addition to those who have already provided details of what they saw."It would have been incredibly distressing to watch, and it may be that you left Tate Modern very quickly after," said Metropolitan Police Detective Chief Inspector John Massey."If you have not yet spoken to us about what you saw, please contact us without delay."We are grateful for the support of the public, some of whom detained the male arrested in the immediate aftermath of the incident. He was arrested by officers very quickly afterward."This was a truly shocking incident, and people will understandably be searching for answers. At the moment, this is being treated as an isolated event with no distinct or apparent motive."The Times newspaper quoted one visitor to Tate Modern as having observed a man "acting weird" shortly before the incident took place."There was a man acting suspiciously," said 47-year-old Nancy Barfield. "He followed us around and I told the kids:'Stay away from that man.' He was acting weird. He had his hands behind his back and was watching us all the time. When he moved away from us we thought: 'Thank goodness he has gone away.'"Shortly afterwards, she heard a loud bang and a woman screaming "That's my son," and about ten people surrounding the man she had observed earlier. She described him as aged between 19 and 21, white and having a "messy" beard.The New York Times reports another eyewitness as saying that when the suspect was asked what he had done, he said it was the fault of social services.Tate Modern is on the south bank of the River Thames, close to landmarks such as London Bridge, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, and the Shard, directly across the river from St Paul's Cathedral.It is a former power station which was converted into a modern art gallery, a partner of the longer-established Tate Britain gallery further west along the Thames at Millbank in Westminster, and opened in 2000.The viewing platform was opened in 2010 and gives access to spectacular views across the London skyline, and in 2018 it helped Tate Modern become the UK's top tourist attraction, with an estimated 5.9 million visitors, according to the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions. It was open for business as usual the day after the incident, but the viewing platform was closed.

                Denim elephants raise awareness of wildlife woes
            </a>
            <p>
                A life-size elephant crafted by a Chinese designer out of recycled denim went on display at London's Tate Exchange this weekend, illustrating the hardships of the natural world and calling for greater protection of the environment and animals within it.Inspired by her trip to Africa, fashion designer Liang Mingyu, whose work featured in the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, made the elephant artwork entitled Masai Mara. She said it expresses her feelings about the animal and that she hopes it will raise awareness of wildlife conservation."In 2015, I visited the Masai Mara wildlife refuge in Africa. One day, I sat in my friend's car and saw a group of elephants 20 meters away," she recalled."They saw us at the same time and suddenly stopped, waiting for us to pass the road. It felt like people waiting for the traffic lights in a city. My friend Xingba waved his arm to 'tell' them go first. I was surprised that elephants can totally understand him. And then I saw the scene that I won't forget my whole life," she said."A group of elephants ran across the road. Baby elephants chased their moms intensely, with noses swing in the air. They looked very happy and united."The intelligence of the elephants left a deep impression on the artist, and thinking about the threat posed to their natural habitat by poaching and the illegal trade in ivory, Liang took on the responsibility of observing and saving their living environment.According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, which is also known as WWF, despite a ban on the international trade in ivory, African elephants are still being poached in large numbers. Tens of thousands of elephants are being killed for their tusks every year, with the ivory often carved into ornaments and jewelry.With her long-held concern for environmental conservation, as well as familiarity with different fabrics, Liang decided to recycle second-hand denims from friends and students and to utilize factories' excess stocks as the main material to make the artwork and let the elephants' voices be heard."I told my friends about this. It is beyond my expectation that they warmly responded to my suggestion and sent me their second-hand denims very quickly. Some factories even donated their excess stocks to me. Lots of denims still have new labels," said Liang. "This reminds me that there is incredible pollution behind the fashion industry, where most people only see the beauty and prosperity of it."She spent more than six months meticulously sewing the elephant and baby elephants, each seam and crease telling the hardships of elephants and trying to draw attention to the alarming environmental pollution caused by the fabric manufacturing process and fashion consumers.The stitching took tens of thousands of needles, and plenty of blood and finger injuries."When I think the elephant's teeth are pulled out, my fingers don't feel hurt at all," she said.Last year, Masai Mara was displayed for the first time at the fourth International Fashion and Lifestyle Expo in the Beijing Exhibition Center.This time it was exhibited as one of the artworks in Itinerant Objects, a Winchester School of Art project at the Tate Modern gallery, partly inspired by China's ancient Silk Road, which helped with the cultural exchange of objects and stories, in a similar fashion to what is being done today through the modern Belt and Road Initiative.

                Tate signs deal with Shanghai's Pudong Museum of Art
            </a>
            <p>
                London's Tate Gallery is to lend its knowledge and expertise to Shanghai's Pudong Museum of Art over the next three years under a new development partnership deal.The world-renowned London gallery will act as a consultant for the Chinese art museum, providing training and advice in several fields, and there are also plans to send pieces from the Tate collections to the new institution in Shanghai.The Pudong Museum of Art, known as PMoA, is a major cultural project in the Pudong New Area. Construction began in September 2017 and is scheduled to be completed in early 2021, opening to the public later that year.PMoA aims to establish itself as an international cultural landmark for Shanghai and an important platform for global cultural and art communication.Tate and Chinese developer Shanghai Lujiazui Group signed a memorandum of understanding at the Tate Modern gallery on Tuesday, formalizing the two sides'commitment to cooperate in cultural exchange and museum development.Tate will assist in areas such as visitor services, operations, art handling and exhibition management, audience development, and learning.Zhu Di, general director of the art department of China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism, said:"When it opens, PMoA will be a stage for dialogue through art, between China and other countries. It intends to become a major contributor to cultural exchanges and cooperation between China and other countries."Zhu expressed excitement in working with Tate and hopes to collaborate with other leading museums around the world.PMoA will primarily focus on the presentation and exchange of international arts, accompanied by domestic art exhibitions.The construction site, located in Lujiazui Business District, has an area of 40,590 square meters and the building will have two floors at basement level and four floors above ground, with a total height of 30 meters.The building has been designed by Jean Nouvel Architects, whose work also include the Louvre Abu Dhabi.Kerstin Mogull, managing director of Tate, said:"We recognize and admire the ambition behind this new public art institution and are excited to be working with the Pudong Museum of Art to advise them on their historic journey toward the opening in 2021 and beyond. This is an internationally significant project to establish a major new art museum in one of the world's most exciting, dynamic and populous cities."The Tate already has an established reputation in China. A Tate exhibition Landscapes of the Mind: Masterpieces from Tate Britain (1700-1980) shown at the Shanghai Museum last year was described as the best-ever attended Tate exhibition anywhere in the world.

                Six-year-old boy critical after being thrown off London's Tate Modern
            </a>

                LONDON - A six-year-old boy who was thrown from a 10th floor viewing platform at the Tate Modern art gallery in central London is now in a critical but stable condition in hospital, police said on Monday.The boy was reportedly thrown from the 10th floor viewing platform of the attraction in central London on Sunday afternoon and was found on a fifth floor roof, police said.He was rushed to hospital by helicopter. His mother was heard by witnesses screaming "Where's my son, where's my son?"."The six-year-old boy injured at the Tate Modern is now in a critical but stable condition in hospital," police said.A 17-year-old male was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and remains in custody, police said. The teenager had remained with members of the public on the viewing platform after the boy's fall."There is nothing to suggest that he is known to the victim," police said.The Tate Modern, situated in a former power station next to the River Thames, was the most popular attraction in Britain in 2018 with almost 6 million visitors, according to the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions.Reuters

                UK authorities charge teen after 6-year-old thrown from Tate
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON — A British youth court on Tuesday ordered a teenager be held on a charge of attempted murder for allegedly throwing a 6-year-old boy from a 10th-floor viewing gallery at London's Tate Modern museum.The 17-year-old boy appeared at Bromley Youth Court and spoke to confirm his name, address, date of birth and British nationality. He cannot be named for legal reasons.The child, a French national, was airlifted to a hospital after plummeting five stories to a roof in the incident, which took place Sunday afternoon when the popular gallery was packed with visitors. He is in critical but stable condition after suffering a sustained bleed on his brain and fractures to his spine, legs and arms.Police say the suspect and the victim had no connection. Detective Chief Superintendent John Massey said this was a "truly shocking incident" that was treated as an isolated event "with no distinct or apparent motive."The teen will appear at London's Central Criminal Court on Thursday.Tate Modern, Britain's leading gallery of modern art, sits on the south bank of the River Thames and was visited by almost 6 million people last year.AP

                Nature is key to UK's climate goal
            </a>
            <p>
                Climate experts say the United Kingdom must plant billions of trees as well as take other transformative measures to achieve its ambitious net-zero emissions target by 2050.In two weeks, throngs of protesters are set to take to the streets in the UK to take part in the Global Climate Strike backed by student activist Greta Thunberg.Protests such as this are now commonplace in the UK, where public concern over the issue of climate change is mounting.In late July, on the second hottest day on record in British history, nine members of activism group Extinction Rebellion faced trespassing charges at a North London court, having glued themselves to the doors of a hotel where the UK's trade minister was speaking at a major petroleum conference.The day before the trial, dozens of protesters from environmental group Greenpeace formed a human chain across the road in front of Buckingham Palace, briefly blocking the motorcade taking new Prime Minister Boris Johnson to meet the Queen.These protests continue, despite the fact that British lawmakers launched an ambitious response to the so-called climate emergency back in June, when the UK became the first major economy to commit to net-zero emissions by 2050.The move drew widespread praise, but environmentalists and climate experts are concerned that the pledge was not accompanied with an outline as to how it might be achieved.Parliament set the new target through an amendment to the Climate Change Act of 2008 which adjusted the previous emissions reduction rate from 80 percent to 100 percent. This amendment was one of the shortest pieces of legislation ever approved.Asher Minns, executive director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia, said that Parliament's pledge "doesn't count for much" and points to recent examples of where the UK has in fact reversed policies designed to mitigate emissions."The government has unrolled the policies that were already in place speaking to the Climate Change Act - including solar and onshore wind policies," Minns said. "The government has actually dismantled those policies".In 2015, the UK government removed tax relief measures on new solar builds and ended certain subsidies for onshore wind projects. Since then a number of financial incentives for biomass, energy efficient homes, and electric vehicles have been removed."The first thing they have got to do is put those things back in place, and then go beyond," said Minns.The UK has made large strides in cutting emissions in its power sector. Electricity generated from gas and coal accounted for 15 percent of total UK emissions in 2017, down from 64 percent in 1990.Renewable forms of energy are getting cheaper, and the UK Committee for Climate Change estimates that further decarbonization of electricity in the UK could feasibly reduce emissions in the power sector by 97 percent compared to 1990 levels.Other sectors will prove more challenging. Buildings accounted for 17 percent of UK greenhouse gas emissions, and the decarbonization of heat for homes is viewed as one of the biggest hurdles in achieving netzero by 2050.To get on track, the CCC says the government must come up with a plan to insulate lofts in 9 million homes, install wall insulation in 2 million homes, and provide electric heat pumps for 2.3 million homes - all in the next decade alone.Ajay Gambhir, senior research fellow at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College London, said the government needs to support the implementation of a retrofitting program and create incentives for people to change out gas boilers, which currently heat 75 percent of homes in the UK.Gambhir said there will also need to be large social changes in the UK, in the way people travel, eat and use energy at home, to reach net-zero. Agriculture accounts for 9 percent of UK emissions - half of which come from cows and sheep - so a shift in diet away from beef, lamb and dairy would help matters.In the transport sector, the government has introduced a policy that by 2040, all new cars sold must be "effectively zero emissions". However, no zero carbon alternatives exist in aviation, which together with shipping contributes 10 percent of UK emissions.This means that the net-zero target will only be achievable if the UK puts in place carbon capture measures, according to former chief scientific advisor to the UK government David King.Engineers around the globe are working on ways to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, but until such technologies are affordable and scalable, King says the UK should turn to nature."How do we remove greenhouse gases? Frankly I think for the UK the best bet is to plant several billion trees," he told China Daily.The government has introduced some forestation incentives, including funding for rural landowners to plant trees and a 10 million pounds ($12 million) urban greening fund. Last year, 134 square kilometers of woodland were planted in the UK, and over the last four years, 15 million new trees have been planted. But the CCC says this rate of forestation is no way near fast enough.It estimates that the UK must plant between 300 and 500 square kilometers of new forest every year until 2050 -- equivalent to 1.5 billion trees -- if it is going to have a shot at achieving net-zero."The zero-emissions target is fine, and I was delighted when it was made," said King. "But we have to start working on it right away, right across government. It's not one single ministry that's involved. The situation is far worse than the climate science community thought 10 years ago."angus@mail.chinadailyuk.com
