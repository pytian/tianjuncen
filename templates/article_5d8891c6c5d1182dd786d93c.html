                A growing number of Chinese travelers are willing to spend big bucks to make the most of their trips, Xu Lin reports. Wang Wei scours the internet in search of the best dining and shopping places when developing travel plans. The 29-year-old office worker from Beijing made a reservation for a Michelin-starred restaurant with an average price of over 1,000 yuan ($140) per person before visiting Japan. She spent about 30,000 yuan on luxury bags and shoes in Italy. She plans to visit museums and galleries, and watch flamenco performances during her upcoming trip to Spain. "I live it up when traveling as a reward for working hard. I want to have quality experiences during vacations," she explains. "The trips broaden my horizons. I watch movies and read books about destinations before trips. But you can only start to understand local lifestyles and cultures after arrival." Wang is among a growing number of Chinese who are willing to splurge for better travel experiences and place higher premiums on cultural engagement. Chinese tourists made 149.72 million outbound trips in 2018, a 14.7 percent year-on-year increase. The number of domestic trips reached 5.5 billion in 2018, a 10.8 percent increase, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism reports. Tourism website Mafengwo recently released an annual report about consumption of Chinese travelers based on user data. It finds that Chinese traveled four times (domestic and overseas) on average in 2018, compared with 3.3 trips in 2016. The report reveals that over 63 percent spent more than 10,000 yuan on travel in 2018. Chinese had higher requirements for accommodation. More than a quarter chose upscale hotels, and 12 percent preferred luxury hotels. Over 20 percent of residents of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen spent more on travel than any other expenditures, aside from housing, in 2018, the report says. Travel accounted for 26 percent of Shanghai residents' annual spending, ranking highest among the four cities. Many tourists planed budgets before traveling, especially people from Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shanghai. Over 90 percent said they spent beyond their budgets, mostly because of shopping. "Chinese have gradually found a balance between careful budgeting and quality travel. In the mobile-internet era, they know how to spend their money in the smartest ways," says Feng Rao, head of Mafengwo's travel research center. "Overspending shows their demand for travel experiences is increasing. And they're willing to pay." Many search online for dining options, the report says. About 45 percent spend an average of 100 to 200 yuan per person per meal, while 19 percent pay 200 to 300 yuan. In the first half of 2019, the number of travel notes on Mafengwo that mentioned "Michelin "increased by 64 percent over the same period of 2018, and many were about Michelin-starred restaurants in Japan. Meanwhile, "coffee" and "milk tea" are two buzzwords in the website's travel notes of the first half of 2019. Shanghai, Beijing, Yunnan province's Lijiang, Tokyo, Vietnam's Nha Trang and Seoul were favorite places to visit cafes. Zhang Chuchen prefers starred hotels with good locations and swimming pools, and unique listings on the home-sharing platform, Airbnb. The 26-year-old office worker from Beijing also stays in hostels to make friends with other young independent travelers from around the world. She buys cosmetics, skin-care products, local snacks and souvenirs from local museums. "It's exciting to enjoy a slow pace of life on holiday," she says. "It's an exploration of the unknown. You learn about other people's lifestyles and ways of thinking." Travelers who were born in the 1970s on average took their first overseas trips at age 30, when they were established in their careers, the report finds. Those born after'95 typically took their first overseas trips at age 18. China's more than 400 million millennials are major drivers of tourism trends, Feng says. Mafengwo reports that bookings for performances, exhibitions and culture-related day tours increased in the first half of 2019. A particularly popular option has been watching the musical, Phantom of the Opera, in London. Many overseas venues are actively promoting themselves to Chinese. "It's not just about sightseeing. It's more about immersing into local culture and history," Feng says. Contact the writer at xulin@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 09/18/2019 page15)
