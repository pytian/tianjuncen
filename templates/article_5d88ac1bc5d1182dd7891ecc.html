                Calls rise to unmask protesters
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Thousands of HK residents sign petition for ban on covering face at public assemblies With protests in Hong Kong turning violent, legal experts and others are once again calling for an anti-mask law. Thousands of residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region signed a petition earlier this month urging the local government to pass legislation that would ban the wearing of masks by demonstrators. In addition, a local group, Protect Hong Kong, has called for such a ban, Hong Kong media reported. The group believes that young people might not commit violent acts at rallies if they are not wearing masks. It also said protesters have no need to wear masks unless they are sick, and if they are sick, they should not take part in rallies. A spokesman for the group said a ban on masks would make young protesters realize they will be identified when committing illegal acts and will face consequences. In violent attacks in the government building, on the street and at the airport in the past three months, rioters have covered their faces with masks and scarves to hide their identity and escape punishment. Similar calls for anti-mask legislation were made after local officials, in February 2016, tried to shut down a night food market in Mong Kok, one of Hong Kong's busiest districts, and rioters hurled bottles and garbage cans at police officers and tore bricks from the pavement to be used as weapons. Some Hong Kong lawmakers at that time urged the local authorities to introduce an anti-mask law, saying many protesters hid their identities during the Mong Kok riot to avoid arrest. Elizabeth Quat Pui-fan, a lawmaker from the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, said psychological studies have shown that a person wearing a mask to hide his or her identity was more likely to do violent acts than one without a mask. Maggie Chan Man-ki, president of the Small and Medium Law Firms Association of Hong Kong, said that with masks on their faces, criminals are more reckless. To safeguard people's safety and restore order in Hong Kong, "the city should have a bill banning protesters from wearing masks," she added. "It is difficult for police to collect evidence (of criminal suspects among the protesters) and file lawsuits," said Chan, who also is a Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress, China's top legislature. Lawrence Ma Yan-kwok, a Hong Kong-based lawyer, said, "There is an urgent need to enact an anti-mask law in Hong Kong." Many radical Hong Kong protesters have deliberately abused this legal vacuum to break the law and avoid arrest, as it is difficult for the police to identify people wearing masks, said Ma, who is also chairman of the Hong Kong Legal Exchange Foundation. "The purpose of having an anti-mask law is to allow the police to identify suspects who commit criminal offenses and bring them to justice," Ma said. Ma said Canada and many parts of the United States have anti-mask laws, and wearing masks in protests is banned in many European countries. Earlier this year, France's National Assembly approved a law banning the wearing of masks at protests, following weeks of anti-government "yellow vest" demonstrations. Wearing a mask could result in a one-year prison sentence and a fine. Wearing a mask to hide one's identity during a public assembly is also banned in such European countries as Denmark, Germany, Norway, Austria and Sweden. Thom Brooks, dean of the law school at Durham University in Britain, said: "My sense is these laws can be very difficult to enforce, which may help explain the substantial penalty for breaking these laws. Part of the difficulty will be simply in identifying those who are covering their faces." Illan rua Wall, an associate law professor of the University of Warwick in Britain, said anti-mask laws are used for two reasons: to make protesters identifiable to the police for subsequent prosecution, and because of the social psychology theory that people who feel anonymous are more likely to act aggressively. "Forcing them to take off a mask is supposed to decrease the risk of escalation," Wall said, adding that an anti-mask law makes it easier to disperse and prosecute.

                    The planet's future burns along with Amazon
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The nearly 73,000 fires, most of them set illegally to clear and prepare land for agriculture, cattle farming and property speculation, have prompted the state of Amazonas to declare an emergency. The fires have decimated the Amazon rainforest, which could be devastating for an ecosystem that produces a huge amount of the planet's oxygen, sparking international concerns over the destruction of one of the world's largest carbon sinks.From frustration to mourning, the community of concerned individuals and organizations the world over are trying to find ways of curbing the man-made devastation in the Amazon."Our house is burning," tweeted French President Emmanuel Macron, calling for emergency talks on the issue at the just concluded G7 summit in Biarritz in France.Although wildfires in the Amazon are an annual occurrence, especially in the dry season which begins in July and continues up to September, this year they increased 84 percent compared with last year.Many climate skeptics and those who never get tired of denying that global warming is man-made have claimed the Amazon fires this year are a natural phenomenon, but environmentalists assert humans are the root cause of the fires.Scientists say the ongoing destruction will have dire consequences for Brazil and the world. The Guardian quoted Carlos Nobre, a senior researcher at the Institute of Advanced Studies at the University of Sao Paulo, as saying the increase in deforestation was taking the rainforest closer to a tipping point beyond which swaths of the usually humid forest would become a dry savannah, with dire consequences for the climate, wildlife and forest dwellers.Deforestation was on course to rise by 20-30 percent this year, Nobre said, adding that it was "very likely" to pass 10,000 square kilometers for the first time in more than 10 years.Nobre told The Guardian: "A very large number of these fires are due to the cultural push that ministers are giving. They are pushing deforestation because it is good for the economy.""Good for the economy" in the short term, perhaps, but considering the devastating effects of massive forest fires and deforestation in the long log run, it could mean the end of economic development as we know it.In Mato Grosso, a soy frontier, which has seen more fires than anywhere else in Brazil this year, burning has been detected inside indigenous people's lands and nature reserves.Nobre told The Guardian that one of the only remaining ways to prevent a dangerous loss of forests was through external protests and consumer actions. "Politicians in Brazil pay more attention to international pressure than the voice of Brazilians," he said.But in the run-up to the G7 summit, the developed world's response to the crisis was mixed. Norway and Germany halted donations to the Brazilian government's Amazon fund, but the United Kingdom spent last week focusing on post-Brexit business with Brazil.Also last week, British Trade Minister Conor Burns was shaking hands with his Brazilian counterpart in Brasilia, saying the UK is eager to deepen relations with Brazil. Worse, asked about the Amazon fires, Burns refused to comment but reportedly said the Bolsonaro government had "legitimate ambitions to bring prosperity to its people".Thomas Lovejoy, a co-author of the tipping point study and who has worked for more than 50 years in the Brazilian rainforest, said this is one of its darkest moments for the Amazon. "There have always been some ups and downs, but the overall trajectory has been towards improvement. Now, Brazil is headed in the other direction. Under normal circumstances, the outside world would endeavor to help, but this Brazilian government is not interested in help."However, the $20 million the outside world, more precisely the G7, has pledged to douse the Amazon fires has been dismissed as "chump change" by environmentalists, as the amount is mainly aimed at sending firefighting aircraft to tackle the conflagrations.More worryingly, the world is divided when it comes to fighting climate change, as was evident in the empty chair of the US leader at the G7 meeting on climate change.It seems those hell-bent on boosting economic growth at any cost are holding the future of the world's forests, rather the future of the planet, to ransom. But without forests there won't be any development.The author is a senior editor with China Daily.

                    Britain's spending on health second lowest in G7: study
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                LONDON -- A report published Thursday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) of Britain provided a health check for the country's National Health Service (NHS).ONS published a report examining how Britain's spending on healthcare compares with other countries around the world, using the latest available statistics from 2017.In that year, Britain spent $3,647 per person on healthcare, the second lowest in the G7, with the highest spenders being France ($4,560), Germany ($5,407) and the US ($9,440). Only Italy ($3,121) spent less than Britain.However, Britain's health spending was near the median for members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which was $3,554 per person.The US, Switzerland, Norway, Germany and Austria were the top 5 health spenders in the OECD members, with Britain taking a center spot at 18th. The list was propped up by Mexico as the lowest health spender.Britain spent $240 billion on healthcare in 2017, slightly above the median expenditure for OECD members, but below the median for the EU15, spanning most European Union members in western Europe.ONS said Britain's healthcare spending fell as a percentage of the country's GDP from 9.8 percent in 2013 to 9.6 percent in 2017. At the same time the percentage rose of spending over the same period for four of the remaining six G7 countries.The report added that in 2017 Britain spent the equivalent of $683 per person on health-related long-term care, which was less than most other northern or western European countries, but a similar amount to France and Canada.

                    Defying gravity in Norway's 'death diving'
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                OSLO, Norway - They throw themselves into the air, twisting their bodies and seemingly making time stand still, before landing with a splash: Originally a pastime to impress girls, Norway's sport of "death diving" now attracts dozens of daredevils. Around 40 divers converged in the Norwegian capital Oslo in mid-August for the annual world championship of the sport, officially known by its Norwegian name of "dods", meaning death. Some svelte and muscular, others paunchy and tattooed, nearly all the competitors are Norwegian, apart from a few from Sweden, Spain, Denmark and Finland. At first glance, it might look like just another belly flop competition. But death diving requires an element of skill. Jumping off a 10-meter tower, competitors perform a stunt, holding the pose for as long as they can until it looks like they are about to do a massive belly flop, before tucking their body into a tight curl at the last second as they are about to hit the water. At Oslo's Frognerbadet municipal pool, the divers vying for the world title warm up with stretches, push-ups and headstands to prepare their bodies for the grueling challenge to come. "You do have a few nerves," said Morten Falteng, the oldest competitor at almost 60, who, with four friends, started the sport back in 1972. "We didn't think too much about it back then, we just wanted to have fun. We dived, we jumped, we wanted to do something new," he recalled, clad in an old-fashioned, red-and-white striped swimsuit. "And there were these five girls that always came to watch us," he said, his voice trailing off at the memory. 'Fear locks out' It was another group of Norwegian friends, who in 2008 set up the world championships. Organizers said it was meant as a somewhat tongue-in-cheek title at the time as the only "international" diver that year was a Norwegian adopted from Guatemala. To blaring music, competitors flex their muscles, dab, twerk and otherwise entertain the spectators below from the top of the diving tower. "When I'm up there and it's a competition, all the fear just locks out. I can do anything when I'm up there," said Miriam Hamberg, a 22-year-old from Sweden. For the past two years, the competition has been open to women, who compete in their own category. Hamberg has won the title both times. "My brothers have always done this and I've always done the same things as they do. I never want to be worse," she said. Two events The world championship is comprised of two events - classic and freestyle. In the classic event, divers jump, their arms straight out to form a cross. Then, just before impact, they tuck their body into a tight ball or pike position called "the shrimp", before reopening their body immediately after impact to make the biggest splash possible. The freestyle contest involves spectacular flips, twisting acrobatics and other "slow motion" moves that create a sense of suspending time - all, often improvised. Poolside, a jury scores the competitors on their style, timing, originality - and, the size of their splash. "It's difficult to describe," said Joan Fuster, a 29-year-old Spaniard, who traveled from Menorca for the competition. "I really love the feeling of flying and being free. Like there's no gravity for just a second." 'A blast' Hitting the water at 70 km/h leaves little room for error. While these dives are far from the spectacular, death-defying swan dives performed off the cliffs of Mexico and elsewhere, they can still involve bruises and knees-in-the-nose when things don't go as planned. Divers occasionally emerge from the water limping or in need of consolation, but mostly there's a lot of camaraderie among competitors, with cheering, hugging and high-fives. "It's not a very demanding sport," said Paul Rigault, an official from the Norwegian death diving federation. "All you need is a swimsuit and a diving tower and everyone has a blast."

                A night in which a theater director had a few too many continues to have its denouement in a town of charmsHuang Lei's moment of enlightenment came at a dinner with friends. It was 12 years ago, so memories of what they ate that evening in Beijing have no doubt been lost to time, but Huang knows exactly what they drank - copious amounts of alcohol - and by the end of the convivial gathering he was well and truly drunk.As he and his friends continued to imbibe and chatter away, sharp images of the town of Wuzhen, 1,270 kilometers away in Zhejiang province, began to float through Huang's mind.Wuzhen's renown is built on the watery setting of part of the town, crossed and crisscrossed by picturesque bridges, canals, rivers and lakes, with traditional architecture that hearkens back to the town's ancient beginnings.

                    French prosecutor: Knife attack suspect in 'psychotic state'
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                PARIS — An Afghan man was in a "psychotic state" and on drugs during a stabbing in France that killed one person and injured eight others, but investigators haven't found any terrorist ties, a regional prosecutor said Sunday.A psychiatric evaluation of the man in custody for Saturday's attack revealed he was experiencing "paranoid delirium," prosecutor Nicolas Jacquet said.The suspect reported he "heard voices" telling him to kill, according to Jacquet. A 19-year-old man died after being stabbed with a knife in the attack outside a subway station in the Lyon suburb of Villeurbanne.Passers-by surrounded and apprehended the assailant before police arrived, according to the prosecutor. He thanked them."Their courageous, responsible intervention was decisive," Jacquet told reporters.A witness broadcaster BFMTV identified as Sofiane described trying to help people who were stabbed and rounding up others to go after the attacker.The man from Afghanistan in custody has been living in a French center for asylum-seekers, and held a temporary French residency card, Jacquet said. The suspect was first recorded in France in 2009, and subsequently traveled to Britain, Italy, Germany and Norway before returning to France in 2017.After the stabbings, the suspect gave "incoherent" accounts and three different dates of birth to police, Jacquet said. The man was not publicly named.The suspect was not on any radicalism watch list, Jacquet said.Officers searched the suspect's residence as part of the investigation, and "nothing was found showing any kind of radicalization," he said.The suspect had no police record or record of psychiatric problems, the prosecutor said. He was found with two knives but no other weapons.Two of the eight people injured remained hospitalized. French police initially said nine people had injuries but the prosecutor said the total was eight. The reason for the discrepancy was unclear.Villeurbanne Mayor Jean-Paul Bret said the man held is the only person suspected of wielding the knife.The mayor also called anti-migrant politicians "shameless" for seizing on the stabbings to push their views.French far right leader Marine Le Pen tweeted after the attack that "lax migration policy" threatens France's security.The attack raised concerns because France remains on alert after a string of deadly Islamic extremist attacks.AP

                    Shipbuilding giant to focus on high value-added vessels
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Co Ltd, a subsidiary of State-owned China Shipbuilding Industry Corp, the country's primary contractor for its naval force, will shift its focus from building conventional ships to high value-added vessels to cast off the negative influence caused by the ongoing Sino-US trade dispute, said a senior executive.Due to bilateral trade tensions, the world's goods and commodity trade activities have declined since March last year and this has severely affected shipowners' enthusiasm and banks' confidence in building new bulk vessels, chemical tankers and container ships, said Yang Zhizhong, president of DSIC.Eager to put its revenue growth on a firmer footing, the company will focus on building very large crude carriers, liquefied natural gas carriers, floating oil and gas production units, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels, as well as making innovation breakthroughs in heavy industry, new material and environmental protection products."About 85 percent of ship parts and equipment such as diesel engines and marine propellers today can be purchased from domestic manufacturers," said Yang, adding the company will gather more resources to compete with South Korea in the field of building LNG carriers, pushed by China's cross-border reform in the natural gas sector, including market-oriented reform, transparency and improved infrastructure.To ensure China's energy security, it is necessary for the nation to develop LNG carriers, because it will help the country import the increasingly widely used energy from other parts of the world such as Qatar, Malaysia and Russia, said Tan Naifen, deputy secretary-general of the Beijing-based China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry.According to global independent maritime research consultancy Drewry, China will import between 60 million metric tons and 100 million tons of LNG annually by 2022, which means that the market will need around 60 to 100 LNG carriers by that time.It is estimated that there will be about 500 LNG carriers worldwide by the end of this year and the number will jump to 600 by 2022.Building LNG carriers requires more advanced technology than building conventional storage tanks. They need to store LNG at a temperature of-163 C and are mostly powered by steam turbines. Each LNG carrier can be sold for $200 million to $250 million.Dong Liwan, a professor of shipbuilding at Shanghai Maritime University, said domestic players certainly see this area as a must-have and not a nice-to-have market. It is time for capable Chinese shipyards to make complex, high value-added vessels to reach buyers in new segments via international collaboration, research and development activities.DSIC is not alone, Shanghaibased Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding (Group) Co Ltd, a shipbuilding unit of China State Shipbuilding Corp, is building the world's largest liquefied natural gas carrier with a capacity of 270,000 cubic meters to cope with the rising demand for the clean fuel in the nation.The Shanghai-based company has joined hands with Norway-based internationally accredited registrar and classification society DNV-GL for construction of the carrier. Under the deal, research and development work on the new vessel is set to be completed by the end of 2020.In addition to building LNG carriers, DSIC delivered the world's first intelligent VLCC named New Journey to China Merchants Energy Shipping Co Ltd in late July to further diversify its production line in the field of high-end shipbuilding.Built over a period of three years, the VLCC is 333 meters long and 60 meters wide. Its dead weight is up to 308,000 tons.In the construction of New Journey, the shipbuilder received strong technical support from several research institutes, including the Shanghai Merchant Ship Design and Research Institute and the Shanghai Electrical Apparatus Research Institute.Yang from DSIC said the company will keep a close eye on market demand in Greece, Germany and member economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to stabilize its export channels and develop markets participating in the development of the Belt and Road Initiative.Supported by more than 1,100 researchers, the Dalian-based shipbuilder gained 20 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) of sales revenue in 2018, with 850 million yuan of profit. It is the only domestic equipment manufacturing enterprise group that runs business in five industrial sectors - military projects, shipbuilding, offshore equipment building, heavy industrial projects, ship maintenance and vessel scrapping.

                    Red Boat brings prosperity to where it set sail

                HANGZHOU - On Nanhu Lake in East China's Zhejiang province rests one of the most famous boats in the country -- the Red Boat.Every day, a large number of visitors queue up to pay homage to the historical boat in the city of Jiaxing, which honors the conclusion of the first National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1921.After 98 years, the CPC has grown from a small party of some 50 members into the world's largest ruling party, with more than 90 million members. At the same time, China has developed from an impoverished country to the second-largest economy in the world."To help remind us of the spirit behind the Red Boat, we placed a model of the boat at our company," said You Yuan, chairman of Jiaxing Glead Electronics Co Ltd, which is located less than 5 km from Nanhu Lake.The Red Boat spirit, written above the one-meter-long boat model, highlights pioneering work, striving spirit and dedication.Glead Electronics is a high-tech company that specializes in the research, development and sale of microwave dielectric ceramics components and satellite navigation modules."The Red Boat spirit continually pushes us forward," said You.The company receives foreign clients from time to time. "If they are interested in the history of the boat, we tell them the story and even bring them to the lake to see the real boat," said the chairman."The employees are united together through the Party and union activities, which is conducive to the operation of the company," said Kawada Masahiro, division director of the general administration department of Nidec (Zhejiang) Corporation.The Japanese businessman has been working in Jiaxing for four years. He is impressed by the positive role the Party plays in mobilizing and uniting his Chinese colleagues.Apart from expats who live and work in the city like Kawada, a growing number of foreign visitors are also attracted to the Nanhu Lake Revolutionary Memorial Hall."In 2019 alone, we have received five batches of 75 delegates from the communist parties of Britain, Norway, and Finland," said Zhang Xianyi, curator of the memorial.Most foreigners are eager to find out the secrets behind China's economic success, and they are interested in the country's development course, as well as the original pursuit and mission of the CPC, according to Zhang.The prosperity of Jiaxing is a testimony of the pursuit of the CPC and the fast development of China.Mao Longhua, a 68-year-old farmer, just spent 900,000 yuan (about $126,177) on the renovation of his house in Tongjie Village of Jiaxing, which was something unthinkable in the past.There is no significant difference between rural and urban areas now in terms of income and living conditions, Mao said.According to the city's bureau of agriculture and rural affairs, the per capita disposable income of rural residents in Jiaxing reached 34,000 yuan in 2018, ranking first in Zhejiang Province for 15 consecutive years."The little boat on Nanhu Lake has evolved into a "giant ship," which carries the hope of the people and the Chinese nation," said Liu Yong, a scholar from the Party School of Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the CPC.
