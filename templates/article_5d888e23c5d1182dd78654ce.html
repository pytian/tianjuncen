                Chongqing will speed up building a cross-border land-sea trade corridor so it can play a leading role in the Belt and Road Initiative, local authorities said on Wednesday in Beijing.Located on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the municipality in Southwest China boasts key geographic advantages as a strategic pivot of the country's development program for its western regions along with being a connecting point for the BRI and the Yangtze Economic Belt."We should make good use of this advantage and build Chongqing into an international logistics hub to drive regional development," Chongqing Mayor Tang Liangzhi said at a news conference on the municipality's economic and social development since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.Chongqing has witnessed robust economic growth with an average GDP growth rate of 8.3 percent over the past seven decades. In 2018, its GDP exceeded 2 trillion yuan ($286 billion).President Xi Jinping paid his second inspection tour to Chongqing in April and said the area should continue to be an anchor of large scale development, a driver in advancing the BRI and a leader in green development along the Yangtze River Economic Belt.Mountainous Chongqing relied in the past on the Yangtze to connect with the outside world."To the south, Chongqing has the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor to reach 190 ports in 90 countries. To the west, it links over 30 cities in 11 countries in Central Asia and Europe via the China-Europe Railway Express freight trains," the mayor said.In addition, there is a Chongqing-Ningbo Rail-Sea Link to connect the eastern region and the Chongqing-Manchuria-Russia freight trains to reach the north, he added.Since 1949, Chongqing has played an important role in the country's development, from being a major industrial base to a national defense manufacturing area in the 1960s.In 1997, it became China's fourth municipality after Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. Covering 82,402 square kilometers and with about 30 million people, it is by far the largest of the four, even bigger in area than the Republic of Ireland or the Czech Republic.Chongqing is the headquarters of the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Demonstration Initiative on Strategic Connectivity signed in 2016. It initiated the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor project in a bid to speed up the opening and high-quality development of the western region."We will seize this significant opportunity to boost the region's overall integration and enhance the international economic exchanges through this corridor," Tang said.The new land-sea corridor will extend mainly from Chengdu in Sichuan province and Chongqing to a group of Beibu Gulf ports in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region and Yangpu Port in Hainan province, which opens a connection to countries in Southeast Asia.The new land-sea corridor will be fully completed by 2035. It will have better transportation capacity, world-class customs clearance and logistics services, the National Development and Reform Commission said."Compared with the traditional route via the Yangtze River and Shanghai, the new route is a faster way to connect China's inland western region with major ports in the south, saving about 20 days in transport time," said Han Baochang, director of the China-Singapore demonstration initiative's administration committee.Opened in 2011, the rail link between Chongqing and Duisburg, Germany, has become an integral transport link and a vital artery in the BRI. Goods can be transported along the 11,179 kilometer route in about 13 days.By the end of June, the China-Europe Railway Express (Chongqing) have made over 4,100 trips with a total value of freight exceeding 155 billion yuan, Tang said."We will continue to increase the number of trips, improve the network and expand the functions of the rail link in order to make it an important platform of the Belt and Road Initiative," he said.

Loudspeakers mounted in the waiting room continued to announce new departure times.Asha Maimuna, a middle-aged passenger, noted wryly: "Our safe arrival is important, not really the departure time."She was traveling to Mbeya, a trip of 813 kilometers, to visit her parents. Some roads are impassable, she said, and journeys overland are prone to accidents."The Makuba Express train is a necessity for many of us, despite the long delays and sluggish speed," Maimuna said.The Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority, or TAZARA, has been a lifeline for landlocked Zambia, creating innumerable job opportunities for the two countries as the line snakes 1,860 km from Dar es Salaam to the copper town of Kapiri Mposhi in Zambia. It is one of China's efforts to aid developing countries.A white paper－The Right to Development: China's Philosophy, Practice and Contribution－which was released in December 2016, said China had provided some 400 billion yuan (about $56 billion) in development aid to 166 countries and international organizations over the past 60 years.It has trained more than 12 million personnel from developing countries and sent around 600,000 people to assist in the development in other nations. Of those, 700 have given their lives, the white paper said.Assistance from China has made a significant contribution to improving the lives of those in the recipient countries.For the past 43 years, Boniface Zimba has been taking the line operated by the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority to visit his family in rural Zambia.Sometimes, the 79-year-old runs into former workers from the authority, which he left 24 years ago. They always discuss how the China-built railway has boosted the economy and changed their lives."We were proud to build it," Zimba said. He left his mining job in 1970 to join 13,500 Chinese technical and engineering personnel and 38,000 Tanzanian and Zambian workers who helped establish the rail authority.Zimba said the steady job and good pay enabled him and his wife to start a family and provide their eight children with an education.The authority was funded by China and established between 1970 and 1975, with commercial operations starting in July 1976. It linked Kapiri Mposhi in Zambia to Dar es Salaam on the Tanzanian coast, providing freight and passenger services.Wang Luo, director of the Institute of International Development Cooperation, responsible to the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation at the Ministry of Commerce, said, "The railway has been an economic catalyst for eastern and southern African nations and a symbol of the friendship between China and Africa."Emmanuel Matambo, an analyst at the Center for Africa-China Studies at the University of Johannesburg in South Africa, said, "The Tanzania-Zambia railway line played a seminal role in demonstrating China's solidarity with anti-colonial and anti-apartheid agitation in Africa."He added that despite not functioning at its best, the line's ideological importance has been so influential that it has dispelled many arguments about China's alleged colonial or harmful designs on Africa."The railway authority was thus an altruistic contribution to Africa from a country that wants to be seen as a kindred spirit to the continent. It created the trust that China still enjoys in Africa today," Matambo said.

                    Playing its role in 'Chinese miracle'

                City has poured more than $1.1 trillion into mainland, accounting for 54 percent of total foreign direct investmentEditor's note: As the People's Republic of China prepares to celebrate its 70th anniversary on Oct 1, China Daily is featuring a series of stories on the role regions have played in the country's development and where they are today.Hong Kong has been known for generations as the place where East met West, but that title took on even greater importance when the city became the gateway to one of the world's biggest markets.The world stood in awe of the evolving "Chinese miracle" over the past 70 years. The return of Hong Kong to the motherland in 1997 under the "one country, two systems" principle became part of that miracle.Reform and opening-up, which started in 1978, was a formula devised by Deng Xiaoping, the late architect of economic reform. It raised the curtain on a bold future for Hong Kong and Macao as part of China's economic transformation. The stage was set for the future special administrative regions to play key roles in a market of nearly 1 billion people then.Entrepreneurs had already been preparing the groundwork. Many had strong familial links across the border in Guangdong province and were motivated by a desire to reconnect with their cultural roots."In the first 30 years of the seven decades since the founding of the nation in 1949, many businessmen from Hong Kong maintained their attachment to the motherland, despite the hiatus in trade," said Jonathan Choi Koon-shum, chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. "They still donated money for building roads, constructing bridges and setting up schools."Choi was one of them. The son of Choi Kai-yau, dubbed "the seafood king" of Hong Kong, he was born in Macao, grew up in Hong Kong and made his fortune on the Chinese mainland.In 1978, Choi, who had just taken over the Sunwah Group from his father, decided to donate money to build a school in Zhongshan, where his family came from.He also invested HK$40 million in a fishing fleet that year, for compensation trade in Zhuhai and Zhongshan. The local authorities used his investment to build ships and, in return, they provided Choi with seafood.But the local fishermen couldn't get the job done and the venture failed. In those days, everything produced in people's communes was to be shared equally by all and the workers just weren't motivated.Things changed after Choi decided to take money as compensation instead. The fishermen were asked to pay Choi an agreed amount. Whatever they earned from selling fish over and above the set amount went into their pockets."When I saw coastal cities like Zhuhai lined with small, brick houses, instead of squatter huts, I felt proud of myself," Choi said.His patriotism took him a long way in his future mainland endeavors and things started falling into place for Choi. He made his way from Zhuhai, in the south, to Shanghai and Dalian on the east coast.He completed his value chain, opening shrimp farms and processing factories, and began exporting his products overseas.Choi's success in business funded ongoing charity efforts on the mainland. Scholarships, teaching buildings and even colleges bearing the Choi name sprung up in about half a dozen universities across China. In 1995, he donated 6 million yuan to create a foundation that provided subsidies to elderly members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He later injected another 10 million yuan into the fund, with the late Chinese nuclear physicist He Zehui - the wife of Qian Sanqiang, the father of China's atomic bomb - among the beneficiaries.

                Museum houses treasures from Qing Dynasty's sole trading port In 2006, some 260 years after a wooden ship, the Goteborg, laden with Chinese goods, sank on the return trip to Sweden from Guangzhou, Guangdong province, a rebuilt vessel repeated the journey to the longtime trading hub in South China. Salvage work began in the 1980s after the shipwreck was found not far from its home in Goteborg (also known as Gothenburg), Sweden. Four-hundred pieces of porcelain and nine tons of porcelain fragments that had gone down with the Goteborg were recovered after 10 years of effort. "The porcelain is truly a reflection of the prosperous trade between Guangzhou and the rest of the world during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911)," said Ge Hua, director of the Thirteen Hongs Cultural Promotion Association. The Goteborg visited Guangzhou three times from 1739 to 1745. Unfortunately, on its final voyage it struck a coral reef and sank on its way home. A replica of the Goteborg is now on display in the Thirteen Hongs Museum in Guangzhou, which shows examples of the prosperous trade between China and the West, including Chinese antiques. "The Thirteen Hongs in Guangzhou was once the gate through which China connected with the world, as well as the window through which the world got to know China. It is the cultural and historical calling card renowned both abroad and at home," Ge said. The word hongs, in Cantonese, refers to merchant houses or trade houses, similar to companies. The number 13 is an appellation, or a generic term, not the actual number of merchant houses. Thirteen Hongs, also refers to the location of the trade houses, the hong merchants and the system in use. From 1757 to 1842, Guangzhou was the sole Chinese port that handled trade with the West, becoming a frontier of political, economic and cultural communication, Ge said. In 1757, the Emperor Qianlong, cautious about political and commercial threats from abroad, ordered that Western merchant ships could only anchor and trade in Guangzhou. While Guangzhou was far away from Beijing, the capital, and had always been a trading port, the Qing government thought it was good idea to confine trade to the southern Chinese city. Guangzhou played an important role on the ancient Maritime Silk Road, establishing trade relationships with some of the world's great port cities starting in the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220). "As Guangzhou represented the direct connection of China and the West during the time the oneport policy was in effect, the Thirteen Hongs Museum is a perfect place to display how the trade policy of the Qing Dynasty operated and how Guangzhou trade prospered during that time," said Wang Yuanlin, a professor at Jinan University in Guangzhou and director of the Guangdong Pearl River Delta Culture Research Association. The Thirteen Hongs Museum, with an area of 4,700 square meters, was created in 2016. It is located on the original site of the old trading zone of the Qing Dynasty (now Guangzhou Cultural Park). "Although the Thirteen Hongs had already ceased its historical role, its spirit of credibility, practicality, adventure and tolerance are still carried on by Cantonese businesses," Wang said. The museum is thematic, with two permanent exhibitions - and exhibition of Guangzhou's Thirteen Hongs during the Qing Dynasty and a display of donated artifacts from Wang Heng and his wife, Feng Jie. The first exhibition hall covers 2,450 square meters and has six parts. It systematically shows the history and prosperity of the Thirteen Hongs, including foreign trade, Hong merchants and other historical landmark trade events. "The exhibition encourages Cantonese businesspeople to keep on moving to compose a new chapter for the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road," Wang said. On the second floor of the museum, the display of donations from Wang Heng and his wife - well-known Cantonese collectors and entrepreneurs - including many precious cultural relics. In 2013, the couple donated more than 1,500 antiques that they had purchased abroad. The museum was under construction. "The splendid history of the Thirteen Hongs is shown by a vast quantity of precious historical documents and the cultural relics from abroad and at home," Wang Heng said. Items include Guangcai porcelain, pith paintings, Cantonese embroidery, carved ivory, fans, furniture, silverware, enamel pieces, reverse glass paintings, watercolors, oil paintings and lacquer ware. "They were the main handicrafts made in Guangzhou for export during the Qing Dynasty," Wang said. "Tea, silk, porcelain and other exquisite handicrafts exported through the Thirteen Hongs were very popular in Europe and the United States." Among the antiques are more than 100 pieces of mahogany furniture of a kind rarely seen in China, and more than 600 Guangcai porcelain pieces made during the Kangxi and Qianlong period, which comprehensively provide visitors with concrete examples for study. Also, there are pith paintings of various themes - a lost craft that illustrates the prosperity and vibrancy of Guangzhou's business and trade during the Qing Dynasty. "We hope this exhibition will become a platform for the study of the history of the Thirteen Hongs, and influence more people to make donations," Wang said. qiuquanlin@chinadaily.com.cn  Items donated by Wang Heng and his wife, well-known collectors, are displayed at the Guangzhou Thirteen Hongs Museum.(China Daily 09/14/2019 page6)
