                Increasingly, high-end overseas talent coming back to ride innovation wave
            </p>
            <p>
                Deng Yuanbo, now in his seventh year at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom, has decided to return to China to start his own business after he finishes his postdoctoral research on optical engineering next year.Deng's startup team aims to provide display products for vehicles that enable users to see data without looking away while driving.Having started to commercialize their technologies last year, the team has been cooperating with a major Chinese vehicle manufacturer."High-tech startups are in line with China's current development strategies and enjoy a series of favorable policies," Deng said.As China's environment for innovation and startups continues to improve, more high-end talent like Deng have been motivated to return to their country.Favorable environmentOn Aug 2, a group of about 30 Chinese students from Cambridge started a weeklong trip to visit and communicate with high-tech enterprises and local governments in Beijing and Chengdu, Sichuan province.It is the sixth trip of its kind held by the Cambridge Chinese Students and Scholars Association. Previous trips covered major cities including Shenzhen, Guangdong province, and Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, as well as industry giants such as Alibaba."The trips are to better connect overseas students with Chinese employers and local governments," said Ren Shengjun, president of the association.The students also had the chance to create startup roadshows during the trip, as nearly half the participants this year, mostly PhD candidates, would like to start up their own businesses.When Ren went to Britain for college in 2012, he planned to work there after graduation. Now in his third year of doctoral studies, he decided to return to China."I have learned that Chinese enterprises have a large demand for overseas talent, and returnees can enjoy preferential policies and a considerable income comparable to those working overseas," Ren said.A number of Chinese cities currently offer favorable policies to overseas talent. As one of China's leading cities on innovation, Shenzhen launched a Peacock Plan offering funds and preferential treatment to high-end talent in 2010, which covered 3,264 returnees as of March 2018."Through our exchanges with local governments and enterprises during the trips, we found that not only local governments but also many enterprises are willing to provide funds or launch training programs for high-end talent," said Zhang Cen, a Cambridge PhD graduate and former president of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association in Britain."Also, venture competitions have become more professional and helpful in recent years," he said.Innovation waveZhang, whose doctoral research focuses on new energy and materials, will work for a major Chinese energy enterprise in the new energy development sector.For Zhang, the rapid economic development and social changes in China make the country an increasingly attractive place not only for Chinese overseas students but also foreigners who want to share the rapid growth of China."There is more competition in China than in many other countries, which can better stimulate young people to work hard for their ideals," he said.China was ranked 14th among more than 100 economies worldwide in the 2019 edition of the Global Innovation Index report, which was jointly released by the World Intellectual Property Organization, Cornell University and several other organizations in July.The report gave China top ranks in patents by origin, industrial designs and trademarks by origin, as well as high-tech and creative goods exports.As one of those in the innovation wave chasing their dreams, Deng plans to settle in Shenzhen to develop his business, which expects to see the first batch of product molds come out in October."Starting up a business is an excellent opportunity and is very attractive to me. It might be risky but can also make us grow fast," Deng said, adding that his team has been contacting more manufacturers and hopes to design products that can be applied on different vehicles."As our technologies gain recognition, we see quite a promising future and have confidence in the business," he said.Xinhua

                South China port city shares its story at event in Cambridge
            </a>
            <p>
                An evening of performances celebrating the culture and attractions of the Chinese port city of Beihai delighted the audience at The Guildhall in Cambridge on Friday.The event, Belt and Road: By Beihai we are Bound, promoted the ancient city in South China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, which is known for its coastal tourism and historical culture and which has played an important role in China's international trading for more than 2,000 years.During the event's opening ceremony, an extract from the drama Maritime Silk Road was performed, with songs and dances. The show highlights the exchanges and trade activities between China and the rest of the world, and shows the Maritime Silk Road's contribution to promoting friendship, cooperation, peace, and prosperity between China and other countries.Visitors also had the chance to view a photo exhibition of Beihai's tourism attractions, its local customs, and the city's infrastructure.Su Yuanxin, deputy minister of the publicity department of Beihai Municipal People's Government, said in a speech that the Belt and Road Initiative is a way to boost trade and business cooperation and cultural exchanges between China and the United Kingdom.He said he hopes that, through the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, China and the UK can enhance their cooperation around tourism, culture, and business.During an event called International Media Focusing on Beihai, organizers encouraged international media organizations to visit the city to "have a real look".Robert Dryden, a councilor and former mayor who represents Cherry Hinton on Cambridge City Council, said the event was the start of a friendship between Beihai and Cambridge.Dryden expressed an interest in being a link between the two cities in order to push forward cooperation and communication on culture and education.During a visit to Beihai in 2017, China's president called on the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region to capitalize on its advantages and play a bigger role in the Belt and Road Initiative, saying the region should make full use of its geographical location, coastline, rivers, and border areas.Tieshan Port in Beihai City has seen a significant rise in its annual cargo-handling capacity in recent years, improving from a capacity of around 1 million tons to more than 20 million tons, according to media reports.

                The biomedicine threat could become real
            </a>
            <p>
                Biomedical advances in recent decades have been hugely beneficial－particularly for the world's poor, whose life expectancy has increased dramatically. But the future looks dangerous. Although continued innovation will further improve people's lives, it will also give rise to new threats, and sharpen some ethical dilemmas concerning human life itself.For starters, some scientists are looking into extreme ways of enabling people to live longer. Although we would almost certainly welcome an extended, healthy lifespan, many of us would not want to prolong matters once our quality of life or prognosis dips below a certain threshold. Some people dread to live in the grip of, say, dementia, or being a drain on resources.Medical progress is also blurring the transition between life and death. Today, death is normally taken to mean "brain death", when all measurable signs of brain activity cease. But now there are proposals to restart the heart artificially after "brain death", in order to keep transplantable organs "fresh" for a longer time. Which would add to the moral ambiguity of transplant surgery.Already, for example, unscrupulous "agents" are persuading people in less developed countries to sell organs that will then be resold at a much higher price for the benefit of potential wealthy recipients.These ambiguities, and the shortage of organ donors, will only increase. One priority, therefore, must be to make xenotransplantation－harvesting organs from pigs or other animals for human use－routine and safe. An even better option, although further off, could be 3D printing of replacement organs, using similar techniques to those currently being developed to make artificial meat.Advances in microbiology may also prove to be a double-edged sword. True, better diagnostics, vaccines and antibiotics should help to sustain health, control disease and contain pandemics. But this very progress has sparked a dangerous evolutionary counterattack by pathogens, with bacteria becoming immune to the antibiotics used to suppress them.This growing resistance has already led to a resurgence in tuberculosis. Without new antibiotics, the risks posed by untreatable postoperative infections will rise back to where they were a century ago. Preventing the overuse of existing antibiotics－including in American cattle－and incentivizing the development of new treatments is thus an urgent short-and long-term priority.And yet there are also risks associated with the race to develop improved vaccines. In 2011, researchers in the Netherlands and the United States demonstrated that it was surprisingly simple to make the H5N1 influenza virus both more virulent and more transmissible. Some argued that staying a step ahead of natural mutations would make it easier to produce vaccines in short order. But critics of the experiments pointed out the increased risk of dangerous viruses being released unintentionally, or of bioterrorists gaining access to new techniques.Rapid innovation in biotech demands that we explore regulations to keep experiments safe, control the spread of potentially dangerous knowledge, and police the ethics of how new techniques are being applied. But effective worldwide enforcement of such rules would be virtually impossible. If something can be done, then someone, somewhere, will do it. Which is a potentially terrifying prospect.Whereas producing a nuclear weapon requires elaborate special-purpose technology, biotech involves small-scale, dual-use equipment. In fact, bio-hacking is an increasingly popular hobby and competitive game. Because our world has become so interconnected, the magnitude of the worst potential bio-catastrophes is greater than ever. Yet far too many people are in denial about this.Today, a natural pandemic would have a far greater social impact than in times past. Mid-14th-century Europeans, for example, were understandably a fatalistic lot, and villages continued to function even when the Black Death killed half their inhabitants. But these days, the feeling of entitlement in many developed countries is so strong that the social order would collapse as soon as a pandemic overwhelms the healthcare system.Nor is it scaremongering to highlight the human risks of bio error or bio terror. After all, the spread of an artificially released pathogen can be neither predicted nor controlled. That fact inhibits the use of bioweapons by governments, or even by terrorist groups with specific aims. But an unbalanced loner with biotech expertise would not necessarily feel so constrained if he or she believes that there are too many humans on the planet.Both bio error and bio terror are possible. And the risk will become even greater in the longer term once it becomes possible to design and synthesize viruses. The ultimate nightmare would be a highly lethal bioweapon that has the transmissibility of the common cold.Yet perhaps the greatest dilemma concerns human beings themselves. At some point in the future, genetic modification and cyborg technologies could make humans mentally and physically malleable. Worse, such evolution－a kind of secular "intelligent design"－would take only centuries, in contrast to the thousands of centuries needed for Darwinian evolution.That really would be a game changer. Today, when we admire the literature and artifacts that have survived from antiquity, we feel an affinity across thousands of years with those ancient artists and their civilizations. "Human nature" has not changed for millennia.But there is no reason to assume that the dominant intelligence a few centuries from now will have any emotional resonance with us, even though they may have an algorithmic understanding of how we behaved. Will they even be recognizably human? Or, will electronic entities have taken over the world by then? It is anyone's guess.The author, a cosmologist and astrophysicist, has been Britain's astronomer royal since 1995.

                Hotbed for global researchers
            </a>
            <p>
                When the first weekend of the New Year will see millions of people uphold their resolutions, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) will welcome hundreds of young scholars to its Global Scientists Forum.The 2019 Global Scientists Forum attracted over 300 young scholars from Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Oxford, Cambridge, National University of Singapore, University of Sydney, University of Tokyo and other top universities. This is a start of a whole year university campaign for talented young researchers around the world.With SUSTech located in China’s innovation capital of Shenzhen, it provides young researchers with superior scientific research conditions and unlimited possibilities for development.SUSTech President Chen Shiyi welcomed the young scholars, saying “We hope that more young scholars would join us to make great progress in your academic career.”SUSTech has welcomed over 800 faculty members to its ranks. More than 90% have worked overseas, and more than 60% have worked or studied in a top 100 university. SUSTech has invited 27 academicians and 35 international fellows to join us. This ratio of prestigious scholars on campus in mainland China’s universities is outstandingly high and impressive.As a rising research university, SUSTech is ambitious and forward-looking. Head of Computer Science and Engineering Chair Professor Yao Xin said “SUSTech can provide everything I need to conduct the cutting edge research project here.”Professor Yao is a world leading expert in artificial intelligence. Prior to joining SUSTech, he was a Chair Professor at the University of Birmingham and Director of the Center for Computational Intelligence and Application R&D (CERCIA). His mission as part of joining SUSTech was to build a world class computer science department in China within ten years.“The university is situated in the heart of the city, which means we are surrounded by high-tech companies like Huawei, Tencent, DJI, and to name a few,” said Professor Yao Xin. SUSTech is connected to the industries so it remains very easy for SUSTech researchers and scientists to start their technology application project and find potential support in the society.Many scientists have joined SUSTech to work with the smartest people and conduct research in fields that offer unique or unknown opportunities in the future.Young scholars have traditionally had difficulty in gaining support for their research. However, SUSTech has implemented the PI research management system, allowing all scholars to access funding and laboratories, whether shared or individual, and have the potential to lead a research group.SUSTech has maintained a high funding rate for national-level projects among mainland Chinese universities for the past three years. The high funding rate comes from the support by the Office of Research and other university departments, who ensure that our scholars can achieve at the highest levels.SUSTech has received funding for 193 National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) projects in 2019, up more than 50% on last year. The total amount of funds has exceeded 100 million RMB for the first time in SUSTech’s history, and represents an increase of over 84% on 2018.In order to fully integrate the innovative ability of the City of Shenzhen, SUSTech set up an industry-university research platform early in its establishment. The role of Technology Transfer Center (TTC) is to facilitate the process by connecting the university, enterprises and government bodies to share resources and encourage professors to innovate and transform the scientific research results for the betterment of society.There are also many examples of our scientists guiding R&D at various enterprises, helping them master new technologies. For example, Associate Professor Sun Dazhi, Professor Tian Yanqing and Professor Cheng Xin teamed up with Shandong pigment companies to realize the industrialization of high-end ultramarine inorganic pigment products.With those support, SUSTech faculty members thrive and achieve success in different ways. In 2018, Nature Index ranked SUSTech 28th among mainland Chinese universities, based on SUSTech publications in world class journals like Science and Nature. With the establishment of two key research centers named after Nobel Laureates and national level research institutes focused on 5G, future communications, system design, AI, quantum science and big data, SUSTech will continue to attract the global talented young scientists to join.

                Britain to resume two-year working visa for foreign graduates
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday announced a new immigration system to enable international students to stay for two years in Britain to find work after graduation.In a joint statement from 10 Downing Street, Johnson and senior ministers unveiled new plans aimed at attracting and retaining "the brightest and best talent" from around the world.The move reversed a decision made in 2012 by then-Home Secretary Theresa May that forced overseas students to leave within four months after finishing a degree."International students make up half of all full-time post-graduate students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) subjects," said the statement."The new immigration route announced Wednesday will mean international graduates in any subject, including STEM, will be able to stay in the UK for two years to find work," it said.The change will apply to international students who start courses at undergraduate level or above from next year onwards. Students will need to have successfully completed a degree from a trusted British university or higher education provider which has a proven track record in upholding immigration checks and other rules on studying in Britain.Under the policy change, there is no restriction on the types of jobs students would have to seek and no cap on numbers.The government said the change would open up opportunities for future breakthroughs in science, technology and research and other world-leading work that international talent brings to Britain."Evidence shows that international students bring significant positive social outcomes to the UK as well as 26 billion pounds in economic contributions, but for too long the lack of post-study work opportunities in the UK has put us at a competitive disadvantage in attracting those students," said Alistair Jarvis, CEO of Universities UK.

                Chinese mainland now home to Asia's two best universities
            </a>
            <p>
                The Chinese mainland now hosts the two best universities in Asia, according to the latest edition of the Times Higher Education World University Rankings.The report shows Peking University has overtaken the National University of Singapore to take second position among Asian institutions, and Tsinghua University is the first.The Chinese mainland also has the most universities in the top 200 listing from among Asian economies, with seven making the list.The two best Asian universities, Tsinghua University and Peking University, are in 23rd and 24th position, respectively, on the global stage.Some Chinese mainland institutions saw their rankings slip, with Nanjing University falling 10 places to joint 144th, and Zhejiang University falling six places to joint 107th.But,overall, the picture is one of continued progress.Shanghai Jiao Tong University leapfrogged numerous United States and United Kingdom institutions to rise 32 places, to joint 157th, driven mainly by a significant increase in its research environment and its industry income score.Globally, the Chinese mainland is in joint sixth place in terms of the number of universities it has in the top 200 – tied with Canada and Switzerland, demonstrating that while it has succeeded in getting more institutions onto the list, it has not yet broken the Anglo-American dominance at the highest level.Outside the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong continues to perform well, given its size, with five institutions making the global top 200, of which three are in the top 60.The University of Hong Kong still leads the charge, in 35th place, one higher than last year. It is the only Hong Kong university in the top 200 to have improved its position on last year. The region's four other institutions in the top 200 each fell, by between four and 16 places.The National Taiwan University is the only institution from Taiwan to have made the top 200, rising 50 places to joint 120th. The strong performance was primarily due to improved citation scores.Phil Baty, Times Higher Education chief knowledge officer, said: "It has long been clear that the emerging countries of Asia are going to play an increasingly powerful role among the global elite of higher education. It must also be stated, however, that the traditional Anglo-American powerhouses will not be displaced at the top of our rankings with ease."Ellie Bothwell, Times Higher Education rankings editor, said: "The most noteworthy development in Asia over the past 12 months is that mainland China is now home to the top two universities in the continent for the first time, after taking the number one spot last year – a remarkable achievement."British and US universities have continued to dominate the upper echelons of this year's rankings. The University of Oxford once again tops the table, with its rival UK institution, the University of Cambridge, dropping to third place behind the California Institute of Technology. Stanford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology round out the top five.The US is home to 60 of the world's top 200 universities, with 10 of them from the state of California. US institutions did see a slight drop in their average ranking overall, although among countries with more than 50 entrants, US universities are still ranked highest on average.Europe makes a strong showing once again, with almost half of the global top 200 coming from the continent.Baty said: "Future editions of the World University Rankings will most likely reveal intense competition, and while European and American institutions face significant hurdles, Chinese and other Asian universities have challenges of their own they must meet. These include ensuring that the excellent academics they produce do not move abroad to more established institutions in Europe and North America, promoting a culture of scholarly creativity and freedom, and boosting ties with nations across the globe."

                Undergraduate research at SUSTech: To cultivate intellectual maturity
            </a>
            <p>
                Three months ago, Hu Qikun, a student of the Department of Chemistry of Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), received many Ph.D. offers from top universities including Cambridge University and Princeton University, but in fact, he is only a junior.Why do many famous universities fancy him? His passport is six high-qualified papers published on the world's authoritative journals, which made him become a legend among the academics. However, pearls are everywhere but not the same as the eyes. There was a talent scout as well as good teacher behind him, Xu Zongxiang, an associate professor in the Department of Chemistry of SUSTech.Dr. Hu, an undergraduateThe story begins with a US laboratory that sought cooperation from SUSTech to complete a set of experiments on the application of photovoltaic devices for new materials. Though this is an important task for the professionals, as an undergraduate, Hu Qikun was chosen to take part in. The truth is that he was qualified and well-prepared for challenging tasks all the time.In December 2018, Hu Qikun published two papers in the internationally renowned journal Solar RRL and Catalyst Today in the field of energy and catalysis as the first author. Both papers completed the main experiment and paper writing. It is not easy for undergraduates to publish articles in internationally renowned academic journals. It is even more difficult to publish an article as the first author, let alone publish two. Since then, he continued to make achievements in scientific research. So far, he has published 2 first-author research papers in the Journal of High-Level Materials and Energy Chemistry, and has co-authored 4 papers, one of which has just been accepted by Advanced Energy Materials."In my research group, there are masters’ and doctoral students, but on many issues, they have to ask Hu Qikun, the undergraduate." Xu Zongxiang said proudly. Zheng Zhiping, the head of the Department of Chemistry of SUSTech, also said "His research results can completely write a doctoral thesis." The students simply called Hu Qikun "Dr. Hu."Interest drives achievementsAnother reason why Hu Qizhen has had such remarkable achievements is the research conditions on offer at SUSTech.Xu Zongxiang said that Hu Qikun came to SUSTech from Fujian Province. "I know his personality very well. He used to like to do research before, so I said that SUSTech is your place." Hu agreed and said that the laboratories in SUSTech opened for undergraduates is what attracts him most.As a productive researcher, Hu Qikun believes that it is not talent that can result in many papers, but diligence. This is true for all other researchers who write many papers. In his opinion, his papers reflect his persistent efforts and hard works over the He loves his experiments and has arranged his life around them. While some people may find this lifestyle boring, but Hu Qikun loves it because he can do what he loves. Hu Qikun is also sure that his future achievements will be just as fruitful as his previous achievements. He is now preparing for summer exchanges overseas and applying for further study at the end of the year.SUSTech endeavors to provide an abundant set of resources with world-class research centers, platforms and top talent teams, in order to produce more innovative talents. Hu Qikun is not the only undergraduate student who published papers on journals.In March, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) journal, IEEE Transaction of Communication published the graduation project of two graduates. 2018 graduates Bojie Lv and Lexiang Huang had their graduation project accepted as a paper in the journal.In April, at the 14th IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems (IEEE-NEMS Conference), 2016 undergraduate students Niu Jinchuan and Zhang Hongyong, respectively, from Assistant Professor Hu Chengzhi’s group in the Department of Mechanical and Energy Engineering was invited for their academic papers were accepted by the conference. Niu Jinchuan gave an oral presentation at the conference.The paper of Zhang Hongyong was titled “Development of Retina Cell-laden Alginate Microbeads for Study of Glaucoma.” The project delved into the fabrication method of three-dimensional cell spheroids based on a flow-focusing microfluidic system to realize high-speed cell encapsulation in hydrogel.The paper of Niu Jinchuan was titled “Electrodeposition of Magnetic Alginate-poly-L-lysine Microcapsules for Targeted Drug Delivery.” The study presented a method for preparing magnetic microcapsules by using microelectrode technology to assist electrodeposition of alginate hydrogel.In July, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) undergraduate Zisheng Zhang (2019) published his research as an outcome of the innovation project from the Department of Chemistry. His research on photocatalytic hydrogen production was conducted within the research groups of Prof. Meng Gu from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering and Prof. Limin Huang from the Department of Chemistry. Working with postdoctoral researcher Ruyi Zhong, their research was published as cover articles for two academic journals, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental (IF = 14) and Catalysis Science & Technology (IF = 5.4). With his outstanding papers, he has earned a full scholarship to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

                Top British troupe to make China debut of Shakespeare classics
            </a>
            <p>
                Cambridge Shakespeare Festival artistic director David Crilly will lead his troupe to stage classic Shakespeare dramas in the hometown of Chinese playwright Tang Xianzu in East China's Jiangxi province during a Sino-British culture exchange week in October.The premiers of the dramas including "Hamlet" and "Romeo and Juliet" will be a highlight at the Tang Xianzu International Theater Exchange Month held in the city of Fuzhou from Oct 19 to the end of November. 　　The Tang Xianzu-themed exchange event has been held for three consecutive years in Fuzhou, with the attendance of foreign diplomatic envoys and cultural officers from more than 20 countries, said Zhang Hongxing, mayor of Fuzhou. Tang Xianzu, a great Chinese playwright of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), is known as the Shakespeare of Asia.In the cultural exchange promotion, Fuzhou is building an art town with the name "Sanweng," which literally means "Three Seniors" in memory of Tang, Shakespeare and Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes. The three literary giants from East and West were all active in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, and all died in the year 1616. 　　During the upcoming exchange month, two lectures will be given by Alan Macfarlane, professor of social anthropology at the University of Cambridge, and Lucy Hamilton, editor-in-chief of literature at Cam Rivers Publishing. 　　A slew of cultural activities including an international academic symposium on Tang Xianzu and the Sino-British Culture and Travel Week will be held.
