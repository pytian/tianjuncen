            <p>
                Jonathan Anderson's Loewe costumes make the perfect match for performance artist Anthea Hamilton at Tate BritainIf you like your art a little more interactive than canvases sitting in a frame and sculptures on a plinth, The Squash is for you.Created for the annual Tate Britain Commission, which invites contemporary British artists to create new artwork in response to the grand space of the Duveen Galleries, this year's immersive installation combines performance and sculpture by 2016 Turner Prize nominee Anthea Hamilton.The artist, in tandem with her good friend, Loewe creative director and designer Jonathan Anderson, has created seven somewhat surreal, spiffy and spoofy costumes to be worn by the cast. Hamilton has transformed the heart of Tate Britain into an elaborate stage for the continuous six-month performance of a single character, dressed in a colorful squash-like costume.More than 7,000 white floor tiles have been laid across the Duveens and encase a series of large sculptures that serve as podiums for a number of works of art from Tate's collection, chosen by Hamilton for their organic forms and colors. The tiles create an immersive new environment within the neoclassical galleries.Each day, the show focuses on a single character, dressed in one of seven colorful Loewe costumes inspired by the colors and shapes of squashes and pumpkins. The clothes also feature voluminous sleeves, bold patterns and legume-style headwear. Each performer selects a costume that reflects their presentation of that day's characters as they move around the space.The organic texture of the costumes was created using handpainted leather and printed silk crepon, while 1970s clothing references have shaped some of the silhouettes. (And note the somewhat surprising retro-reference to the sea monsters from the BBC's long-running TV series Doctor Who.)

                AVIC unveils $400m property in Kenya
            </a>
            <p>
                The Aviation Industry Corporation of China, or AVIC, has unveiled a $400 million property in Nairobi, making it its most expensive investment in Africa's real estate sector so far.Dubbed 'A Dream City and Community', the Global Trade Center is set to redefine the city's skyline with six towers rising at the outskirts of the central business district in a unique setting that is the first of its kind. Sitting on 7.5 acres of prime land, GTC comprises six towers: four residential blocks ranging between 103-116 meters, a 184-meter-high office building, and a 143-meter-high tower occupied by the star-studded US chain JW Marriott hotel. It also includes a boutique mall."Starting from the planning phase, GTC has closely collaborated with various renowned architectural design teams. Thanks to the contribution from a strong lineup of big name international firms and individuals that are known as visionaries in the industry of urban and architecture design, GTC manages to bring together the leading concepts in contemporary complex planning as well as the specific needs in the development of Nairobi city," said AVIC's general manager Wang Long.Speaking during a media tour of the facility, the general manager disclosed that the project has contributed more than $8 million in taxes to the government and generated approximately 2,000 jobs directly and indirectly."In the foreseeable future, GTC will drive global capital and intelligence from Nairobi and the entirety of East Africa into endless momentum for the development of itself as well as the region, nurturing an ultra-premium city complex that is vibrant, full of opportunities and potential for further value appreciation," said Wang, adding that the property will eventually grow into a high-quality neighborhood that combines offices, residences, networking and consumption, "unveiling a brilliant new epoch of GTC in the future."

                AVIC's African HQ to stand tall in Nairobi
            </a>
            <p>
                High-rise near city's central business district also houses mall, hotel Nairobi will be the official home of eastern and central Africa's tallest building, with the unveiling on Sept 19 of the Global Trade Center, which is set to be the new African headquarters of Aviation Industry Corp of China International. The building complex, on 3 hectares acres near the city's central business district, will comprise six towers upon completion: four residential buildings, a commercial building and a JW Marriott hotel and a boutique mall.  From Left: Brian Mwangi, head of marketing for the Global Trade Center; Shang Yuiun, deputy general manager of GTC; Wang Long, general manager of GTC; Kacob Kibwage, environmental consultant; and Patrick Muiru, supervising engineer of the project, attend at the unveiling ceremony of GTC. Lucie Morangi / China DailyThe commercial building will be the tallest in the complex, at 184 meters. The more than $400 million project, expected to be opened in 2020, is dramatically changing the city's skyline, says Wang Long, the project's general manager. "The GTC will become a brand-new icon for the entire country, duly uplifting Kenya's international profile while leading the region's efforts toward future prosperity," he says. The Global Trade Center is the second notable real estate investment by the Chinese company, which earlier invested $64 million in the Two Rivers Mall, a 65,000-square-meter facility on the outskirts of Nairobi that opened last year. AVIC International continues to be the largest private investor in the region. Wang says the building, which combines global standards and cutting-edge technology, is bound to attract multinational tenants interested in using Kenya as a platform to reach other parts of Africa. "The office tower, which sets records for building height and level of services, software and hardware configuration in East Africa, will be an ideal home for Fortune Global 500 corporations and renowned international enterprises," says Wang. The project is also an indication of an upswing in investment flow into the East African nation, he adds. Patrick Muiru, the project's consulting engineer, says the biggest challenge for the project - which he says is setting new standards for the region's real estate sector - has been coordinating with various suppliers and contractors to come up with best practices and comply with global standards. "The local regulations are still underdeveloped for futuristic development such as this. But we worked closely with the local government and indeed set the pace for reforms in the sector that will (lead to) accelerated development of similar ventures. It has gone beyond the norm," he says. Muiru, who calls the project a unique concept, says the mixed-use development, which will combine residential, office, shopping mall and hotel functions, will reduce the need for travel time, which he says is important in a rapidly growing city where traffic jams are quickly becoming the norm. Muiru adds that he hopes the building complex will inspire Nairobi's urban planning. "I think the city needs an increased number of high-rise buildings that can accommodate more people to improve the efficient use of land." lucymorangi@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Africa Weekly 09/21/2018 page26)

                Sales of foreign alcohol brands used to be severely affected by the national anticorruption campaign, but many labels are now making a resurgence thanks to young and sophisticated consumers who are eager to explore new tastesFor Huang Qifang, the highlight of her wedding banquet in 2015 was not the luxurious feast at the JW Marriott hotel in Shanghai, nor showing off the Korean-style wedding photos she spent tens of thousands of yuan on.Rather, it was the sight of a solitary bottle of Macallan 12 Year single malt whisky that was on one of the 20 tables. It is customary for the newlyweds to demonstrate their gratitude to their guests by serving premium alcohol at the banquet. The most common option is baijiu."Everyone was taking photos of the bottle and posting it on their social networks, calling me the first and coolest bride they have seen to offer whisky to guests," said Huang."And it was only priced at 380 yuan ($56) a bottle back then, much cheaper than the Wuliangye (Chinese liquor) I put on the other 19 tables," added the 33-year-old Shanghai native.

                Vietnam's Hanoi all ready for hosting US-DPRK summit
            </a>
            <p>
                HANOI - Minutes after several young men erected three large panels featuring US and DPRK national flags, a dove and an olive branch outside the Cultural Friendship Palace in Hanoi, a Vietnamese government official announced that preparations for the upcoming US-DPRK summit have been complete."Our preparations (for the second summit between US President Donald Trump and the top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Kim Jong Un slated for Feb. 27-28 in Hanoi) have been complete in all fields," Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Le Hoai Trung told reporters Monday at the palace, which acts as the summit's international media center.According to him, preparatory work for the summit, including security, healthcare and communications, has been done very well under the direction and inspection of Vietnamese senior leaders, including Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, as well various ministries and sectors.Regarding security issues, the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security has instructed different units from central to local levels, and coordinated with the Ministry of Defense and other relevant agencies to devise and implement specific plans.Security forces of the United States and the DPRK have also joined in to safeguard the summit, and ensure safety of delegates at their accommodations and on the way, the deputy minister said."Vietnam has flexibility and charm in providing security at the maximum level for the coming summit," he noted.On Tuesday morning, Hanoi Police Department held a dispatching ceremony for all police units, including traffic police and flying squads. Thousands of police officers were mobilized.Following a long procession of high-capacity motorcycles driven by traffic police officers in lemon yellow uniforms were several green-colored armored vehicles with big wheels.Earlier, Hanoi's police chief, lieutenant general Doan Duy Khuong, announced stringent security measures, including around-the-clock watch of important sites across the city, such as Noi Bai International Airport, train and coach stations. A total of 96 patrol teams were also dispatched to guard and suppress criminal activities everyday from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m.At Khuong's request, the Ministry of Public Security also dispatched 500 mobile police officers to assist Hanoi's police.Besides police officers at important sites and on roads, Vietnamese soldiers wearing black armors bearing the name "Bomicen" outside their camouflage uniforms can also be seen meticulously scanning every flower pot and expanse of short grass at potential venues for the summit and the hotels US and DPRK delegations may be staying.Such metal scanning by "Bomicen" young men has taken place at the international media center and JW Marriott Hotel which has received a lot of US equipment and vehicles, including the US presidential state car nicknamed "The Beast" over the past few days. "Bomicen" is the initials of the Technology Center for Bomb and Mine Disposal under Vietnam's Engineering Command.Concerning healthcare issues, the Ministry of Health has been taking measures to ensure hygiene, disease control, food safety, quarantine, and some major hospitals in Hanoi have been assigned to stand ready for health-related emergencies around the clock, Trung said.Other preparatory work relating to facilities, infrastructure, communications and protocol have also been complete, although Vietnam "has only 10 days to prepare for the second summit," compared with Singapore having nearly two months to prepare for the first US-DPRK summit in June last year, the deputy minister stressed.At noon of Sunday, on the pavement in front of Melia Hotel, which has been believed to receive the DPRK delegation, chairman of Hanoi's People Committee (the municipal government) Nguyen Duc Chung, was seen instructing hotel staff to put up long banners featuring iconic images of Hanoi, and place red flowers on the pavement."Regarding decorations, we have finished erection of 95 banner clusters, hanging at 3,000 sites of national flags of the three countries (the DPRK, the United States and Vietnam), and erections of 27 large LED screens," Chung told reporters on Monday.A total of 550 Vietnamese reporters and nearly 3,000 foreign journalists from over 200 foreign media outlets of nearly 40 countries and regions will cover the summit, Vietnamese Minister of Information and Communications Nguyen Manh Hung said.

                JW Marriott Beijing GM: Luxury hotels need to go back to basic
            </a>
            <p>
                Leading one of the most prestigious luxury hotels at Beijing's heart of CBD, Priscilla Wong said she can't help judge wherever she checks in from the perspective of a general manager."Smile and eye contact at the front desk are always the first things I care," she said, adding these norms are universal. "The next I will observe forgotten concerns for sanitary," she said as she removed a tissue box from a tea table in a presidential suite where she sat down for the interview. "For example under the tissue box."Joining the JW Marriott Hotel Beijing since the hotel's opening in 2007 before playing a key role in the pre-opening stage, she puts forward the company's core culture heart and soul: "Take care of our associates, and our associates will take care of our guests".That is what she believes women managers are good at: women are more likely to listen and talk."I always ask myself to develop conversations with my associates, I mean, to ask open questions instead of reviewing reports and forms," Wong said, referring "open questions" as "what, how, why and etc" instead of those answered by "yes" or "no". "As you develop your seniority, you will miss more and more valuable information from that 'one-way' communication.”She takes developing conversations as key to discovering problems and opportunities to improve, even with subordinates who are quitting the job. "The farewell conversation could turn out to be fruitful because I believe information is power."The JW Marriott Beijing leader lives in the habit of kicking off daily work by welcoming guests at the front desk or giving a helping hand at the breakfast buffet. By working together with her employees, she taps more opportunities to improve the hotel and makes more friends with global guests.She inspects the hotel for any slack in quality and has back-to-back meetings with associates or receives VIP guests during the rest of the day.Her working style embodies her administrative philosophy - hotel is a people-business. Working with this philosophy, she boasts quite a number of loyal employees and guests.Contact the writer at guanxm@chinadaily.com.cn

                Experts say world will pay price of Washington's protectionist stance
            </a>
            <p>
                As China published a white paper on Sunday denouncing US unilateral and protectionist measures, foreign business and trade experts said that protectionism must be avoided as it is shortsighted and will have an adverse effect on the global economy in the long run.The white paper, "China's Position on the China-US Economic and Trade Consultations" issued by the State Council Information Office, sets out China's stance on the damage caused by the trade friction provoked by the United States, and China's commitment to credible consultations based on equality and mutual benefit.Christopher Bovis, professor of international business law at the University of Hull in the United Kingdom, noticed that as the US administration has maintained a US-centric trade policy with protectionist and nationalistic features, it has departed from the principle of free trade and embarked upon a series of trade wars with its major partners across the world, including China."Protectionism is shortsighted. The reason for such irrational behavior is the US needs to renegotiate WTO rules and take away some of the advantages of market access which have been offered to other economies over the past 20 years."However, this runs contrary to a global integration agenda which has been sought by international institutions and governments worldwide with the objective of trade liberalization and the elimination of protection and preferences by governments to national industries," Bovis said.Commenting on China's stance on the Sino-US trade negotiation, Tom Harper, doctoral researcher at the University of Surrey, said Beijing sees the trade conflict as a US attempt to contain its ascent and derail the Made in China 2025 initiative."Beijing is unlikely to back down regardless of the threats made by the Trump administration. What is notable is that the legacy of history has been invoked, with Trump's demands bringing back memories of the 'unequal treaties' of the 19th century for the Chinese," Harper said."It is China's long-term vision that has been instrumental in its success rather than simplistic perceptions that China has only advanced through IP theft or being able to manufacture what has been conceived elsewhere," he added.Trumpeting "America First", the current US administration has adopted a series of unilateral and protectionist measures, regularly wielded tariffs as a "big stick" and coerced other countries into accepting its demands, the white paper said.Jock O'Connell, an international trade adviser for California-based independent research and consulting company Beacons Economics, said in a globalized world the logic of protecting one's own interests at the expense of damaging those of its trading partners is problematic."Too many of the Trump administration's demands go to the heart of Chinese economic policy and even touch on the issue of national sovereignty. Washington's calls for reforming an economic system that has worked very well for China over the past 40 years seem absurd," O'Connell said.Tim Harcourt, a JW Nevile fellow in economics at UNSW Business School in Sydney, Australia, said that China and the US will eventually reach an agreement.Andy Rothman, an investment strategist at San Francisco-based investment firm Matthews Asia, said that it is still possible that the two can achieve reconciliation, "but only through dialogue and more engagement."Lia Zhu in San Francisco, Karl Wilson in Sydney and Pan Mengqi in Beijing contributed to this story.
