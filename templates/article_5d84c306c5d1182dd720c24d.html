                Former revolutionary base becomes tourism magnet
            </a>
            <p>
                In the western suburbs of Beijing, Xiangshan Park, or the Fragrant Hills, is known as a prime place in China for viewing autumn foliage.Now the red leaves have another meaning. More people have realized they symbolize the country's revolutionary years as eight revolutionary memorial sites in the area opened to the public. It has become a magnet for tourists who want to view historical relics and related cultural information.In March 1949, the Communist Party of China Central Committee had its headquarters in the Fragrant Hills. Chairman Mao Zedong lived in Shuangqing Villa from which he directed the military campaign that sent soldiers across the Yangtze River and led to the collapse of the Kuomintang regime.
