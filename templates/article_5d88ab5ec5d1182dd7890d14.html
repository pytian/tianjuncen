                Sudan military, opposition reach power sharing accord
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                          KHARTOUM - Sudan's Transitional Military Council and protest leaders reached an agreement on the disputed issue of a new governing body on Friday, in a breakthrough power sharing accord aimed at ending the country's monthslong political crisis.              The landmark agreement came after two days of talks following the collapse of the previous round of negotiations in May over who should lead the new ruling body - a civilian or a soldier.                  "The two sides agreed on establishing a sovereign council with a rotating military and civilian (presidency) for a period of three years or little more," African Union mediator Mohamed el-Hacen Lebatt told reporters.                      Sudan has been rocked by a political crisis since the army ousted longtime president Omar al-Bashir, with the generals who seized power resisting demonstrators' demands to hand it over to a civilian administration.                          "We want to reassure all political forces and armed movements and all those who took part in the change ... that this agreement is all inclusive and does not exclude anyone," deputy chairman of the ruling military council, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, said in a statement.                              For his part, Omer Al-Digair, a leading member of the opposition Freedom and Change Alliance, said this agreement paved the way for the formation of a transitional government which would work for political, economic and social reforms in the African country.                                  Tension between the two sides had further soared after a raid on a protest camp outside army headquarters in the capital Khartoum that killed dozens of demonstrators and wounded hundreds on June 3.                                      Lebatt did not specify the exact makeup of the new ruling body, but prominent protest leader Ahmed al-Rabie said that it would comprise of six civilians, including five from the protest movement, and five members of the military.                                          The latest round of talks had resumed on Wednesday after intense mediation by Ethiopian and African Union envoys, who had put forward a draft proposal to break the deadlock.                                              The blueprint proposes a three-year transition period, with the presidency of the new ruling body to be held by the military for the first 18 months and a civilian for the second.                                                  However, it was still unclear if both sides had signed off on the military holding the post first.

                    Sudan investigating ousted president Bashir
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                KHARTOUM - Sudan's public prosecutor has begun investigating ousted President Omar al-Bashir on charges of money laundering and possession of large sums of foreign currency without legal grounds, a judicial source said on Saturday.The source said that military intelligence had searched Bashir's home and found suitcases loaded with more than $351,000 and six million euros, as well as five million Sudanese pounds."The chief public prosecutor... ordered the (former) president detained and quickly questioned in preparation to put him on trial," a judicial source told Reuters."The public prosecution will question the former president in Kobar prison," the source added. Bashir has not been questioned yet, said the source. Two of his brothers were also detained on allegations of corruption, the source said.Relatives could not be immediately reached on Saturday for comment about the investigation.Bashir, who is also being sought by the International Criminal Court (ICC) over allegations of genocide in the country's western Darfur region, was ousted on April 11 by the military following months of protests against his rule and had been held at a presidential residence.Bashir's family said this week that the former president had been moved to the high-security Kobar prison in Khartoum.Hassan Bashir, a professor of political science at the University of Neelain, said the measures against Bashir are intended as a message to other figures associated with his rule that they are not above the law."The trial is a step that the military council wants to take to satisfy the protesters by presenting al-Bashir for trial," he said.Bashir survived several armed rebellions, economic crises, and attempts by the West to turn him into a pariah during his 30-year rule before he was toppled in a military coup.At a sit-in outside Sudan's Ministry of Defence that began on April 6, protesters stood besides posters of Bashir that called on the ICC to put him on trial.The Sudanese Professionals' Association, leading the protests, has called for holding Bashir and members of his administration to account, a purge of corruption and cronyism and easing an economic crisis that worsened during Bashir's last years in power.On Wednesday, Sudan's transitional military council ordered the central bank to review financial transfers since April 1 and to seize "suspect" funds, according to state news agency SUNA.The council also ordered the "suspension of the transfer of ownership of any shares until further notice and for any large or suspect transfers of shares or companies to be reported" to authorities.Reuters

                    Sudanese protesters suspend talks with military
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                KHARTOUM, Sudan — The organizers of Sudan's protests said Sunday they have suspended talks with the ruling military council because it has failed to meet their demands for an immediate transfer to a civilian government following the overthrow of President Omar al-Bashir.Mohammed al-Amin Abdel Aziz, a spokesman for the Sudanese Professionals Association, said Sunday that the political committee of the military council is too close to al-Bashir, who has been jailed in the capital, Khartoum."The military council is delaying its response to our proposals, saying that they are considering proposals from all political forces," he said.He said the SPA is calling for more protests, and repeated its demand for an immediate transfer to a transitional civilian government that would rule for four years.The SPA led four months of protests that eventually ended al-Bashir's 30-year reign, which was marred by multiple armed conflicts and widespread corruption. The umbrella group of unions says around 100 people were killed by security forces since December, when the protests were sparked by a hike in the price of basic goods.The Sudanese military overthrew and arrested al-Bashir on April 11, and has appointed a military council that says it will rule for up to two years while elections are organized. The military has arrested senior officials from al-Bashir's government and sacked top judges and prosecutors.Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, the head of the military council, told state TV Sunday that the council is "ready to hand over power tomorrow to a civilian government agreed by political forces."He said the military is waiting for the various political factions behind the protests to submit the names of the proposed members of a transitional government, something the organizers had said they would do on Sunday. He said the military is considering the protesters' demands for a civilian council with a military representative."Our role is to complete the uprising and the blessed revolution," he added.The protesters fear the military — which is still dominated by al-Bashir appointees — will cling to power or appoint another general in his place.Mohammed al-Asam, a senior member of the SPA, told The Associated Press late Saturday that "we are ready with a clear plan for a transition with qualified names."The association had said it would announce the names at a press conference Sunday outside the military's headquarters in Khartoum, where thousands of protesters have kept up a sit-in since April 6. It was not immediately clear whether the announcement had been cancelled or delayed."We want a civil council immediately with a military representation. This is our demand," said al-Asam, who was detained for more than three months before being released after al-Bashir's ouster. He was held in the Koper prison in Khartoum, where al-Bashir and other top officials now reside.The 28-year-old doctor urged the international community to press the military to hand over power to civilians. He said the military council is becoming more powerful every day and that "this is dangerous to the revolution."Burhan said the military council will send a delegation to the United States later this month for talks on removing Sudan from the US list of state sponsors of terror, a designation that dates back to the early 1990s, when the country briefly hosted Osama bin Laden."We expect a breakthrough in this issue," he said.The military has also reached out to the African Union, saying it is working to "create an environment so political forces can rule in a peaceful and democratic way," according to the state-run SUNA news agency.SUNA said Lt. Gen. Omer Zain-al-Abdin, head of the political committee of the military council, met with AU commission chairman Moussa Faki in Khartoum on Saturday.The African Union on Monday gave Sudan's military 15 days to hand over power to a "civilian-led political authority" or face suspension from AU activities. The AU said a civilian authority should hold elections "as quickly as possible."Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates meanwhile announced a $3 billion aid package for Sudan. The Saudi state-run news agency said Sunday that $500 million would be deposited in Sudan's central bank, while the remaining amount will be used to purchase food, medicine and fuel.Burhan said authorities recently searched a presidential residence, where they found more than 7 million euros ($7.8 million) and $350,000 in US currency. The protesters have accused al-Bashir and his family of pillaging state resources during his three decades in power.AP

                KHARTOUM - Sudan's Transitional Military Council (TMC) on Sunday denied attempts to disperse a sit-in by thousands of Sudanese protesters in front of the army's general headquarters in Khartoum."A number of social media and local media outlets circulated reports that there were attempts by the armed forces and other regular forces to disperse the sit-in by force," the TMC said in a statement."We reiterate to all the citizens and the protesters at the sit-in ... that this talk is completely baseless," the statement added.The council, however, warned some groups not to block major roads in the capital Khartoum, saying "such a matter is totally rejected as it creates a kind of chaos which needs the authorities concerned to decisively address."Meanwhile, the major opposition Freedom and Change Alliance accused regular forces of attempting to disperse the sit-in."There are attempts to disperse the sit-in, where we reiterate that we will not allow that," the alliance said in a statement.The alliance called on the citizens in the neighborhoods of the capital and the neighboring areas to come out in rallies and head to the sit-in area in front of the army's headquarters.The TMC, chaired by Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan, is tasked with running Sudan's affairs following the ouster of former President Omar al-Bashir.

                KHARTOUM, Sudan — Sudan's former President Omar al-Bashir appeared in public on Sunday for the first time since his ouster, as he was led away to a prosecutor's office in a corruption probe.The deposed strongman has been held under arrest in the capital, Khartoum, since the military removed him from power in April amid mass protests against his 30-year rule.Sudan's top prosecutor Al-Waleed Mahmoud said al-Bashir was being questioned over corruption accusations that include money laundering and the possession of large amounts of foreign currency.A spokesman for the ruling military council, Lt. Co. Abdel-Latif al-Kabir, confirmed that this is the first time the ousted president was taken out from his prison in Khartoum.In May, al-Bashir was charged with involvement in killing protesters and incitement to kill protesters during the popular uprising that started in December, initially over the prices rises of basic goods and a failing economy, but which later turned into calls for his ouster. The military toppled him on April 11.Al-Bashir is also wanted by the International Criminal Court over charges of war crimes and genocide linked to the Darfur conflict in the 2000s, but the military has said it would not extradite him.AP
