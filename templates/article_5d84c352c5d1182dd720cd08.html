                Netanyahu says Israel might launch another strike in Lebanon
            </p>
            <p>
                JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that his country is ready to launch another attack at Hezbollah in Lebanon after fire exchanges broke out along the Lebanese border.Netanyahu said that he had held consultation with the army's command following an anti-tank missile attack launched by Hezbollah earlier in the afternoon."We are prepared for any scenario and will decide how to continue based on further events," he said, warning Hezbollah not to fire more missiles.Shortly after 16:00 p.m. local time (13:00 GMT), Hezbollah fired anti-tank missiles at an Israeli military position near the community of Avivim in northern Israel's upper Galilee near the Lebanese border.Jonathan Conricus, a spokesman with the Israeli military, told reporters that two or three Hezbollah missiles were fired and hit a battalion headquarters and a military ambulance. Both were damaged.There were no injuries among the Israeli forces.Conricus said that in response, the army attacked the Hezbollah squad that fired the missiles with about 100 artillery shells and attack helicopters."This is a scenario that we have been preparing for since Sunday," he said, referring to warnings issued by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who vowed to retaliate against an Israeli drone attack in Beirut last week."Hezbollah executed the attack. However, it failed to cause casualties," he said, adding that the army still "maintains a high level of alert."Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli army confirmed that it sparked fires near the border. According to Hezbollah's al-Manar media outlet, the fires were caused by incendiary materials dropped by Israeli drones.The recent violence was a sharp escalation between Israel and Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed armed group and movement.Israel and Hezbollah, which fought a bloody war in 2006, were on high alert over the past days in the wake of a series of Israeli airstrikes in Syria and Lebanon.

                Israel, Hezbollah exchange fire

                Arab League voices 'full solidarity' with Lebanon over ongoing escalationKIRYAT SHMONA, Israel - Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement exchanged fire along the Lebanese border after a week of rising tensions, sparking fears of an escalation and prompting concern from world powers.Israel said it had responded with around 100 artillery shells Sunday after Hezbollah fired two or three anti-tank missiles at a battalion headquarters and military ambulance, hitting both.Israeli officials refuted claims by the Hezbollah movement that it had killed and wounded those inside the Israeli military vehicle, saying there were no casualties."We are consulting about the next steps," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. "I have ordered that we be prepared for any scenario."The Arab League voiced on Sunday its concern over the ongoing military escalation, stressing "full solidarity" with Lebanon in confronting any aggressions."Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul-Gheit is following up with concern the developments of fire exchange in the border areas between Lebanon and Israel," Egypt's official MENA news agency quoted an Arab League official as saying.The official said on condition of anonymity that Aboul-Gheit reaffirmed the Cairo-based pan-Arab body's full solidarity with Lebanon "in confronting any assaults it is subjected to".The United Nations called for restraint and France said it had made "multiple contacts" to avert an escalation.The United States voiced concern over the "destabilizing role" of Iranian proxies in the region and said it "supports Israel's right to self-defense", a US State Department official said."Hezbollah should refrain from hostile actions which threaten Lebanon's security, stability and sovereignty," the official added.Earlier, Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri contacted senior US and French officials to urge their countries and the international community to intervene.Hours after the flare-up, Israeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus said the "tactical event" near Avivim, an Israeli community near the Lebanese border, was most likely over but that the "strategic situation is still ongoing".Israel had targeted the unit that fired the missiles, he said.Hezbollah said its fighters had "destroyed a military vehicle on the road to the Avivim barracks, killing and wounding those inside".Its Al-Manar TV said the group targeted a Wolf armored vehicle that can fit eight soldiers.After the initial reports of fire from Lebanon, an Israeli military spokesman said Israelis living within four kilometers of the border should remain at home and prepare shelters.Tensions have risen in the last week between Israel and its enemy Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite movement backed by Iran.Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said on Saturday that the militant movement had decided to respond to an alleged Israeli drone attack on the group's Beirut stronghold.Drone attack The predawn Aug 25 attack involved two drones - one exploded and caused damage to a Hezbollah-run media center and another crashed without detonating due to technical failure.Israel has not claimed responsibility for the incident, which came after it had launched strikes in neighboring Syria to prevent what it said was an impending Iranian drone attack on the Jewish state.Hezbollah says two of its members were killed in that strike.Major-General Stefano Del Col, the head of the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, said the "serious incident" violated the UN resolution ending the 2006 conflict.UN chief Antonio Guterres said he was "seriously concerned", according to a spokesman, and called "for maximum restraint".Sunday's escalation comes amid rising tensions pitting Iran against the US and its allies over a series of incidents involving shipping in sensitive Gulf waters.Bahrain, which hosts the US Fifth Fleet, on Sunday urged Bahraini citizens to leave Lebanon immediately.The United Arab Emirate's minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, tweeted that "our hearts are with Lebanon and the Lebanese"."The decision to make war, peace or stability should be the decision of the state," he tweeted, taking a jab at Hezbollah.The flare-up also comes ahead of Israel's Sept 17 elections.Netanyahu is seen as wanting to avoid a major conflict before the vote but he warned that the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah "knows very well that the state of Israel knows how to defend itself well, and to repay its enemies".Agencies

                Israel sends firefighters to aid Brazil battling Amazon fires

            <p>
                JERUSALEM - Israel said on Tuesday it was dispatching a team of firefighters to help Brazil with fighting the rampant fires in the Amazon rainforest.The team is comprised of eleven experts in the fields of rescue, intelligence, and forest fires, the Israeli foreign ministry said in a statement.It will provide "assistance and professional know-how to the Brazilian authorities, including the Brazilian government, military and firefighting authorities who are combatting the fires," the statement said.The foreign ministry said the delegation is being dispatched following a phone talk between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.Israel and Brazil have seen strengthening ties since Netanyahu arrived last December in Brazil ahead of Bolsonaro's presidential inauguration ceremony.Later, Bolsonaro paid a visit to Israel in April this year.The fires have been consuming huge parts of the Amazon rainforest, leading to global calls for Brazil to stop the fires.

                Israeli PM's annexation plan draws condemnation from Palestinian, Arab leaders
            </a>
            <p>
                CAIRO/JERUSALEM - Palestinian and Arab leaders on Tuesday condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to annex the occupied Jordan Valley in the West Bank, while warning it could kill the peace process.Netanyahu said on Tuesday that he would annex the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank right after Israel's Sept 17 election, if he wins re-election."I intend to apply Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea immediately after the elections," Netanyahu said in a televised speech.In angry reaction, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas warned that all peace agreements will end if Netanyahu moves to annex the Jordan Valley, northern Dead Sea or any part of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967."We have the right to defend our rights and achieve our goals by all available means, whatever the results are, since Netanyahu's decisions contradict the international legitimacy and international law," the Palestinians leader said.Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Saeb Erekat warned that Netanyahu's plan to annex part of the occupied West Bank will bury any chance of peace between the Palestinians and Israelis."If Netanyahu is allowed to implement his plan of annexation, he will succeed in burying any chance of peace between the Palestinians and Israelis. The Israeli and the international community must stop such madness," Erekat tweeted.Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Ishtaye also issued a statement, denouncing Netanyahu as a "destroyer of the peace process."The 2,400-sq-km Jordan Valley, which accounts for nearly 30 percent of the West Bank, is regarded to be strategic both in terms of security and agriculture.If Netanyahu moves to annex part of the West Bank, it would be a major shift from Israel's long-held policy and is set to trigger strong criticism from Arab countries and the international community, and even escalate violent clashes with the Palestinians.On Tuesday night, Netanyahu was whisked off the stage of an election rally, which was part of the Likud's campaign ahead of the Sept 17 parliamentary elections, after rockets fired from Gaza Strip triggered air raid sirens in the southern city of Ashdod.Video footages taken at the rally showed people running in panic and security guards escorting Netanyahu off the stage.A spokesperson with Netanyahu's Likud party told Xinhua that Netanyahu later returned to the stage to finish his speech.No group in Gaza immediately claimed responsibility for firing the rockets, which Israeli army said were intercepted by Israel's anti-rocket Iron Dome system.The Islamic Hamas movement, which controls the Gaza Strip, earlier accused Netanyahu of selling "illusion" to Israeli voters by vowing to annex parts of the occupied West Bank."Netanyahu is searching for the right-wing votes throughout selling his audience the illusion that he would keep the occupation of our land forever," said Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem.He also underscored the need to forge "a unified Palestinian position that adopts comprehensive resistance" against the Israeli plan to annex part of the occupied Palestinian territories of West Bank.Meanwhile, Arab foreign ministers, who held a meeting in Cairo, Egypt under the framework of the Arab League, condemned Netanyahu's plan as "a new Israeli offensive" that undermines peace chances.The ministers vowed they are prepared to take all legal and political actions to counter this unilateral Israeli policy.They also reaffirmed their adherence to the principles of the Arab position that supports the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.Currently, about 400,000 Jewish settlers live in some heavily guarded communities in the West Bank among some 2.8 million Palestinians.

                Israel faces potential deadlock in polls
            </a>
            <p>
                JERUSALEM - Israel is headed toward an unprecedented repeat election on Tuesday with no guarantee that the do-over vote will produce a more decisive result than the inconclusive one last April.The Israeli electorate is deeply divided and the fragmented parliamentary system makes coalition building a tricky business.In April, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seemed to have a clear path to power with his right-wing Likud party and its traditional Jewish ultra-Orthodox and nationalist allies securing a majority in parliament.But when Avigdor Lieberman's hard-line Yisrael Beitenu party objected to the parties' excessive influence, Netanyahu was left with just 60 supporters - one short of a majority. Instead of allowing an alternative candidate a chance to form a government, he dissolved parliament and called another snap election.Polls show Netanyahu's Likud and its main challenger, the centrist Blue and White party, in a head-to-head tight race. Both parties could struggle to form a majority coalition.A unity government between the two biggest parties may be the most reasonable way out of the gridlock, but the Blue and White has vowed not to serve under Netanyahu because of his likely indictment on corruption charges. Netanyahu, the longest serving leader in Israeli history, is unlikely to agree to sit in a government headed by anyone else.Meanwhile, the Israeli government agreed to turn the wildcat settlement of Mevoot Yericho in the Jordan Valley into an official settlement, the prime minister's office said.The approval follows Netanyahu's pledge last week to annex the Jordan Valley, which amounts to one-third of the West Bank, if he wins Tuesday's elections.Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas's spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, dismissed the entire cabinet meeting as illegal and called on the international community to "stop the Israeli madness aimed at destroying all the foundations of the political process".Peace Now, an Israeli NGO opposed to the settlements, said: "The government continues to show blatant disregard for reaching a two-state conflict-ending agreement with the Palestinians."The European Union and the United Nations condemned Netanyahu's Jordan Valley announcement last week.Beyond the cabinet approval, Netanyahu and opposition leader Benny Gantz were making last pitches to voters."Anyone who wants to ensure that we will continue to protect Israel, anyone who wants a strong right-wing government under my leadership, has to vote only (Likud)," Netanyahu wrote in Yediot Aharonot newspaper.Gantz argued he can heal divisions in Israeli society that he says Netanyahu has exacerbated."I see what kind of government Netanyahu wants to form: An extremist minority government that would decide for the majority and act toward immunity for Netanyahu," Gantz said.Agencies

                Netanyahu's political fate on the line as Israelis vote
            </a>
            <p>
                JERUSALEM - Israel voted in its second election in five months on Tuesday that will decide whether to extend Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's term as the country's longest-serving prime minister despite corruption allegations against him.The stakes could not be much higher for the 69-year-old right-wing leader who, as in April polls, faces a strong challenge from ex-military chief Benny Gantz and his centrist Blue and White alliance.Netanyahu voted in Jerusalem alongside his wife Sara and said he expected a close election, calling on Israelis to turn out in large numbers." (US) President (Donald) Trump said yesterday that the elections will be tight," Netanyahu said in reference to Monday's comments by the US leader, who has been a strong supporter of the premier, calling the polls"50/50"."I can guarantee you this morning that they are very tight."Gantz voted in his hometown of Rosh Haayin near Tel Aviv and called on the country to reject corruption and "extremism"."We want new hope. We are voting today for change," Gantz said after voting with his wife Revital."We will succeed in bringing hope. We will succeed in bringing change, without corruption and without extremism, all together."Polls opened at 7 am, local time, and were due to close in most areas at 10 pm.Ex-defense minister Avigdor Lieberman, Netanyahu's former right-hand man turned rival, could play a kingmaker role with his campaign to "make Israel normal again".About 6.4 million people are eligible to vote.The first exit surveys will be released just after polls close, while official results are not expected until Wednesday.Opinion polls have indicated another tight race, showing Netanyahu's Likud and Blue and White winning around 32 seats each in the 120-seat parliament.Netanyahu and Gantz paid a last-minute visit on Monday night to Jerusalem's Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews are allowed to pray. Netanyahu suffered one of the biggest defeats of his political career following the April vote.His Likud along with its right-wing and religious allies won a majority, leading Israeli President Reuven Rivlin to task the premier with forming a new government.But following weeks of discussions, Netanyahu failed, leading him to opt for an unprecedented second election rather than risk having Rivlin choose someone else.The danger for Netanyahu extends beyond remaining prime minister, a post he has held for a total of more than 13 years.If he wins, many believe he will seek to have parliament grant him immunity from prosecution while facing the possibility of a corruption indictment in the weeks ahead.Recognizing the stakes, Netanyahu spent the final days of the campaign seeking to appeal to right-wing nationalists - key to his reelection bid - and to boost turnout among his base.Those efforts have included a controversial pledge to annex the Jordan Valley, which makes up a third of the occupied West Bank.Agence France-Presse

                ISRAEL Parties deadlocked after repeat election Israel's two main political parties were deadlocked on Wednesday after an unprecedented repeat election, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing an uphill battle to hold onto his job. The election's seeming political kingmaker, Yisrael Beiteinu party chairman Avigdor Lieberman, said he will insist upon a secular unity government between Netanyahu's Likud and Benny Gantz's Blue and White parties. Based on partial results, the two parties have each won 32 seats in the 120-seat parliament. Without Lieberman's endorsement, both parties appear to have fallen well short of securing a parliamentary majority. UNITED STATES Trump lists finalists to replace Bolton US President Donald Trump on Tuesday revealed five potential candidates to replace John Bolton as the next national security adviser. Trump said he has narrowed the candidates to five people: Fred Fleitz, Bolton's former chief of staff; Robert O'Brien, a senior hostage affairs official at the State Department; Rick Waddell, a former deputy national security adviser; Keith Kellogg, the current national security adviser for Vice-President Mike Pence; and Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, the undersecretary for nuclear security at the Department of Energy.

                Netanyahu's challenger claims victory in Israeli elections
            </a>
            <p>
                JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's main rival, centrist Benny Gantz, claimed on Thursday victory in the closely-fought parliamentary elections.In a broadcast statement on Israel's main TV channels, he called on Netanyahu to join him to a "broad, liberal unity government under my leadership".He rejected Netanyahu's earlier call to form a unity government with Gantz' centrist Blue and White party and far-right and ultra-Orthodox parties as a "spin"."When you want to form a unity government, you do not come forward with political blocs and spins but rather honesty, statesmanship, responsibility and seriousness," Gantz said, referring to the political bloc deal Netanyahu signed earlier on Thursday with leaders of most of the right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties.Under Netanyahu's deal, the parties were committed to supporting only Netanyahu as the next prime minister.After 97 percent of the votes in Israel's parliamentary elections have been counted on Thursday morning, Gantz's Blue and White party was shown to win 33 seats. Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party won 31 seats.Israeli governing coalition needs at least 61 members to have a majority in the 120-seat parliament. However, both of the blocs of Gantz and Netanyahu failed to gain enough seats to form a governing coalition, with a unity government emerging as a likely option.The results mean Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, might come to end.Israelis cast ballots on Tuesday for the second time in five months after Netanyahu failed to form a governing coalition and call for snap elections.
