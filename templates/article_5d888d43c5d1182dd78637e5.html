                Chinese innovation driving Africa's growth
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Over the years, China has supported sound economic transformation in Africa that has greatly enhanced Africa-China relations. The transformation is evident in the infrastructure, agriculture, communication technology and manufacturing sectors.China, a front-runner in the manufacturing sector, particularly consumer electronics, has been offering viable innovative solutions to Africa, which is eyeing higher economic growth.Africa is entering the age of technological advancement and innovation, which is expected to shape its future. Innovation is the newest frontier in China's continued engagement with Africa, which is part of a wider pattern of increasing Chinese investment in African markets, infrastructure and natural resources. This is underpinned by China's "going out" strategy, incorporated into its 10th Five-Year Plan (2001-05) with the objective of encouraging Chinese enterprises to invest overseas, improve competitiveness and secure an international business presence.Chinese companies' investments in innovation on the continent have diversified since early forays and now include broadcasting networks, data centers and smartphone sales.In December 2016, China Telecom Global announced it would work with the Djibouti Data Center to expand its network and spur the growth of fiber cable services in East Africa. Liu Changhai, managing director of China Telecom in Africa and the Middle East, said in a statement that the decision "marks a new page for the company's regional strategic planning".China believes in driving economic growth through innovation and skills transfer.The most remarkable Chinese contribution, perhaps, has been the construction of modern railways that crisscross the African continent.For instance, a standard gauge railway will connect Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. It is Kenya's biggest infrastructure project since its independence in 1963 and was developed with Chinese technology and skills, providing one of the best examples of modern transportation systems in Africa. It has created more than 30,000 jobs for Kenyans. As part of its commitment, China Road and Bridge Corp opened a technology transfer training camp in Voi, Kenya, to impart theoretical as well as practical skills to local engineers and technicians.China's ambitious investment program to improve regional and commercial links with countries has set the stage for unlocking the agricultural potential of African countries and deepening strategic cooperation with Africa.In order to guarantee food supply and speed up agricultural development, Chinese companies, with the help of the Chinese government, have built large farms and farming technology demonstration centers across Africa.For instance, Johnken Estates Ltd was co-founded by China National Agricultural Development Group Co and the China-Africa Development Fund in 1994 for growing crops and breeding livestock in Zambia. These companies employ more than 3,000 workers. By working on the farms, locals acquire advanced farming skills and technological expertise. The agricultural cooperation with Chinese companies has not only led to the development of training centers for agriculture but also facilitated provision of machinery, farm inputs and much-needed markets for African farmers.Many Chinese agricultural companies have built agricultural technology demonstration centers in Africa, including Tanzania, Mozambique and Rwanda, where locals are offered advanced farming technology and the latest seeds. Africa is likely to become the food basket of the world due to its rapid growth in the agricultural sector.With the rapid development of the African economy, the demand for international information services in these countries has increased substantially.As a company that specializes in international information services, China Unicom has worked closely with African telecommunication operators and equipment manufacturers to provide products and solutions, including information and communication technology services, premium internet, global networking solutions and cloud-network integrated solutions.China has been playing an increasingly important role in the African communication landscape.Through the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation - a platform established by China and African countries for consultation and dialogue - several initiatives have been launched, including people-to-people exchanges like the establishment of Confucius Institutes.Chinese communication technology companies, including Tecno and Huawei, are currently the top mobile companies in the African markets.Chinese mobile companies strive to meet the particular needs of African consumers. Besides being affordable, their products support local languages such as Swahili. They also have a long battery life, which is crucial in parts of Africa that have an unreliable power supply.Endowed with rich natural resources, Africa is poised to become the world's next manufacturing superpower. The mining sector is booming as well. For example, China has reopened iron ore mining in West Africa and steel manufacturing in Liberia.More Chinese companies are looking at offshore production in African countries.The availability of young workers in abundance, free trade access to the United States market, and proximity to the European Union make Africa an attractive investment destination for manufacturers.The author is an information and technology expert and researcher at the Africa Policy Institute.

                Facility connectivity has been a central focus of the Belt and Road Initiative, which was proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013 and represents the largest development initiative of its kind in recent years.The ultimate goals of the BRI－which comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road－are to promote peaceful cooperation and common development around the world, where all countries can participate.The initiative also aims to promote an efficient flow of materials and integration of markets to achieve diversified, balanced, mutually beneficial and sustainable development.Implementation of the BRI in recent years has generated widespread interest and some concerns. On the one hand, developing and emerging economies have a huge demand for infrastructure development to stimulate economic growth. On the other, there are concerns about the environmental costs of infrastructure development, and about the financial burden that these infrastructure investments may add to the already challenging financial conditions in these countries.These concerns are not new for people who have worked in international development. There has always been a struggle between economic development aspirations and sustainable environmental and social goals, which has to be sorted out by domestic debate and consultation. An interesting question is: What are the unique factors that have made the BRI attract so much attention?In 2017 and 2018, our research task force selected four countries－Indonesia, Cambodia, Ethiopia and Kenya－as case studies to investigate infrastructure construction by Chinese State-owned companies.The focus was on railway construction: the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail in Indonesia, the Addis Ababa-Djibouti electrified railway in Ethiopia, the Mombasa-Nairobi standard gauge railway in Kenya and the proposed railway project in Cambodia. The different types of railways represent both completed and uncompleted infrastructure projects within the BRI framework.In 2015, the government of Indonesia accepted a Chinese bid over a Japanese bid for a 150-kilometer high-speed rail connecting Jakarta and Bandung. The rail is Indonesia's and Southeast Asia's first high-speed rail project. However, the project has been plagued by problems since its inception, including lack of proper environmental impact studies and consistency with spatial plans in Indonesia.Another case is Cambodia, whose infrastructure is among the least developed in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations region. In 2016, China and Cambodia issued a joint statement, proposing to accelerate development of the new Silk Road and invest in the construction of transportation, energy, agriculture and water management infrastructure in Cambodia.In 2011, the Export-Import Bank of China and China Civil Engineering and Construction Corp signed a $4 billion contract for the construction of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway, and the project was inaugurated in 2016. The link is the first multinational electrified railway built and operated by China in Africa.In 2014, China and Kenya signed an agreement in Nairobi agreeing to fund the construction of the Mombasa-Nairobi railway. A financial agreement was reached with a total investment of $3.8 billion, 90 percent of which was provided by China Exim Bank and 10 percent by Kenyan financial funds. The railway began commercial operation in 2018.We argue that the BRI can serve as a platform for China to transfer its successful development practices, which have been tested in China's own development experience since the early 1980s. After transforming China with high-speed rail lines, roads and electricity grids, Chinese companies are ready to export their expertise.While the short-term focus of the BRI is mainly on infrastructure construction, the long-term implications could extend to other sectors. The whole idea of the BRI is not only about building a transportation route between China and the participating countries, but also a trade and investment corridor that can generate the goods and services to be transported along the routes.In view of lessons learned from our case studies, a successful BRI project largely depends on people's trust and support in recipient countries. A BRI project can be accepted and recognized not only when the recipient country can benefit from BRI projects, but also when the major stakeholders in the country are able to perceive the benefits and gain them. There is a need to connect hearts between people in China and these countries before connecting roads in them.Xue Lan is dean of Schwarzman College of Tsinghua University and professor at the university's School of Public Policy and Management.

                    Belt and Road forum sets stage for Africa's Agenda 2063
                </p>

                The initiative is not just about the construction of railways, roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects Beijing is hosting the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation on Thursday to Saturday. The Belt and Road Initiative, unveiled in 2013, is President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy venture aimed at strengthening China's connectivity with the global community. According to the March 2015 white paper presented by China's National Development and Reform Commission, the five major goals of the initiative are to facilitate connectivity, promote policy coordination, foster people-to-people bonding, and promote unimpeded trade and financial integration. And, as the forum looks to set a blueprint for the next stage, the initiative's benefits are already evident in more than 20 African states. The other African countries are in the process of joining the initiative as they recognize that it provides a way for African countries to achieve social and economic development. As part of the initiative, China is providing capital and technology to Africa. And the continent has witnessed development on several fronts, including transport. For example, the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway and the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway connect Kenya and Ethiopia to the world, providing a better platform for further development and prosperity of these two countries. Bagamoyo Port in Tanzania, the Jamestown fishing port complex in Ghana, the Kribi deepwater port in Cameroon and Lamu Port in Kenya, play a vital role in promoting the integration of Africa and they were all constructed as part of the Belt and Road Initiative. China has been financing major projects across sectors in Africa. At the close of 2018 the China-Africa Forum for Cooperation Summit held in Beijing, China pledged $60 billion to strengthen Sino-African ties. The fund will also be used for the Belt and Road Initiative-related projects, including railways, roads and bridges, energy, and telecommunications. Through these initiatives, China has shown its focus is on building a win-win relationship with Africa. The West, however, has criticized China's policies in Africa, terming them "debt traps". But China has countered this narrative through its push for peaceful development. The Belt and Road Initiative is not just about the construction of railways, roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects. The initiative forms a bridge by which the world can conduct civilization exchanges. Beijing believes a peaceful environment is necessary to develop a stable economy. Africa, with a population of 1.3 billion and vast mineral resources, has drawn up an ambitious master plan called Agenda 2063. It is a blueprint for transforming Africa into a global powerhouse of the future. China, on the other hand, needs mineral resources to accomplish its development agenda. For African states that plan to hold more bilateral discussions with China, Agenda 2063, the African vision and commitment to a shared strategic framework for inclusive growth and sustainable development, and a global strategy to optimize the use of Africa's resources for the benefit of all Africans, should be one of their key focus areas.

We also welcome the participation of Secretary-General António Guterres of the United Nations and Managing Director Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund. The Leaders' Roundtable was chaired by President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China.2. We met at a time when the world economy is facing both expanding opportunities and rising challenges, complicated by profound and rapid changes in the world. We reaffirm that strengthening multilateralism remains essential in addressing global challenges. We also believe that an open, inclusive, interconnected, sustainable and people-centered world economy can contribute to prosperity for all.3. Recalling the Joint Communique of the Leaders' Roundtable of the 1st Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, including the cooperation objectives, principles and measures contained therein, and reaffirming our commitment to the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we reiterate that promoting peace, development and human rights, mutually-beneficial cooperation, and honoring the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and international law are our common responsibilities; achieving strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth and improving people's quality of life are our common goals; creating a prosperous and peaceful world with shared future is our common aspiration.4. The ancient Silk Road contributed to the strengthening of the connectivity and the expansion of the world economy in the spirit of promoting peace and cooperation, openness, inclusiveness, equality, mutual learning and mutual benefit. We look forward to restoring and rejuvenating such spirit, through the Belt and Road Initiative and other cooperation frameworks and initiatives.5. As cooperation partners, we appreciate the progress already made and important opportunities created in the Belt and Road cooperation, especially the outcomes in areas such as development policy synergy, increased infrastructure investment, economic corridors, economic and trade cooperation zones, industrial parks, finance and trade cooperation, innovation and technology, maritime cooperation, business-to-business ties, people-to-people and cultural exchange. Such cooperation explores new sources of growth and offers potential for economic and social development, and contributes to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.6. Looking into the future, we envisage high-quality Belt and Road cooperation in enhancing connectivity by promoting development policy synergy, infrastructure development, unimpeded trade, financial cooperation and people-to-people bond, thereby enhancing practical cooperation for the well-being of our peoples. In this context, we look forward to more efforts by cooperation partners.・ Such cooperation will be based on extensive consultation, joint efforts, shared and mutual benefits. We emphasize the importance of the rule of law and equal opportunities for all. We endeavor to move on with policy and project cooperation through voluntary participation and consensus-building, based on common responsibility and outcomes. All states are equal partners for cooperation that respects openness, transparency, inclusiveness and level playing field. We respect sovereignty and territorial integrity of each other and affirm that each country has the right and primary responsibility to define its development strategies in accordance with its national priorities and legislation.・ Such cooperation will be open, green and clean. We embrace open economy and inclusive, non-discriminatory global market. All interested countries are welcome to join in such cooperation. We underline the importance of promoting green development and addressing the challenges of environmental protection and climate change including by enhancing our cooperation to implement the Paris Agreement. We encourage more efforts in building a culture of integrity and combating corruption.・ Such cooperation will pursue high standard, people-centered and sustainable development. We will work together in line with our national legislation, regulatory frameworks, international obligations, applicable international norms and standards. We believe that relevant cooperation should be people-centered and conducive to inclusive quality economic growth and broad-based improvement of people's livelihood. We are committed to promoting sustainability in all its dimensions.7. We start from the conviction that connectivity contributes to boosting growth, economic and social development, trade in goods and services, as well as investment and creating employment opportunities and better communication and exchanges among peoples. In this regard, promoting global partnership on connectivity, based on transparency, openness and inclusiveness, provides an opportunity for all. Today, through such partnership including the Belt and Road Initiative and other cooperation strategies, we resolve to promote international cooperation, at sub-regional, regional and global levels aiming at a brighter shared future and common prosperity. We support a universal, rules-based, open, transparent and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system with WTO at its core.Strengthening Development Policy Synergy8. To sustain common development, we welcome sound macroeconomic policies, encourage discussions with regard to Sustainable Development Agenda and will work together to enhance macroeconomic policy dialogue at the UN and other multilateral fora, and promote synergies among related development plans and connectivity initiatives based on the progress already made.9. In this regard, we also emphasize the opportunities arising from the initiatives and cooperation frameworks, including, inter alia, the ACMECS Master Plan (2019-2023), the African Union including Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA), APEC Connectivity Blueprint, the Arab League, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) including Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025, ASEAN Smart Cities Network and ASEAN Initiative on Connecting the Connectivities, ASEM Pathfinder Group on Connectivity, BIMP-East ASEAN Growth Area, Central Asian Connectivity, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), the Dubai Silk Road Strategy, EU strategy on connecting Europe and Asia, EU-China Connectivity Platform, EU Eastern Partnership, Eurasian Economic Union, Eurasian partnership, Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), Global Infrastructure Connectivity Alliance, International G-Global Project, Lancang-Mekong Cooperation, Organization of American States, Pacific Alliance, Pacific Islands Forum, Union for the Mediterranean and those sub-regional and regional cooperation initiatives between all partners.10. Determined to pursue trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, we aspire to further open our markets, reject protectionism, unilateralism and other measures that are incompatible with WTO rules. We highlight the importance of special and differential treatment in accordance with WTO agreements.11. We recognize the importance of improving customs facilitation including by encouraging better cooperation and coordination of relevant agencies involved in border clearance, mutual assistance, information sharing and cooperation, streamlining customs and transit procedures. We encourage such facilitation to be consistent with the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement and accompanied by efficient and effective controls to, inter alia, prevent illicit trade and fight fraud.12. We call for strengthened cooperation on foreign direct investment and joint ventures in the context of our national laws and international commitments, and encourage an enabling and predictable environment for the promotion of investment and new business opportunities.13. We intend to enhance cooperation in tax matters, encourage more agreements on avoidance of double taxation, and promote growth-friendly tax policies. To achieve these goals, we aim to work within existing international taxation cooperation frameworks.14. We endeavor to forge inclusive and diversified global value chains, beneficial to all partners. We encourage greater cooperation on innovation, while protecting intellectual property rights. We also encourage the introduction of digital transport accompanying documents.15. We support the development of sustainable blue economy and call for further developing maritime links and intensifying international maritime cooperation, including among ports and shipping industries, while sustainably managing marine and coastal ecosystems.

                    Kenya lauds China's food aid for communities in arid areas
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The Kenyan government on Monday hailed China's emergency humanitarian support targeting millions of Kenyans facing starvation in arid areas following poor rainfall in May.Eugene Wamalwa, the cabinet secretary for Devolution and Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL), thanked China for being "a friend indeed", as the East African country faces a difficult dry period ahead, which if it comes to pass, would worsen food shortages and water scarcity.Due to failure of long rains in the months of March to May, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an eight-country trade bloc in Africa based in Djibouti, has said that Kenya will be hit by the worst drought in 38 years.Speaking at a handover ceremony of 2017 Rice Assistance to Kenya press event held at the Treasury House in Nairobi, Wamalwa said the country is expecting a second batch from China, which will go a long way in assisting government food programs targeting vulnerable communities living in more than 13 of Kenya’s 47 counties."In 2016-2017, during drought where more than 1.3 million Kenyans faced starvation due to prolonged drought, China provided rice that was distributed to ASAL and other counties. Moreover, we have also recently received 10,000 bags of rice that has been distributed to 17 counties, particularly our Muslim brothers during the holy month of Ramadan. We are expecting additional consignment that will bring relief to millions of Kenyans as the current rains end by the end of this month."Wu Peng, Chinese ambassador to Kenya, said China donated 21,366 tons of rice worth $22.5 million in 2017. He announced that the embassy will work closely with the Kenyan government in the distribution of the second consignment."Once again, the Chinese government has decided to donate 11,835 tons of rice worth $12 million to Kenya. The first batch arrived at Mombasa on May 19 and I'm told that it has already been distributed to and benefiting the drought affected people. The shipment for the second batch of 1,500 tons will start by the end of this month."Due to dependence on rain in agriculture, Kenya has already lowered its economic growth forecast for this year from 6.3 percent to 5.3 percent. The World Bank has also shaved its forecast for the economy from 5.8 percent to 5.7 percent.

                    BRI not a 'debt trap' but a boost for world economy
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Accusations of China's infrastructure financing 'absolutely wrong', analysts sayAccusations that China's infrastructure financing under the Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, are causing huge debts to countries involved and pushing them into a "debt trap" are absolutely wrong, reports and analysts have pointed out.Since last year, some senior officials from the West, including US Vice-President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have made such allegations without offering any evidence. These false allegations have been refuted by a number of global studies and analysts recently.The Express Tribune, a major daily English-language newspaper based in Pakistan, published an article on May 27, saying the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, a project under the BRI, is not a "debt trap" but a boon for Pakistan.It said China is investing $62 billion in Pakistan through the CPEC, which has enabled the country to avert its energy crisis and has helped build an elaborate network of infrastructure in various parts of the country for the past five years. The CPEC has greatly boosted the economic activity and improved people's life, it said.Despite several hostile voices saying that the project is a "debt trap" for Pakistan and will hurt the country's economy, Noor Ahmed, secretary of the Economic Affairs Division of Pakistan, said that the country's total foreign debt is about $106 billion. Of which Chinese loans account for only 10 to 11 percent, while the remaining are from the International Monetary Fund, Paris Club, and other Western organizations, according to the Express Tribune.Ahmed said that China has greatly supported Pakistan and always help the country during tough economic crises. Through the CPEC, China is building infrastructure in Pakistan to save its economy, and some of its money coming into Pakistan are purely an investment, some are interest-free loans, and other loans are on very easy and simple terms."If China lends money to Pakistan at one of the lowest interest rates in the world, how can it be a debt trap?" Ahmed said.The Chinese-built Hambantota International Port project in Sri Lanka is another example that is always cited by critics while accusing China of making a "debt trap".Barry Sautman, a professor in the Division of Social Science at Hong Kong University of Science & Technology, said that alleged story that Sri Lanka's government was forced to sign the port away on a 99-year lease after failing to repay Chinese loans that were racking up 6.3 percent interest "are erroneous".In a recent article published on The South China Morning Post, he said that China holds an estimated 9 to 15 percent of Sri Lanka's external debt, based on his team's field research in Sri Lanka.Some of the rest are high-interest loans from commercial banks, which are mainly Western. International sovereign bonds holds about half of its external debt, with "Americans holding two-thirds of their value and Asians only about 8 percent", he said.Sri Lanka must pay interest averaging 6.3 percent on international sovereign bonds and the principal must be fully repaid, on average, within seven years. In contrast, more than two-thirds of the value of Chinese financing to Sri Lanka from 2001 to 2017, including two-thirds to Hambantota Port, carry only 2 percent interest, and mostly repayable more than 20 years, he said."Ironically then, if Sri Lanka is debt distressed, it owes more to American and other Western entities than to Chinese," he said.He added that in fact, Chinese infrastructure loans have not led to the forfeiture of a single valuable asset abroad and have not impinged on the sovereignty of any country. There is no Chinese plot to take over the world.A report on a study by New Yorkbased independent research provider Rhodium Group, also dismissed the "debt trap" accusations against China recently. Based on 40 cases of external debt renegotiation between 2007 and this year in 24 countries, the report said asset seizure was a rare occurrence. More often, China was inclined to renegotiate the debts or write them off, it said.Hisham AbuBakr Metwally, an economics researcher with the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Trade and Industry, said that critics always mention "debt trap" in African countries, including Kenya and Ethiopia. The fact is that these countries was in keen need of developing infrastructure, such as railways and bridges, which could greatly boost their economic development."BRI is really a new hope for the world to overcome the barrier and achieve development for all," he said. "For example, with the development of infrastructure, we can see now Ethiopia grows the fastest in Africa, at about 7 percent annual growth of GDP."A recent report from global trade credit insurance company Euler Hermes said that merchandise trade between China and countries involved in the BRI will add $117 billion to global trade and boost its growth by 0.3 percent this year. It would also add 0.1 percent to global GDP in 2019.Abdallah Abdillahi Miguil, Djibouti's ambassador to China, said that unlike the Western investment with strings attached to it, Chinese investment is welcomed by the country in the Horn of Africa."The people and the government of Djibouti are aware of the fact that Chinese investment came at a time where it was mostly needed," he said. "In this connection, we do care less what those who envy the growing cooperation between Djibouti and China say."Xu Haoliang, assistant secretary-general of the United Nations, said the BRI is a global initiative that has the potential to facilitate the achievement of the sustainable development goals. Importantly, it can also fill in the financing gaps and development needs in underinvested countries with loans and investment from China and other countries.He said that although some countries have expressed concerns on the issues of standards and regulations pertaining to transparency, debt sustainability, the environment and society, these issues are complex and go beyond the BRI."They represent systemic issues in some developing countries related to investments and economic management, are not necessarily or only as a result of the BRI," he said. "Careful study is needed to understand the situation in every instance."

                Riding on the Belt and Road Initiative, also known as the BRI, Hong Kong-based enterprises are keenly eyeing investment opportunities in both Kenya and Djibouti.Toward that end, a delegation of 12 people representing 10 Hong Kong-based enterprises visited Djibouti and Kenya on Aug 4-9, where they held forums with local enterprises, lobby groups and government representatives.The enterprises are looking at investing in banking, finance, manufacturing, real estate development, property development, construction, engineering services and projects, among other areas, generally through joint ventures and partnerships with local companies.Nicholas Kwan, director of research at the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, said they are interested in investing in infrastructure and transport logistics in Djibouti.He termed Kenya and Djibouti as key entry points into Africa. Djibouti is strategically located in East Africa and serves as the regional transportation and logistics hub for landlocked countries in the region.He said the delegation recognizes the importance of Kenya as a gateway to the rapidly developing East Africa region, with the country playing a significant role as a major logistics hub.Daniel Lam, the regional director of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council in the Middle East and Africa, said they are keen to explore opportunities presented by Kenya's economic success story, through the BRI.He said Hong Kong investors are in a position to provide some of the expertise and funding that can make Kenya's vision 2030 a reality."Kenya and Hong Kong are both important hubs for trade and commerce. Already, solid business ties exist between the two places," he said.Lam said Kenya can greatly capture the relevant opportunities of the Belt and Road Initiative through Hong Kong, which is well-placed to be the commercial platform for the initiative."Hong Kong is an important two-way investment and business hub in Asia. We are your prime gateway to Asia's regional markets, especially ASEAN countries and mainland China, which we are familiar with and have extensive experience working in," he said.In the first five months of 2019, Lam said exports from Hong Kong to Kenya grew by 120 percent to $103 million, while bilateral trade rose by 68 percent.

                Riding on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Hong Kong-based enterprises are keenly eyeing investment opportunities in both Kenya and Djibouti.A 12-member delegation representing 10 Hong Kong-based enterprises visited Djibouti and Kenya in August, where they held discussions with local enterprises, lobby groups and government representatives.The enterprises are looking to invest in banking, finance, manufacturing, real estate development, property development, construction, engineering services, and project investment among others, basically through joint ventures and partnerships with local companies.Nicholas Kwan, director of research at Hong Kong Trade Development Council, said they are interested in investing in infrastructure and transport logistics in Djibouti.He termed Kenya and Djibouti as key entry points into Africa.

He said Kenya has a deficit of 250,000 housing units annually."The low-cost housing agenda seeks to address the acute shortage by cutting construction costs through use of innovative technologies, reducing mortgage cost, and raising low-cost funds from private and public sectors for investment in large-scale housing construction," he explained.Ikiara said developers of 100 low cost residential units and above will enjoy 15 percent corporate tax.On universal healthcare coverage, opportunities lie in enhancing low cost private insurance coverage and schemes, private healthcare facilities and services, provision of medical commodities and equipment.This is in addition to digitization of healthcare and provision and implementation of alternative financing.Betty Maina, the principal secretary of the State Department of Investment and Industry, assured the Hong Kong investors that Kenya will continue to be an open economy with a business friendly environment.She said her ministry will strive to make the country the preferred investment destination and one of the most globally competitive trading nations in the world.

                    Kenya endorsed to seek UN Security Council seat
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Kenya has been endorsed as a candidate for the UN Security Council nonpermanent seat for the 2021-2022 term, in a vote held Wednesday at the African Union headquarters in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa.Kenya won the endorsement after a second round of voting by the Permanent Representatives Committee, garnering 37 votes against Djibouti, which got 13 votes. In the first round of voting held on Aug 5, Kenya fell short of a two-thirds majority threshold.Following the endorsement, the east African country will be Africa's sole candidate for the nonpermanent seat race to be held in New York in June 2020.Niger and Tunisia were elected in June to serve in the UN Security Council for the 2020-2021 term, representing western and northern Africa respectively.To win the seat, Kenya will have to get the support of two-thirds of the UN member states.The UN Security Council, which is responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security, has 15 members. Its permanent members are China, France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States. The 10 nonpermanent members get elected for two-year terms by the General Assembly.Monicah Juma, the cabinet secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, applauded the AU Permanent Representatives Committee for trusting Kenya."This endorsement is an affirmation that Kenya has remained true to the decision and aspirations of the African Union and confirms that it is a safe and a dependable pair of hands," she said.Juma said Kenya is committed to being a bold voice for Africa and shall steadfastly promote and defend the continent's position.Given Kenya's foreign policy, which is strongly Afro-centric, Juma said the elections to the Security Council will give the country the opportunity to build consensus across regional and global matters that affect Africa.Mohammed Idris Farah, Djibouti ambassador to the African Union, lauded Kenya for the victory."I congratulate Kenya for a well-deserved win and I am sure it will ably represent our great continent at the UN Security Council," he said.However, on Thursday, the Djibouti government seemed to withdraw its earlier decision to concede defeat.In a tweet, Mohamed Siad Doualeh, Djibouti's permanent representative to the UN, said his country will continue to vie for the nonpermanent seat."Djibouti reaffirms its decision to continue its bid to secure a seat at the Security Council for the period 2021-2022.  We thank all the UN member states that have formally expressed support to Djibouti," he wrote.According to the UN Security Council's rotation rules, the 10 nonpermanent seats rotate among the various regional blocs.The five available seats are allocated as follows: two for Africa, one for the Asia-Pacific Group, one for Latin America and the Caribbean, and one for the Eastern European Group.Initially, the AU had reached the UNSC candidature decision through consensus but Djibouti and Kenya failed to agree on who should step down, leading to the vote.Since last year, President Uhuru Kenyatta has been lobbying for support of Kenya's bid to secure the UN Security Council seat, a move that would boost the country's position as a regional diplomatic hub.
