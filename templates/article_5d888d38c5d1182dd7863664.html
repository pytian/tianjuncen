            <p class="style-content">
                A Hong Kong government spokesman strongly condemned radical protesters' violent and vandalistic acts in Tuen Mun and other districts on Saturday.Following the conclusion of a procession in Tuen Mun, New Territories, earlier on Saturday, the protesters carriedout violent and vandalistic acts in various places in the district.They blocked roads, set fires and hurled petrol bombs, endangering police officers and the public at the scene. They also vandalised Light Rail stops and placed objects on tracks, leading to the suspension of service and potentially affecting the safety of its operation.Some people assaulted a police officer and even attempted to take his revolver, while others trampled and burned a national flag, challenging the national sovereignty.After nightfall, the violence and vandalism spread to other districts, with some people blocking roads, setting fires and hurling petrol bombs in Yuen Long, New Territories, and besieging and attacking Mong Kok police station in Kowloon.In a statement issued Saturday night, the special administrative region government strongly condemned the violent and vandalistic acts.The police will take action against illegal activities to protect people's safety and restore public order, a spokesman said.MTR, the sole operator of the rail system in Hong Kong, in its statement issued Saturday night, also strongly condemned protesters for vandalizing Light Rail stops.Facilities at numerous Light Rail stops were destroyed while rail tracks and crossing lights were sabotaged.Such acts of vandalism posed a grave danger to commuters, the company said, adding it has reported the cases to police.The company appealed to members of the public to be considerate, and stop vandalising station facilities, harassing other people or affecting railway safety.MTR engineering personnel will check the damaged facilities to assess damages and the time required for recovery. If some of the facilities cannot be repaired in time, passengers may have to wait for a long time to use the facilities, the company said.

                China on Thursday demanded the United States stop advancing a Hong Kong-related bill and its interference in Hong Kong affairs on Thursday, after US lawmakers held a news conference to back the bill. US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a bipartisan group of members of Congress held the media event on the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019". Hong Kong separatists, including Joshua Wong Chifung and Denise Ho Wan-see, attended the event. China is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposed to the move, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Thursday.

                    MTR chairman urges public to treasure HK railway amid unrest
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                MTR Corporation Chairman Rex Auyeung Pak-kuen appealed to the public of Hong Kong to cherish the homegrown rail brand, which has braced up to throw its support behind the police in fighting against violence and vandalism that have roiled the railway system and the city. Auyeung, 67, made the appeal in an interview with a local Chinese-language newspaper. He expressed hopes for the people of Hong Kong not to push the renowned local brand that was built up by the efforts of generations into the sea. The city’s rail network, which carries an average of 5 million daily passenger trips, has become a primary target of repeated vandalism by radicals in the ongoing civil unrest that has gripped the city for more than three months.Following several deliberate disruptions of the railway services that paralyzed the metro services and affected hundreds of thousands of travelers, radicals set fires and smashed facilities at the major metro stations along the Island Line over the past two weekends.In light of that, Auyeung said the company has recruited a large number of new security guards to shield the metro operations from vandals and ensure the safety of its front-line staff members.This year marks the 40th anniversary of the start of MTR services in the city. It, however, saw its most severe challenge in its history, with more than half of the about 150 subway and light rail stations being sabotaged at a repair cost of up to HK$10 million. Not to mention, hundreds of thousands of passengers were affected by the overt challenge to the rule of law, a value the city holds dear. Auyeung did not expect the radicals would defy a High Court’s injunction order that bans deliberately obstructing the proper use of the metro services. But he assured that the cost will not be transferred to passengers by a hike in ticket fares. Several standoffs at the MTR stations turned into scuffles with MTR front-line staff amid the incessant weekend mayhem. This has saddened Auyueng, who said the railway has become sandwiched and battered by the political turmoil. Auyeung said staff members for the MTR are not trained to deal with confrontations and the corporation is not experienced in dealing with massive public activities. For societal order, the police should step in, he said.That’s why the MTR will brace up and continue to support the police for strictly enforcing the law in the face of violence and vandalism, said the newly appointed chairman of the city’s sole rail operator. Auyeung assumed office in July 1, at a time when the city’s political turmoil rocked the city for about a month. He apologized for falling short of the public’s expectations in handling the political unrest when the company arranged a free train to help anti-government radicals retreat after they confronted the police in the Yuen Long MTR station on Aug 21.Auyeung said that the special train service arrangement was to evacuate the crowd as ground traffic was obstructed, adding that it was not out of political consideration.In hindsight, it did give a bad impression to the public as it was like giving a ride to someone who refused to foot a bill after the meal and vandalized the property at the restaurant, he said.

                    HK vows swift action against violence
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Hong Kong police on Friday called for calm and pledged to take swift action against any street violence or other illegal activities, irrespective of offenders' backgrounds or views.The vow came as some protesters engaged in violent confrontations last weekend, resulting in eight injuries.The expected rally on Saturday-Clean Hong Kong Day－organized by Legislator Junius Ho Kwan-yiu, is in an attempt to remove memos and notes containing political opinions on over 70"Lennon Walls" in places such as underpasses and footbridges across the city.The police will deploy manpower across various districts on Saturday in an attempt to prevent conflicts from escalating out of control, said Fang Chi-kin, superintendent of the Hong Kong Police operations wing, on Friday.The Lennon Walls, more often than not, have been sites of violence over the past three months, Fang said. Since June, police launched 40 criminal investigations into physical confrontations taking place near the walls, and arrested 57 people on charges including assault and possession of offensive weapons.While police have always respected the citizens' freedom of speech rights, they have to be carried out in a peaceful and orderly manner and no one should resort to violence, he added.Later on Friday, a top Hong Kong police officer said that law enforcement officers were getting more and more united and determined as the protests and escalated violence mounted.The top officer made the remarks during a closed-door media session at police headquarters in Wan Chai district on condition of anonymity. The city has endured 15 consecutive weeks of street protests which went from peaceful rallies to illegal protests with masked radicals resorting to escalating violence and extreme acts of vandalism.The police unity and determination could be witnessed through resignation rates. He said the nonscheduled resignation rate for police so far this year is around 1.1 percent. The rate in 2018 was around 1.6 percent."We, the police force, won't be intimidated by any acts of violence," he said.When asked about accusations of police officers allegedly using excessive force, the top official said it is fair to say Hong Kong's police force is one of the most restrained in the world, but some media just show a partial picture.He said he went to New York in June and met with police officers. When he played video clips showing radicals' vandalism and then showed them what the media was saying, they were shocked at the huge differences between what's been written and what's been documented on camera.He called for media to give accurate, fair and balanced media coverage on police actions.It has been more than 100 days since the violent protests started in June. So far, 1,474 people have been arrested at illegal protests and 207 have since been charged.He said he agreed in theory that if there were fast-track of court procedures, it would change the current situation as people, especially the young, would know that there is a price to pay for illegal acts.

                    HK CPPCC members: patriotism should be reinforced and expanded
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                For Hong Kong's prosperity and stability in the long-run, Hong Kong members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference said it is necessary to reinforce and expand patriotism.Member of the CPPCC from Hong Kong Samuel Yung Wing-ki said the patriotic force loving both the country and the city needs to be strengthened.To achieve this, he encouraged the city's CPPCC members to engage people from various backgrounds, especially young people, to brief them about the nation's latest development and opportunities in prominent national strategies.This will buttress their national identity as well as their recognition of the country, he said.This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the CPPCC, the advisory body to the Chinese government and a major player in the Chinese social and political system.Many of the city's CPPCC members have joined local groups, the founding President of Hong Kong Professionals and Senior Executives Association said, adding that they can lobby groups to hold more activities to increase local people's understanding of China.Besides lectures, the associations could invite government officials to explain policies relating to the Chinese mainland or organize delegations to visit mainland cities, he said.It is also important for CPPCC members of the special administrative region (SAR) to support the law-based governance of the SAR government, which Yung said is a basic requirement.One of the advisory body's main tasks is to offer suggestions to the government, in both the promulgation and implementation of policies, Yung said.To provide quality suggestions, Yung advised members of the advisory body to maintain a close connection with the public. This could help them better identify and investigate the deep-rooted problems in society, he said.Echoing Yung, Jackey Tse, a Hong Kong member of the Youth Federation of Jilin province, told China Daily that supporting the law-based governance of the SAR government is a must for Hong Kong to end the current turmoil, which has gripped the city for more than three months."To help society back on track soon, we must support the SAR government's administration and the police's law enforcement actions to bring law-breakers to justice," said Tse, who is also a member of the Jilin provincial committee of the CPPCC.There are various ways to throw weight behind the government's administration, Tse said. Young people could take the initiative to clarify rumors targeting the government among their peers, Tse said.In Tse's eyes, there is a need to strengthen the ranks of patriots among Hong Kong society, as it is a key way to guarantee the city's stability.Tse encouraged CPPCC members to put more efforts into connecting with the city's young people, introducing them to the opportunities across the boundary, as well as the policies benefiting Hong Kong people's lives on the mainland.He also appealed to Hong Kong's young people to put aside prejudice and embrace the development opportunities on the mainland in a more open and active manner.Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies – a Hong Kong and Macao affairs think tank – said Hong Kong's recent social unrest reveals the patriotism needs to be increased across society.Facing the China-US trade tension and foreign forces' constant intervention in Hong Kong internal affairs, Lau said now it is more urgent than ever to expand the force of people who love the nation and Hong Kong.Hong Kong members of the CPPCC should play greater roles in the city's political arena and serve as the bridge between the mainland and the city, Lau said.Lau added that committee members should do more policy research targeting the deep-seated social issues in Hong Kong to relieve the city's internal rift and tensions, which many believe are the cause of the protracted social unrest recently.

                Tsang Hin-chi, who was born into poverty, created a business empire and became a pioneer in China's industrial development, is remembered for his patriotism and outstanding contributions to the country's development.Tsang died on Friday in the town where he was born, Meizhou, Guangdong province. He was 85 years old.His death was announced by Goldlion Group, the menswear company Tsang founded in 1971 that became an iconic brand.Tsang was one of the most respected entrepreneurs in Hong Kong, taking the lead in investing on the Chinese mainland during the early days of reform and opening-up in the 1970s. He also provided advice to the mainland as it worked to create the Chinese miracle.Tsang's outstanding contribution to China's advancement earned him a medal of recognition as a "reform pioneer" in 2018. He was one of only four Hong Kong residents - among a total of 100 - honored with the title by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor expressed deep sorrow on Friday over Tsang's death. She called him a trailblazer who contributed to China's economic reform that started 41 years ago.Lam added that Tsang's efforts contributed to Hong Kong's smooth transition in its return to China in 1997.Wang Zhimin, director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong, described Tsang as "an elder of noble character and high prestige".Wang praised Tsang as a dedicated patriot and prominent member of Hong Kong's business community.As a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress - the country's top legislature - from 1994 to 2008, Tsang performed his duties to promote democracy, the rule of law and the development of industry and commerce on the mainland, Wang said.Choy So-yuk, a Hong Kong deputy to the NPC, said she was saddened to learn of Tsang's death. She spoke of the philanthropic entrepreneur's patriotism, noting that when NPC deputies visited impoverished areas on the mainland, Tsang would donate to the construction of new facilities there.Another NPC deputy in Hong Kong, Ng Leung-sing, recalled that although Tsang became seriously ill in his later years, he continued to attend celebrations marking the mother land's achievements. His patriotism became a model for the younger generation, Ng said.Albert Au Yeung, a senior Hong Kong journalist who interviewed Tsang over 10 years ago, recalled him as an easygoing man who was well disposed to sharing his thoughts with journalists. Even in those days, Tsang had health problems, but he carried on with his charity work for the country, Au Yeung said.Tsang also organized numerous media tours to the mainland to help journalists in the special administrative region to understand China's development, he said.Meixian county, where Tsang was born in 1934, is now a district of the city of Meizhou, Guangdong province. Tsang moved to Hong Kong in 1968 and there started building his empire making clothes in his small workshop.In the late 1970s, Tsang became one of the first investors when the Chinese mainland declared itself open for business. He suspended his plans to set up companies in the United States and moved his production base to his hometown in Guangdong.At the same time, he started funding developments in education, aviation, sports, science and healthcare, contributing more than HK$1.2 billion ($153 million) to the mainland over the past 40 years.Tsang supported China's national sovereignty over Hong Kong. More than a decade before the transition took place, Tsang was appointed as a member of the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee in the 1980s.He was among the first to be awarded Hong Kong's Grand Bauhinia Medal, in 1997 - the highest award under Hong Kong's honors system.Tsang was elected a member of the 8th NPC's Standing Committee in 1994 and served three consecutive terms, until 2008. After his retirement, he continued to follow the developments on the mainland and Hong Kong.Tsang spoke out during the illegal "Occupy Central" movement in Hong Kong in 2014, cautioning that the city needed stability to stay prosperous."The people of Hong Kong should show love for the city and oppose those thugs, so that we can all live and work in peace and contentment. Those people who arbitrarily vent their tempers and do whatever they want, did not realize that they were breaking the law," he said.He called on young people in Hong Kong to understand more about their society, about the Hong Kong SAR, and about their motherland China.
