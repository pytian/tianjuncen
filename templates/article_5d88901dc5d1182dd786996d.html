                Kazak restaurateur's passion produces cultural harvest
            </p>
            <p>
                URUMQI-Music interrupts the conversation of contented diners as dancers dressed in traditional Kazak and Uygur costumes invite the restaurant's customers to put down their cutlery and dance. The waiters and waitresses set down their trays and join in.Backstage, 49-year-old restaurateur Hellat Deleilikhan watches. It is the highlight of his busy day."I feel happy watching my customers join in," he said. "They enjoy themselves, and I'm satisfied. I have worked for so many years to build a place just like this. It is the wheat that I reap."It is not unusual for Hellat, an ethnic Kazak from the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, to drop farming terms in this way. In fact, it's in his blood.For centuries, the Kazak people were nomadic herders who drove their cattle and sheep across the pastures of Xinjiang. They shunned the idea of commercial activity, even going as far as regarding business as a disgrace."Fifty years ago, it was shameful for a Kazak to even sell a cup of milk tea to someone else," Hellat said. "If someone ate at your house and you charged money for that meal, other Kazaks would look down on you-it would be worse than death. But the times have changed, and now it is OK to earn money from your hard work."Today, more Kazaks have left their flocks and yurts to lead modern lives with access to education and health service.Growing up in a city, young Hellat excelled in the arts, but he took his parents' advice and majored in Russian at college. That led to a respectable job in the local administration for foreign trade.The job meant travel. A lot of travel, to far-flung countries where he developed an obsession-restaurants. He drank up the exotic atmosphere, admired the unusual decorations and reveled in the amazing performances. The more places he saw, the more he knew that he wanted a career that he was really passionate about.In 2001, he quit his job and opened his first venture, a Kazakstyle milk tea shop in a tiny 43 square meter space in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang.He decorated the shop like the cafes that had impressed him and named it "Father of Apples" after the saying "the three apples that changed the world". The first was the one eaten by Eve, the second fell on Isaac Newton, and the third was created by Steve Jobs.Hellat was determined to find his own apple that would change his world.In 2007, the tea shop was transformed into a restaurant, and singers and dancers were hired to perform."It's not about making more money," he said. "For me, my restaurant is like a container which houses all my hobbies, from decoration design to singing and dancing. I've realized a childhood dream."The restaurant soon moved to a 800 sq m space, then 1,600 sq m and again to 2,800 sq m."I often joke that we Kazak people traditionally lead a nomadic life," Hellat said. "We live in a place for just a few years and will then migrate to new pastures. In my catering business, our moves are about business and the need to expand."He said that instead of taking classes or reading books on management, he mainly relied on his intuition. "I stick to just one principle-follow my heart."After a decade of expansion, Hellat opened a second restaurant. Both restaurants are now household names in Xinjiang.Diners sit in surroundings that are opulent and full of character as they enjoy some of the best food on offer in Xinjiang. And then, of course, there is the traditional singing and dancing.Dina, also a Kazak, studies dance at Xinjiang Arts University and works part-time at Hellat's restaurant."It's my dream to become a dancer," she said. "This job allows me to improve my movements and learn how to interact with the audience."Hellat said: "Sheep and cattle are inseparable parts of our history and culture. But we need to keep up with the times and lead a modern life. We Kazak people can put down the whip and live modern lives. It's a good thing."He still loves to travel and credits his exposure to many different cultures for his belief that all ethnic groups should be inclusive."Cultures don't have boundaries," Hellat said. "As long as it's good, we like it. So, I believe cultures can blend. It's like pollen. Cross-pollination can make the flowers bloom so much more beautifully."Xinhua

                1,200 lost hikers in Gobi Desert rescued
            </a>
            <p>
                Over 1,200 lost hikers, mostly university students, were rescued after they called the police during a Gobi Desert hiking contest on Friday in Aksay Kazak autonomous county, Gansu province, according to the Beijing Youth Daily on Monday.The police managed to locate their whereabouts based on the information and showed the direction for the way out, said Zhang Qiang, deputy director of the command center in the police bureau of the county, as the report showed.The hiking contest was organized by a cultural development center in Changsha of Hunan province and a local outdoor activity center supported the activity, the report said, adding that in the 1,200-plus team of hikers, there were only seven coaches from the organizing centers.The 1,200 hikers lost their way in the Gobi Desert in the county, which covers an area of 31,000 square kilometers with an average altitude of 3,200 meters. Some areas have forbidden cattle grazing to protect the environment, leaving them empty all year long.The local temperature can approach 0 C at night though it hovers above 30 C during the day in the summer. But the hikers planned to stay outdoors at night, the police said.The local police in the county also asked for joint search and rescue from neighboring areas including Dunhuang city police after receiving the report.The police finally found the lost hikers at 2:40 am on Friday, according to the report.The police warned that such outdoor activity organizers should inform the relevant authorities beforehand for the sake of security.Ye Qian in Beijing contributed to this story

                Xinjiang Uygur sees big influx of visitors
            </a>
            <p>
                The Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region experienced a travel boom from January to June, and the growth is projected to continue through the rest of 2019, according to a recent report by the region's government.The report said that in the first half of 2019, the region received about 76 million visits, up 46 per-cent year-on-year. Revenue generated by tourism exceeded 115 billion yuan ($16 billion), registering an increase of about 48 percent over the same period last year.Urumqi, Ili Kazak autonomous prefecture and Changji Hui autonomous prefecture were the three hottest destinations for travelers in the past half year. Year-on-year, Urumqi saw a 56 percent increase in travelers, Ili Kazak saw 81 per-cent, and Changji Hui 46 percent.Domestic travelers accounted for 98 percent of those visiting the region, while the top three sources of overseas visitors were Kazakhstan, Russia and Mongolia.According to the report, tourism will maintain high-speed growth of 40 percent in the next half year thanks to stable public security, enhanced infrastructure construction and flourishing winter tourism.Zhang Xiaoyu, general secretary of the Xinjiang Tourism Association, said that winter used to be the slack season for Xinjiang because of the rather low temperatures and heavy snow."Numerous scenic spots were shut down when winter came, but they grew to be new attractions to travelers thanks to the popularity of winter tourism," he said.In February, 351 attractions were available to travelers, much more than the 69 that opened around that time last year, according to the report.Scenic spots also saw an increase in travelers during the winter. Zhang said that the region offers diversified entertainment to travelers during the season."In the southern part, people can join a desert exploration event in winter that is hard to carry out in the summer sun," he said. "Skiing and hot springs are popular choices for travelers visiting the northern areas."The region, however, still faces challenges because of insufficient tour products, inconvenient transportation, a shortage of talent and insufficient planning and management, according to the report."Talent is the main problem," Zhang said. "Tour guides and management staff are in high demand. Also, there are few training courses available to people in the tourism industry. We need people to bring new ideas to help promote the region's tourism development."Mao Weihua contributed to this story.

                'King of Naan' succeeds on an industrial scale
            </a>
            <p>
                As the fourth generation of naan makers in his family, Tursonjon Abula said his latest goal is to produce 25,000 of the flatbreads in a day.The 45-year-old from Hotan prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, was told by his grandfather when he was young he would have to make 400 in a day to call himself the "King of Naan".With modern production methods, he easily surpasses that.Tursonjon was brought up in his grandfather's naan shop in a village in southern Xinjiang's Moyu county. There he learned the skills of making quality naan in traditional wood-fired clay pits.After taking over the family business, he started to change the traditional ways. "I decided to stuff the naans with jam made from roses grown in Hotan and dry fruits. The new varieties immediately became a hit," Tursonjon said proudly.In 2016, he expanded his business to the regional capital of Urumqi and registered the brand name "King of Naan" to honor his grandfather.Besides the naan stores he owns around Urumqi, Tursonjon now runs a naan factory with 40 employees. His factory, which began operations in September last year, is in the naan industrial and cultural park in Urumqi.

                Kazak president has high praise for BRI
            </a>
            <p>
                Visiting Kazak President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev hailed the Belt and Road Initiative on Wednesday as a way to a promising future, saying the modern Silk Road has restructured the global economy.Tokayev, who kicked off his first state visit to China on Tuesday since taking office in June, made the remarks during a speech at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing.Thanks to the BRI, 11 cross-border railways and highways through Kazakhstan have facilitated transportations across the Eurasian continent, and enabled Chinese commodities to reach consumers in Europe, the Eurasian Economic Union and the Near East three to four times faster than six years ago, the Kazak president said.He said China and Kazakhstan have started 15 projects on joint building of the Belt and Road with a value of $4 billion. "All the projects help create new job opportunities and foster new enterprises that produce high value-added products, develop renewable energy and promote new technologies in agriculture and manufacturing."The two countries are also actively pushing for cooperation on refined products in the areas of oil, petroleum, natural gas, nuclear energy and mining, Tokayev said.The president called China "a friendly neighbor and reliable partner", and said the Kazakhstan-China relationship has become a good example of state-to-state relations."The important thing is there remains nothing that impedes the development of bilateral relations and further cooperation between the two countries," Tokayev said, adding the two nations will sign a joint statement to further consolidate and deepen their comprehensive strategic partnership during his visit.
