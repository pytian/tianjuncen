                Govt plans to boost sports consumption
            </p>
            <p>
                Better facilities and tax policies to turn the industry into pillar for growthInspired by increasing public sports participation, China's central government has pledged to further stimulate sports-related consumption through a plan to back the quality development of the sports industry.From sweat-soaked runners jostling in marathons to excited fans roaring in support of their favorite teams at the just-concluded basketball World Cup in China, sports participation is on the rise in China, motivating the central government to issue a new guideline aimed at boosting sports-related business through more efficient management, better service and stronger financial support.The plan, issued by the State Council, China's Cabinet, on Tuesday lays out 35 measures - including the reform of sports governance, construction of facilities and preferential tax policies - to turn the sports industry into a pillar for economic growth.According to the plan, national sports associations have to reform their administrative management by bringing more talent and expertise from outside government ranks while delegating the organizing and marketing rights of grassroots sports events to operators from the private sector.The General Administration of Sport of China, the country's top sports governing body, will work with ministry-level departments of education, finance, housing and urban-rural development to promote wider sports participation on campuses, cut taxes for qualified sports-related businesses, build more accessible sports facilities and professionalize domestic sports leagues."Even though our sports industry has grown at a fast pace in recent years, we are not yet a strong sporting nation, consumption-wise, as the contribution of the sports business to our overall economic growth remains modest," Li Yingchuan, a deputy director of GASC, said in a media briefing on Wednesday.According to the National Bureau of Statistics, sports-related businesses in China generated 781 billion yuan ($110 billion) in added value in 2017, up 20.6 percent from the previous year and accounting for about 0.95 percent of GDP.An analysis by Plunkett Research showed that the equivalent proportion in the United States was 3 percent in 2017.Compared with international sports powers such as the US, China's sports industry has huge potential to fuel the service sector, including ticketing, sports venue operation, fitness training and guidance, sports tourism and leisure, said Liu Fumin, director of GASC's sports economy department.One of the key tasks of the sports sector is to guide the public to adopt more active lifestyles by offering accessible and affordable sports facilities, fitness services and higher-quality sports competitions, Liu said.In 2014, the Chinese government announced a national strategy to develop the country's sports industry and raise the sector's annual output to 5 trillion yuan by 2025, while making the promotion of fitness one of the government's national priorities.

                UK govt formally suspends Parliament for 5 weeks
            </a>
            <p>
                The British government has formally suspended Parliament, sending lawmakers home for five weeks amid a Brexit crisis.The legislature was officially prorogued, or suspended, with a formal ceremony in the House of Lords — but only after House of Commons Speaker John Bercow voiced his displeasure, saying many regard it as "an act of executive fiat."There were raucous scenes in the House of Commons as opposition lawmakers chanted "Shame on you."Lawmakers will return Oct 14, little more than two weeks before Britain is due to leave the European Union on Oct 31.The opposition accuses Prime Minister Boris Johnson of trying to stop lawmakers studying his Brexit plan.It is the first time in more than 70 years a British government has suspended Parliament when faced with opposition.AP

                Proposed vacancy tax completes the HK govt’s housing initiative
            </a>
            <p>
                 The Hong Kong government's proposed property vacancy tax will be tabled at the Legislative Council when it reopens.The new tax will be the last of the six measures to be implemented in the government's initiatives to tackle the housing shortage problem in the city.The tax bill, to be gazetted on Friday, indicates that the entire package of six new housing measures will be put in place, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor wrote in her official social media account on Thursday.As part and parcel of the six new measures introduced in June 2018, the vacancy tax on empty new residential units is designed to discourage developers from manipulating home prices by hoarding.In the government's proposal, first-hand private residential units that have not been occupied or rented out for more than six months will be considered as vacant and subject to tax at twice the normal rate determined by the Rating and Valuation Department.The other five measures include decoupling the price of subsidized flats from market prices, and reallocating nine land sites from private development to the building of public housing.Lam stressed the housing problem is the most challenging, formidable and complex among all livelihood issues. More new measures, aiming to increase the housing supply, will be in the pipeline, she added.

                HK govt to meet district councilors to break deadlock
            </a>
            <p>
                Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government will have discussions with the city's district councilors to find ways of bringing an end to the civil unrest that has torn the society apart in recent months.The invitation to community leaders, extended by the SAR government on Friday, was the latest move by government to heal the rift.Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor had earlier met with business representatives and youth groups to listen to their suggestions.These meetings are part of a bid to lay the groundwork for an open discussion platform for people from all walks of life.Lam and her principal officials will meet the city's district councilors next Wednesday at government headquarters.The invitation was welcomed by many district councilors, who said it is an opportunity to share opinions they have gathered at a grassroots level with the government amid an atmosphere of mistrust and misinformation that permeates society.Bunny Chan Chung-bun, chairman of the Kwun Tong District Council, said district councilors are on the frontline serving residents and it is their job to set aside differences and reflect the real concerns of residents in their communities to the chief executive.Chan, a former chairman of the Youth Commission, said understanding people's opinions will help the government to better implement its policies to help bridge the division in society.Chan stressed that as elected officials, district councilors have the duty and responsibility to convey public opinion to government.The current term of the district councilors will end October 4, 2019, with the District Council Election slated for November 24. A total of 452 district councilors from 18 districts in the city will be on the ballot."Dialogue is better than dispute," said Derek Hung Chiu-wah, member of Yau Tsim Mong District Council, adding that it is unwise of pro-democracy councilors to protest or disrupt order at the sessions, which may deprive others of the chance to voice their opinions.Frankie Ngan Man-yu, member of the Kwun Tong District Council, said the government's planned discussion platform will be a major step forward. An effective dialogue is built on mutual respect, seeking harmony rather than confrontation, Ngan said.Earlier, Lam also revealed that she will go with her governing team to talk directly to the people in different communities.Ngan urged that the chief executive and her bureau chiefs should start direct talks with residents as early as possible in order to adopt more feasible policies in the future.
