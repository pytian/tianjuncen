                ZF to deepen localization efforts in China for next-generation mobility
            </p>
            <p>
                ZF Friedrichshafen AG is to increase production and development in China in terms of electrification and autonomous driving as the technologies perceived for future mobility are gaining a bigger momentum in the country, according to top executives. The Germany-based global technology company is presenting its latest solutions in those aspects at the ongoing Shanghai auto show, which are to support the ambitions of both local Chinese customers and international companies in terms of next-generation mobility. "We believe automatic driving will be highly appreciated in China with its highly dense traffic in urban areas. We believe the demand will be tremendous here," CEO Wolf-Henning Scheider told China Daily on Wednesday.  ZF's coPILOT vehicle makes its global debut in Shanghai, showing Level 2 plus autonomous functions. Photos Provided to China DailyOf ZF's exhibits in Shanghai for future mobility is a supercomputer, the ProAI RoboThink, which is making its premiere in Asia. It is the most powerful central processing unit in the automotive industry, capable of computing performance of more than 150 teraOPS, or 150 trillion calculation operations per second. It can be extended to up to four units, offering a total performance of 600 teraOPS. Combined with ZF's suite of sensors, the system is capable of delivering Level-4-plus autonomous driving functions and shared service. The company also is holding a global debut of its coPILOT vehicle, showing its solution for urban mobility with Level-2-plus autonomous functions. Based on its ProAI Gen2 supercomputer and Nvidia software, the system will offer comfort to drivers and help ease urban traffic congestion and cut pollution, among others, said Scheider. It can monitor individual driving behavior as well as the interior of the vehicle in order to help prevent or mitigate hazardous situations. The system's volume production is scheduled to start in 2021, according to the company. ZF offers a number of products already in series production in the fields of autonomous driving and e-mobility. In China, the company is getting a firmer foothold through increased production and development capabilities in the country. "China is already the world's largest automotive market and it will be a trendsetter in many other aspects of future mobility as well," said Scheider. The company expects 30 percent of its global sales will come from the Asia-Pacific region in the future, in which China will play a dominant position. Last year, sales in China accounted for 80 percent of the total from the region. "To achieve this, we will further develop our solutions to address next-generation mobility for the Chinese market through enhanced local development and investment, strengthened local leadership and participation in the local mobility ecosystem," said Scheider. It now has nearly 40 production sites in 24 cities in China and will increase its localization by up to 100 percent in the coming years. One example is ZF's new steering plant in Zhangjiagang, Jiangsu province - its largest steering plant worldwide and its largest investment in the Asia-Pacific region to date. Two joint ventures with Chinese commercial vehicle manufacturer Foton started operations earlier this month, further improving ZF's production capacity and localization in China. The factory in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, is expected to achieve series production of electric drive products by March 2020. "I am asking my teams to be really speedy so we are talking about a few years, say, two to three years, to achieve the target," said Scheider. ZF is now developing autonomous driving and e-mobility solutions in China as well as its conventional systems, reinforcing its commitment to full localization. Holger Klein, a ZF board member responsible for Asia-Pacific, said, "ZF's development capabilities in China are keeping pace and providing customers in China with high quality products and services." ZF said Chinese vehicle manufacturers are playing an increasingly important role in its global growth strategy. ZF China President Renee Wang said the company is committed to developing tailored solutions to help meet the growth aspirations of its local customers. "Innovation and speed is very important in the automotive industry if we want to be perceived as a leading technology company and partner of choice. This is particularly true for the Chinese market��we must achieve 'China Speed'," said Wang. (China Daily 04/22/2019 page17)

                Capital's tech industrial influence goes global
            </a>
            <p>
                From high-tech companies to auto manufacturers, Beijing's industrial influence is expanding on both domestic and international levels. Among the local high-tech powerhouses is Tus-Holdings, a spinoff of Tsinghua University. Founded in 2000, the company targets startups, providing them with incubation and financing services. Compared with the 1990s, the environment for innovation in China has transformed, said Chen Hongbo, executive vice-president of Tus-Holdings. "Nowadays, companies have a better starting point, with a higher level of technology, rich social resources and more financing opportunities." Tus-Holdings has established more than 300 innovation centers worldwide and has launched over 100 technology projects in cooperation with 65 colleges around the world. "High-tech companies are part and parcel of regional economic development," Chen said. "They boost the local economy by promoting the industrialization of technological achievements and bringing new products, business patterns and job opportunities." The company is engaged across diversified industries, ranging from environmental protection, digital economy and clean energy to new materials. The Belt and Road Initiative is an opportunity for companies to better develop businesses in overseas markets with the vision of shared benefits, Chen said. "We will improve our business patterns to support more high-tech companies and thus aid in China's efforts in building itself into an innovation powerhouse," he said. Foton Motor Group is a Beijing-based commercial vehicle manufacturer founded in 1996. Its product portfolio incorporates heavy-duty and light-duty trucks, vans and buses. The company has fulfilled more than 70 major orders in 34 countries and regions involved in the BRI. It has cooperated in infrastructure construction projects in countries such as Kenya and Pakistan. With the development of industry 4.0, the manufacturer has also broadened its businesses to incorporate the internet and advanced technologies, including an industrial internet platform monitoring center and self-driving vehicles. Zhou Zhe, a staff member of the company's internet of vehicles department, said the center is aimed at fulfilling automated monitoring in areas including vehicle production, operation and maintenance. Caciuc Anatolie, a journalist from Teleradio-Moldova, said during a tour of Foton's facilities that the development of China's automobile industry has been stunning. "I have been to China several times, but this is my first time visiting a vehicle production workshop and it is also a demonstration of China's rapid development in social economy," he said. China has provided support for Moldova especially in infrastructure construction, Caciuc said. "Self-driving cars and the industrial internet platform are the best creations and I hope my country can import such high-tech products from China." You Jing, a Foton employee, said expanding overseas markets is a crucial part of the company's strategy and its diesel engine brand is highly recognized in overseas markets. liangkaiyan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily 04/27/2019 page11)

                Hydrogen fuel cell technology put on solid development path
            </a>
            <p>
                Government reinforces intention to cooperate with big-name industry playersThe future role of hydrogen fuel cells in China's fast-changing automotive industry was made clearer by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Tuesday, with it detailing the government's latest development prospects for the technology."Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles will coexist and complement fully electric vehicles, jointly meeting the people's transportation needs," said Huang Libin, spokesman for the ministry, at a news conference held by the State Council Information Office in Beijing.Both hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and fully electric lithium battery vehicles are important technical routes for new energy vehicles, Huang said, adding that based on their technical characteristics and development trends, fully electric vehicles have so far proved more suitable for passenger cars travelling within the city limits, while hydrogen-powered vehicles suit large commercial vehicles, such as buses and trucks, used over longer distances.His words were echoed by Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consulting firm Automotive Foresight, who said that the large differences in costs in applying the different technologies across different applications is proving complementary rather than competitive.The advantages of hydrogen fuel cells is that they produce zero emissions, enable longer distance driving and require little time to refuel.However, safely storing hydrogen is a key technological challenge, as well as there being a lack of supporting infrastructure, laws and regulations.Hydrogen lags far behind electric both in terms of infrastructure and commercialization."The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology will carry out demonstration runs of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles together with other departments, with the aim of promoting innovative development in China's hydrogen energy and fuel cell vehicle industries," Huang said.His remarks are the latest made at State-level on the market prospects of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, reafirming the government's intention to cooperate with bigname automakers on developing this segment of the market.Japanese auto giant Toyota - one of the first automakers to develop hydrogen fuel cell vehicles - established a joint research institute with Tsinghua University on April 21, working on hydrogen fuel cell technology. The next day, on April 22, Toyota joined hands with Foton Motor Group and Beijing SinoHytec, a high-tech enterprise focusing on the R&D and industrialization of hydrogen fuel cell engines.The cooperation will see the hydrogen-powered buses produced by Foton Motor coupled with Sino-Hytec's hydrogen fuel cell power system which uses Toyota's hydrogen fuel cell stack and other components and parts."Foton's fuel cell bus will serve the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics," said Xu Heyi, the chairman of BAIC, parent company of Foton, at the two sessions this year."BAIC Motor will step up the development of hydrogen products in commercial vehicles."With its experience accumulated in hydrogen fuel cell technology, Foton has developed the fourth generation of its hydrogen fuel cell buses, adding advanced safety features and vehicle layout design in line with international standards.The automaker is collaborating with related enterprises on hydrogen manufacturing, storage, transportation, the construction of hydrogen refueling stations and developing more hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, aiming to forge a whole industrial chain.The collaboration between Toyota and Foton is expected by insiders to extend to a full range of models, including passenger cars, vans, and light and heavy trucks, providing a valuable foundation for next-generation commercial vehicles.SAIC Maxus unveiled China's first hydrogen fuel cell passenger car - the Maxus G20FC - at the 2019 Shanghai auto show.The model has a maximum driving range of 550 kilometers under the standard of the New European Driving Cycle, known as NEDC, and can be refueled from empty to full in five minutes.Xu Qiuhua, general manager of SAIC Maxus, said as the ultimate solution to pollution caused by automobiles, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles will play a key role in the development direction of the automobile industry.However, compared with Europe, North America, Japan and South Korea, who have already made substantial progress in developing hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, China still has a long way to go."Developing hydrogen fuel cell vehicles strongly relies on core technologies and supporting infrastructure, so it will take China at least 10 to 20 years to completely realize the industrialization and commercialization of hydrogen fuel cell automobiles," said Zhang from Automotive Foresight.

                Foton's commercial focus steers brand toward success
            </a>
            <p>
                Foton Motor Group's strategy of focusing more on commercial vehicles is producing promising results, with its business revenue in the first quarter of this year growing 50 percent year-on-year to over 14 billion yuan ($2.07 billion).The strategy has driven its profits in the three months to grow by more than 80 million yuan compared with the same period last year, according to statistics the Chinese automaker released in late April.The results came three months after it sold a majority stake in Borgward, a passenger car brand it purchased in 2014 but failed to make a success in the Chinese market."The results, especially selling off the passenger car business, marked the preliminary achievement in our strategy," said Foton President Gong Yueqiong. "We will focus all our resources on our commercial vehicles, which will be key to our future strategy as well."Gong said the good business performance is thanks to Foton's efforts in upgrading its commercial vehicles ranging from light to heavy trucks over the years, and in cutting costs in sales and management.A total of 131,000 vehicles were sold from January to March, up 11.8 percent year-on-year, lifting the group's market share by 1.3 percentage points to 11.5 percent."Our strategy is clear. We improve products and operation, and meanwhile increase investment to sharpen our competitive edge," said Gong.He said Foton's investment in research and development in the first quarter went up 27 percent year-on-year, adding that similar expenditure last year doubled from 2017.The company will invest 2.8 billion yuan over five years in R&D facilities.Foton is one of the first commercial vehicle makers to develop new energy vehicles and autonomous driving.It is offering electric, hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, covering light trucks, vans and pickups, and has received licenses to test autonomous driving on public roads.Yang Guotao, a vice-president at Foton, said the carmaker expects its sales of new energy vehicles to reach 100,000 in 2025, which is believed to be a turning point for their growth.Foton is planning to strengthen its overseas presence as well. In the first quarter, it exported 13,000 vehicles, topping the list of Chinese commercial carmakers.Zhang Xiyong, Foton chairman, said the company's overseas sales will reach 100,000 vehicles in 2020, accounting for 15 percent of its total deliveries.Foton has established a number of plants overseas. Late last month, it inked a deal with Charoen Pokphand Group to set up a new joint venture to produce vehicles in Thailand for sales across the ASEAN region.The new company will make a broad range of vehicles, with Foton providing the technology.Foton said it is confident in future growth prospects in Southeast Asia, targeting a top three position in Thailand.
