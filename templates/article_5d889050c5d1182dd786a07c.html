                Cabo Polonio, Uruguay’s Shangri-La
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                In this day and age, urban dwellers are either cocooned in the digital world, minds boggled by a myriad of content online; or subconsciously tyrannized by the always-being-connected lifestyle, bombarded 24/7 by push notifications on ever-smarter phones.Buffeted and drained by the hustle and bustle in big cities, do you sometimes fancy zoning out a bit to go back to nature and regain peace and quiet within?Uruguay, a diamond embedded between Brazil and Argentina, now promises its Cabo Polonio, a hamlet many people call “Shangri-La” on the country’s eastern coast, can shelter and nourish weary souls in modern life.Dr. Leonardo Segalerba, 54, born in Uruguay’s capital, Montevideo, used to work as a lawyer in the capital city. Tired of hectic city life, he retired at 40, moved to Cabo Polonio and became one of its 120 permanent residents.“Basically every 20 seconds at night, you can spot a meteor shooting across the sky,” said Segalerba, press representative for Cabo Polonio at a promotional event held at the Cervantes Institute in Beijing.Cabo, meaning “cape” in English, is a peninsula infamous for its rocky shores and fierce seas that wrecked many ships. Polonio, a Spanish ship, was just one of those misfortunes. It crashed into the peninsula on a stormy night in 1735, leaving its name as a legacy to the place where it was destroyed.Isolated from surrounding cities by sand dunes and without roads directly leading to it, Cabo Polonio is geographically removed from urban civilization. The only way to get there is by taking a double-decker truck that routinely picks up tourists at a station and takes them on a 20-minute bumpy ride.Electricity, genesis of modern comfort and entertainment, isn’t available. But it is worth noting the iconic lighthouse erected in 1881 by the Uruguayan government is powered by the national grid to prevent shipwrecks.Moreover, there is no running water in the area, and villagers there rely on water from wells and collected rain water.Recognized as a national park in 2009 by the Uruguayan government, Cabo Polonio embraces a mix of natural environments, such as beaches, sand dunes, and wetland. Meanwhile, the park is home to Uruguay’s second-largest colony of sea lions, which number roughly 200,000.With its breathtaking natural beauty and primitiveness, Cabo Polonio strikes visitors as the Shangri-La of South America. Since the 1980s, the site has been sought after by American and European tourists who desire to escape suffocating city life and reconnect with the freshness and tranquility of nature.“Many writers live here around the year focusing on their books as it’s a place where they can disconnect themselves from the chaos of the modern world,” Segalerba said.“It is only in the last two years that Chinese tourists began to come to Cabo Polonio,” Segalerba told China Daily in an interview.Zhang Qi, 32, a travel enthusiast whose footsteps have been left in more than 60 countries, is among the first batch of Chinese tourists to the area.Zhang has traveled to Uruguay four times and to Cabo Polonio twice, in 2017 and 2018. He spent more than 20 days during his recent trip to the village with his brother and sister-in-law, who were on their honeymoon.Calling Cabo Polonio his favorite place in the world, the well-traveled man opened a café in Beijing’s always buzzing and alcohol-laden Sanlitun in May and named it “Cabo Coffee”, serving both excellent coffee and South Americans’ favorite drink, the mate tea, a caffeine-rich infused drink.“In Cabo, I saw the biggest-ever setting sun, the most beautiful sunset, and the most spectacular galaxy of the southern hemisphere,” Zhang fondly recalled, adding that “There is no electricity in Cabo, but it makes the place cooler and gives me a sense of primitiveness.”Like Zhang’s observation, Cabo Polonio is at its finest at night.As the lighthouse is the sole artificial light after sunset, the region is free from light pollution, making it a vantage point in the Southern Hemisphere for appreciating thousands of stars punctuating the night sky.Another night feast for the eye is watching the second-largest sea lion colony in Uruguay behind the iconic lighthouse, where the creatures can be seen singing and dancing.During the day, Cabo Polonio also has much fun to offer. Surfing, sunbathing on the beaches, running up and sliding down the sand dunes, or hiking along the shores are among the activities.The village, covering an area of about 26,000 hectares, is inhabited only by 120 permanent residents, with most engaged in tourism, running restaurants or renting their houses to tourists.During the peak season, from mid-December to mid-January, some 3,000 tourists will flock to Cabo Polonio and spend days or even weeks there. This has aroused the concern of many environmentalists, fearing swarms of tourists may pose a threat or even damage protected wildlife and the fragile ecosystem that the country values.“The isolation created by the surroundings prevents swarms of tourists from reaching Cabo, acting as a ‘natural shield’ that protects and preserves its culture and distinct way of life,” Segalerba explained.Segalerba also pointed out that planning, analyzing and monitoring tourists’ behavioral patterns can help achieve a fragile balance between environmental protection and the sustainable development of the area.In addition, the authority in charge of the site will adopt measures such as managing tourist flow of the year and involving the local community in environmental protection to handle problems that may arise with the arrival of more and more international tourists.Yang Xiaoyu contributed to the story

                    Tourists clamor for a slice of island life

                 More visitors are coming to Changhai County of Dalian, Liaoning province, for beautiful island scenery, delicious seafood, and even dolphin-spotting. "We're thinking of opening regular dolphin-spotting tours next year," says Guo Chengjin, who is running a Chinese-style bed-and-breakfast business, or minsu, with her mother. "In recent years, the dolphins have been seen in the local waters around April and they stay until November. It's not difficult to find them. By taking a boat trip people sometimes see pods of more than 100 dolphins," she says. With the name of Haide Jijie, or seasons of the sea, Guo's homestay has 30 rooms near the seaside on the Dachangshan Island, one of the biggest of the 252 islands comprising Changhai County. Changhai is located on the Yellow Sea, facing the east of the Korean Peninsula. It is the closest point to Japan and the Republic of Korea in Northeast China. Every summer, tens of thousands of tourists vacation on the islands, making the most of local homestays, inns and hotels. The Haide Jijie ranks highly on Ctrip, China's largest online travel agency. "My family had a wonderful short getaway. Everyone is satisfied with our stay here. This place is like a northeastern version of Phuket, Thailand," one user writes on the Ctrip website. "We really enjoyed the delicious and fresh seafood, especially the oysters and scallops," she adds. Changhai is famous for its authentic and tasty seafood, including trepang (a kind of precious sea cucumber), abalone and sea urchin. According to Guo, their minsu can provide set meals for guests. They can also order separately or buy fresh seafood from local markets or the fishing port to bring back to cook. "The seafood here tastes really good. More importantly, it is of high quality and inexpensive," writes another Ctrip user, who went there twice this summer. It's a seaside paradise, with some visitors digging clams or picking up little crabs and sea snails in the flats at low tide, while others enjoy sea fishing and boat tours. Some, however, just want to sunbathe on the sandy beach or frolic in the ocean. For those who prefer their animal entertainment to be based on land, Guo's pets-an Alaskan Malamute and 12 cats-love the attention of the guests at the minsu.
