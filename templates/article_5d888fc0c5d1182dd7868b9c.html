                China urges South Sudan parties to accelerate peace implementation
            </p>
            <p>
                JUBA -- China has urged parties to South Sudan's September 2018 peace deal to fast-track its implementation and end the conflict in the east African country.The Chinese Embassy in South Sudan said in a statement issued on Tuesday evening that Beijing supports efforts to restore peace and stability in the world's youngest nation and urged the country's leaders to put their personal interest aside and work for the wellbeing of all South Sudanese."China sincerely hopes that relevant parties of South Sudan could put the people's interests above all else, establish confidence in peace, fulfill the commitment to peace, accelerate the implementation of the revitalization peace agreement, and realize permanent peace in South Sudan at an early date," said Feng Bo, Military Attache of the Chinese Embassy in Juba.Feng made the remarks on Tuesday in Juba during an occasion marking the 92nd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.Feng said China will continue to provide support and assistance to the peace and development of South Sudan within its capacity.On his part, South Sudan's army chief Gabriel Jok Riak praised the achievements of the Chinese army in the past nine decades, adding that he would seek more assistance from their Chinese counterparts to support the peace process.South Sudan descended into civil war in late 2013 and the conflict has created one of the fastest growing refugee crises in the world.The UN estimates that about 4 million South Sudanese have been displaced internally and externally.A peace deal signed in August 2015 collapsed following renewed violence in the capital Juba in July 2016.Under the new peace deal signed on September 2018, opposition leader Riek Machar with four others will once again be reinstated as Kiir's deputy.But signatories to the fragile agreement on May 3 agreed to extend the formation of a transitional government by six months following delays in the implementation of the pact.

                Hunan creating goodwill by sharing its resources with Africa
            </a>
            <p>
                Central China province strengthens bonds by providing agricultural, educational and medical expertise to less-developed nations As the host province of the China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo and as a rising economic power in Central China, Hunan is lending its intelligence to aid Africa's development. As Hunan has gathered strength in sectors including agriculture, manufacturing, medical care and education, it is willing to share its experience with countries in Africa. One of the leading Chinese agricultural scientists in Hunan, Yuan Longping, who is known as the "father of hybrid rice", said his wish is to benefit the entire world with better and more varieties of hybrid rice. Africa is one of the regions to benefit from the research achievements of Hunan's agricultural scientists, including Yuan. In Madagascar, the paddy rice field is a part of its national emblem. It shows the people's fondness for the crop, which has been in the country for nearly 2,000 years. It is a custom in Madagascar that rice ear is the best present to give a guest visiting a household.   Researchers from the Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences presented their best gift to the country by sharing their research results in hybrid rice. During the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in 2006, the Chinese government promised to develop 10 agricultural demonstration centers in Africa. Based on its international strength in the research and development of hybrid rice, the Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences was assigned to build a hybrid rice demonstration center in Madagascar. The project was launched in 2007, the first of the 10 centers pledged by China. Despite its long history in rice farming, Madagascar had suffered from insufficient grain supply for many years. This was because of limited output of regular rice varieties. The Hunan academy cooperated with a rice seedling company - Yuan's Seeds - in the province to cultivate high-quality and high-output hybrid rice seeds for the country. Zhang Lijun, general manager of the Madagascar branch of Yuan's, has been engaged in developing rice seeds for the country for more than 10 years. Zhang said Yuan's established its branch in Madagascar in 2010. It founded a hybrid rice research center there in 2012. Seed cultivation has been conducted in both China and Madagascar. Currently, the output of seed growing in the African country can reach about 400 metric tons a year. China exports another 390 tons to Madagascar annually. As a result, 35,000 hectares of hybrid rice have been added to the country over the past decade, which means an increase of 104,900 tons of grains in total. Medical aid Boasting several nationally renowned hospitals and medical research and education institutions, Hunan is using its expertise in the medical sector to safeguard the health of African people. Hunan's initiative to aid is also made possible thanks to a group of devoted medical practitioners. They are experienced, distinguished in their fields and true to their values. Departing from their loved ones in their home province, they went to Africa to serve the needy as doctors. Sierra Leone is a West African country that attracts millions of tourists every year because of its picturesque landscapes. However, it is also on the United Nations' list of least-developed countries, especially in medical care. China has offered medical assistance to the country since 1972. According to an agreement signed between the governments of China and Sierra Leone that year, Hunan was assigned to take charge of medical assistance in the country. The province sent its first medical task force to Sierra Leone in 1973. In the 1970s, diseases like malaria were rampant in Sierra Leone because of poor sanitary conditions. The situation was worsened by a lack of medical professionals, medicines and equipment. In only 20 days, the Chinese team built their first hospital in the country, bringing hopes to the locals with their devotion, professionalism, as well as China-made medicines and equipment. In 1985, Hunan dispatched a medical team to Zimbabwe. The number of long-term medical team members in the two countries reached 438 and temporary mission members amounted to 157. In total, they have served more than 800,000 patients in the countries and conducted more than 200,000 operations. The China-Sierra Leone Friendship Hospital in the nation's capital city of Freetown is the outcome of the two countries' medical cooperation. The hospital was built and operated with the help of Hunan's medical institutions and professionals. Li Jindong, a doctor from the renowned Xiangya Hospital in Changsha, capital city of Hunan, is the leader of the 20th medical assistance team from China. He and his team members have been in the hospital for a year, according to a report on Changsha Evening News. They have served more than 34,000 local patients and conducted about 350 operations. Li said his team launched a two-month-long training program for the nurses in the hospital in March. The hospital has only five local doctors, including the hospital president, and 86 nurses. "Most of the medical services are provided by the nurses because of the lack of doctors," Li said. He added the training program can make the nurses more professional and versatile to serve patients. In 2018, Hunan's Xiangya Hospital was commissioned by the National Health Commission of China to upgrade the hospital. It aims to make it a demonstrative hospital in West Africa. Hunan is now dispatching the 21st medical assistance team to Sierra Leone and the 17th team to Zimbabwe. Education cooperation Hunan is also sharing its development experience with Africa through education and training programs. Hunan-based China South Publishing and Media Group kicked off an education assistance program in South Sudan in January 2017. This was China's first educational assistance program in foreign countries. South Sudan is a young country founded in 2011. After years of wars, the country saw education as an important part of its reconstruction. However, the limited government expenditure was a bottleneck to the sector. The country's authorities expected help from the international community. The China South Publishing and Media Group sees the program an important corporate social responsibility initiative. The program covers areas such as education planning, teacher training, publication of textbooks and education-related information and communications technologies. According to Gong Shuguang, chairman of China South Publishing and Media Group, the lack of textbooks is a pressing challenge in the newly founded country. To solve the problem, the company established a textbook compiling team in cooperation with experts and educational officials in South Sudan. In September 2018, about 1.3 million textbooks published by the company, ranging from mathematics and English to science, were distributed in local schools ahead of the new semester. The training of teachers, managers and technological support personnel is an important part of the company's South Sudan program. To date the company has trained more than 200 people. The government and people of South Sudan highly praised the program. The South Sudanese ambassador to China, John Andruga Duku, said the company's program is a "tailored initiative" for South Sudan. "China's Hunan is now a familiar name in our country because of the program. We are grateful to the Hunan people," the ambassador said.  From Left: Du Jiahao, Party secretary of Hunan province, delivers a speech at the ongoing ChinaAfrica Economic and Trade Expo.

                KHARTOUM -- Sudan's Transitional Military Council (TMC) on Sunday announced its agreement on a proposal presented by the African-Ethiopian mediation to resolve the political crisis in the country."The African Union (AU) proposal constitutes an excellent base for negotiations and we are ready for the talks as of today," said Shams-Edin Kabashi, the TMC spokesman, in a statement.He expressed hope that a comprehensive solution, involving everyone, would be reached as soon as possible under the AU umbrella.He further said that any other efforts should be in coordination with the AU.Kabashi expressed the TMC's appreciation for the AU and Ethiopian envoys over their efforts to find a settlement for the political crisis in Sudan.Earlier, the AU and Ethiopia presented a joint proposal for the TMC and the opposition Freedom and Change Alliance with the aim to end the political crisis in the country.The proposal reportedly stipulates formation of a sovereignty council of 15 members and a cabinet of 18 ministers, besides delaying formation of the legislative council.

            <p>
                KHARTOUM - Sudanese army on Wednesday announced foiling a military coup attempt, led by the army chief and high ranking officers in the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) and Islamist leaders.Army's Chief of Joint Staff Hashim Abdel-Mutallab Ahmed, NISS high ranking officers, as well as leaders from the Islamic Movement and former ruling National Congress Party (NCP), were involved in the coup attempt, SUNA news agency reported, quoting the Sudanese army in a statement.Suspects in the coup attempt have been arrested and are now under investigation before a trial, the report said.The army said the attempted coup tended to foil the Sudanese revolution, bring back the former NCP to rule and sabotage the expected political solution and the establishment of a civilian-led government, said the report.On July 17, the ruling Transitional Military Council (TMC) and the opposition Freedom and Change Alliance initialed a political declaration, which outlines the structures of the transitional period.The declaration, reached under mediation by the African Union and Ethiopia, stipulates the establishment of a joint sovereignty council of 11 members, including five civilians and five military representatives, in addition to one civilian to be selected through consultation between the two sides.

                UN officials call for return to sea rescues after Mediterranean tragedy
            </a>
            <p>
                UNITED NATIONS -- United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, along with the heads of a number of UN agencies, have expressed horror at Thursday's reports that some 150 people may be dead after a boat they were traveling in capsized off the coast of Libya, making it the worst such tragedy in the Mediterranean this year.Several of the senior officials have called for a return to sea rescues in the Mediterranean, Farhan Haq, deputy spokesman for the UN chief, said at the daily news briefing.The Libya office of the International Organization for Migrants (IOM) published social media reports on Thursday that some 145 survivors of the shipwreck, mainly Eritreans and Sudanese, were returned to the Libyan shore. The survivors reported that some 250 were on the boat before it capsized, after engine failure.In a tweet, the UN chief wrote that he was "horrified" by the news, and called for "safe, legal routes for migrants and refugees." His comments were echoed by the head of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), Filippo Grandi, and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) chief, Henrietta Fore, both of whom also called for an end to the arbitrary detention of refugees and migrants in Libya.A spokesperson for UNHCR said in a press briefing on Friday that the large loss of life underscores the "terrible urgency" of the agency's repeated pleas to states to restore sea rescues and "help with alleviating the suffering of the thousands of refugees and migrants caught in the conflict in Libya."The UNHCR spokesperson reiterated the agency's request for additional help, such as further resettlement places, and other safe pathways out of Libya for vulnerable people, as well as increased measures to arrest and prosecute people traffickers.The wreck occurred three days after a conference in Paris on the situation in Libya and the Mediterranean, attended by the heads of the UN's refugee and migration agencies, during which they called for sea rescues not to be criminalized, and for those rescued not to be sent back to Libya.
