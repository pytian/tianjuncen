                Convention to combat illegal trade in antiquities nears 50th anniversary Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the 1970 Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. It was established by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. As the anniversary approaches, the agency is renewing calls for cooperation and dialogue from member states in the fight against illicit trade of cultural property. Lazare Eloundou Assomo, deputy director of the division for heritage and the UNESCO World Heritage Centre, said challenges will remain when the 1970 convention reaches the half-century milestone but the UNESCO will continue to review challenges, identify actions, and share good practices. "The world is evolving, there are new issues, and cooperation and partnership are absolutely important," Assomo said. " (The anniversary) will be a good opportunity to reflect for all the UNESCO member states who have signed the convention and also look at how to better cooperate with all partners ... some of the important subjects we will be discussing will pave the way for the next 50 years." The convention is an international treaty created to combat the illegal trade in cultural items. To date, 140 states have ratified it. Cultural property is deemed to be anything of scientific, historical, artistic, or religious significance. But the convention notes that every state can define its own cultural property, as long as the item is of importance to it. Emiline Smith, a lecturer in art crime and criminology at the University of Glasgow, said such items are important to nations' identity. "Certain social values, belief systems, and traditions are passed on from generation to generation, and cultural heritage is proof of this: a reflection of human civilization," she said. "Most countries have indicated certain objects that they deem most valuable to be national cultural heritage. As such, it can unite or divide a nation. It can be used in the creation of a political narrative. It can be a source of personal or national pride, and create a sense of belonging and connection." In an effort to tackle the issue of illicit trade in art and antiquities, groups made up of intergovernmental committees meet every year to review all issues related to illicit trafficking around the world. Assomo stressed that the UNESCO cannot act alone and noted that cooperating with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the International Police Organization, customs services, the private sector, and museums is key to protecting cultural heritage. One major concern for the UNESCO is the phenomenon of terrorist groups exploiting cultural sites to finance their activities. Smith said they are using attacks on cultural heritage "as a strategy to undermine national governments and intimidate local populations". "In some cases, the looting and destruction of cultural heritage have been found to generate income for terrorist groups to extend their operations, for example in Iraq and Syria," she said. "They know that there is a market for the art and antiquities that they sell." The UN Security Council adopted resolution 2347 in 2017, which aims to strengthen international cooperation in order to deprive terrorists of funding and to protect cultural heritage and curb illicit trade. There is also a need to ramp up the fight against illicit trafficking of cultural objects in the global art market. According to the UNESCO, Europe is reportedly the largest exporter of art and antiquities, and the second-largest importer. The UN agency acknowledges that, while most of the estimated $14.6 billion European trade is licit or "clean", there is no doubt that it also falls victim to organized crime, money laundering and terrorist financing as a means for generating illicit proceeds. Illicit art is being detected as objects make their way in, through, and out of Europe and, at times, these objects make their way into the European licit market. Because this black market is hard to trace and quantify, the UNESCO believes preventative and tracking measures must be strengthened. Assomo explained that education and the importance of reinforcing due diligence measures is key for the art market. He said museums in Europe have, in the past 10 years, put in a lot of work on checking provenance, but he pointed out that more work is needed when it comes to Europe's auction houses. Auction giant Christie's recently hit the headlines when Egyptian authorities urged it to cancel the sale of a Tutankhamun statue that Egypt claimed had been looted from a temple. Assomo said the UNESCO reached out to Christie's after they were asked to do so by the Egyptian authorities. Christie's went on to sell the statue for $5.96 million. "We played our role and, of course, the auction houses have their own procedures in checking provenance, but when there is a country that is really concerned about the selling of an object that it considers at part of its cultural identity, I believe dialogue is important," he said. "This is something which we would like to push and will continue to push in the future." boleung@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily Global 09/10/2019 page3)

                Officials say China makes great human rights achievements over 70 years
            </a>
            <p>
                GENEVA -- China has made great achievements in human rights over the past 70 years, officials said here Monday during the opening ceremony of a human rights exhibition.China's economy and society are growing more robust, Chen Xu, head of the Chinese mission to United Nations (UN) at Geneva, said at the opening ceremony of the exhibition titled "Pursuing Happiness for the People: 70 Years of Human Rights Progress in China" at the Palais des Nations.The exhibition, jointly sponsored by China's State Council Information Office and the Permanent Mission of China to UN at Geneva, captures 70 years of happy moments in the country since the People's Republic of China was founded in October 1949."Food or clothing shortages no longer threaten the 1.3 billion Chinese, and more than 850 million Chinese are out of poverty, 770 million are employed," Chen said.Also, nine-year compulsory education is provided across the country, and China's universal health care system and social security system lead the world in scale, he said."The secret to all of this lies in the way we promote human rights in China -- knowing our own realities, putting the people's interests above all else, and promoting human rights through development, the rule of law, and greater openness," he said.Chen said that with remarkable transformations unseen in human history, the Chinese people are united under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, on the path of development with Chinese characteristics.China is fully committed to multilateralism. It works for a community with a shared future for humanity, advocates dialogue and cooperation, and honors its international human rights obligations, Chen said.China keeps in mind not only its own development but also the common progress of the world through win-win cooperation, he said."What China has accomplished in human rights is a great contribution to the international cooperation in this area," said Chen, adding that China stands ready to work with the international community to build a better world.Lu Guangjin, director general of the Department of Human Rights of China's State Council Information Office, said at the ceremony that the well-being of the people did not stop at China's borders."Over the past 70 years, China advocated peace, development and cooperation in the international community," using cooperation as the way "to deliver development and thereby human rights progress," Lu said."It shares its wisdom and solutions for global human rights governance and makes hard efforts to promote this global cause and build a community with a shared future for humanity," he said.Lu said that as China is moving forward, the Chinese people will enjoy more rights to a greater extent and realize all-around development at a higher level, and China's contribution to human rights development across the world and the diversity of human civilization will only increase.Philippine Ambassador to UN at Geneva Evan P. Garcia, who also attended the ceremony, praised China for its achievements over the past 70 years."The People's Republic of China has demonstrated a tremendous achievement in lifting so many people out of poverty and in promoting development for the whole country," said Garcia."This is something that the whole world should recognize and learn from," Garcia said, adding "it's something that could not have happened without their commitment to peace."

                Building a brighter future for the world
            </a>
            <p>
                The cause of human rights across the worlds is facing traditional and non-traditional threats, especially in the political, economic, scientific and technological fields.The trade war the United States launched against China more than one year ago has dealt a blow to the global economy. Similarly, the US has taken many unilateral actions detrimental to the international community, among which its withdrawal from the United Nations Human Rights Council in June 2018 has undermined the cause of human rights.Given that world peace, development and human rights depend on the constructive participation and contribution of all countries, it is all the more important that all the countries engage in international governance based on the existing rules.In the 70 years since the founding of New China, especially during the 40 years of reform and opening-up, Beijing has vigorously protected and promoted human rights within the country. It has been actively participating in UN human rights affairs, too, on the basis of equality and mutual respect, extensively carrying out international exchanges and cooperation, and actively offering Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to address the problems facing international human rights governance.As the world's largest developing country, a founding member of the UN and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has been elected many a time as a member of the UN Human Rights Council. It was elected to the council for the fourth time on Oct 28, 2016, with as many as 180 votes. This reflects the recognition China has received from other countries for its work to develop human rights around the world and the expectations the international community has of its role in developing global human rights governance.On March 11, 2018, the first session of the 13th National People's Congress, China's top legislature, approved an amendment to the country's Constitution and added "promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind" to the preamble of the Constitution.This is a development on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by China in the 1950s. As such, it has become China's constitutional principle and goal to build a community with a shared future for mankind.China's proposal has evoked positive response from the UN. In recent years, the UN Security Council and other international committees have adopted resolutions emphasizing the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. At its 37th session on March 23, 2018, the UN Human Rights Council for the first time included into its resolution China's proposal to build a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind.Economic development is the key to solving almost all the global, regional and national problems. Through active exploration, and reform and opening-up, China has blazed a development path that suits its national conditions, which has helped it to solve Chinese people's food and clothing problems, and embark on the path to building a well-off society and achieving greater prosperity.Even on the international level, China has closely integrated development with human rights, promoting development and human rights through cooperation, so as to help build a community with a shared future for mankind. China has worked with other countries to push the UN to adopt the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and advocated that the agenda be implemented through North-South and South-South cooperation.At the G20 Summit in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, in September 2016, China pushed for the formulation of a collective action plan to implement the 2030 Agenda.In a letter on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on Dec 10, 2018, President Xi Jinping emphasized that the Chinese people are willing to work with all the people of the world by adhering to such common values as peace, development, justice, democracy and liberty, maintaining human dignity and rights, promoting fairer, reasonable and inclusive global human rights governance, and building a community with a shared future for mankind to build a brighter future for the world.The author is executive director of the human rights research center, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

                Iran rules out talks with US as tensions rise
            </a>
            <p>
                Supreme leader digs in after Teheran blamed for attacks on Saudi oil facilitiesTEHERAN - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei announced on Tuesday that "there will be no talks with the United States at any level", as tensions mount between the two countries after Washington blamed Teheran for attacks on Saudi oil installations, which Iran has denied.Iranian state TV quoted Khamenei as saying this is the position of the entire leadership of the country and that "all officials in the Islamic Republic unanimously believe" this.Khamenei said the US wants to prove its "maximum pressure policy" against Iran is successful."In return, we have to prove that the policy is not worth a penny for the Iranian nation," Khamenei said. "That's why all Iranian officials, from the president and the foreign minister to all others have announced that we do not negotiate (with the US) either bilaterally or multilaterally."There had been reports about a possible meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, during the upcoming United Nations General Assembly this month in New York.But tensions roiling the Persian Gulf have escalated following a weekend attack on major oil sites in Saudi Arabia that the US alleged Iran was responsible for - a charge Iran has denied.The attack on Saudi Arabia, which set ablaze a crucial Saudi oil processing plant and a key oilfield, was claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebels, who are at war with a Saudi-led coalition that is trying to restore Yemen's internationally recognized government to power.Around 3 million barrels per day of Saudi oil will remain offline for a month, about half the production halted by the devastating attacks, S&P Platts said on Tuesday.Trump said on Monday it looked like Iran was behind the attacks on the oil plants but stressed he did not want to go to war, as the strikes sent oil prices soaring and raised fears of a new Middle East conflict.The strikes damaged the world's biggest crude-processing plant and triggered the largest jump in crude prices in decades.Rouhani said the drone attacks were a "legitimate defense and counterattack" against the Saudi-led war in Yemen."Regarding the drones' attack, this problem has its root in invading Yemen. They (the Saudi-led coalition) are bombing Yemen on a daily basis," he said during a summit in Turkey to discuss Syrian crisis with the Russian and Turkish leaders.Raising concernsIn Riyadh, officials said on Monday initial investigations indicate that Iranian weapons were used in the attacks and it "will invite UN and international experts to view the situation on the ground and to participate in the investigations".A statement from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: "The kingdom will take the appropriate measures based on the results of the investigation, to ensure its security and stability."It called Saturday's attack that resulted in the suspension of approximately 50 percent of Saudi Aramco's production "an unprecedented act of aggression and sabotage" and an "egregious crime which threatens international peace and security".Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, who currently chairs the UN Security Council, said the attacks on the Saudi oil installations were "unanimously and unequivocally condemned" by all 15 council members.As for Trump's statement that the US is "locked and loaded" to respond if necessary, Nebenzia said: "We are very concerned that incidents similar to this may provoke larger conflicts in the Gulf."Agencies

                74th session of UN General Assembly opens
            </a>
            <p>
                UNITED NATIONS - The 74th session of the UN General Assembly opened at UN Headquarters in New York on Tuesday.Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, president of the 74th session of the General Assembly, declared the opening of the 2019-2020 session of the most representative body of the United Nations.In his remarks to the opening plenary meeting, Muhammad-Bande asked for action in line with the theme of this year's General Debate: "Galvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion.""Our vision statement focused on the implementation of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), particularly poverty eradication, zero hunger, quality education, climate action and inclusion," he said."Accordingly, I will ... pay close attention to the effective implementation of inherited mandates and the following priorities, which I initiated in my vision statement and at the dialogue with member states prior to my election: promotion of peace and security, particularly prevention, and collaborate and coordinate with the Security Council, the (UN) Secretariat to ensure that greater attention is paid to prevention rather than reaction to full-blown conflict."I will also advocate for effective early detection and warning systems as well as mediation, negotiation, and peaceful settlement of ongoing conflicts. I will work to engender cooperation that addresses drivers of conflict, such as poverty, exclusion and illiteracy, increase partnership for the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals, particularly poverty eradication, zero hunger and quality education."In his remarks, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed the need to convince people that the United Nations is relevant to all and that multilateralism offers real solutions to global challenges."The General Assembly is a unique and indispensable forum where the world can come together to advance on sensitive and important issues," he said. "It is vital that the world has strong and effective multilateral institutions and architecture, and that international relations are based on international law."The General Assembly is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations, and the only one in which all member states have equal representation.The General Debate at the beginning of each session is considered the largest gathering of world leaders. This year, 143 heads of state and government are believed to have registered to speak at the high-level week.The 74th session of the General Assembly will also feature other high-profile events, including a Climate Action Summit and a high-level meeting on universal health coverage.

                UN’s Afghanistan mandate extended by Security Council
            </a>
            <p>
                The UN Security Council on Tuesday unanimously adopted a resolution extending the UN political mission in Afghanistan.The technical resolution renews the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) for one year.It asks the UNAMA to provide assistance to Afghanistan with elections, connectivity, regional cooperation, security, anti-narcotics and reconstruction, promote partnership on connectivity, and welcome joint efforts to enhance dialogue and collaboration and to advance shared goals of economic development across the region.The resolution also stresses the importance of supporting capacity building by the Afghan government on security to maintain stability and combat terrorism.Zhang Jun, permanent representative of China to the UN, said in an explanatory statement:"China is glad to see the unanimous adoption by the Council of the resolution on a technical renewal of the mandate of UNAMA. The result meets the expectation of the Afghan people and enables UNAMA to continue doing its job. It has also accommodated the concerns of all parties.""As a direct neighbor, China most wants to see peace, stability, development and prosperity in Afghanistan. China cares most about the interests and well-being of the Afghan people," the ambassador said.Thinking of Afghanistan's position, Zhang emphasized "China believes that to achieve lasting peace, economic development must be boosted; to achieve security and stability, the country's security concerns must be addressed; to maintain unity of the Security Council, existing consensus must be respected."Zhang said that China has been emphasizing that it is not a good time to adopt a comprehensive resolution; technical renewal is the way.China took part in the consultations on extending the mandate of UNAMA and proposed revisions."To China's regret, a few countries refused to keep the text of consensus previously agreed and refused to accommodate the core concerns of the parties. The draft also failed to address possible security vacuum in Afghanistan. All this led to serious division among the parties," Zhang told the council."The argument that supporting Afghanistan in taking part in regional cooperation and promoting connectivity is unrelated to the mandate of UNAMA is a complete misunderstanding of UNAMA's mission," he said."China welcomes the fact that the relevant parties have then come back to the track of consultation in seeking a solution and reached consensus on a technical renewal of the mandate," he added.Zhang said that it must be pointed out that helping the Afghan economy is vital to achieving lasting peace and stability in the country. "That is what the Afghan people want, and no country has the right to deny them a better life," he said.He said that China supports Afghanistan in holding a general election, advancing peace and the reconciliation process and strengthening capacity-building of the Afghan security forces.
