                Costs, ticket demand climb as Japan Olympics countdown hits 365 days
            </a>
            <p>
                TOKYO - The countdown for the Tokyo Olympics has hit 365 days.To mark the year-to-go mark, the gold, silver and bronze Olympic medals are to be unveiled Wednesday as part of daylong ceremonies around the Japanese capital.Tokyo's 1964 Olympics showcased bullet trains, futuristic designs and a new expressway, underlining Japan's recovery following World War II. Those games were the first seen worldwide by early satellites, sending the Olympics into a new era.Japan's capital has less to prove this time when the games open on July 24, 2020. Many of the venues are completed, Tokyo has abundant infrastructure and Japan is a byword for know-how.There are, however, other matters: Expected high temperatures (though this summer has been wet and mild), costs, traffic and subway congestion, earthquake preparedness and ticket scarcity. Ticket demand by Japan residents alone is reported to be at least 10 times the supply. Abroad, prices are sure to soar on secondary ticket markets.Organizers have shattered records for local sponsorship revenue, which has passed $3 billion-about three times more than any previous Olympics. The main driver has been Japan's giant advertising and marketing company Dentsu Inc, the exclusive marketing agency for Tokyo."The fact that the talk is so much about not being able to get tickets," Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said a few days ago, "is a symbol, a representation of the enthusiasm and expectations that a lot of people have toward the games".Tokyo doesn't need the Olympics to build infrastructure. It has some of the world's best. Pressed to justify spending billions on the games, Koike described the Olympics and Paralympics as an "accelerator" to get more things done, even if evidence overwhelmingly shows that working on Olympic deadlines drives up costs.Sports economist Robert Baade, who teaches at Lake Forest College outside Chicago and has researched the Olympics, says the games are "about marketing and branding. The most important part from a commercial standpoint is the opening and closing ceremony. Sport is the subtext".Tokyo is building eight venues. The other 35 are defined as "temporary" or older buildings being reused, which organizers say has saved billions. But even existing venues need renovation. The centerpiece is the $1.25 billion National Stadium, which will open at the end of the year, and the Olympic Village for more than 10,000 athletes on the edge of Tokyo Bay.Tokyo will showcase four new sports-karate, skateboarding, surfing and sports climbing. A fifth-baseball and softball-is returning after being dropped following the 2008 Olympics.Exact costs-what are and are not Olympic expenses-are difficult to sort out. But Tokyo is spending about $20 billion to get ready, 70 percent of which is taxpayer money.IOC President Thomas Bach has repeatedly called Tokyo's preparations "the best" in history. But there have been glitches and links to corruption.A group of anti-Olympic activists, many from outside Japan, has held small protests and other events in the last few days under the Japanese title "Hangorin no Kai", which translates roughly as "No Olympics". They question Olympic spending and have raised local housing and environmental issues.Tsunekazu Takeda, the head of the Japanese Olympic Committee, was forced to resign this year when he was implicated in a votebuying scheme to land the games. He has denied wrongdoing, but acknowledged he signed off on about $2 million that French investigators allege went to buy votes of some IOC members.Associated Press

                What's hampering Shenzhen growth?
            </a>
            <p>
                Like influential bay areas elsewhere, it could do with a high-quality education cluster A well-developed higher education system is indispensable for the sustainable development of a city. In just four decades, Shenzhen has leaped from being a remote border town of Guangdong and Hong Kong to a modern megacity with unprecedented speed. On Aug 18, 2019, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued an Opinion on Supporting Shenzhen's Pioneering Demonstration Zone of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics. It has not only positioned Shenzhen as the leader of development in the Greater Bay Area of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao. It has also granted Shenzhen the great responsibility of constructing a pioneering zone with Chinese characteristics and growing into a global benchmark city with competitiveness, innovation and outstanding influence. However, the "short board" that constrains Shenzhen's growth, the "bottleneck" of its urban sustainable development, are its education and healthcare systems. In particular, the state of higher education resources in Shenzhen does not match its status and comprehensive strength in the country. As a result, Shenzhen is seeing an awkward coexistence of "innovation and entrepreneurship highland" and "education lowland". To this end, Shenzhen urgently needs to develop a high-level higher education system that matches the pioneering position the central government has endowed it with. An innovative global city must not only have high-quality economic output, but also have high-quality talent cultivation. After all, the three most influential bay areas in the world - the New York Bay Area, the San Francisco Bay Area and the Tokyo Bay Area - are all places where world-famous universities gather. First, the Tokyo Bay Area. With one-third of Japan's population, this area has 263 higher education institutions and more than 1.27 million registered university students (2013). Top universities such as University of Tokyo, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Waseda University, Keio University and Hitotsubashi University are all in the bay area. Concentration of both industrial districts and higher education institutes is the secret behind sustainable development of the Tokyo Bay Area. Next, the San Francisco Bay Area in the United States. Though, with a population of only 7.7 million, nine of the top 100 universities in the world, such as Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley, San Francisco, Santa Cruz and Davis exist here. A cluster of world-class universities, too, have come up around the bay area: California Institute of Technology, University of Southern California, University of California at Los Angeles, University of California, Santa Barbara, University of California, Irvine, University of California, San Diego, University of California, Riverside, etc. Then, the New York Bay Area. With a population of 20 million, represented by New York City, Newark and New Jersey, it has formed the world's top Ivy League Schools cluster, both centering in New York and exerting strong radiation and influence on nearby places. For example, Columbia University, Cornell University, New York University, etc, are in New York State, and Princeton University, Yale University, Harvard University, and MIT are around New York. Five out of eight US Ivy League Schools are in the New York Bay Area. In comparison, Shenzhen, a new city positioned to be the benchmark for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, is the only first-tier city without any of the local 985 and 211 universities. None of the 42"Double First-Class" universities ("Double First-Class" is a national program for China's higher education excellency) selected by China's Ministry of Education are in Shenzhen. Shenzhen's shortage of higher education resources stands out, even when compared to second-tier cities. Of course, a well-developed higher education system in a city or a region requires long-term investment. As people often say: "It takes 10 years to grow trees, but 100 to cultivate talents." Building high-quality higher education in one area is not something that can be completed overnight. The world over, a city's sustainable development and outstanding innovation capabilities hinge on first-class universities and institutes. A world-class university, whether providing general education as British Newman, specialized education as German Humboldt, or social service education of US Wisconsin, is the most important place to discover and produce knowledge. At present, though a city of innovation, let's face it. Shenzhen lacks sufficient higher education resources. And these cannot be enhanced by "attracting investment" in short order, as it did to develop other industries. The improvement of higher education and research capacity is a long-term process, therefore Shenzhen must attach importance to the introduction of international and domestic famous universities and research institutions, while creating a friendly environment for their long-term development. Also, as a pioneering city of socialism with Chinese characteristics, to upgrade its higher education rapidly, Shenzhen should take advantage of the policy innovation to attract and adopt global advanced strategies, and foster increment on the basis of the current high-quality higher education resources. First of all, China's domestic "Double First-Class" universities are greatly interested in establishing campuses in Shenzhen, for the purpose of observing emerging technologies and industrial innovation. Second, the incremental advantage of developing higher education in Shenzhen is very obvious. As a city of innovation, the two main subjects of higher education, teachers and students, come from and go into the cities' development, moving like running water to constantly inject energy into the city's higher education improvement. It will help make up the shortfall of research capacity in Shenzhen in a shorter period of time. Third, the construction of high-quality higher education in Shenzhen should help attract global resources looking for a base. Based on the wave of the "Fourth Industrial Revolution", Shenzhen can build its constructions using emerging technologies, focusing on the construction of "new liberal arts", "new engineering" and "new medical science". Finally, the development of high-quality higher education in Shenzhen should deal with several relationships: first, the relationship between the Shenzhen Demonstration Zone and the development concepts of the mainland universities; second, the balance between the development of science and engineering and the humanities; and third, the relationship between incremental development and stock optimization of education resources. That is to say, Shenzhen should balance the talents from "siphon effect" and from original campus, to seek a win-win situation between increments and stocks.

                Tokyo targets youth at 'Urban Festival'
            </a>
            <p>
                The International Olympic Committee (IOC) hopes that Tokyo 2020's "Urban Festival", which will offer fans the chance to try out Olympic sports, will help the governing body remain relevant and increase long-term youth engagement with the Games.In July, Games organizers announced plans to develop a Waterfront City in Tokyo Bay, involving demonstration events and fan participation in sports, as well as concerts and other performances during next year's showpiece.The plans, which mirror a similar idea tested at last year's Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, are part of the IOC's wider aim of increasing its appeal to younger sports fans.
