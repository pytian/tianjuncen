                Remarks by HE Ambassador Liu Xiaoming at the Showcase Event for the Documentary China's Greatest Treasures
            </p>
            <p>
                Remarks by HE Ambassador Liu Xiaoming at the Showcase Event for the Documentary China's Greatest Treasures: A Shining New Era for China's Greatest TreasuresChinese Embassy, Sept 18, 2019Ms Victoria MacCallum，Mr Li Xiangdong,Mr Jim Egan,Ms Charlotte Jones,Mr Stephen Perry,Ladies and Gentlemen,Good evening! Welcome to the Chinese Embassy!It is a real delight to have you with us at the showcase event for the documentary China's Greatest Treasures. Let me begin by offering my warmest congratulations to the production teams from both China and the UK on your successful cooperation!This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. It is also the 65th anniversary of China-UK diplomatic relationship at the chargé d'affaires level.In this special year, it is both significant and relevant that the media communities of our two countries join hands to produce the documentary that will be shown tonight.This documentary features historic artifacts from China. They have traveled through history to tell the audience about where China has come from and where it is going. They will help foster a deeper understanding of China and appreciation of the Chinese culture.I believe this documentary has three-fold significance.First, it introduces the Chinese culture.China has a history of more than 5,000 years, which has given birth to a civilisation that is both profound and fascinating. In this documentary, every artifact is a crystallisation of beauty. They are steeped in history, imbued with the essence of culture and representative of the spirit of their times.By opening a door into the past, these greatest treasures will also open a window on the Chinese culture.Second, this documentary tells stories of the Chinese nation.The history of the Chinese nation is like a book that tells stories of a magnificent scale and profound meaning. The documentary being launched tonight offers a glimpse into the life, joy, sorrow and relentless efforts of the Chinese people through thousands of years. It also demonstrates how the Chinese art excels at being inclusive and drawing on others' successful experience. Viewers could begin to understand why and how the time-honoured history is having a profound impact on today's China and China in the future.Third, this documentary promotes exchanges between civilisations.Exchange and mutual learning between civilizations is a strong driving force behind human progress. It is also the bedrock for the steady and sustained development of China-UK relations.As we celebrate the 65th anniversary of China-UK diplomatic relationship at the chargé d'affaires level, I am delighted that the media professionals of our two countries have come together and produced this documentary. This joint production promotes exchange and mutual learning, and deepens cooperation between our cultural and creative industries. It is a fruit of China-UK cultural and people-to-people exchanges. It strengthens our belief that mutual learning is the right way forward, while "clash of civilisations" leads nowhere.I want to quote President Xi Jinping. He said, "The aspiration for all that is beautiful is a common pursuit of humanity that nothing can hold back."Both China and the UK are great civilisations with time-honoured history and profound culture. This documentary shows that the people of our two countries have the shared yearning for beauty, similar need for mutual understanding, and common pursuit of exchanges and mutual learning.Let's draw strength from our profound cultures and work hand in hand. I am sure we will produce more excellent works like China's Greatest Treasures, and make greater contribution to enhancing cultural cooperation and people-to-people exchanges between our two countries and building a closer bond between our two peoples.In conclusion, I wish China's Greatest Treasures great success. And I wish everyone a pleasant evening!Thank you!

                PRC's anniversary celebrated in UK
            </a>
            <p>
                China's top envoy to the United Kingdom has called for mutual respect, open cooperation, mutual learning and shouldering of responsibilities between both countries for the well-being of mankind. Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador to the UK, made the remarks at a reception in central London on Monday to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The reception is among China's prime UK public diplomacy events this year, which saw dignitaries, key implementers, and movers and shakers of the burgeoning China-UK relationship at the landmark Guildhall. Stressing that the Chinese people have created an economic miracle through hard work, the ambassador reflected on China's tremendous achievements over the past seven decades. Ninety-eight percent of Fortune 500 companies have investments in China while 129 Chinese companies have made it to the 2019 Fortune 500 list, marking the biggest country group for the first time, bringing in participants such as Sherard Cowper-Coles, the chair-elect of China-Britain Business Council, which reaffirms that Sino-UK trade ties are on the right track. "It (China-UK) is an indispensable economic relationship, indispensable for the UK because of our need to engage with an economy of the size and sophistication of China's, indispensable for China because China's best friend in the West is the United Kingdom," said Cowper-Coles, who emphasized that huge synergy lies in the Sino-UK partnership on the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative. "China has the political will and the economic will, Britain sometimes has the expertise... (they) can form win-win partnerships that are of mutual benefit," he said. Ambassador Liu said China has gone through reforms and opening-up and changed from a secluded, backward and impoverished nation to a strong nation of prosperity and strength. China's GDP increased by more than 450 times, from $30 billion in the early years of New China, to more than $13.6 trillion last year. China is not only the world's second largest economy, but also the largest industrial country, the largest trader of goods, the biggest holder of foreign exchange reserves and the top producer of more than 200 products. That is part of what Stephen Perry, chairman of the 48 Group Club, described as "incredible testimony "to the ability of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people to realize these goals, to realize the transformation of China "from one of the most backward countries to one of the most advanced countries in the world in just 70 years". The 48 Group Club is a British business association that started the UK's trade links with China, and is committed to promoting China-UK trade. "There is a lot to be done," said Perry, while urging China and the UK to address some of the world's most pressing problems, such as "the excess debt in the world, the problems with climate control, populism and nationalism. "It will take a lot of clever and effective work by the major nations to keep the world together and to keep it focused," he said. China has lifted more than 700 million people out of poverty since the start of reforms and opening-up 40 years ago and it has built the world's largest network, with a basic pension insurance system covering more than 900 million people and a basic health insurance system covering 1.3 billion people, said the ambassador. Most importantly, the average life expectancy in China has more than doubled from 35 to 77. "The Chinese nation has been unwavering in its original aspirations, namely the pursuit of happiness for the people and rejuvenation of the nation. This is the force that has been driving generations of Chinese forward in defiance of all hardships," Liu said. "No matter how strong China is, it will be committed to self-improvement but will not bully, firm in safeguarding its interests, but will never seek hegemony, and it will continue advocating exchanges, mutual learning between different civilizations, pursue peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and act in accordance with international law." On behalf of the UK government, Richard Moore, director general for political affairs of UK Foreign Office, delivered British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's message of congratulations, in which the new leader said the Sino-UK relationship is "broad and deep, and this relationship will continue to be important as the UK prepares to leave the European Union. I want to be ambitious with greater trade and investment between our countries". A photography exhibition titled Beautiful China: Man, Nature and Harmony, showcasing China's nationwide picturesque landscape, and The Development of Chinese Enterprises in the UK, a photo gallery on China's decades-long deepening business relationship with the UK, were also held on the occasion.

                Cinematic landscape
            </a>
            <p>
                A retrospective look at the film industry shows its changing fortunes over the past seven decades of New China, Xu Fan reports.In the early spring of 1949, Northeast Film Studio-the first movie production company established by the Communist Party of China-wrapped up the shooting of Bridge in Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang province.Widely regarded as the first feature-length movie produced in the year of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the black-and-white movie opened a new chapter in Chinese cinema.With painstaking effort from several generations of domestic filmmakers, China has produced more than 12,000 movies over seven decades, according to China Film News, an industry newspaper sponsored by the China Film Administration, the country's top movie regulator.When the movie Bridge was shot, most of the cast and crew members were novices. But later, many involved in the production went on to become pioneers that shaped New China's cinematic landscape.Among them were journalist-turned-scriptwriter Yu Min, who co-founded the Golden Rooster Awards-the mainland's top movie honor-in the early 1980s, and Chen Qiang, a veteran actor best known for playing villainous roles and as the father of household-name comedian Chen Peisi. Chen Qiang died at the age of 94 in a Beijing hospital in 2012, while Yu passed away at the age of 100 in 2014.

                China's southernmost province will continue focusing on ecological development as it establishes a national ecological civilization demonstration zone and builds up a world-class pilot free trade zone, a top official from the province said on Monday.Liu Cigui, Party secretary of Hainan province, said the province will continue carrying out the most stringent environmental regulations to protect its natural resources, such as tropical forests that cover one-seventh of the island. The province also plans to soon set up a national rainforest park."It's important to integrate the crackdown on illegal construction on the island and speed up efforts to improve the natural environment of coastlines," Liu said at a news conference held by the State Council Information Office in Beijing.The only tropical island province in China, Hainan has 1,944 kilometers of coastline, 68 natural bays and more than 600 islands. In the capital Haikou, a wetland area of 29,093 hectares is home to 514 wetland animal species and 439 plant species.The province also boasts rare rainforest resources, ecosystems and biodiversity. It has more than 4,000 vascular plants, more than 2,500 kinds of medicinal plants and over 20 species of rare plants protected at the national level.Since May 2018, the province has taken the lead in implementing the use of new-energy vehicles, planning to replace gasoline-powered cars by 2020 and provide a green lifestyle for the public, said Shen Xiaoming, governor of Hainan."It also plays an important role in preserving the nation's largest tropical rainforest area of 4,400 square kilometers," he said, adding that the province will phase out single-use plastic bags by the end of 2020 to ease pollution and protect the environment.Government figures show that the province's annual concentration of PM 2.5-hazardous fine particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 microns-was below 17 micrograms per cubic meter last year, and forest coverage has stabilized at more than 62.1 percent.Established in 1988, Hainan was built up as the country's largest special economic zone, and the central government declared the island a pilot free trade zone in April last year.With the historical change of the island from an isolated land to a tourist paradise, the development of Hainan province has long been at the forefront of China's reform and opening-up, according to Shen."The future development of the island can't ignore the preservation of the ecological environment as it plans to establish a year-round garden to attract visitors from home and abroad," he said.

            </a>
            <p>
                China's musical heritage was celebrated at a spectacular concert at the Barbican Centre in London on Monday evening in a collaboration involving the United Kingdom's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the China Philharmonic Orchestra.The China Night concert was part of a global series that is highlighting China's rich cultural heritage and the strong artistic connections and collaborations between the East and West.The audience was treated to some of the sounds of China's most famous composers, including Xian Xinghai's Yellow River Concerto, which was performed by Chinese piano virtuoso Wan Jieni.The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, joined by members of the China Philharmonic Orchestra, was conducted by Xu Zhong, general director of the Shanghai Opera.The evening also featured music from Zhu Jianer's Symphonic Suite: Sketches in the Mountains of Guizhou, Chen Qigang's Wu Xing (The Five Elements) and China Overture, which was written by Ye Guohui and that was inspired by the Chinese national anthem, March of the Volunteers.The classical music event was also part of celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and marks the 65th anniversary of the China-UK diplomatic relationship at the level of charge d'affaires.Speaking at a reception before the start of the concert, Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador to the UK, described the concert as "the fruition of the cooperation between top Chinese and British orchestras, and a vivid example of the mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the UK"."I am confident that, with the joint efforts of the cultural and art communities of our two countries, China-UK cultural and people-to-people exchanges and cooperation will produce more fruits and deliver more benefits to the peoples of our two countries," the ambassador said.James Williams, managing director of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, said the ensemble has been touring China regularly for more than 25 years and has forged strong partnerships in China with promoters, orchestras, artists, audiences, and educational institutes."It has been equally wonderful to welcome Chinese orchestras here to the UK to perform in our most prestigious concert halls," Williams noted.Yu Peng, a minister counselor at China's embassy in the UK, added: "The 70 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China is a history of constant learning to benefit the public. The focus has mainly been on tackling the relationship between our own culture and other cultures, between tradition and modernity."
