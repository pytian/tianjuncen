                One dead, five hurt in Washington, DC shooting - police
            </p>
            <p>
                 WASHINGTON - One person was killed and five others injured in a shooting Thursday night in northern Washington D.C., police said.A police commander told reporters on the scene that there is one female victim and five male ones.One man has died, and the other victims suffering from non-critical to critical injuries are being treated at area hospitals, according to the commander.Police responded to several reports of gunshots at around 10 pm (0200 GMT Friday) in the Columbia Heights neighborhood about 3 km from the White House.Police issued an alert on Twitter, urging a lookout for "a light colored Nissan sedan" occupied by two males "armed with AK style rifle."The shooting occurs as US politicians are negotiating possible gun reform legislations following several mass shootings this year, in which dozens of people were killed.

                The paradox of prosperity
            </a>
            <p>
                An economist looks at how improved material wealth coincides with rising inequality and gives special attention to China's role in the global economy, Andrew Moody reports in London.Douglas McWilliams believes China is a classic case of the paradox at the heart of the global economy.Although it has delivered 800 million out of poverty in the past 40 years, the gap between rich and poor has also grown, something the Chinese government is very determined to address.This, though, is a global phenomenon and one that the well-known British economist addresses in his new book, The Inequality Paradox: How Capitalism Can Work for Everyone, which was officially launched earlier this month."China has made the biggest single contribution to the fall in global poverty in human history and progress is still being made," the 67-year-old says.China aims to entirely eliminate extreme poverty by the end of next year."But within China, as with other countries, inequality has increased as poverty has decreased. This is the paradox."Inequality is now a central issue of economic debate. It is a particular problem in the West, where many feel left behind since the global financial crisis of 2008. And this has given rise to increasing disaffection and rising populism.It was also addressed by the French economist Thomas Piketty in his seminal 2013 book, Capital in the Twenty-first Century. He blamed the problem on the rich seeing a greater rise in the value of their assets than the increase in wages of those who have to work for a living.McWilliams, who was speaking at the central London office of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, the economics consultancy he founded more than 25 years ago and of which he is executive deputy chairman, thinks Piketty is only partly right."What he argues is about 20 percent true. IMF studies that have looked at this carefully do point to people with assets exploiting others being part of the story. I think, though, Piketty's explanation misses the real driving point," he says.McWilliams believes what has driven inequality is globalization-which China has largely benefitted from-and technology with the Fourth Industrial Revolution threatening to destroy jobs in the developing as well as the developed world."With globalization, you have had nearly three-quarters of the world's population suddenly becoming economically active in just a few decades. This is bound to be disruptive. It has created increased inequality in the West, but it has also been associated with a significant reduction of poverty in the East," he says.McWilliams insists Donald Trump-style protectionism is no answer to globalization."King Canute (the 11th-century English Viking king, who tried to hold back the tide) had similar ideas. But it didn't work, did it? China, in fact, is one of the best examples of isolationism not working. It looked in on itself after the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) voyages of Zheng He and hardly developed for several centuries afterwards."McWilliams believes such technologies as artificial intelligence and robotics, which will destroy vast swaths of jobs, pose huge challenges to policymakers if societies don't become more equal."It is no longer just about machines replacing people but machines making the machines that replace people," he says."People will just have to find new things to do. In the UK, we have actually had the growth of the lifestyle economy with the number of people claiming to be musicians going up nearly five times and, similarly, writers three times."He believes the only solution may be that everyone becomes entitled to a universal basic income and that this might be more imminent than many currently think."In some of the oil states in the Middle East, there is already an effective basic income. My maths says the economics in the US start to add up in about 10 years' time, and in Europe and China is about 20 to 25 years' time."McWilliams was partly brought up in Asia. His father was a civil engineer in Malaysia before McWilliams returned to the UK to attend the Roman Catholic independent school Stonyhurst College in Lancashire before studying economics at Oxford.He has held a number of prominent jobs, including stints as chief economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry, the leading US-business organization, and an economic adviser to former UK chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne.His latest book comes just three years after the success of his first, The Flat White Economy, which looked at how the growth of media, internet and creative businesses was transforming economies.McWilliams says the issue of inequality is not so important to people when they are being delivered from poverty. It's only later when people become concerned about disparities in their material wealth."When you are starving, you just want food. When you are well off, you start to demand luxury goods. In China, you cannot ignore the fact that life expectancy has gone up as well as nutritional standards, and health has massively improved," he says.McWilliams says globalization and technology can have an exponential effect on disparity. In the book, he cities the fact that England soccer player Wayne Rooney earned 53 times more than the legendary Bobby Charlton of an earlier era."This was because Rooney played on the global stage, whereas when Bobby Charlton played, even people in the UK couldn't watch him on the TV since only a very few matches were broadcast live," he says.McWilliams believes that one of the ways to reduce inequality is through education, and that is why countries like China are right to place emphasis on this."There is no greater determinant of how much people will earn in their lives than their level of education. I was brought up in Asia, and my mother ran a kindergarten. The thing that humbled me is that poor people would pay half their salaries to educate their children. I think we have slightly lost that in the West."Unlike Piketty, McWilliams does not believe that taxing the rich is a solution to reducing inequality."Piketty argues that if you shoot the rich the problem goes away. I don't believe that."McWilliams' consultancy earlier this year produced a report on how the Belt and Road Initiative would boost global GDP by 4.2 percent in 2040. It has also produced several other reports on China's economy."I am confident about the China economy because the government has done all that it needs to do to get to the next level, and, therefore, it is unlikely to get stuck in the middle-income trap."On the UK, he supported Brexit in the referendum but insists he is not a "head-banger" on the subject and is increasingly frustrated by the uncertainty it is creating."My guess now is that whatever happens it is going to be hugely disruptive, and the pain will have been prolonged by the fact the country has taken so long to make up its mind."As for inequality across the world, McWilliams says that after writing the book, which is persuasive and, arguably, easily one of the best on the subject so far, he is pessimistic."I think we are going to have to fight, and fight very hard, to prevent the gaps in society from widening," he says.

                Two killed, seven wounded in DC shootings
            </a>
            <p>
                Authorities on Friday hunted for a pair of suspects involved in two shootings in Washington, DC, that left two people dead and seven wounded late on Thursday.In the first attack, one man was killed and five people wounded, two of them critically, in a drive-by shooting. The victims had been standing in an apartment building courtyard when they were shot, Metropolitan Police commander Stuart Emerman said.Two suspects were seen in a Nissan sedan and used an "AK style rifle,"About half an hour after the first incident, three people were shot in the northeastern part of the city, leaving one dead, according to NBC's Washington affiliate. There was no initial indication the two shootings were linked, NBC reported, citing police.Gun violence has been a regular feature of American life, but a spate of recent mass shootings in Texas, Ohio and other states have renewed debate over the nation's gun laws and spurred calls for action.Many Republicans and the powerful gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, oppose further restrictions on gun ownership. Republican Vice-President Mike Pence has decried the gun-control stance and accused the Democrats as having a "radical agenda."Republican President Donald Trump, in an interview with Fox News that aired on Thursday, said he was looking for compromise steps that both Democrats and Republicans could support on gun control, but has given no details on what action he may push.House Democrats have passed several gun initiatives, including expanded background checks, but the Republican-led Senate has not taken up the legislation.The controversy over the use of assault rifles has entered the 2020 presidential race, with candidate and former US Representative Beto O'Rourke declaring at a Democratic debate that he would confiscate such rifles.O'Rourke has made gun safety the centerpiece of his campaign since late August, when his hometown of El Paso, Texas, was the site of a racially motivated mass shooting that killed 22 people inside a Walmart store.On Thursday, gunmaker Colt said it was suspending its productions of the AR15 and other rifles for the civilian market, The Associated Press reported.REUTERS

                Chinese photographer on shortlist at London nature awards
            </a>
            <p>
                Insect image highly praised by competition judgesA sleeping seal, a zombie beetle and a tragic turtle are just some of the striking images competing inthe 2019 Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition at London's world-renowned Natural History Museum.Now in its 55th year, the competition showcases the best nature photography and photo journalism. Among the Highly Commended images is a photograph of a cocoon of a cynamoth pupa by Chinese photographer Yuan Minghui.Yuan came across the cage-like cocoon on the outside wall of a toilet at the Xishuangbanna tropical botanical garden in Southwest China. A more typical location for such a cocoon would be a tree trunk or rock."It was still rainy season so the sun was covered by the dark clouds most of the time," he said. "I looked for a proper shooting angle and waited for an hour and a half before shooting when the sun was bright. I chose a small aperture to show the lines of this cage-like cocoon. This is not only the art of life, but also the refinement and interest of life."In the image, entitled The hair-net cocoon, the caterpillar had used its long, hair-like features known as setae to weave a delicate cage, just 4 centimeters long, inside which it would pupate.Yuan, who has won numerous international awards in photography, said it is his "mission to show the beauty of China's wildlife and the achievements of environmental protection to the world"."The more important thing is to attract Chinese attention to the beauty of nature around us through beautiful award-winning works. I hope this can finally benefit the wildlife in China," he added.Yuan specializes in natural landscapes, plants and insects, as he would like to show "the beauty and dignity of ordinary life, as well as ourselves"."The fragility of wildlife is closely linked to human destruction of the environment. To protect the environment and care for life is to love ourselves. As my opinion, it is a kind of return to humanity," he said.Roz Kidman Cox, chair of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year jury, described Yuan's photo as "an exquisite creation" that reveals "both the simple yet complex beauty of nature and vision of the photographer, who has presented his discovery as a work of art".The overall winners will be announced on Oct 15 at an awards ceremony in the museum's iconic Hintze Hall. Winning images are selected for their creativity, originality and technical excellence. This year's competition attracted almost 50,000 entries from professionals and amateurs across 100 countries.
