                Artists call for structured African contemporary art market
            </p>
            <p>
                One day in 2008, Sisqo Ndombe, a Congolese artist and graduate of the Kinshasa Academy of Fine Arts, took to the streets of the Democratic Republic (DR) of Congo's capital, Kinshasa. His artwork in his hands, he braved the scorching sun as he looked for customers, eager for his first sale.Unfortunately, after walking several kilometers and trying to persuade people to buy his work, nobody expressed interest and he returned home a frustrated man."That is the day I realized that there is a big challenge in the artistic sector. I also discovered that many talented African artists who I knew were facing a similar frustration. They could not sell their artwork or even be recognized, because of the lack of diffusion spaces, professional galleries, and customers," Ndombe said.This didn't dampen his enthusiasm, but instead inspired his entrepreneurialism. On June 2018, Ndombe launched Bandombe Gallery, an online marketplace selling contemporary African artwork.The platform has registered over 400 artists from across Africa, of whom about 300 have displayed over 800 artworks at the gallery. The artworks cost $150-$20,000 and so far, 37 artworks have been sold through the platform."The advantage of the arts community is that you are judged on your talent and skills, not on your academic qualifications or experiences. Studying the works of great masters remains the best training," he said.Ndombe was among the African artists and experts who had gathered at a side event during the Makutano Forum in Kinshasa on September 6, 2019 to discuss how the contemporary African art market can position itself and find an audience.The participants agreed that contemporary African art is unable to compete internationally because of the lack of a structured market. They said there is a need to develop a system that will enable the sector to develop and that will also critique artworks.They also emphasized the need for art education to keep pace with market demands and to encourage creativity. They called on African governments to create national galleries where artists can exhibit their artworks.Henri Kalama, professor, painter and general director of the Kinshasa Academy of Fine Arts, spoke of the need for an African market able to compete internationally, which would give African artists inspiration from the works of artists across the globe.Kalama said there should be reinvestment in African culture, to make it more interesting and encourage people interested in supporting the art industry."African governments should create conditions to allow art to develop, like financing them directly or giving advantage to investors in the culture industry. In DR Congo, many people want to venture into art, but are hindered by a lot of taxes and customs," he said.Kalama said South Africa has professional galleries that have not only given artists international exposure but have also made their value known."In DR Congo, an artist will be selling a painting at $1,000 today, and unfortunately, it will be hard to sell the same painting at half the price the next day, because the market is not structured," he said.Kalama said African society should be educated that beyond enjoyment, art can also be a source of income."The future of art is in Africa. That's why the sector players and experts have been holding forums, an indication that people are looking for a solution," he said.Freddy Tsimba, artist-sculptor, said it's unfortunate that African artists' works are popular outside but unknown on the continent."When I heard the price of my artwork during an exhibition in Canada, I shed tears, not because of the amount of money, but because I had to travel outside the country to sell my artwork," he said.Tsimba's thought-provoking sculptures expose the trauma of war, bringing life out of death. He has expressed the tragedies of a woman during the events of conflict and war. He uses objects of war like bullets castings, machetes and discarded metals like spoons and keys.Tsimba said when he was starting off he received lots of criticism from people for taking such a career path, but he chose to follow his passion. Today, he has received numerous awards and distinctions in France and Canada and has participated in over 50 exhibitions in Africa, Europe, Canada and China.

                Violence main cause of humanitarian needs in DRC
            </a>
            <p>
                UNITED NATIONS - Violence continues to be the main cause of humanitarian needs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the UN envoy for the DRC said on Wednesday.Leila Zerrougui, the UN secretary-general's special representative for the DRC, told the Security Council that the level of violence increased in several areas in the eastern part of the country over the course of the past weeks.In this regard, Zerrougui said she is concerned with the current situation in Ituri province, where spoilers are seeking to play on ethnic tensions to instigate inter-community violence.As a result of the increasingly violence, the country is currently facing simultaneous emergency situations, including mass displacement and protection threats, she added.In Ituri, more than 350,000 people are displaced in Djugu, Mahagi and Irumu territories following renewed violence, said Zerrougui, adding that 733,000 people are in need of assistance in Ituri province to date.The deterioration of the security situation is interrupting the return process that had been gradually taking place since 2018, she said.Added to this is the ever-increasing concern of the Ebola epidemic, which has now claimed the lives of more than 1,700 people, Zerrougui warned.On July 17, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Ebola in the DR Congo as a public health emergency of international concern.The problems faced in eradicating this disease are not only epidemiological in nature, they are linked as well to a variety of political and social factors, said Zerrougui, which include the activities of armed groups such as the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and Mai-Mai, along with continuing high levels of community distrust around the response to the epidemic.This confluence of factors has resulted in a deadly environment for the people working to counter Ebola, to the point of being specifically threatened and killed by armed groups, she added.The UN Security Council on June 26 extended the sanctions regime on the DRC until July 1, 2020. The resolutions impose an arms embargo on armed groups in the DRC, a travel ban on individuals and asset freeze on individuals and entities designated by the Sanctions Committee.

                New international funds raise hopes of containing Ebola outbreak in DR Congo
            </a>
            <p>
                International agencies have heeded a World Health Organization emergency call to pledge funds to contain the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo.WHO on July 17 called the outbreak a "public health emergency of international concern", a rare designation only used for the gravest epidemics.The year-old epidemic in eastern DR Congo, the second deadliest on record, has expanded from the largely contained remote areas to urban areas, Agence France-Presse reported. More than 1,700 people have died.The Ebola virus is highly contagious and has an average fatality rate of around 50 percent. It was transmitted to humans from wild animals and spreads among people through close contact with blood, body fluids, secretions or organs of an infected person.Tedrus Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, said: "In the last couple of weeks there is renewed commitment to finance the shortages we were facing. The support has raised hopes that the epidemic could be restrained."Ghebreyesus' comments came after the World Bank announced $300 million financial support raised in a global response to the epidemic. This was the second round after $100 million disbursed by the bank since August 2018.Kristalina Georgieva, the chief executive officer of the World Bank, said the communities and health workers on the front line of the outbreak urgently need more support and resources from the international community to prevent the crisis from worsening.Italy pledged 300,000 euros ($333,600) to support medical treatment, immunization and burials in "sanitized" conditions, carried out by WHO in the North Kivu and Ituri regions of DR Congo.Italy's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation said in a statement that the contribution assured continuity to the response of the country's cooperation service since the Ebola outbreak last year.The United States, through the US Agency for International Development, pledged more than $38 million in additional assistance to help end the outbreak, including $15 million in new funding to WHO.This brought the total USAID funding for the Ebola response to more than $136 million since the beginning of the outbreak in August 2018.The European Union has also contributed 30 million euros in humanitarian funding for the Ebola response. This brought total EU financing toward the epidemic to 47 million euros since 2018.The World Food Programme on Friday announced that it requires $50 million over the next six months to implement its response and preparedness actions in DR Congo and neighboring countries: Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan.The agency plans to nearly double its food assistance and nutritional support to the 440,000 Ebola-affected people in DR Congo over the next six months, in what it termed as, stepping up preparations for a potential further escalation of the epidemic.The African Union has also announced plans to convene a fundraising forum in the first week of September to support the fight against Ebola in DR Congo.

                DR Congo president pledges support for entrepreneurs to grow economy
            </a>
            <p>
                 Felix Tshisekedi, the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, has promised to support entrepreneurs who he called the "primary partners" of the country, in an effort to grow the economy.Tshisekedi spoke during the opening ceremony of the Makutano Forum 5 in Kinshasa on Friday, saying his government will take strong measures to restore the middle class with the promotion of the young entrepreneurs across all provinces.He said one key measure is guaranteeing the creation of funds for young entrepreneurs. The funds are expected to enable young Congolese to access credit to venture into entrepreneurship or expand their businesses. It's also part of the government's effort to lower interest rates, which are currently considered exorbitant."My ambition is to create several Congolese millionaires as well as support the establishment of many small and medium enterprises to create employment," he said.The president reassured the business community that he has embarked on actions aimed at avoiding all kinds of harassment on enterprises by state agencies.The Federation of Enterprises of Congo has been raising concerns regarding the missions of the General Inspectorate of Finance (IGF), which they termed a "bother".Tshisekedi also announced that he will convene a round table meeting to listen to the grievances of the business community with the aim of improving business environments. Through the meeting, he also plans to set up a mechanism for monitoring reforms for the country's business environment.He said his government will establish more vocational training centers to align skills training with labor market demands.The president also promised to create agro-industrial zones as well as develop infrastructure in the agricultural sector to reduce import of food stuffs. Currently, he said, the country imports 90 percent of its basic consumer goods, despite having huge agricultural potential.According to Invest in DR Congo, a national agency for the promotion of investments, the country has 80 million acres of arable land and 4 million acres of irrigable land, as well as many rivers with fishery resources. Most of the farmers are currently engaged in subsistence food agriculture.Anthony Nkinzo, the general manager of the National Agency for Investment Promotion, said there is need for strong commitment and responsibility to rebuild the country's image as well as attract more foreign investors."We anticipate for DR Congo with access to healthcare for all, education and training as well as improved infrastructure and a win-win public-private pact to grow the country's economy," Nkinzo said.Mahamadou Issoufou, the president of Niger, Ellen Johnson, the former president of Liberia and Dramani Mahama, the former president of Ghana, were some of the dignitaries who attended the forum.Nicole Sulu, the founder of Makutano network which is behind the forum, said attendance by the distinguished guests was an indication of a new era for African dialogue.She said the DR Congo is key for Africa's development because of its strategic location and natural wealth.The DR Congo is endowed with large mineral resources and has potential to install up to 100,000 MW of hydropower capacity, according to the United States Agency for International Development.The central African country is endowed with an abundance of rare mineral resources like diamond, gold, copper, cobalt, zinc, manganese and coltan. The country also has very rich forest resources.edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cn

                DR Congo aims for economic growth
            </a>
            <p>
                The Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) has announced measures to change the country's narrative, from poverty, conflicts and diseases, to a developing economy and favorable investment destination.Speaking during the recently concluded Makutano Forum, held in the country's capital Kinshasa on Sept 6-7, Félix Tshisekedi, president of DR Congo expressed confidence and passion to set the country on a trajectory of growth.Tshisekedi, who took office in January 2019 after winning the Dec 30, 2018 election and marking the country's first transfer of power through ballot box, is faced with the challenges of addressing political instability, improving governance and growing the economy. He announced his new government in August."My 100-day program is the beginning of a vast national development plan to make the DR Congo play its role in the African integration process," he said.The president said that DR Congo has potential and promising prospects that can transform the country into one of the richest economies in Africa. Toward that end, he said they will diversify the economy to leverage agriculture among other sectors.He said despite the country having 80 million hectares of arable land and 40 million hectares of irrigable land, it imports 90 percent of its basic consumer goods.The president called on the youth, of whom most have migrated to urban centers, to invest in agriculture, saying his government will improve living conditions in rural areas through the creation of agribusiness zones and construction of basic infrastructure."The DR Congo population is expected to hit 200 million by 2050, out of which over 60 percent will be below 25 years old. This is a real lever for development, but it can become a major risk if we don't make the right decisions today. Currently nearly 40 percent of the Congolese population lives in cities and this figure may exceed 50 percent by 2050," Tshisekedi said.Dr. Cheikh Kante, the minister in charge of the emerging Senegal Plan, lauded the president's call for youth to go into agribusiness, saying it's one of the initiatives that enabled his country to achieve food security."In just five years, Senegal created 196 farms. DR Congo has a huge agricultural potential and can be Africa's bread basket. Unfortunately the country has for long concentrated on the mining sector in the expense of the other sectors. DR Congo is a giant that President Tshisekedi should awaken by developing other sectors," he said.President Tshisekedi said the country was already awakened. "DR Congo has for long been termed as a giant with clay feet, However the country is now standing and ready to move forward," he said.Tshisekedi said they are also focusing on developing the energy sector, which is a priority for industrialization.

                DR Congo outlines growth trajectory
            </a>
            <p>
                The Democratic Republic of the Congo, or DR Congo, is vowing to change overseas perceptions of the country as poverty stricken and ridden with conflicts and diseases. Speaking during the recently concluded Makutano Forum, held in the country's capital Kinshasa on Sept 6-7, Felix Tshisekedi, president of DR Congo, expressed confidence and passion to set the country on a growth trajectory. Tshisekedi took office in January 2019 after winning the December election. The country had the first transfer of power through ballot box.

Tshisekedi will also focus on developing the energy sector, a priority for industrialization. He said the DR Congo has a combined energy potential of more than 200,000 megawatts, including 100,000 megawatts in hydropower, which coupled with its natural resources and geographical position can make the country a true global energy web. He added that the country is rich in fresh water, thus it can help solve the desertification challenge threatening north and southern parts of Africa. edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 09/13/2019 page4)
