                A typical day for 82-year-old Beijing resident Wang Baoyu centers around a senior care center near his home.He and his 80-year-old wife visit the center almost every day, either to fetch the delicious and nutritionally balanced food they have ordered, or to take part in activities the center has organized, including lectures, movies, photo shoots, and performances."With the center, its activities and the friends we have met there, we no longer feel lonely, and the takeout food is especially convenient, saving us the trouble of cooking or dining out," said the retired scientist who is entitled to special subsidies from the central government.Wang is one of a few hundred seniors who live near the center and benefit from the community-based care facility, which is operated by Hualu Senior Care and Health Management Co Ltd, a Beijing-based State-owned enterprise making fast inroads into the senior care industry.Li Congrong, vice-president of the company, said the firm has established a strong presence with significant growth in the industry since it was set up about four years ago, thanks to its adherence to innovation to meet middle-end, high-quality senior care service demand in China."The senior care industry in China keeps developing, but many of the high-quality senior care facilities target wealthy people who can afford expensive service charges," he said."Our company, on the contrary, tries to provide good quality but affordable services to the general public through business model innovation and efficiency enhancement."When people are old, they need all sorts of care and services, but ultimately, the most urgently needed senior care services in China are for those dependent seniors who suffer from dementia or physical illness, and cannot live by themselves, he said, adding that those who are physically challenged or suffering from dementia are the company's core service receivers.The care center the company operates in Wang's residential area is a flagship facility, which opened nine months ago and provides community-based care services for both dependent seniors and those who are still able to look after themselves.The main concept is that by establishing such a facility within an urban community, instead of a distant suburb, seniors living in the facility will not become isolated from people and places they are familiar with, especially as it allows their children and friends to visit them more easily.Also, seniors living in proximity to the facility such as Wang can access services whenever they wish.More importantly, such a facility can either hire certificated medical professionals or partner with nearby clinics and hospitals to provide basic medical services to seniors, including chronic disease medications and physical care.Zang Xianghua, the daughter of a 93-year-old Beijing resident suffering from Alzheimer's disease, said she felt lucky to have found the company's care center for her father late last year, as it is near her brother's home.Before that, she had visited three other facilities. Two looked fancy and comfortable but rejected her father because they only took in healthy seniors, despite high charges, while the third, which was cheaper, was too shabby.Besides, all three were far from the city.She pays 11,000 yuan ($1,530) per month to the Hualu facility for her father's care, and all the services he receives make her feel the cost is worthwhile."My father has a better life in the center than he did in our home, and we see it every time we visit," Zang said."I hired two carers for him at home, but they were not as professional and patient as the caregivers in the center."Li said the company has built a few community-based senior care centers in Beijing, and Jinan in Shandong province, each offering dozens of beds for dependent seniors.Few companies in China are operating similar facilities, and the company hopes to build more facilities to form a chained brand.Senior care is a heavy-asset business that needs huge investment in both assets and human resources but offers slow returns, and it is difficult to find suitable locations for senior care facilities with reasonable rents in cities, he said.The silver lining is that the Chinese authorities attach great importance to improving access to good quality senior care, and an increasing number of local governments are running trials of public insurance programs for senior care, he added.The company has been working with local governments across the country to build and operate senior care centers through public-private partnerships, and also plans to build nursing homes in areas such as the Yangtze River Delta region that provide medical services and life care to seniors seeking rehabilitation and chronic disease care, Li said.

                    A healthy lifestyle may offset genetic risk for Alzheimer's
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                LOS ANGELES — A healthy lifestyle can cut your risk of developing Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia even if you have genes that raise your risk for these mind-destroying diseases, a large study has found.People with high genetic risk and poor health habits were about three times more likely to develop dementia versus those with low genetic risk and good habits, researchers reported Sunday. Regardless of how much genetic risk someone had, a good diet, adequate exercise, limiting alcohol and not smoking made dementia less likely."I consider that good news," said John Haaga of the US National Institute on Aging, one of the study's many sponsors. "No one can guarantee you'll escape this awful disease" but you can tip the odds in your favor with clean living, he said.Results were discussed at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Los Angeles and published online by the Journal of the American Medical Association.About 50 million people have dementia, and Alzheimer's disease is the most common type. Genes and lifestyle contribute to many diseases, but researchers only recently have had the tools and information to do large studies to see how much each factor matters.One such study a few years ago found that healthy living could help overcome genetic risk for heart disease. Now researchers have shown the same to be true for dementia.Dr. Elzbieta Kuzma and colleagues at the University of Exeter Medical School in England used the UK Biobank to study nearly 200,000 people 60 or older with no signs or symptoms of dementia at the start. Their genetic risk was classified as high, medium or low based on dozens of mutations known to affect dementia. They also were grouped by lifestyle factors.After about eight years of study, 1.8 percent of those with high genetic risk and poor lifestyles had developed dementia versus 0.6 percent of folks with low genetic risk and healthy habits.Among those with the highest genetic risk, just over 1 percent of those with favorable lifestyles developed dementia compared to nearly 2 percent of those with poor lifestyles.One limitation: Researchers only had information on mutations affecting people of European ancestry, so it's not known whether the same is true for other racial or ethnic groups.The results should give encouragement to people who fear that gene mutations alone determine their destiny, said Dr. Rudy Tanzi, a genetics expert at Massachusetts General Hospital. Less than 5 percent of the ones tied to Alzheimer's are "fully penetrant," meaning that they guarantee you'll get the disease, he said."That means that with 95 percent of the mutations, your lifestyle will make a difference," Tanzi said. "Don't be too worried about your genetics. Spend more time being mindful of living a healthy life."One previous study in Sweden and Finland rigorously tested the effect of a healthy lifestyle by assigning one group to follow one and included a comparison group that did not. It concluded that healthy habits could help prevent mental decline. The Alzheimer's Association is sponsoring a similar study under way now in the United States.Healthy living also is the focus of new dementia prevention guidelines that the World Health Organization released in February.AP

                Wu Qi was debilitatingly shy when he was very young and refused to talk to most people until one day he found a newborn puppy in a trash can.Now, the 38-year-old is cheerful, optimistic and has become known as a "dog whisperer", an animal behavior expert and a founder of China's first animal-assisted therapy program. Wu is also called "Uncle Dog" by many autistic children.After he found the puppy, the two became good friends. He took care of the dog through elementary and high school until he went to Nanjing University in Jiangsu province, in his native Zhejiang province, to further his studies."I often talked to the dog and shared my life with it. It changed my introverted personality and helped make me the person I am today," he said.Wu was heartbroken when the dog died peacefully at home. After he graduated from the university in 2003, he owned another dog and learned how to care for animals in a professional manner, including how to train them to better fit their unique environments and work together with humans.He left his job as a computer games designer to enter the pet sector－a career decision that provided him with sufficient time to be with animals.Wu's father, a civil servant, and his mother, a teacher, were strongly opposed to his decision to quit a well-paid job in order to raise animals. They thought his new occupation was "humiliating" for a well-educated man, and wept when they talked to him on the phone.Wu continued with his new career, but encountered many difficulties. He failed in running two pet shops, and in 2010, he had nothing to his name but six dogs.

                    Moderate exercise can decrease physical markers of Alzheimer's: study

                WASHINGTON -- A new study showed that regular exercise can help prevent the development of physical signs of Alzheimer's among those who are at risk of the disease. Presented at the ongoing annual convention of the American Psychological Association in Chicago from Aug 8 to 11, the study showed that in a late-middle-age population at risk for Alzheimer's disease, physically active individuals can experience fewer age-related alterations in biomarkers associated with the disease.The researchers led by Ozioma Okonkwo at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health examined 317 participants with a history of parents with probable Alzheimer's dementia.They are cognitively healthy and between the ages of 40 and 65 years at the time of enrollment, according to the study.All participants completed a questionnaire about their physical activity and went through neuropsychological testing and brain scans to measure several biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease.The researchers compared data from individuals younger than 60 years with older adults. They found a decrease in cognitive abilities and an increase in biomarkers associated with the disease in the older individuals.However, the effects were significantly weaker in older adults who reported to have engaged in the equivalent of at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise five days a week.In another study, researchers studied 95 people who were given scores based on whether they possessed certain genes associated with Alzheimer's.They found that those with higher risk scores also showed decreased biomarkers with greater aerobic fitness."These studies suggest that the negative effect of aging and genetic risk on Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and cognition can be lessened in physically active, older adults at risk for the disease compared with their less active peers," said Okonkwo.

                Eighty-year-old scientist Guan Huashi is steering an independent research team to find cures for diseases, and his source is the ocean.Guan and his team, based in Qingdao, Shandong province, plan to develop several new medicines mainly derived from marine organisms in the next three to five years.As a pioneer of marine pharmaceutical studies, Guan, a professor at the Ocean University of China, in 1985 led a team that successfully developed the country's first marine drug, called PSS. The drug helps to treat vascular diseases related to the heart and brain.The latest breakthrough of Guan's team is an Alzheimer's drug called GV-971, which is extracted from brown algae.When President Xi Jinping visited Qingdao in June last year, Guan, also a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, told Xi about his dream to develop a "blue drugstore" for medicine in China, with "blue" indicating the sea."We share the same dream," Xi replied."Developing the marine economy and conducting research in marine sciences are important parts of the nation's strategy of rejuvenation," Xi said, adding that all-out efforts should be made in this direction.China is pursuing coordinated land and marine development, a national strategy adopted at the 19th Communist Party of China National Congress.Bordered by the Bohai and Yellow seas, Shandong boasts 3,345 kilometers of coastline, accounting for one-sixth of the country's total, with its waters providing abundant marine resources. Qingdao, which contains 10 districts and three county-level cities, has 817 km of coastline, comprising 120 islands and 49 bays, and covers a maritime area of 12,240 square kilometers."Qingdao is at the forefront of marine science and technology," said Wang Qingxian, secretary of the Qingdao committee of the Communist Party of China.The coastal city is home to more than 30 percent of China's marine science and technology universities and research institutes, as well as 50 percent of researchers and 70 percent of experts and scholars in the field.The city also has an extensive shipping network to 177 ports across the world, thanks to its natural deep-water harbor."Qingdao is accelerating its efforts in the high-quality marine sector, with a focus on economic transformation, efficient port services, opening-up, technological innovation and ecological protection," Wang said.The Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Qingdao was founded in 1950, a year after the founding of the People's Republic of China. It is China's first State-run marine science institution and has been focusing on research.The institute has witnessed big strides and Chinese scientists have made ocean exploration a reality, said its director Wang Fan.According to Wang Fan, the institute has established the world's largest marine observation system covering offshore areas and neighboring oceans. It also deploys a vast number of buoys, which can transmit real-time data.Wang Fan said the Institute of Oceanology is teaming up with 12 domestic marine institutes to establish the Center for Ocean Mega-Science in Qingdao. The center aims to bring together facilities and talent and make innovative contributions to China's marine sciences.The center will be located in the Qingdao West Coast New Area, the ninth national-level new area in China. When it was approved by the State Council in 2014, the new area was expected to play an important role in the development of the country's maritime economy.Wu Jifa, deputy head of the new area's marine development bureau, said over the past five years it has helped establish a modern marine industry, which incorporates ship building, marine equipment manufacturing, shipping logistics and seawater desalination.Zhao Ruixue contributed to this story.

                    Plan focuses on disabilities of the elderly

                New framework to assist institutions in evaluating ailments of older adultsChina has established a framework to help elderly care institutions evaluate the disabilities of older adults and provide tailored services, the National Health Commission said on Tuesday.The move is aimed at addressing the rising demand of care for the elderly who live with chronic disabilities, a swelling group that has exceeded 40 million in recent years, according to Jiao Yahui, deputy chief of the commission's medical administration and supervision department."A wide range of health institutions, from large hospitals and community clinics to nursing homes and rehabilitation centers, are encouraged to evaluate the disability levels of their senior clients based on the framework," she said, adding that assessment results will be used to assist caregivers in designing or altering aged care services.The newly released framework is also expected to shed light on the emerging long-term care insurance policy, which covers a niche of caring services excluded from regular healthcare insurance, such as assisted living and long stays at nursing homes, said Liu Hongjian, an official with the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.In China, the policy was proposed by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security in 2016 and is now under trial in 15 cities across the country. Nearly 46.5 million people had enrolled in the trial program as of the end of last year."Insurance companies will be able to develop a variety of products based on the framework, which provides a uniform and clear standard on the classification of disabilities and types of care services that can be offered at these elderly care institutions," Liu said.According to the framework, there are five levels of disabilities for people aged over 60. The levels are determined by the seniors' ability to perform daily activities and participate in social events as well as their mental health, perception and communication skills. Debilitating conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are also taken into consideration.Jiao added that the commission has also incorporated mental health checkups and consultations as well as therapies that incorporate traditional Chinese medicine into a list of recommended services for the disabled elderly, in addition to traditional service categories that include bathing assistance and dispensing medication.China has nearly 250 million people aged 60 or over, accounting for about 18 percent of the population, according to data released by the National Statistics Bureau in January.That number is set to climb to 400 million by 2035 and 500 million, or 35 percent of the total population, by 2050, according to estimates from the World Health Organization.The growing elderly population has strained the country's aged care services. As a result, China has adopted a raft of measures to expand access to quality elderly care services and increase supervision over the booming industry.On Aug 19, the China Gerontological Nursing Alliance was established in Beijing to compile efforts from healthcare institutions, research centers and enterprises to help authorities draft new regulations and standards for the elderly care industry.Xi Huan, chairman of the alliance, said it will soon set up more detailed action plans based on the framework and promote implementation among its members.

                Removal of barriers to foreign access will allow European providers to help support China's increasing senior populationBroadening foreign investment access, an improving business environment, and government support are making it easier for French companies to cooperate with Chinese partners to tap the huge potential in China's senior care market, according to French officials and industry insiders.During a recent conference in Beijing on cooperation between China and France in the senior care sector, Olivier Richard, deputy head of mission at the French embassy in China, said many barriers to foreign access have been removed this year and French companies are being treated equally with Chinese companies." (That) creates a better environment for French and Chinese companies to cooperate," he said.A graying population with longer life expectancy means surging demand for senior care facilities and professionals so seniors can enjoy a high-quality of life, he said, stressing the huge potential in the Chinese senior care market, the largest in the world.France's senior care expertise accumulated over decades from its establishment and operation of world-leading senior care and support models, especially for dependent seniors, will be helpful to China, Richard said.The senior care industry in France covers a wide range of areas, from architecture design, and construction of nursing homes, professional training, to home care services, and also includes services related to smart residential systems, the internet of things, insurance, medical care and telemedicine, and big data, with a number of world-leading players.China, on the other hand, is faced with a huge challenge in caring for its rapidly increasing senior population, although it has been ramping up efforts to boost the sector, such as expanding market access, reducing fundraising costs, and cutting tax for home-based senior care service providers.Statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics showed China had a population of 249 million aged 60 or above at the end of 2018, accounting for 17.9 percent of the total population.
