                LONDON -- Liverpool maintained their 100 percent start to the season with a 3-0 win away to Burnley which only served to show that Jurgen Klopp's side looks hungrier than ever.After opening the scoring with a Chris Wood own goal, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino added to Liverpool's tally with the only negative and on-field disagreement between Mane and Mohamed Salah after Salah wasted a chance by opting to shoot rather than pass.Klopp said the incident only highlighted the desire his players have, after chalking up their 13th consecutive league win.Manchester City kept on Liverpool's tail as the top of the Premier League begins to take on a very familiar look. Pep Guardiola's men had few problems in brushing aside Brighton 4-0 with goals from Kevin de Bruyne, who put City on course for a win as early as the second minute.Kun Aguero scored twice and Bernardo Silva rounded off the scoring for City, who suffered a potentially major setback when central defender Aymeric Laporte was carried off with what looked like a serious knee injury.Sunday's north London derby between Arsenal and Tottenham produced thrills and goals in a 2-2 draw which probably leaves Arsenal the happier of the two sides after they came back from 2-0 down.Christian Erikson justified his return to the Spurs side with a 10th-minute goal and Harry Kane doubled Spurs' lead with a penalty five minutes before the break.Alexandre Lacazette threw Arsenal a lifeline in first-half injury time and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang drew the home side level with 19 minutes left to play, although the result sees both sides slip further behind Liverpool and Man City.Frank Lampard continued to struggle with Chelsea as his side saw young striker Tammy Abraham underlined his potential with two first-half goals in a 2-2 draw at home to recently promoted Sheffield United.Callum Robinson began the Sheffield United fightback when he swept home in the first minute of the second half and then sent the 'Blades' fans wild in the 89th minute when his cross was deflected into the Chelsea net by the unfortunate Kurt Zouma, who is not enjoying a happy return to Stamford Bridge.Manchester United's failings were exposed again as they drew 1-1 away to Southampton and the home side could have taken all three points but for Kevin Danso's 73rd minute red card.Daniel James scored a fine opener for United, but that was cancelled out by Jannik Vestergaard's powerful header, while a bench containing three youth teamers and three players out of form (Matic, Rojo and Lingaard) shows the lack of depth available to Ole Gunnar Soljskaer.Jamie Vardy scored twice as Leicester City continued a positive start to the season and moved up to third with a 3-1 win at home to Bournemouth, while Sebastian Haller and Andriy Yarmolenko gave West Ham United a 2-0 home win over Norwich, who disappointed after a promising start to the campaign.Richarlison scored twice as Everton won a thriller 3-2 at home to Wolves, with Alex Iwobi netting the other goal as Marco Silva's side beat the team coached by his countryman Nuno Espiritu Santo.Jonathan Ayew's solitary goal was enough to give Crystal Palace three points at home to Aston Villa, while Watford got their first point of the campaign with a 1-1 draw away to Newcastle United who failed to build on last weekend's win away to Tottenham.

                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump spoke over phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about Iran, the White House said Thursday.The two leaders discussed bilateral cooperation in "advancing shared national security interests, including efforts to prevent Iran's malign actions in the region," said the White House in a statement.Iran announced Sunday that it was raising the uranium enrichment level beyond the limit set in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, after Washington's unilateral exit from the landmark pact over a year ago.Iran said earlier that the Europeans had failed to take "practical" steps to ensure Iran's economic interests under the deal.Netanyahu, a vocal opponent of the 2015 nuclear deal, has urged European leaders to reimpose sanctions on Iran, accusing the Islamic republic of enriching uranium to "build nuclear weapons".

                    UN chief calls for 'concrete plans' at climate summit in September

            <p class="style-content">
                UNITED NATIONS -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday called for "concrete plans" at the Climate Action Summit he is to convene in September.At a press encounter, Guterres expressed his hope that world leaders "don't come to the summit with beautiful speeches," but "come with concrete plans."He said the summit needs "clear steps to enhance nationally determined contributions by 2020, and strategies for carbon neutrality by 2050."The Climate Action Summit 2019 is slated for Sept 23 as part of the high-level events of the 74th Session of UN General Assembly, which will gather heads of state and government of the UN member states.Guterres underlined the gravity of the global warming by citing the latest evidence.According to the World Meteorological Organization, he said, the month of July at least equaled if not surpassed the hottest month in recorded history.Also, "we are on track for the period from 2015 to 2019 to be the five hottest years on record."He said preventing irreversible climate disruption "is the race of our lives and for our lives" and "a race we can and must win."The UN chief reiterated the targets of limiting temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius, cutting greenhouse emissions by 45 percent by 2030, and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050."We need rapid and deep change in how we do business, generate power, build cities and feed the world," he urged. "Having endured what is possibly the hottest month in recorded history we need action now."

            <p class="style-content">
                NEW DELHI -- Indian and Pakistani border troops were involved in cross-border firing on Thursday, India's 73rd Independence Day, and claimed casualties on each other's sides.Indian Army sources said that Indian troops killed as many as three Pakistani security personnel in cross-border firing. They claimed that Pakistani troops were involved in ceasefire violations.In a tweet, spokesperson of the Pakistan Armed Forces Major General Asif Ghafoor confirmed three soldiers died on the Pakistani side. He also claimed that in the firing as many as five Indian soldiers were also killed.An army statement from the Pakistani side said the Indian army has increased firing along the Line of Control (LoC) in its "efforts to divert attention from precarious situation" in the Indian-controlled Kashmir.However, the Indian Army denied the Pakistani claim of five casualties and damages on the Indian side due to Pakistani firing, Indian media reported.The Times of India daily quoted a senior Indian Army official as saying "the claim made by Pakistan's military is fictitious."

                    China says Kashmir issue should be resolved peacefully
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                UN Security Council members believe India and Pakistan should refrain from taking unilateral action over the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir, China's UN envoy said on Friday after the council met on the issue for the first time in decades.While the council did not agree on a statement, China's UN Ambassador Zhang Jun summed up the discussions at the closed-door meeting, describing serious concern over the situation.He said the Kashmir issue "should be resolved properly though peaceful means in accordance with the UN Charter, relevant Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements." "This represents the consensus of the international community," he said.On Aug 5, India issued a presidential decree that revoked Article 370 of India's constitution that grants special status and allows the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir to make its own laws.The government removed the region's limited autonomy, which has been in place since the 1940s, and cut the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories.The Indian government also imposed an unprecedented security lockdown and a near-total communications blackout in the region, arresting more than 500 people.The move has reportedly worsened the already-heightened tensions between India and neighboring Pakistan.United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged India and Pakistan to exercise restraint.During the closed-door meeting, council members listened to briefings by the UN Secretariat on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and the work of the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan.After the meeting, Zhang spoke to the media about China's position on Kashmir.Zhang said the issue of Kashmir is left from the history between India and Pakistan. "According to relevant Security Council resolutions, the status of Kashmir is undecided and it is an internationally-recognized disputed area," he emphasized.Zhang said the constitutional amendment by India has changed the status quo in Kashmir, causing tension in the region."China is deeply concerned about the current situation and opposes any unilateral action that complicates the situation," he said. "We call upon the relevant parties to exercise restraint, act prudently, and in particular, not take actions that will aggravate tensions."He said India's move has also challenged China's sovereignty and violated a bilateral agreement on maintaining peace and stability in the border area."I wish to emphasize that such practice by India is not valid in relation to China and will not change China's exercise of sovereignty and effective administrative jurisdiction over the territory," he reiterated.He said both India and Pakistan are China's friendly neighbors.As both countries are at a crucial period of development, he said that they should find a proper solution to their historical grievances, discard a zero-sum game mentality, avoid unilateral action, and settle disputes peacefully to jointly maintain peace and stability in the region.According to the news agency Xinhua, Indian and Pakistani troops recently shelled each other several times near the Line of Actual Control in Kashmir. The latest cross-border firing happened on Thursday, India's 73rd Independence Day, and troops on both sides claimed casualties on each other's side.

                    How to attract more corporate HQ to mainland
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                In November last year, while delivering his keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the First China International Import Expo in Shanghai, President Xi Jinping said China will build a world-class business environment.According to a report by World-World Bank Group on the business environment of 2019, the global ranking of China's business environment rose to 46 from 78 among 190 economies, up 32 places, that signified China as the future's largest economy with the world's most improved business environment and strongest ranking increase.Few countries try as hard as China does to improve their business environment, with devoted efforts to implement an all-around opening-up policy, although all countries in the world are exerting to improve their business environment.For a good business environment, it is very important to have a market economy centering on an open, fair, just and transparent legal system.From January to July this year, China's actual use of foreign capital reached 533.14 billion yuan ($74.3 million), up 7.3 percent year-on-year, which was quite an achievement against the background of global flows of foreign direct investment falling in the past three years.There is now a torrent of multinational companies keen to set up their regional headquarters in China, thanks to the improvement in China's business environment.At the end of July, Shanghai was the key base of 696 multinational companies, with 104 of them setting up headquarters for their operations in China (including the mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong), or Asia, or even larger regions (like the Asia-Pacific). Shanghai is also home to 450 research and development centers.The city boasts the largest number of regional headquarters and foreign R&D centers on the Chinese mainland.More importantly, operations at these headquarters push forward further companies' layout of R&D, design and logistics centers in China. The official launch of Lin-gang Special Area on Aug 20 as a newly added part of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone is likely to attract more headquarters of multinational companies to Shanghai.However, China still lags behind the top players in attracting multinational companies to build regional headquarters. Although Shanghai has 696 companies' headquarters, the figures for Singapore, Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, Rotterdam of the Netherlands hit 1,200, 2,146, and 800 respectively. The United States has headquarters of 8,000 companies.To encourage more companies to establish their headquarters, Chinese cities must avoid making three mistakes:One, they should not focus only on foreign companies; they should not neglect Chinese private companies such as Alibaba and Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co Ltd.Two, they should not attach so much importance to the economic and trade sectors that they end up overlooking the services sector, particularly its key segments like financing, culture, education, medical care, tourism and fashion.Three, which is the most dangerous factor, they should not eye only existing big companies but start to pay attention to even promising startups.More companies are choosing Chinese cities to establish headquarters because China is a huge market with a bulking middle-income consumer group of about 400 million people. China has complete industrial, supply and service chains. It is the world's largest industrial country with all manufacturing sectors. Many Chinese cities either host China's central government departments, or are centers of financing, manufacturing or innovation and scientific research. Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou in Guangdong province and Nanjing in Jiangsu province are good examples in this regard.What might be the weaknesses of some Chinese cities in hosting company headquarters? Are they lack of preferential policies, skilled talent, capital, or tax reduction?I think what really matters is the belief that a city should develop together with companies' headquarters.After a company establishes its headquarters, if there is no follow-up service, or support systems in the form of housing, transportation, education and so on, then it will be difficult for the company to retain talent, and to develop.When attracting corporate headquarters, Chinese cities often focus on economic and trade aspects, and neglect services. Lack of financial institutions, and cultural and art centers, exacerbates the situation.Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is expected to bring about a change, but for the next leap forward, China should make efforts in the following aspects.First of all, the Chinese government must accord more attention and support to companies. It is important to care for both the total number and layout of company headquarters.Attached to headquarters, there may be facilities for R&D, industrial design, global logistics, and asset control. All these require all-round support, including in environment-related aspects. In this regard, the Dutch and Irish governments are very supportive of companies operating in their countries.According to the World Bank Group's report on business environment, China ranked low in indicators such as credit, construction, and taxation. China ranked 73rd in terms of access to credit, 121st in construction permits, and 114th in taxes.However, China ranked high in the execution of the contract, power accessibility, enterprise establishment, property registration, which were sixth, 14th, 28th, and 27th respectively.China should take action on its shortcomings, the report revealed, to improve its global rank in business environment.China should contribute more to the global headquarters economy. The continuity and stability of policies are much valued, so that China could strengthen the implementation of the opening-up policy to attract more corporate headquarters to China.China will become a first choice for companies to build headquarters within five years, if China makes full use of its advantages and overcomes its weaknesses.The author is an expert with the China Going Global Think Tank, former vice-minister of commerce, and vice-chairman of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges.

                UNITED NATIONS - The 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly was concluded on Monday.At the closing plenary meeting of the session, the outgoing UN General Assembly President Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces handed over the gavel to the President-Elect of the 74th session Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, symbolizing the handover of power."My sincere hope for the 74th session is that we will not only hear robust defenses of multilateralism, but see delivered tangible benefits to people's lives," said Espinosa.In her final speech as president of the UN General Assembly, Espinosa said that she hopes to see "concrete actions to make this organization more effective, transparent, inclusive, accountable, and relevant to all people everywhere.""Today, there is almost no problem that does not require global cooperation," she added.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres congratulated on the completion of the session.In his remarks, the UN chief said many of the issues debated, raised and accomplished during the 73rd session are testament to what can be achieved through international cooperation and competent leadership.The adoption by the General Assembly of two global compacts on migration and refugees are remarkable examples, he said, adding that the United Nations continued in the past year to advance its comprehensive reforms at an unprecedented pace and scale.Espinosa was the fourth woman and the first from Latin America and the Caribbean to serve as the UN General Assembly president. Guterres said that her successful term will "pave the way for increasing the participation of women in the political sphere around the world, and for accelerating progress towards gender equality within and beyond the United Nations."The 74th session of the UN General Assembly will open on Tuesday.
