                How US tariffs boost Chinese hardware firms
            </p>
            <p>
                Ironically, the tariffs and sanctions against Chinese tech companies are pushing the growth of technologically independent, homegrown tech hardware companies in China.The key enabler for the growth of a new industry, especially a tech industry, is a customer who provides a steady source of demand for its products.From the 1950s to the 1980s, the US military and NASA were the prime demand sources that allowed the early producers of integrated circuits to stay in business.And, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, provided the key funding that made the creation of the internet possible.As late as 1980, the federal government procured more than half of all aircraft and telecoms equipment. This supported the companies plus allowed the development of spin-off consumer goods.Without this demand from the US government, the companies would not have been able to do the expensive research or make the huge upfront investment that made the microchip industry possible.In markets for more mature technologies, it's very hard for a new company to grow if it requires big upfront capital investment and faces already established competitors. The newcomer would have to take customers away from the old companies by competing on cost or quality.A new producer of chips, for example, would have to invest in fabrication facilities costing billions of dollars before receiving any return. Then, it would have to charge less or build a better product than long-established firms - a very difficult proposition.Famously, China imports more chips than it does petroleum. In 2017, the country imported $260 billion worth of chips and $162 billion worth of crude oil. More than $200 billion of the chip purchases were US-made chips, according to Bloomberg data.Even more were US-designed chips, for which US companies received royalties.You might think this would be touted as a huge success for US exporters. But, the current sanctions and threats of sanctions against Huawei, ZTE and others have permanently soured the market for US chips and other technologies.According to the China Semiconductor Industry Association, less than 20 percent of Chinese domestic chip demand in 2017, up from 9 percent in 2015, was met by Chinese-made chips.Once Huawei deploys its own new Harmony operating system, will it ever be willing to rely on Google's Android again? Will Chinese tech companies be willing to rely on US chips? For that matter, will countries around the world be willing to be dependent on US technology? The decisions being made now are irreversible.Both Chinese companies and the Chinese government have invested heavily in core research and in the development of new tech products. But, realizing the goal of creating a more vibrant and innovative domestic tech industry would be very difficult if the new companies and products faced constant competition from established foreign players.Effectively, the US tariffs and sanctions are creating a window of opportunity allowing China's infant tech industries to develop by guaranteeing a protected market. If China were to try to limit the imports of US technology on its own, you can be sure that the US would file a complaint with the World Trade Organization.The immediate shock of the sanctions and tariffs will no doubt cause short-term, even medium-term, disruptions. For example, Ren Zhengfei, Huawei's CEO, acknowledged that the company will likely lose $30 billion over the next several years as a result of US actions.China has been building its tech capabilities for more than a decade and has invested heavily in R&D aimed at building chip-making skills. Universities have created departments to develop the talent needed.But, chip-making is a very highly specialized, high-investment business and there are only a few capable companies in the world. Velu Sinha, Bain& Company partner in Shanghai, was quoted in the Financial Times in January concluding that Chinese semiconductor science and chip design capabilities are at the cutting edge, but the industry needs access to the most advanced next-generation tools for chip making."It is not a question of if, it is a question of when. But we are not talking a year or two, we're talking five to 10 years before those technologies in China get caught up," Sinha told FT.The US sanctions and tariffs are likely to push up this schedule since Chinese chip-makers know that they have a very large and very eager customer base. This reduces the risk in the huge investment needed to build next-generation foundries.The US and Chinese tech manufacturing and supply processes are so intertwined that no one really knows what will happen if they are forced to separate.Some companies will likely move some manufacturing out of China to Vietnam or India to avoid tariffs. But, these will be low value-added, labor-intensive manufacturing processes that are not dependent on China's unequalled infrastructure or manufacturing clusters.Many others will have to just pay the tariffs. In any case, prices charged to consumers will have to rise.In the longer term, tech competition among multiple tech centers will be good for the world. Over the past decade, firms in Silicon Valley have used their monopolistic power to stamp out competition around the world, with the sole exception of China. It is unreasonable for the US to try to protect monopolistic tech giants from world competition.Most countries have an industrial policy, whether they call it that or not. The German government's "Industry 4.0" intends to use government policy to facilitate the upgrading of industry to use the coming artificial intelligence advances in and robotics technologies. Airbus would not have been created without substantial subsidies from European countries.The US has long depended on defense spending for support of developing the high-tech industry. For example, for the past two decades, Boeing's defense sales have exceeded 30 percent of total company revenue.As an American, I want to know how the US ended up without a producer of 5G equipment. How did our industrial policy system allow that to happen?China is, of course, eager to develop its long-term technological capabilities. It has recently spent heavily on R&D related to a range of new high-tech industries. This is especially important as it transitions to an economy based on producing higher-value added products.To continue to grow and to increase the incomes of its people, China must continue to move away from the low-wage industries that kicked off its industrialization.China is taking many good-faith steps to open its large, competitive, consumer economy to a wide range of foreign competitors. Recently, it has opened its financial services markets and also removed most requirements that foreign firms need to meet to form joint ventures with local firms.But no country could agree to any steps that would cripple its future technological development or industrial transformation.

                Top 10 Chinese cities with fastest internet download speed
            </a>
            <p>
                How fast is the broadband download speed for daily use in Chinese cities? The recently published report on Chinese broadband speed by the Broadband Development Alliance unveils the latest general picture across the nation.According to the report, China Unicom took the crown in terms of users' download speed over a 4G network among the three telecom operators, followed by China Mobile and China Telecom.From a location perspective, users in East China enjoy the fastest download speed of 24.4 Mb/s, while in Central China 23.4 Mb/s and West China 22.88 Mb/s.With different telecom operators, service sets and locations, speeds across the country will undoubtedly be different, Zhu Wei, deputy director of the Communication Law Center of the China University of Political Science and Law explained. Individual user handsets also play a role in overall speeds.Let's take a look at the top 10 cities with the fastest download speed in China.

                With China at the forefront of digital technologies and social media, Johnson & Johnson, the US-based healthcare giant, has adapted these trends to its new recruitment methodology to compete for talent and drive its growth in the country.Many global companies such as J&J are no longer focusing on just sourcing top professional talent from outside their companies. They are also diversifying the skills of their employees via multi-job training, overseas mobility, incentive programs and talent cultivation.Alexandros Kopitsas, head of human resources at J&J China, said hiring with the help of digital technology could mean imaginative use of video resumes and AI-enabled interviews.

                Cao Xue has endured the proverbial roller coaster of emotions since learning his team's design was selected as the mascot for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.After months of toil and sleepless nights, there were tears of joy on Aug 21 when Cao was told that cute cartoon panda Bing Dwen Dwen had beaten around 6,000 submissions to be the symbolic face of the Beijing Games.But after being sworn to secrecy until the design was officially unveiled on Sept 17, Cao admitted the wait to tell everyone the exciting news was excruciating."I suffered for weeks after being told Bing Dwen Dwen had been chosen as the mascot for the Beijing Winter Games. I could not tell my friends, relatives, colleagues and even my family before it was officially announced by the 2022 organizing committee," said Cao, a professor at Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts (GAFA).Cao now finds himself catapulted into the spotlight, fielding interview after interview as he explains the process and thinking behind his team's creation, which has been described as a panda wearing an icy shell that's stylized as a sports helmet or spacesuit.Bing translates as "ice" in Chinese, which is a symbol of toughness and purity, while Dwen suggests health and ingenuity－all characteristics associated with the spirit of the Olympics.Cao acknowledges it is somewhat ironic that designers from Guangzhou, a hot and humid southern metropolis that rarely sees snow, ran out winners of a Winter Olympics design competition."I told an official with the 2022 organizing committee that those who have never seen snowfall are even more creative and imaginative in creating, designing and producing ice and snow works," he said."And nobody in China likes the snow and ice better than the Cantonese."In fact, as Cao pointed out, Guangdong province boasts the world's second-largest indoor ski resort, so winter sports aren't completely alien to southerners.The same can't be said for pandas, though. Cao chose the rare animal as the basis for the design because it has, as he says, become a symbol of goodwill and resonates with a global audience.As part of the design process, Cao's team visited a giant panda nature reserve in Sichuan province last year.Cao added that Bing Dwen Dwen is a gift for the country as it prepares to celebrate its 70th anniversary next month.Liu Pingyun, another member of the winning team, revealed Bing Dwen Dwen underwent over a thousand design revisions before the final version was arrived at."To create, design and produce Bing Dwen Dwen, the 14-person team, which consisted of seven professors and teachers and another seven GAFA postgraduate students, worked overtime for several months," Liu said."We even joked that one of the women on our team, who wears glasses, had started to look like a panda because she was so focused on her work!"

                Iran vows to lead Gulf security as tensions rise
            </a>
            <p>
                TEHERAN - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday that his country should lead regional security in the strategic Persian Gulf and criticized the presence of foreign forces, as the country's nuclear deal with world powers appears near collapse and the United States deployed more troops to assist its Arab allies.The US has said Iran is behind a series of attacks on the region's energy infrastructure, including a major drone-and-missile hit on Saudi Arabia's oil industry that shook global energy markets. Iran has denied the allegations and said any retaliatory strikes from the US or Saudi Arabia will lead to "all-out war".Speaking during a military parade, Rouhani warned that the presence of foreign forces in the Persian Gulf region could cause problems for the world's "energy security".He said that Iran extends its "hand of friendship and brotherhood" toward regional nations for overseeing security in the Persian Gulf and its narrowest point, the Strait of Hormuz, where one-fifth of global oil exports passes.Along with boosting troops and equipment levels in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the US is leading a maritime coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Kingdom and Australia, to secure the area's waterways and vital oil trade routes.The military parade marked the 39th anniversary of the start of the eight-year war with Iraq that began when former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invaded Iran in 1980.Similar parades were held in many major cities across Iran including the port city of Bandar Abbas near the Strait of Hormuz.State TV showed scores of Iranian fast-attack boats, as well as air defense and other military equipment. It also carried images of Iranian Revolutionary Guard naval forces rappelling down the side of a sailing ship.The US navy has often complained about Guard fast boats and naval forces harassing shipping in the Gulf.Tensions escalated between arch-foes Iran and the US after last weekend's attacks on Saudi energy giant Aramco's Abqaiq processing plant and Khurais oilfield halved the kingdom's oil output.Yemen's Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the strikes, but the US said it had concluded the attacks involved cruise missiles from Iran and amounted to "an act of war".US sends more troops Washington approved the deployment of troops to Saudi Arabia at "the kingdom's request", US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said, noting the forces would be "defensive in nature" and focused on air and missile defenses.The commander of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, General Hossein Salami, said on Saturday that Iran was "ready for any type of scenario"."Whoever wants their land to become the main battlefield, go ahead," he told a news conference in Teheran."We will never allow any war to encroach upon Iran's territory."We hope that they don't make a strategic mistake", he said.Saudi Arabia, which has been bogged down in a five-year war across its southern border in Yemen, has said Iran "unquestionably sponsored" the attacks.Riyadh said the weapons used in the attacks were Iranian-made, but it has stopped short of directly blaming its regional rival.Iran has long sought the evacuation of Western and US forces from Arab Gulf countries, seeing it as a potential threat to the Persian nation.Rouhani added on Sunday that he will offer a regional peace plan during his visit to the United Nations General Assembly this week.Fears of a wider regional conflagration have grown, as tensions between Iran and the US remain high over Teheran's failing 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Recently, Iran has broken the deal's limits on enrichment, uranium stockpiles and the use of advanced centrifuges, as it seeks to pressure Europe to offer it a way to sell its crude oil on the international market despite US sanctions.US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the deal over a year ago, and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran.Agencies

                Chengdu panda base to limit visitors during National Day holiday
            </a>
            <p>
                Zhou Mengqi, a veteran photographer in Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan province, is a great fan of pandas, having taken pictures of the cuddly bears for about three decades.But he admits he hates the panda bases during any major holiday, say, New Year's Day, Tomb Sweeping Day, Labor Day, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day."You see people instead of pandas," he complains.The photographer is pleased that the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding issued a circular on Sunday to try to mitigate the expected madding crowd.Visitors will have to book tickets online during the National Day holiday from Oct 1 to 7. Tickets will not be sold at the ticket office or ticket-selling machines during the period.As many as 60,000 tickets will be sold online for a single day over the period, 36,000 tickets for the morning and 24,000 for the afternoon.The maximum number of visitors allowed at one time will be 22,000. If this number is reached, the base will stop admitting visitors and will operate on a one-out, one-in basis, the circular said.The move is aimed at preventing the base from overcrowding, which has been commonplace during previous holidays.
