                MTR to pay up to HK$10 million for damage repair
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                A top official of the city's sole rail operator on Sunday said repair cost for the damaged metro stations totaled up to HK$10 million.Jacob Kam Chak-pui, chief executive officer of MTR Corporation, said at a television talk show that more than 90 metro stations have been vandalized by radical protesters in the past two weeks.He added that repairing those damaged metro stations has been made more difficult by repeated vandalism targeting the railway system. The acute shortage of spare parts for repair was one of the main problems, Kam added.Some damaged stations that reopened the next day were limited to providing only minimal services, Kam pointed out. For example, only two of the six ticket machines at a station were operational on one of those stations. Sometimes, parts were removed from another intact station to be used to repair another station that was seriously damaged.Radical protesters had smashed the turnstiles and ticket machines, wrecked surveillance cameras and fire fighting equipment in various stations, and harassed MTR staff. On Sept 8, they set fire at the exit F of the Central station in the city's business center.In addition to the damage repair work, MTR also faces another pressing problem posed by some protesters who were seen jumping over the turnstiles to avoid paying fares.Kam said they would set up a contingent of some 200 security guards to enforce the Mass Transit Railway By-laws. Violators of the by-laws in fare evasion or breaking the facilities will face punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment.The police would step in to maintain security in the stations when MTR deemed it necessary in situations that endanger the safety of the passengers and trains, Kam added.The MTR had recorded a decrease in passenger traffic in recent months, according to Kam. The main reason, he believed, was that many people have cut back on going out to shop and dine in their leisure time because of the frequent demonstrations and violent clashes across the city in the past weekends.

                Riotous protesters wreaked havoc on the streets of Hong Kong for the 14th consecutive weekend, again targeting MTR stations, including Central Station in the heart of Hong Kong Island, where fires were started at several entrances and windows smashed.The protests on Saturday and Sunday came despite Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's announcement earlier in the week that the extradition law amendment bill, which has sparked more than three months of oftentimes violent demonstrations, will be withdrawn — one of the protesters' main demands.Rioters turned the prime Central business district into a battlefield on Sunday, starting multiple fires on the streets and at various MTR station entrances with cardboards and barricades, and smashing windows with metal rods. Plumes of smoke were seen engulfing an exit at Central MTR station, blocking all traffic in the vicinity.Protesters also wrecked the station with bricks pried from street pavements, sprayed offensive graffiti on its exterior, and blocked some of its exits with piles of trash.Pedestrians were caught in violent clashes between radical mobs and police. One man was beaten up, his heading bleeding, after he collided with fleeing protesters, who also terrorized passersby for videotaping their acts of violence.Violence also erupted inside metro stations as rioters destroyed facilities and provoked clashes with riot police by swearing at them. As of 10:30pm on Sunday, Central and Wan Chai MTR stations on Hong Kong Island, as well Prince Edward and Mong Kok stations in Kowloon, were forced to close. Protesters also descended on the busy shopping district of Causeway Bay, where police fired volleys of tear gas to disperse them. Several arrests were made.MTR Corp, which operates the city's railway system, strongly condemned the indiscriminate vandalism at metro stations, saying the protesters' behavior had threatened the safety of passengers and MTR staff.In a statement issued on Sunday night, the company said one of its employees was injured after being struck by a hard object hurled by protesters.Earlier, masked, black-clad protesters had marched from an authorized rally at Charter Garden in Central to the US Consulate, calling on the United States to "intervene in the crisis".Mobs also gathered outside Mong Kok Police Station on Sunday evening, pointing laser beams at the building and chanting anti-police slogans.As of 11 pm, the police had conducted three operations to disperse the protesters. Online footage shows police arresting several rioters during the operation, although it's not known how many people were arrested.On Saturday, violence again erupted in various areas of Kowloon and the New Territories. Crowds of rioters besieged Tung Chung MTR Station and vandalized ticket vending machines, while others attacked police officers inside a Sha Tin mall, started fires and blocked off roads in Mong Kok.MTR Corp issued an open letter on Sunday, saying it's facing its most serious challenge in its 40 years of operation.It urged people from all walks of life to cherish and protect the railway network which, it said, has been part of the collective memories of Hong Kong people for decades.On Wednesday, Lam formally withdrew the extradition bill to "allay public concerns and provide a basis for dialogue" in a city that has been embroiled in months-long unrest and in dire need of reconciliation.The chief executive also appointed two new members to the city's police watchdog body, the Independent Police Complaints Council, and pledged to start a direct dialogue with all sectors across the political spectrum, and an independent review of the city's deep-rooted problems.

                The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government condemned the illegal behavior of radical protesters, saying vandalism, as seen on Sunday, must end immediately.In a statement issued Sunday night, a Hong Kong SAR government spokesman said the radical protesters’ illegal acts deprive the rights of other members of the public to use the MTR, the railway and metro system in the city.Riotous protesters wreaked havoc on the streets of Hong Kong, again targeting MTR stations, including Central Station in the heart of Hong Kong Island, where fires were started at several entrances and windows smashed.The protests on Saturday and Sunday came despite Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's announcement earlier in the week that the extradition law amendment bill, which has sparked more than three months of oftentimes violent demonstrations, will be withdrawn — one of the protesters' main demands.Rioters turned the prime Central business district into a battlefield on Sunday, starting multiple fires on the streets and at various MTR station entrances with cardboards and barricades, and smashing windows with metal rods.

                    Hong Kong police arrest 157 people over violence since Friday

            <p class="style-content">
                HONG KONG - The Hong Kong police said on Monday that a total of 157 people had been arrested for violent acts in different parts of Hong Kong from Friday to early Monday.During the past three days, some radical protesters, in disregard of the court's injunction for the Hong Kong International Airport, tried to storm the airport and paralyze the traffic around the airport.Some violent protesters vandalized Mass Transit Railway (MTR) stations, smashing windows and damaging facilities. Some of them erected barricades and set fires on roads.These acts clearly ran against the interests of the general public, and the police would continue maintaining public order and security and bringing the law breakers to justice, Chief Superintendent Tse Chun-chung of the Police Public Relations Branch (PPRB) told a media briefing.Senior Superintendent Kong Wing-cheung of PPRB said the police had arrested 125 males and 32 females, aged between 14 and 63, during the three days.Their offenses include criminal damage, possession of offensive weapons, assaulting police, contempt of court and unlawful assemblies. Six of them have been charged and have appeared in court.Deputy Chief Fire Officer (Headquarters) Chan Derek Armstrong of the Fire Services Department said his department received 23 fire reports related to the public gatherings from Friday to Sunday, including the intense fire set by protesters near one exit of the Central MTR station on Sunday.He pointed out that arson is becoming an increasingly serious problem in Hong Kong and expressed the Fire Sevices Department's condemnation of the acts that seriously affected the public safety and properties.

            <p class="style-content">
                The people of Hong Kong watched in disbelief over the weekend when rioting protesters went on a rampage of arson, vandalism and violence in the heart of their city.But posts exposing these senseless acts were glaringly absent on social media.Instead, there was an upsurge in the number of robot accounts, which kept churning out biased information about the true state of affairs in Hong Kong.When social media focuses exclusively on finding fault with police conduct, rioters are emboldened to escalate their acts of violence.

                Protestors in Hong Kong targeted the city's metro system on Sunday, going on an arson spree in the Wan Chai district.The mobs resorted to this vandalism a week ago by setting ablaze a Central MTR station exit and causing extensive damage to numerous MTR stations.Repairs for the damage stood at HK$10 million. In the past two weeks alone, about 90 stations were vandalized.Senior government officials and MTR management condemned the attack on the city's metro system that serves millions of people on a daily basis.

                Parties, medical professionals call for peace, help in restoring law and order The riotous protesters have drawn widespread condemnation, including from the political parties, in Hong Kong following the weekend turmoil that saw incidents of violence and arson. About 600 medical professionals, in a jointly signed letter in some local newspapers on Monday, called on the medical sector and the people of Hong Kong to save the city from the "critical illness" of chaos and violence, and help the police force in restoring law and order. They refused to be misrepresented after some doctors and nurses urged the government to concede to some of the demands of the radicals, including a blanket amnesty for those arrested in connection with the monthslong unrest. They said the police force has been demonized amid the escalating violence.  Sweepers clean up the mess created by radical protesters in Admiralty, Hong Kong, on Monday. The glass facades of a public elevator were shattered by protesters on Sunday. China DailyStressing that the society should not tolerate any violent acts that disrupt law and order, the New People's Party on Sunday called on the authorities to introduce an anti-mask legislation at the earliest to contain the unrest. The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, the city's largest political party in the legislature, said in a statement on Sunday night that it urges all residents to immediately draw a clear line against violence and to not tolerate such extremely violent acts. To break the current political impasse, the party hopes the people of Hong Kong can join the government's efforts in solving the city's deep-rooted problems through dialogue. The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, the city's largest labor group, deplored the rioters' outrageous acts that have defied law and spread hatred among society. It appealed to all the sectors to unite and bring order and peace in Hong Kong soon. On Sunday afternoon, an illegal assembly turned violent, with radical protesters attacking police officers with gasoline bombs and other weapons, setting fires at multiple locations, and attacking residents and reporters. At least three residents were assaulted by radicals for voicing different opinions, Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of the Hong Kong police's public relations branch, told a news conference on Monday. The radicals have been increasingly resorting to violence in the weekend protests, Tse said. A total of 89 people were arrested from Friday to Sunday, taking the overall arrests to 1,453 since the unrest began in June, according to the police. Unlike the usual tidiness and orderliness, the city's Admiralty and Wan Chai were in a state of disarray on Monday morning after mobs went on the rampage on Sunday. Glass facades of an elevator were shattered, water barricades set on fire, bus stop signboards tossed around randomly and bricks plucked out from pavements lay scattered on the sidewalks. Trash bins were emptied and waste was strewn all around. The city's subway operator MTR strongly condemned the malicious acts in a statement issued on Sunday night after some mobs wreaked havoc at a number of MTR stations, with the Admiralty, Wan Chai and Causeway Bay stations suffering the most. The recurrence of violence and vandalism at the MTR stations not only affected passengers' commutes, but also endangered the safety of passengers and the MTR staff, the statement read.
