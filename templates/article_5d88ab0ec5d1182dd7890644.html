                CHONGQING - Police in Southwest China's Chongqing municipality have seized 69 suspects in a cross-border telecom fraud case involving nearly 10 million yuan ($1.4 million).In July, a victim surnamed Yang reported to the police that she received a phone call where the caller claimed to be with the customer service of Taobao, Alibaba's e-commerce platform, saying that Yang was entitled to double compensation as the diapers she purchased online had quality problems.Yang then added the caller on China's social media platform WeChat and scanned a QR code as required. The victim then found that more than 3,000 yuan was deducted from her account.A similar case was reported on Aug 3, when a victim surnamed Long said she received a call from someone claiming to be with Taobao customer service. Using the same explanation they gave Yang, Long was required to fill in his ID card information and mobile number on a website, and then he found 17,592 yuan was deducted from his bank card.After investigation, police found a scam gang located in the northern part of Myanmar and arrested the suspects with the help of Myanmar police.Police said an initial investigation has shown that almost all the suspects were from the city of Longyan in eastern China's Fujian province, and some of the scammers were relatives.Since June, the gang leader surnamed Lin has invited more than 60 people to cross into Myanmar from the border province of Yunnan to engage in telecom fraud.According to the police, there are more than 1,000 victims from 20 provinces, regions and cities involved in the case.The suspects have been put under criminal detention, and further investigation is underway.

                    Major corn producing areas safe from army worms
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China has successfully defended its key corn-producing areas against the invasion of fall army worms, a destructive pest that has spread to 25 provincial-level regions since its first sighting in January, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said on Tuesday.The pest, which predominantly damages corn but also poses threats to sugar cane and sorghum, has infested more than 1 million hectares of farmland in China. About 80 percent of the affected fields are located in Southwest China, including Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, and Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, said Pan Wenbo, an official with the ministry."The worm did not reach the northeastern regions, the country's top corn growing area," he said."In affected areas, reductions in yield are contained under 5 percent. This means total grain production during this autumn won't be disrupted by the newly arrived pest."Despite progress in safeguarding the country's crops against fall army worms this year, Pan warned that its spread will become "normal" in the country."Agricultural experts have concluded that fall army worms can survive the winter and breed in southern parts of China, especially the subtropical areas," he said. "And new pests might migrate from neighboring countries during early spring."China plans to intensify its prevention and control efforts against the pest by deploying more monitoring devices and incorporating smart and big data technologies in the future, according to Zhu Enlin, an official with the ministry."We will also step up cooperation with Myanmar, Vietnam and other neighboring countries to minimize risks of the pest migrating from overseas," he said.The fall army worm, native to tropical and subtropical areas in North and South America, was first discovered in Yunnan province in early January and spread fast across the country's corn fields in the southern and southwestern regions.To curb its spread, the Ministry of Finance has allocated 500 million yuan ($72 million) while local finance authorities have allocated 360 million yuan.The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has also dispatched more than 40 groups of technical experts to carry out on-site inspections and provide guidance to farmers.
