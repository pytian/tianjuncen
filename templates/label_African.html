In recent decades, Africa has witnessed far-reaching changes, and has seen one of the fastest rates of economic development globally, meaning there are now different requirements for aid from China, Wang added

As a result of an emphasis on industrialization as the potential key driver of Africa's development at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Johannesburg Summit in 2015, it has become a major area of focus for policymakers, implementers and thought leaders in Africa. For instance, it is doubtful that industrialization projects would take off in countries beset by policy and political challenges unless nudged by others outside the continent

                            Ladies and Gentlemen,Dear Friends,Faced with the profound changes in the global economy, should we, the Asia-Pacific economies, lead reform and innovation, or just hesitate and proceed haltingly? Should we steer economic globalization, or dither and stall in the face of challenge? Should we jointly advance regional cooperation, or go our separate ways?This is my answer: We must advance with the trend of times, live up to our responsibility and work together to deliver a bright future of development and prosperity for the Asia-Pacific.As China works hard to pursue innovation and higher quality of growth, new forms of business will keep emerging, more innovations will be used, and development of various regions in China will become more balanced.Fourth, we should continue to make economic development more inclusive and deliver its benefits to our people

                             Africa is also likely to benefit from China's newly created China International Development Cooperation Agency, which is designed to coordinate China's foreign aid program. Both initiatives have enabled Chinese investment and loans in Africa to give priority to development projects and, through Chinese loans, have for the first time enabled African governments to turn the continent's resources advantage into a development advantage. Since Africa is yet to climb the value chain of mineral processing and manufacturing, the assistance in building up local capacity could have a much greater impact on developing skills in African economies if it were closely aligned with African economic potential and priority sectors, such as manufacturing

                             Four things are required to advance Africa's industrialization in a coordinated way: First, China should concentrate its investment in countries and regions with better conditions. So if China is going to really help African countries, it needs to help them find the path of industrialization, support manufacturing capacity which suits the different development stages of African countries and attach great importance to the relationship between the transformation of China's manufacturing industry and Africa's industrialization needs. The last round of large-scale investment was in infrastructure construction in Africa, which did not directly bring self-development to Africa, but laid a good foundation for the development of the manufacturing industry with ports, airports, other transportation networks and energy supplies

He said low investment in agricultural research and development in Africa has resulted a huge domestic resource gap in generating agricultural investments, weakening the continent's chances of reducing the number of undernourished people by 2030. "The African Union should consider establishing a continental agricultural research and development facility which will lobby foreign investment on behalf of African farmers and producers and also assist in exploiting and enhancing Africa's sustainable agricultural potential," he said
