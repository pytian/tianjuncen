                Brand USA turns to China’s 'Dolphin Princess' Jane Zhang to help stem decline in Chinese visitorsThe number of Chinese visiting the US has dropped during the current trade dispute between the two countries, so the destination marketing organization for the US is turning to a Chinese pop star in hopes of reversing it.Jane Zhang, who is known as the "Dolphin Princess'' for her high vocal register, will lead Brand USA's biggest-ever campaign on the Weibo social network next month. She has been filming the campaign, which will be called "Feel the USA", in Las Vegas, New York and San Francisco, the organization said.Brand USA hopes the move will lead some of her 42 million Weibo followers to visit after a year marked by falling Chinese tourist numbers that have affected US hotels, retailers, travel agencies and other businesses."(It is) the biggest consumer initiative we've had with Sina Weibo since we began working together five years ago," marketing chief Tom Garzilli said in a statement. Brand USA declined to say how much it was investing in the campaign.Brand USA isn't alone in turning to social media in China.US hotels, retailers, tour operators and others have been expanding marketing to Weibo and WeChat, commonly referred to as "Chinese Twitter".For the past 15 years, the number of Chinese tourists to the US has grown steadily because of a stronger Chinese economy and better relations between the countries.But in 2018, about 3 million tourists traveled from China to the US, according to US Commerce Department data, a decline of 5.7 percent from a year earlier, compared with a 4 percent gain in 2017, and a 15 percent increase in 2016.The number of Chinese tourists declined another 3 percent in the first six months of 2019 as a stronger US dollar, the trade conflict and government warnings on gun violence discouraged travelers, tourist officials said.On June 4,the Chinese government issued an alert for Chinese tourists traveling to the United States, citing "shootings, robberies and theft" that have occurred "frequently". The warning came amid the trade dispute and tougher immigration enforcement by the Trump administration."Chinese tourism is a big prize in global trade. ... On this front, the US has more to lose than China," Robin Winkler, foreign-exchange strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note in June. The trade war "would likely take a severe dent to household income growth to squash the new middle class's appetite for passports and foreign travel. A weaker exchange rate could make foreign travel somewhat less affordable", Winkler added.Despite the drop-off in 2018, Chinese tourists remained the biggest spenders of all international travelers to the US, laying out $36.4 billion last year, according to Commerce Department data.Many American retailers rely on high-spending tourists, and on Wednesday, Tiffany & Co, the New York-based luxury jeweler, reported that its second-quarter profit and sales fell as it dealt with continued weak spending by Chinese tourists and other international travelers.The strong dollar has made jewelry from Tiffany more expensive for Chinese tourists visiting the US; the intensifying trade war between the US and China also has been a strain on business. Quarterly results also were affected by street protests in Hong Kong, Tiffany's fourth-largest market, the company said.CEO Alessandro Bogliolo told Reuters that while spending outside of China was down, sales on the Chinese mainland were robust.In 2018, Washington welcomed 1.9 million overseas visitors, down 5.3 percent from 2017, but the number of visitors to the nation's capital from China, its top overseas market, decreased 25 percent to 226,000, according to Destination DC."The data shows that Chinese visitation is down in the US overall, especially when it comes to vacation and first-time visitors, which DC tends to see a bigger share of," Elliott Ferguson, president and CEO of Destination DC, told China Daily."There are bright spots in the China market, however, with length of stay up 27 percent and room nights up 72 percent, so it's more important than ever to maintain our strong market presence,'' he said, including leveraging in-market representation in China.The decline in Chinese tourists has been particularly felt by gateway cities and states and sites that have been popular with Chinese tourists.In Hawaii, the number of Chinese tourists dropped by more than 23 percent in the first four months of 2019, compared with the same time period last year, according to the islands' tourism office. Hawaii's officials said Chinese travel declined in 2019, partially because Hawaiian Airlines in October discontinued its nonstop flights between Beijing and Honolulu.In Arizona, home of the Grand Canyon, the state's Office of Tourism estimated the number of Chinese visitors declined 3.7 percent in 2018, after nearly quadrupling from 2010 to 2017.Chinese tourism to Los Angeles — one of the most popular destinations — grew 7 percent, hitting a record 1.2 million visitors last year. This year, it's forecast to grow 6 percent.San Francisco Travel, a tourism industry-funded organization, said it will spend about 10 percent to 15 percent more on marketing the city's attractions, such as the Golden Gate Bridge, in China this year, marketing chief Howard Pickett said.Nancy Kong in New York, The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this story.

                    Concerns grow about seafloor mining
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Whether companies should be allowed to mine the seafloor is a question gaining traction as the International Seabed Authority debates the drafting of a code that could eventually lead to such commercial mining. The first phase of the code is expected to be finalized sometime next year. But scientists, environmentalists and other concerned parties are arguing for a moratorium so more research can be carried out on the full impact of deep-sea mining. The 168-nation International Seabed Authority says it is an autonomous international organization established under the United Nations' Convention on the Law of the Sea, and that its aim is to organize, regulate and control all mineral-related activities in international waters. For many years, the debate surrounding deep-sea mining was academic, since companies doubted that mining at depths in excess of 3,000 meters could be economical. However, improved technology has changed that. Impetus for deep-sea mining has been growing in recent years as the global demand for copper, cobalt, nickel, silver, manganese and rare earths and specialty metals increases, driven by the growth of renewable energy technologies. A number of these metals are used in rechargeable batteries, solar photovoltaic generators and wind power plants. This combination of perceived economic viability and technological feasibility has spurred a surge of interest - by countries as well as private companies - in exploring the ocean floors for mineral resources. There is widespread concern, however, about the impact that seabed mining would have on the ecosystems and habitats of the deep, and how the practice could be managed. The practice is still at an early stage. Consequently, the nature and extent of its impacts on deep-sea ecosystems remain unknown. But existing information has led scientists to warn that biodiversity loss would be inevitable and likely irreversible. If seabed mining were permitted, the activity could directly affect tens of thousands of square kilometers of seabed in abyssal plain areas and potentially release toxic chemicals and vast plumes of sediment. Even if the International Seabed Authority reaches an agreement, it could take years or even decades to become law. The authority has granted 29 exploration contracts covering more than 1.3 million square kilometers of seabed in the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic oceans. Some of the contracts are due to expire in 2021. Scientists say more assessments must be done that bring together science, conservation, industry and regulators to help write and evaluate the rules for extractive industries before mining takes off. The destructive potential extends beyond the loss of species, according to a recent editorial in the science journal Nature. It said the use of tractor-sized machines, each weighing around 300 metric tons, could release carbon locked up in deep-sea sediment into the atmosphere, worsening climate change. Craig Smith, an oceanographer at the University of Hawaii, has speculated that seabed mining "will probably have the largest footprint of any single human activity on the planet". As Smith and others point out, scientific knowledge of the seafloor is scant. Mining the ocean floor is seen as the last frontier. In the 1970s, oil and natural gas companies moved offshore. The frozen continent of Antarctica is known to house rich deposits of minerals such as iron ore. But following the signing of the Protocol on Environmental Protection (the Madrid Protocol) in 1991, that agreement came into force in January 1998, banning mining in Antarctica indefinitely. Deep sea oil and gas production has not been without its challenges or disasters. The Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion in 2010 is perhaps the best known. The oil well was about 1,500 meters below the rig when the explosion occurred, killing 11 workers. It took 87 days to cap the well, but in that time 3.19 million barrels of oil had leaked into the Gulf of Mexico and washed up along the Louisiana coastline 42 km away, creating an economic and environmental catastrophe. The International Seabed Authority says it has the right to set the rules, since it is a transparent public forum of consensus-building by the international community and in compliance with international law. But the question is whether we really need to have the seabed ripped open by mining in the first place. The author is a China Daily correspondent based in Sydney.

                    Breaking the waves at the beach
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                  Whether bronzing at the beach or sipping poolside cocktails, look to the iconic beach belles and beaus of the 1950s and '60s for timeless examples of elegant shoreside attire.It's fairly indisputable – French screen siren Brigitte Bardot is the pinnacle of boho beach chic. She paired her signature wide-brimmed floppy hat with striking bikinis, blonde beach locks and kohl eyeliner for an effortlessly cool look. Her beach style was epitomised in the 1962 film A Very Private Affair; the St Tropez style launched the two-piece as an iconic swimwear garment that endures to this day. In the same year, Sue Lyon controversially wore a patterned bikini and a wide-brimmed hat in Stanley Kubrick's Lolita, creating an innocent and playful beachwear look.For a more pristine look, style icon Grace Kelly was always a portrait of elegance. She wore white bikinis, and even a leopard-print bathing suit. The one-piece was a favourite of 1950s stylistas from Sophia Loren to Elizabeth Taylor; the latter paired hers with striking red lipstick. Marilyn Monroe famously posed in a flattering white swimsuit, as a sweetheart neckline one-piece in various hues became her favourite splash. Movie star and synchronised swimming icon Esther Williams glided across the screen in desirable swimsuits during her 1950s blockbusters, even launching a swimwear brand that offers women the chance to emulate her beach attire and continues to this day.Sandra Dee's role in 1959 comedy Gidget saw her in cute red swimsuits and orange two-pieces, paired with her sporty blonde ponytail. In 1967 romance Two for the Road, Audrey Hepburn wears cotton shirting over her swimsuits, as well as red-and-white tops layered over red swimwear. In 1958 drama Bonjour Tristesse, Jean Seberg dons an oversized denim shirt over her swimwear, showing an effortless stylish choice for those not keen on a kaftan.The aptly named 1969 film La Piscine (The Swimming Pool) sees French actress and trendsetter Jane Birkin donning a white bikini alongside the smouldering menswear style icon Alain Delon. The 1960s sex symbol was famed for his sharp tailoring, while on the beach he looked to well-fitted shorts in white, which showed off his fashionable tan.The 1959 drama From Here to Eternity sees Montgomery Clift wear classic hibiscus-print shorts paired with Cuban-collar shirts in the Hawaii-set film. Set in the late 1950s, the 1999 film The Talented Mr Ripley soaks up the sublime surroundings of Italy; Jude Law's wardrobe is full of refined menswear options as he strolls from the beach to town. The film's Riviera-style resort wear ranges from patterned shorts matched with open-neck white shirts to white linen trousers rolled up at the ankles with cream-coloured short-sleeved shirts.More than 50 years on, these icons of cinema remain the epitome of beach style.

                    Annual forum puts heat on Australia
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Leaders of Pacific countries are eager to address the single dominating topic of their meeting in Tuvalu for the annual Pacific Islands Forum this week: climate change.With a population of 11,000, the tiny nation of Tuvalu is one of the least developed nations in the world. It is made up of nine atolls that are fast being eroded by rising sea levels."This region faces issues vital to our future. Our leadership role is crucial to navigate the impacts of climate change for the Blue Pacific and for the planet," said Pacific Islands Forum Secretary-General Meg Taylor in a tweet ahead of the forum, which runs from Aug 13-16."Our destiny is at stake now."Earlier this year, Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, toured the Pacific to get a firsthand look at how climate change is affecting the lives of ordinary people ahead of the Climate Action Summit in September.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is expected to receive a cool reception by Pacific island leaders this week.Australia has come under fire from several Pacific countries for its stand on climate change and its refusal to end its support for fossil fuels.Michael O'Keefe, director of the international relations development at La Trobe University in Melbourne, said Morrison will likely try to avoid the climate change issue and focus on security instead. "I don't think that will wash with the Pacific leaders who want to see real action by Australia on climate change and not just empty words," he said."For those Pacific nations, climate change is real. It is impacting on their day-to-day lives and threatens their very survival."Patrick Pringle, a research associate with Climate Analytics, a nonprofit climate science and policy institute in Berlin, noted that climate change is already having an impact on the Pacific islands.Atoll countries like Tuvalu, Tokelau (located halfway between New Zealand and Hawaii), the Marshall Islands (between the Philippines and Hawaii) and Kiribati (in Micronesian islands) are all highly exposed to sea level rises," said Pringle.Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said he expects stronger action from Australia, including phasing out coal-fired power generation. "I appeal to Australia to do everything possible to achieve a rapid transition from coal to energy sources that do not contribute to climate change," he said ahead of the forum on Monday."We face an existential threat that you don't face and challenges we expect your governments and people to more fully appreciate."Raijeli Nicole, regional director of Oxfam in the Pacific, said: "The climate crisis is a matter of survival for our most vulnerable nations (in the Pacific). Right now, Australia's rising pollution and burgeoning fossil fuel exports are undermining our future."She said the human toll and grave injustice of the climate crisis is clear for all to see in Tuvalu.It is not only people's homes, food and water that are at stake. Put simply, Tuvalu's very existence is threatened by the climate crisis.

                Hollywood A-lister teams up with fellow Fast and Furious star for new franchise, Xu Haoyu reports.After the eighth installment of the Fast and the Furious franchise raked in 1.3 billion yuan ($184 million) at the Chinese box office in just three days last year, Universal Pictures decided to launch a spinoff to tap into the original series' runaway success.Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs &Shaw centers around the duo of Luke Hobbs, an agent of the US Diplomatic Security Service (Dwayne Johnson), and Deckard Shaw, a former elite British military operative (Jason Statham), and the one thing they have in common: family.In the film, the quarreling two are forced to team up to stop terrorist Brixton (Idris Elba) from gaining control of a biological weapon that could change the fate of humanity and rescue Shaw's sister (Vanessa Kirby), an MI6 agent who had to inject herself with the virus during a special mission.Hobbs and Shaw have been trying to take each other down with verbal insults and body blows ever since they first met in the seventh Fast and Furious outing."You know we hated each other," Johnson jokes at a news conference in Beijing."Still do," retorts Statham.

                A documentary, dedicated to the 70th anniversary of New China, follows three US TV hosts as they visit nine far-flung villages, Xu Fan reports.Chris Bashinelli, a television host from New York, recently caught a glimpse of life in rural China through a Chinese documentary.During his journey to Niujiaoshan, a village of more than 1,300 people in the mountainous region of Hunan province in Central China, he was "assigned" to pick leaves from tea plants. Joining him there were the mostly female villagers, where the best pickers among them often earn up to 500 yuan ($70.9) a day. Bashinelli received 10 yuan after an exhausting day of work. But despite the somewhat frustratingly low payment, he had a wonderful stay in the village, which is a tourist attraction and home to more than 300 ethnic Miao families.Taking part in a series of activities from attending a local wedding to learning about Miao jewelry, Bashinelli, 32, had the chance to see how people in rural China are striving for a better life.His tour featured in one episode of Homestay China, a three-part documentary that has been running on Chinese streaming platform Youku since July 1. Translated into 43 languages, the program has also been broadcast on the National Geographic Channel since July 13. The documentary's trailers have been released on several overseas streaming platforms such as You-Tube, and were watched more than 500,000 times across Asia, North America, Europe and Africa, according to the producers.
