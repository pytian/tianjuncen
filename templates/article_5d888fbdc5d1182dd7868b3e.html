            </p>
            <p>
                A torch relay for the upcoming 7th International Military Sports Council Military World Games began on Thursday in Nanchang, Jiangxi province. The flame was lit at a ceremony on Thursday morning in front of a sculpture of Communist Party of China revolutionaries inside the Nanchang August 1st Memorial Hall. Fang Minglu, the great-granddaughter of Fang Zhimin, a revolutionary martyr, lit the torch with a concave mirror using the sun's rays. Later, she passed the flame to a PLA soldier who transferred it to a carrier.

                PLA pushes protection, peace agenda
            </a>
            <p>
                Defense minister: Underestimating army's resolve 'extremely dangerous'Underestimating the People's Liberation Army's resolve to safeguard China's sovereignty, security and development interests is "extremely dangerous", Defense Minister General Wei Fenghe said on Tuesday.Wei, also a State Councilor, said the world today is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, with peace and development remaining overall trends, though destabilizing factors and uncertainties are mounting.China will continue to follow a path of peaceful development and adamantly uphold its national military policies, which are defensive in nature, he said at a reception at Beijing's Great Hall of the People on Tuesday night, two days before the 92nd anniversary of the founding of the PLA.Wei added China will never seek hegemony, expansion or spheres of influence, but the PLA will resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests."We have the confidence and capability to overcome all difficulties," he said."There is one China in the world, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China," he said. "China must be and will be reunified. No attempt to split China will succeed, and underestimating the PLA's resolve and will is extremely dangerous."At the same time, the PLA will deepen exchanges and cooperation with foreign militaries and actively participate in international and regional security affairs, aiming at making greater contributions to world peace and stability, he said.Wei said the PLA will undertake further reform and modernization to build a strong military that can fulfill the missions entrusted to it by the Communist Party of China and the people."Being able to fight and win is the basic requirement of the PLA," Wei said. "Improving combat capability is our sole and fundamental criterion. We shall develop combat capability through scientific and technological innovation, and conduct harder and stricter training so that the PLA will always be ready to fight and win when called upon."Historically, the contributions made by the PLA have enabled the Chinese people to "stand up, grow rich and become strong while promoting world peace and prosperity," Wei said.The PLA will carry forward the heroic legacy and fighting spirit from the revolutionary days, tighten discipline and strictly operate under the law so as to ensure highly centralized and unified management and maintain the safety and stability of the troops, he said.

                PLA Garrison in Hong Kong SAR marks 92nd anniversary of PLA founding
            </a>
            <p>
                HONG KONG - The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Garrison in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) hosted a reception on Wednesday to mark the 92nd anniversary of the PLA's founding.Major General Chen Daoxiang, commander of the PLA Garrison Commander, said that since the PLA Garrison was stationed in Hong Kong 22 years ago, it has been firmly implementing the principle of "one country, two systems," performing defense responsibilities in accordance with the law, firmly supporting the SAR government in governing according to the law, thus playing a significant role in maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.The series of violent incidents that happened in Hong Kong recently have severely damaged Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, severely challenged Hong Kong's rule of law and social order, seriously threatened the lives and properties of the Hong Kong people, and touched the bottom line of the principle of "one country, two systems," Chen said."This is absolutely intolerable and we strongly condemn these acts," he added.Chen said that the PLA Garrison firmly supports Hong Kong Police Force in strictly enforcing the law, and firmly supports the SAR government and the SAR Judiciary in meting out punishment to the violent criminals according to the law.Over the past 22 years, the Hong Kong Garrison has been dedicated to enhancing communication with the Hong Kong society and has received more than 780,000 Hong Kong citizens during the open days of its barracks. A total of 15 summer camps have also been organized by the Garrison for more than 4,300 young people in Hong Kong, according to the commander.Tung Chee-hwa, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam, Wang Zhimin, director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, and Xie Feng, commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in the HKSAR attended the reception.More than 400 guests from all walks of life, including major officials of the HKSAR government and Hong Kong deputies to the National People's Congress were present at the event.
