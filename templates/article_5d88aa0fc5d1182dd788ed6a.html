                Cuba rejects US expulsion of two diplomats as 'unjustified'
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                HAVANA - Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez on Thursday slammed the US expulsion of two Cuban diplomats in the United Nations as "unjustified."Earlier in the day, the US State Department required the imminent departure of the two diplomats who are members of Cuba's Permanent Mission to the UN, accusing them of having "attempts to conduct influence operations against the United States."However, it announced the expulsion over "abusing their privileges of residence" in a statement without providing further details. Meanwhile, the US State Department demanded travels of the members of Cuba's UN mission should "essentially be restricted to the island of Manhattan" in New York City, where the UN is headquartered.Writing on his Twitter account, Rodriguez said, "I reject categorically the unjustified expulsion of 2 officials of the Cuban Permanent Mission at the UN and the tightening of the restrictions of movement for the Cuban diplomats and its families."He also criticized the US allegation against the Cuban diplomats as a "vulgar slander" and the newly announced restrictions as aiming to provoke an escalation of bilateral diplomatic tensions.The US moves came as Cuba is seeking an end to a 57-year-old US economic blockade and trade embargoes against it at the 74th session of the UN general Assembly that opened Tuesday.In a 2018 report to the UN, Cuba said it has incurred losses worth over $933 billion as a result of the US sanctions.On Monday, Rodriguez tweeted that the US sanctions on oil shipments are causing a fuel shortage on the Caribbean island, which creates difficulties "affecting every Cuban family."

                    US betrays its disdain for sovereignty: China Daily editorial
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                 In an obvious show of displeasure with the Solomon Islands leadership's decision to switch diplomatic ties from Taipei to Beijing, US Vice-President Mike Pence has reportedly canceled his planned meeting with the Pacific island country's prime minister on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York — or later in Washington.The cancellation of the meeting, originally planned to discuss development partnerships, is just one of the "consequences" the Solomon Islands has to face for the switch, a US official was quoted by Reuters as saying.To even suggest a country has to pay a price, no matter how heavy or small, for choosing a diplomatic partner is malfeasance. To actually punish a country for doing so is violation of its sovereignty. And the Solomon Islands is no puppet state, whose strings the United States can pull at will. As an independent, sovereign state, it has as much right as any other country, big or small, to decide what best serves its national interests and make its own diplomatic decisions.The fact that the 27 lawmakers of the island country voted in favor of the switch, with six abstaining, on Monday shows an overwhelming majority of the people in that country support the diplomatic move — after all, the lawmakers are the representatives of the people.So far, all except 16 countries in the world have established diplomatic relations with Beijing. In 1979, the US itself severed official ties with Taipei before establishing diplomatic relations with Beijing.What Pence has done is not the first irrational move by the US administration. Perhaps the US believes that, by shifting their diplomatic ties from Taipei to Beijing, the countries are jeopardizing US interests. Last year, it recalled its top diplomats from three Latin American countries — the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Panama — after they cut off official ties with Taipei and established formal diplomatic relations with Beijing.For those in Washington who still live in the Cold War era and believe China's diplomatic gain equals the US' loss need a wake-up call. Perched atop their ivory tower, the way such people have treated the countries that in recent years have established diplomatic ties with Beijing belies the US' claim that it favors bilateral relationships based on mutual respect, fairness and sovereignty as much as it exposes the US' hegemonic practices in international affairs.China is the world's second-largest economy. That is more than enough reason for any country to have diplomatic relations with it. It is surprising the US does not understand this simple fact.

                    US expels two of Cuba's UN diplomats, citing 'influence operations'
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - The Trump administration on Thursday ordered the expulsion from the United States of two members of Cuba's delegation to the United Nations and restricted travel of the remaining mission members to Manhattan, drawing strong condemnation from Havana.In an announcement just days before world leaders gather for the annual UN General Assembly, the US State Department accused the two Cuban diplomats of trying to "conduct influence operations" harmful to US national security but did not elaborate on the accusations or release their names.It was the latest sign of deteriorating US relations with Cuba, since US President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, which has rolled back the detente initiated by his predecessor Barack Obama."The Department of State today notified the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the United States requires the imminent departure of two members of Cuba's Permanent Mission to the United Nations for abusing their privileges of residence," said Morgan Ortagus, the department spokesperson, in a statement."This is due to their attempts to conduct influence operations against the United States," the spokesperson added, without providing further details on the issue.Besides, the US required Cuba's UN mission's travel should "essentially be restricted to the island of Manhattan," according to the statement.Agencies-Xinhua
