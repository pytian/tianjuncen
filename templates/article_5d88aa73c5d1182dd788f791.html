                RCEP injects new impetus for global trade
            </p>
            <p>
                It is time for world to seize the opportunity The current proliferation of trade disputes is a serious challenge to globalization and the international trade order. The Sino-US trade war apart, trade tensions between Japan and the Republic of Korea are also escalating. Japan's recent move to remove the ROK from its fast-track trade "white list" has sparked further tit-for-tat responses, disrupting supply chains and adding to the clouds hanging over the global economy. Previously, the World Trade Organization Appellate Body was an effective mechanism for resolving trade disputes. Since its creation in 1995, it has settled over 400 disputes, preventing them from turning into political conflicts of the type we see today. However, the Appellate Body is now paralyzed because of the failure to appoint replacement judges. WTO reform is urgently needed but it cannot be achieved overnight. Fortunately, fresh impetus for global trade comes from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, the regional free trade agreement between 16 Asian countries that is under negotiation. The 2019 RCEP ministerial conference in Beijing from August 2 to 3 saw important progress toward this landmark FTA between the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China, Japan, the ROK, Australia, India and New Zealand. With a combined GDP of $21 trillion, the countries account for around 30 percent of the global economy. Once completed, the RCEP will cover a population of 3.5 billion and become the world's largest regional FTA. Some have raised fears that different regional FTAs may lead to a complex "noodle bowl effect" of different standards in Asia. In fact, the RCEP is complementary to the Comprehensive Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership. The CPTPP shares many similarities with the RCEP, and seven of the 16 RCEP members, namely Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam, are also CPTPP members. But the CPTPP has a lower entry criteria, while RCEP is more accessible to developing countries. Also, the RCEP framework has covered gaps in WTO rules, such as for the service trade, intellectual property rights, e-commerce and telecommunications services. These areas have great significance for the promotion of free trade in the modern economy. In the new era of globalization, the RCEP can be a way for developing countries to reach a higher degree of free trade and decrease the gap with developed countries. As a key player in the process of economic integration in the Asia-Pacific region, China should play an active role in realizing the RCEP's potential. First, China should promote proactive and pragmatic negotiating strategies with prospective members to help seal the agreement. After seven years of hard work, the recent ministerial meeting in Beijing has brought great hope. In his speech, China's Commerce Minister Zhong Shan called for all parties to achieve the goal of ending negotiations within this year. More than two-thirds of market access negotiations have been completed. Parties have agreed on more than 80 percent of the pact. However, concluding the deal is often the most difficult part. Frictions between Japan and the ROK may also complicate matters. Given this scenario, while respecting the leading position of ASEAN countries in the RCEP, China should continue to use its influence to push forward RCEP negotiations. Second, China should continue to deepen its reform and opening-up to ease some countries' fears that exports from China will harm their domestic markets under the RCEP. China should continue steps to demonstrate the huge potential its market holds for enterprises and investors from RCEP countries and encourage them to invest in China. China may overtake the United States as the world's largest consumer retail market as early as this year, presenting great opportunities for RCEP exporters. China's Foreign Investment Law, due to come into effect on Jan 1, will help provide a yet more attractive and convenient environment for foreign investors and entrepreneurs to do business in China. Third, China should carry out more exchanges with RCEP countries to build support for free trade. Industrial development and technological innovation cannot be achieved without market competition. During the WTO negotiation process, some voices in China feared that once the country lowered tariffs and opened its domestic market, State-owned enterprises and other domestic enterprises would be devastated. In reality, market competition forced Chinese enterprises to reform and raise their game, spurring the development of world-class enterprises such as Huawei, Alibaba and Xiaomi. In the new era of globalization, deeper regional integration can help deal with the multiple challenges stemming from anti-globalization sentiment and international trade disputes. As the largest regional FTA, finalizing the RCEP would be a key step in the process of economic integration in the Asia-Pacific region. No effort should be spared to complete the deal and seize the chance to create new growth opportunities and positive momentum for global trade.

                Washington's tactics risk reversing positive Korean Peninsula progress: China Daily editorial
            </a>
            <p>
                Every walk of life has its jargon and taboos. But as the top diplomat of the United States, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems incorrigible in speaking the diplomatic lingo while wagging his tongue as he likes.At the American Legion National Convention in the state of Indiana last week, Pompeo once again accused the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of rogue behavior. Prompting Pyongyang, to label him, not without reason, as a "diehard toxin", while claiming that the hopes for talks on the peninsula's denuclearization are fading.Although the US State Department reportedly said it remained interested in pursuing the talks, what Pompeo said has undoubtedly dented Pyongyang's belief in Washington's sincerity.The impromptu meeting of leaders of the two countries in the demilitarized zone between the DPRK and the Republic of Korea on June 30 raised high hopes that the working-level talks the two leaders agreed on, which have been stalled since their no-deal meeting in Hanoi, capital of Vietnam, in late February, would be restarted.Regretfully, despite a series of concrete measures the DPRK has taken to show its resolve on denuclearization, the meeting, apart from demonstrating the leaders' rapport, has not prompted the US to carry on the positive momentum to sustain the constructive atmosphere with any tangible and cooperative moves.That the DPRK has fired several short-range missiles recently, to protest against the US-ROK joint military exercises near its border, should be regarded as a restrained and compelled reaction. It is the military exercises and the inaction of the US that is gradually closing the window of opportunity for talks with the DPRK.That explains why State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to Pyongyang from Monday to Wednesday — the first visit by a senior Chinese official since President Xi Jinping's epoch-making state visit in June — has attracted so much attention.Apart from strengthening their already solid bilateral ties, it is hoped that Beijing can take the opportunity to help turn the worsening tide again before it is too late by further strengthening Pyongyang's confidence in denuclearization.But if the US administration is intent on playing fast and loose with the sensitive denuclearization talks, it is jeopardizing any fruitful progress.Turning a deaf ear to China's dual suspension suggestion, Washington's superstitious belief in the power of its "maximum pressure" tactics as being the art of a deal will not win it any advantages, but only push the Korean Peninsula situation back to where it was before Pyongyang and Washington started talking.

                Will Britain look East after Brexit?
            </a>
            <p>
                Editor's note: Whether British Prime Minister Boris Johnson succeed in overcoming Parliament's opposition and formalize the United Kingdom's divorce from the European Union on or before the Oct 31 deadline is anybody's guess. But how will the UK handle trade after it exits the EU and how will Brexit affect its trade ties with Asian economies? Two experts share their views on the issue with China Daily's Wang Kan. Excerpts follow:UK trying to maintain its overseas marketsThe British government began making arrangements for the post-Brexit era long ago. Britain signed a free trade agreement with the Republic of Korea on Aug 22, indicating it wants to strengthen its economic and trade ties with its Asian trade partner after it leaves the EU.Britain began negotiating a trade deal with the ROK to continue the bilateral preferential trade arrangement and avoid any negative impact of Brexit on its economy. The two sides reached a consensus on relevant principles in June.Thanks to the EU's trade framework, Britain enjoys preferential trade arrangements for about 40 items with more than 70 economies. Post-Brexit, the UK cannot avail of this preferential treatment, which would cost it dear in terms of exports and imports.That's why it started bilateral trade negotiations with other economies the moment it launched the Brexit process, and has inked 13 trade agreements with more than 38 economies.As for the ROK, it has its own considerations. Under the EU-ROK free trade agreement (FTA), many commodities from the ROK can enter the British market under the preferential tariff agreement.However, after the UK leaves the EU, higher tariffs could have been imposed on ROK exports to the UK. For instance, the tariff on ROK automobile exports to the UK could have increased from zero to 10 percent in the absence of a new UK-ROK trade deal.And after the EU and Japan signed an FTA, the pressure on the ROK to sign such deals with other economies has increased, especially since relations between Seoul and Tokyo have deteriorated. Therefore, the ROK needs to stabilize its exports to the UK so that when Brexit becomes a reality, the FTA would help the two sides to have preferential trade arrangements as before.Still, the UK would do good to also sign FTAs with more economies, Japan in particular.Ni Yueju, a researcher of Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social SciencesFTA with China in the worksAs the British economy is largely export-oriented, it is obvious that the UK-ROK free trade agreement is of great significance to Britain's economy, particularly because Britain could lose its global economic status after exiting the EU.Since Britain has to pay additional customs duties and can no longer freely export goods to EU member states after Brexit, the free trade deal with the ROK would help it to maintain one of its important overseas markets. Aside from the ROK, Britain has also signed FTAs with countries such as Chile and Switzerland, and is negotiating a free trade deal with China.The ROK's free trade deal with the UK can be seen as further opening up of the Asian market. The FTA with the ROK will help Britain to address some of the problems that Brexit is expected to create.The deal could also facilitate British automobile sales to the ROK. Besides, the UK-ROK free trade deal could be a precursor to such deals with other economies, especially China.Due to its reliance on exports, particularly on the EU market, the UK needs to take measures to sustain its export markets to cope with the negative effects of Brexit.The UK-ROK free trade deal, to a certain extent, could ease British exporters' pain, and arrest the slide of the pound sterling which is inching close to the US dollar in terms of value.Besides, it could enhance investor confidence and stabilize the job market in the UK.Li Gang, a researcher at the Institute of European Studies, Chinese Academy of Social SciencesThe views don't necessarily represent those of China Daily.

                ROK envoy holds phone talks with US counterpart on Korean Peninsula denuke
            </a>
            <p>
                SEOUL -- The nuclear envoy of the Republic of Korea (ROK) on Tuesday held phone talks with his US counterpart over the Korean Peninsula's denuclearization, according to ROK Foreign Ministry.Lee Do-hoon, ROK's special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, talked over phone with Stephen Biegun, US special representative for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) affairs.During the phone conversation, the nuclear envoys discussed recent situations on the peninsula and actual measures to completely denuclearize the peninsula and settle permanent peace, the ministry said.The two diplomats agreed to meet in the near future for further consultations.The phone talks came after the DPRK fired two unidentified projectiles into the eastern waters from its west inland area earlier in the day.It marked the DPRK's 10th test-firing this year and the latest launch was conducted on Aug 24 when the country fired what it called "super-large" multiple rocket launchers off the east coast.Choe Son-hui, the DPRK's first vice foreign minister, said in a statement that her country was willing to sit with the United States at an agreed-upon time and place in late September to comprehensively discuss issues the two sides had taken up, according to the Korean Central News Agency on Monday night.Biegun said during his visit to Seoul last month that the United States was ready to engage in working-level talks with the DPRK for the peninsula's denuclearization.

                ROK culls thousands of pigs after confirming African swine fever
            </a>
            <p>
                SEOUL - The Republic of Korea is culling thousands of pigs after confirming African swine fever at a farm near its northern border. Kim Hyun-soo, the ROK's agricultural minister, said the country's first case of the highly contagious disease was confirmed on Tuesday in tests on five pigs that died on Monday evening at the farm in the city of Paju. Officials were planning to complete by Tuesday the culling of nearly 4,000 pigs raised at the farm and two other farms run by the same family. No other case has been found yet within a 3-kilometer radius of the farm, which is 2.5 km away from a river that runs across the border with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Right after the confirmation, the ROK Agriculture Ministry raised the warning level to the highest, while issuing a 48-hour standstill order on all pig farms, slaughterhouses and feed factories across the country. The government also strengthened efforts to disinfect farms and transport vehicles. Under threat is a massive industry that involves 6,000 farms raising more than 11 million pigs. African swine fever has decimated pig herds in other Asian countries before reaching the Korean Peninsula. It is harmless to people but for pigs is highly contagious and fatal. There is no antidote or vaccine and the only known way to prevent the disease from spreading is a mass cull of affected livestock. Although this was the first confirmed outbreak of African swine fever in the ROK, the country has battled a number of animal diseases in the past. In 2014, outbreaks of avian flu in poultry farms resulted in the culling of more than 500,000 birds. A 2011 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease resulted in the culling of nearly 3.5 million cattle, pigs and other animals. "We will invest maximum effort to prevent the disease from spreading, ... we believe the first week (following the outbreak) would be most dangerous," considering incubation periods, the agricultural minister said during a news conference in Sejong City. "We will quickly complete monitoring inspections at the 6,300 farms (nationwide)... checking each pig to see whether it has fever or not and testing on even the slightest of symptoms," he said. ROK President Moon Jae-in called for fast and stern quarantine measures to prevent the disease from wreaking havoc on the pork industry, the presidential Blue House said. The outbreak in the ROK came despite months of heightened monitoring efforts at border area farms. Kim, the agricultural minister, said at the Paju farm, where the disease has been detected, the pigs were in a sealed indoor facility with no windows and is surrounded by fences to fend off wild boars. The farm's owner and four Nepalese workers said they hadn't recently traveled outside of the country, Kim said. The government had placed hundreds of fences and traps around border area farms to prevent pigs from being infected by wild boars. The ROK's military, which had monitored the movement of wild boars through heat sensors installed along the border, said it would be difficult for wild boars to cross over barbed wire fences in the mine-scattered border zone. But government officials have said the animals could possibly swim across rivers. "We haven't been able to immediately confirm the infection route of the disease," Kim said."We are trying to identify the cause as soon as possible because that would be crucial for preventing the disease from spreading."
