                Better energy utilization a pressing need
            </p>

                Country's August crude oil imports rose 9.9 percent to 42.17 million tonsChina will take key measures to increase capacity, tap more oil resources and establish better systems for the production, supply, storage and sale of natural gas in an effort to further enhance energy security, according to the country's top energy regulator."Due to the particular 'rich coal, meager oil and deficient gas' energy structure, China's crude oil production grew slower than consumption growth in recent years," said Zhang Jianhua, director of the National Energy Administration. "And China's oil import dependency continued to deepen over the years."Zhang made the remarks on Friday at a State Council Information Office news conference in Beijing.To help ensure the security of oil and gas supplies, more efforts are needed to increase investment in exploration and development of oil and gas resources, tackle key scientific and research problems, speed up construction of key production bases, deepen institutional reforms and offer supportive policies."We've already made some progress, and will endeavor to keep oil dependency at a reasonable level," Zhang added.China aims to increase its annual domestic crude oil output to 200 million metric tons by 2022. The output stood at 190 million tons in 2018, and is expected to hit 191 million tons this year.Retail prices of gasoline and diesel in China were higher on Thursday as international oil prices soared following attacks on a major oil-processing facility and oilfield in Saudi Arabia.Zhang said the attacks in Saudi Arabia will not affect China's oil supply."We won't gamble on depending on any particular country or region. And we always attach great importance to diversifying importing channels and we've worked well at that," Zhang noted.Lin Boqiang, director of Xiamen University's China Centre for Energy Economics Research, warned any rise in international oil prices means that Chinese consumers will have to pay a lot more, as China's refined oil prices are closely linked to international markets.A$1 rise in international oil prices would cost Chinese consumers an extra 3.5 billion yuan ($494 million) or so a year.China imported 42.17 million tons of crude oil in August, up 9.9 percent year-on-year.Lin said China needs to pay more attention to energy security."It is indeed a matter of national security and we should beef up efforts to reach the goal of energy independence which will definitely take a long time. We need to not only diversity import sources, but also look for alternatives to reduce oil dependency, such as encouraging people to take public transportation and purchase electric vehicles."

                Wife of police officer pleads for reconciliation
            </a>
            <p>
                The wife of a Hong Kong police officer appealed to a radical protester who shared his doubts about the violent protests online that it is never too late to end violence and choose the right path.She also said when the radical protesters are willing to forsake violence, the scars they caused to the society could be healed and mutual trust could be rebuilt.The appeal was written in an open letter posted on tweeter account @JakesKristal. The writer only identified herself as the wife of a Hong Kong police officer. She said the letter was a reply to remarks posted by a radical protester on Twitter saying he felt confused and even lost when he saw all the damages done to the city, the violent clashes with the police and the harassment of their families in the anti-government protests in the past three months.“When I saw the fire and the broken glass, I was confused and wondered whether that was what I wanted?” the protester wrote.What struck him even more was the realization that the policemen standing opposite him were also men of flesh and blood.“Am I really going to attack someone just because his political stance was against mine?” the protester asked rhetorically.The protester revealed that he was having a strained relationship with his family, who strongly objected to his participation in anti-government demonstrations. He had to go home after midnight every day to avoid his parents.In the open letter responding to the protester’s self confession, the wife of a police officer said she was glad that the protester has the courage to reflect on his own anti-social and violent behaviors.“I believe it is not too late for you to think things through because there is still hope of rebuilding and restoring order in Hong Kong,” she wrote.She called the radicals’ rampaging "inappropriate behavior by a group of lost children in pursuit of their own ideal.”She encouraged protesters to think more sensibly about their demands and whether these could be achieved through violence.More than 1,600 police officers and their family members have their personal data leaked online since early June, including information about some 70 children, according to the police. Some officers' families received death threats.Groups of radicals have repeatedly gathered at the disciplined services living quarters where some policd officers and their families live. They threw debris at the buildings and broke some windows on the lower floors.Several police officers’ wedding parties were disrupted by protesters in the past few months. The radicals chanted offensive slogans at the wedding parties and threw joss paper, burnt offerings for the deceased, as a curse outside the hotels where the weddings were held.

                HK govt and city's rail operator strongly condemn violence and vandalism
            </a>
            <p>
                A Hong Kong government spokesman strongly condemned radical protesters' violent and vandalistic acts in Tuen Mun and other districts on Saturday.Following the conclusion of a procession in Tuen Mun, New Territories, earlier on Saturday, the protesters carriedout violent and vandalistic acts in various places in the district.They blocked roads, set fires and hurled petrol bombs, endangering police officers and the public at the scene. They also vandalised Light Rail stops and placed objects on tracks, leading to the suspension of service and potentially affecting the safety of its operation.Some people assaulted a police officer and even attempted to take his revolver, while others trampled and burned a national flag, challenging the national sovereignty.After nightfall, the violence and vandalism spread to other districts, with some people blocking roads, setting fires and hurling petrol bombs in Yuen Long, New Territories, and besieging and attacking Mong Kok police station in Kowloon.In a statement issued Saturday night, the special administrative region government strongly condemned the violent and vandalistic acts.The police will take action against illegal activities to protect people's safety and restore public order, a spokesman said.MTR, the sole operator of the rail system in Hong Kong, in its statement issued Saturday night, also strongly condemned protesters for vandalizing Light Rail stops.Facilities at numerous Light Rail stops were destroyed while rail tracks and crossing lights were sabotaged.Such acts of vandalism posed a grave danger to commuters, the company said, adding it has reported the cases to police.The company appealed to members of the public to be considerate, and stop vandalising station facilities, harassing other people or affecting railway safety.MTR engineering personnel will check the damaged facilities to assess damages and the time required for recovery. If some of the facilities cannot be repaired in time, passengers may have to wait for a long time to use the facilities, the company said.

                Rioters should be held accountable to restore order in Hong Kong
            </a>
            <p>
                International conventions such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights explain what a "democratic society" is or should be. In general, a democratic society should be pluralistic and inclusive, and have space for different points of view, which should be expressed in a peaceful manner.Since Hong Kong's return to China in 1997, the "one country, two systems" principle has helped yield universally acknowledged positive results. "One country, two systems" allows Hong Kong people to govern the special administrative region and enjoy a high degree of autonomy. Which makes the SAR a democratic and rule-based society.However, the demonstrations that started in opposition to a bill to amend the SAR's extradition law soon became violent, taking a heavy toll on the city. It transformed into a seesaw battle between the police and the violent demonstrators, who resorted to gasoline petrol bombs and attacking police officers, undermining the rule of law in the city.The demonstrators even tried to break into the SAR Legislative Council building, wantonly damaging LegCo facilities. Worse, they defiled the national emblem and national flag..The insurrectionists even blocked Hong Kong International Airport, the city's subway and main traffic hubs, and vandalized public property, paralyzing normal activities. In other words, they held the city to ransom to fulfill their narrow political goals.Yet their criminal acts, which tantamount to terrorism, have been ignored by some Western media outlets and governments. Some in the West have even called the insurrectionists "pro-democracy fighters" when the truth is that the demonstrators have tarnished Hong Kong's image as "Asia's world city" and an international finance and logistics hub.It is ironical that the "pro-democracy" demonstrators claim to be protecting universal values despite doing exactly the opposite: violating the law, and trampling democracy, human rights and freedom.Claiming to be fighting for freedom of speech and human rights, the rioters have tried to stifle sane voices because they do not care for other people's human rights, especially if those people do not support their "cause of rioting".Some Western politicians and media outlets have been making irresponsible remarks glorifying the insurrectionists and supporting the violence in an attempt to whitewash the crimes of the violent demonstrators — and to further incite youths and heighten tensions. The real intention of these Western hypocrites is to cause chaos in the city and exploit the situation to check China's rise.Some Western politicians and media outlets have pointed an accusing the finger at the Hong Kong police, claiming they have abused their power. But their evil designs will never succeed, because there is a consensus among sensible people across the world that the Hong Kong police have exercised considerable restraint, which have even made them vulnerable to attacks.The situation in Hong Kong is serious, as some radical demonstrators have crossed the bottom line of the "one country, two systems" principle, which will have dire consequences.Rational, law-abiding Hong Kong residents have organized many rallies to oppose the violence. And it is such law-abiding residents that represent the public opinion in the SAR. The Hong Kong police and judiciary should not only be supported but also encouraged to take resolute measures and hold the rioters accountable so as to restore public order in the city.There are many lessons to be learned from the chaos in Hong Kong. But first, the SAR authorities have to put an end to the violence, which is necessary to build a platform for dialogue and implement institutional reforms to help the city recover and return to track of development.The author is a professor with the Institute for Human Rights at China University of Political Science and Law.

                China edges Brazil 3-2 for to extend winning streak at FIVB Women's World Cup
            </a>
            <p>
                SAPPORO - China survived a five-set thriller against Brazil at the FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup here on Sunday to extend its unbeaten record to six matches after a two-day break.Zhu Ting and Yuan Xinyue tied for a game-high 26 points for China's 25-23, 23-25, 22-25, 25-19, 15-9 victory in two hours and five minutes. Gabriela Braga Guimaraes, with 20 points, was the top scorer for a Brazil side that rested captain Fabiana Claudino."I think unity and concentration are the reasons we were able to win," captain Zhu told Xinhua after the match.China kept a slight advantage over Brazil in the opening minutes with strong performance from Yuan and Yan Ni, and forced the two-time Olympic champion to a timeout after establishing a 13-8 lead. Drussyla Costa then spearheaded Brazil's attacks while China was troubled by consecutive errors as the South American side closed the gap 19-20. Coach Lang Ping called a timeout as Brazil saved two set points to trail by 24-23 and Yuan finally converted China's third chance to claim the set 25-23.The second set saw both sides showcase their attacking prowess with Rio 2016 champions Zhang Changning and Zhu launching spikes while Gabi and Lorenne Geraldo Texieira opening fire for Brazil. The game was tied multiple times before Sheilla Castro De Paula Blassioli registered one spike and one block to seize the set point 24-22. Brazil gave one chance away on error but Gabi's spike powered the two-time Olympic champion to level the game 1-1.China sent on young spiker Li Yingying and put Zhang as middle blocker in the third set in which the tenacious defense of the Nations League runners-up made it hard for the Chinese attackers, especially Zhu. Yuan carried the flag for China instead, but a more balanced Brazil initiated a 6-1 run after 14-19 down to recover from early disadvantage and tied the game 20-20. The two sides traded points before 23-year-old Lorenne wrapped up the set 25-22 for Brazil with two aces in a row."It's a good chance for Li Yingying to learn in such a tough match and as a young player, she did well in reception even though being targeted by the opponent," coach Lang commented on the 19-year-old.The defending champion regained form in the fourth set as Zhu and Yuan took turns to smash Brazil's defense and granted China a five-point lead into the second technical timeout 16-11. China pressed further ahead and grabbed the set point 24-18 after a service error by Lorenne and eventually tied the match 2-2 in the fourth attempt.The four-time World Cup winner carried on the momentum into the decider where Yuan and Gong Xiangyu combined for five points to put China 8-5 ahead. Mara Ferreira Leao had five points in vain to see China clinch the victory 15-9 after Ana Beatriz Correa's spike was called out.After losing its first two sets in the tournament, China will face Nations League champion United States on Monday while Brazil will play against Dominican Republic in an all-South American clash."Their head coach was with me a long long time ago, and he started to be a coach with my daughters in my house, so he knows everything about me," Brazil coach Hose Roberto Guimaraes said of his Dominica Republic counterpart Marcos Kwiek, adding that the match tomorrow will be difficult.

                Escalating violence in SAR reveals Western media's ill intentions: China Daily editorial
            </a>
            <p>
                Violence has continued unabated in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region even as Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor is actively building a platform for dialogue in a bid to foster cohesiveness in society and find ways to bring the city back to the development track.That the demonstrators refuse to end the violence and some Western media outlets continue to ignore their unlawful acts shows there is more to the demonstrations than meets the eye.Although the numbers of demonstrators and riots have declined over the past few weeks, probably because of the public fury over the serious disruption of normal life and economic activities, the intensity of the violence has been on the rise.Recent weeks have seen a surge in gasoline bomb attacks on police officers. The situation worsened over the weekend when the radical demonstrators targeted police vehicles with more such bombs. Some even tried to snatch the service revolvers from the police officers.Yet law enforcement officers are not the only targets of the insurrectionists. On Sunday, the demonstrators again vandalized a subway station, smashing closed-circuit cameras and electronic sensors.Such has been the impact of the demonstrations and violence on residents' lives and livelihoods that the silent majority in the SAR has decided to speak out against the mayhem. Saying enough is enough, many among the silent majority are openly protesting against the demonstrators and their unlawful behaviors.The demonstrators' outrageous acts have been captured in photographs published in those local newspapers that still adhere to professional ethics and in news video clips posted online.Such visual evidence speaks louder than words about the crimes committed by the radical demonstrators. Which makes one wonder how some foreign media outlets, eschewing their conscience and journalistic ethics, could still publish biased news reports and commentaries claiming the rioters are fighting for "freedom" and "democracy" when they are doing exactly the opposite — by violating other Hong Kong residents' rights and freedom.On Friday, the Hong Kong Police Force briefed the foreign media about the grim situation they are facing and rebutted unfounded accusations against them.If some Western media outlets continue to disseminate their one-sided views even after this, they will only further expose their prejudice against China and "one country, two systems".Unfortunately, the fact is that the anti-China "ideology" is the underlying cause of the violent demonstrations, which some Western media outlets are encouraging to wreak havoc in the city and help the demonstrators seize the power to govern the Hong Kong SAR and thus curb China's rise.But if they believe they will succeed in their evil design, they are living in a fool's paradise.
