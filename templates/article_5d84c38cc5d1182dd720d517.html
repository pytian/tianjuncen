A cover story of The Economist said that "slowbalization" has become the new development mode of the world economy. Meanwhile, bilateral or regional relations of economies have become increasingly close. FTAs such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership have been reached. Therefore, reform is imperative for the WTO, which is the best representative of a multilateral trade system.

Logistics and infrastructure construction has been boosted and there is deeper production and supply chain integration.
