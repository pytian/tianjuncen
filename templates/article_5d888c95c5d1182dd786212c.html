                An assessment meeting on traditional Chinese culture open classes was held in the conference hall of the Ministry of Education on Wednesday. The activity, "Power of Inheritance" organized by China Youth Daily, and hosted by the Department of Physical Education, Sanitation and Art Education under the Ministry of Education, was aimed at promoting excellent traditional Chinese culture through physical and art education at school.The nation's education experts attended the meeting and reviewed some open classes.From April to June this year, the Ministry of Education collected excellent open classes on traditional Chinese culture from middle and primary schools, as well as colleges around the nation. There were 999 schools that handed in a total of 1,373 open class videos, covering music, fine art, traditional festivals, traditional sports items and intangible cultural heritage items. Some representative intangible cultural heritage inheritors walked onto the podiums, and the campus has become a major channel in passing on traditional Chinese culture.There were 32 works from 18 provinces or regions entering into the final which were presented on the assessment meeting. Experts shared their views on how to better promote Chinese culture through sports and arts courses on campus during the meeting.Yang Yu, one of the attendees from Sichuan Normal University, said that a teacher's passion for traditional culture determines the height and depth of his teaching design."I believe that, with such activity, and teachers devoted to Chinese culture, excellent traditional Chinese culture will surely be better inherited and innovated," Yang said.

                Between September 1949 and 1950, the Soviet Union sent two film production teams to China. And joining hands with staff from Beijing Film Studio, the crews shot three color documentaries to reflect different facets of New China.Recently, Jie Fang Le de Zhong Guo (Liberated China), a restored version of one of the three films -- spanning 88 minutes -- was screened at the China Film Archive in downtown Beijing, as part of the organization's events to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.In the documentary audience can see China's then urban landscape and the country's efforts to build a better life for Chinese people.Besides, the Archive has also teamed up with Comic Book Publishing House, the country's only state-owned publisher specializing in comic books, to publish an anthology of 10 comic books about 10 classic films, including director Huo Jianqi's Postmen in the Mountains.

                    10 films on real-life police stories planned

            <p class="style-content">
                A film franchise backed by Ministry of Public Security plans to make 10 films about nine police officers and a police detachment, a first- of-its-kind project for Chinese film industry.The project was announced at a recent Beijing event jointly held by the ministry, the China Film Association and the streaming giant iQiyi.Titled as Wo Shi Jing Cha (I'm a Police Officer), the franchise covers a wide range of different law enforcement units, including those responsible for counterterrorism, hunting criminals, and cracking down on drug rings as well as maintaining social order.Zhang Hong, the deputy chairman of the China Film Association, says that the stories of police officers are a treasure trove for filmmakers across the world, exemplified by gangster movies in the United States and cops & robbers films in Hong Kong.He says he hoped mainland filmmakers would produce movies about their own police heroes, highlighting their heroism to protect the country.Work on two movies, titled Operation Sword and Hunting Criminals Over 1,000 Miles, has recently started in Liaoyang, in Liaoning province, and Jixi, in Heilongjiang province.All the 10 movies will be produced by iQiyi and its production companies.

                A consortium of Chinese universities has pledged to conduct joint research on the development of the Yangtze River Delta region through an academic alliance.Spearheaded by Fudan University, the YRD Higher Education Think Tank Alliance was established in Shanghai on Sunday. Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Nanjing University, Zhejiang University and the University of Science and Technology of China are the other four partners in the alliance, which is open to recruiting other universities and research institutions within the region.The bloc aims to enhance academic research and offer policy advice regarding the development of the delta, through international collaboration and talent cultivation, according to a press release.China has made the regional integration of the delta a national strategy. The area covers Shanghai and its neighboring provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui.Although the region only accounts for one-sixth of China's population, it generates nearly a quarter of the nation's gross domestic product.

                    NBA icons' reunion a slam dunk for super penguin show

                From Manu Ginobili's throwback wig to Tony Parker's signature spin move, the 2019 Super Penguin Celebrity Game took Chinese fans of the vintage San Antonio Spurs on a ride back to the good old days.Featuring an exhibition game with the participation of hoops stars and celebrity entertainers, the fourth edition of the super penguin show ended up giving diehard San Antonio fans a blast from the past in Shanghai over the weekend as the two Spurs' icons, who were invited to each lead a team, made their reunion at the game quite special.Ginobili, who lost his once-flowing locks midway through his career before going completely bald, suited up for Blue Energy in the second half of the game, donning a wig that reminded everybody at the gym of his heyday back in 2005, when his long locks swayed through the air as he effortlessly Euro-stepped his way to helping the Spurs win its third NBA championship.Watching his old teammate sport a familiar look, Parker, who won four championship rings together with Ginobili and Tim Duncan from 2003-2014, appeared as if he'd been transported a decade back in time.
