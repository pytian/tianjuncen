                Chinese Nike factories rapidly reducing carbon footprint
            </p>

                Nike has seen a rapid reduction in it's carbon footprint during manufacturing and transportation, as China leads the way in utilizing alternative energy, said the group's chief sustainability officer.During his recent visit to China, Noel Kinder said brands like Nike play a key role in driving positive change, as the company has replaced 75 percent of its energy consumption with renewable energy across its global operations this year alone.The company is also vowing to help its partners become more efficient and sustainable, and in China, such efforts have paid off, with factories reducing waste by 12 percent from the 2016 to 2018 fiscal year. From the 2015 to 2018 fiscal year, its strategic footwear suppliers in China reduced energy consumption used per pair of shoes by 19 percent."At Nike, we build long-term relationships with our contract manufacturing suppliers because we know having trust and mutual respect supports our ability to create products more responsibly," he said.As China has been accelerating its pace in adopting electrical vehicles to help lower environmental manufacturing impacts recent years, Kinder said the country has been leading the way in the use of alternative energy, giving Nike certain advantages in reducing its carbon footprint during transportation."Logistically, we have worked with some tracking companies that were thinking of adopting e-vehicles, so our carbon footprint would go down very quickly," he said.According to Nike, the company has been utilizing LNG (liquefied natural gas) for long-haul transportation in China on about 30 percent of its cross-province routes. Continuous efforts have also been placed on electric vans for in-city deliveries such as in Zhengzhou, where e-van deliveries have successfully reached 100 percent."With increasing emphasis placed on alternative energy in China, Nike has been motivated to adjust its focus in this aspect of moving our products," he said.

                Guangdong police to intensify fight against personal data theft
            </a>
            <p>
                A senior police officer has vowed to further intensify efforts to fight against personal data theft to ensure a good and sound internet space for residents and online users in the months ahead.Sun Taiping, deputy director general of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Public Security, said personal data theft poses a serious threat to residents and internet users, so police across the southern province, the window of China's reform and opening up, should spare no effort in fighting against any illegal event that is a serious offense in the mainland."Meanwhile residents should also further raise their awareness to prevent their personal data from being stolen and used by lawbreakers to commit crimes," Sun said.Sun made his remarks at a press conference in Guangdong's provincial capital on Thursday. Provincial police noted they have detained 7,460 suspects after working on more than 730 cases involving online theft and illegal sales of personal data in a special campaign during the first eight months of the year.Meanwhile, police seized more than 400 million pieces of stolen personal data during the campaign, code named Operation Anwang, or Safe Internet, 2019.A number of criminal gangs that used to be active in stealing and selling personal data for major profit have been busted in the province, one of the country's economic powerhouses, according to Sun.A large number of computers, mobile phones, identity cards and bank cards were seized during the Anwang operation, which was launched at the beginning of the year.In Guangzhou, police detained 201 suspects, including three gang heads, after busting a criminal operation that mainly stole and illegally sold personal data in April.The gang was investigated and found to have defrauded large sums of money after establishing more than 300 shell companies with the stolen data, to defraud a large number of residents in the mainland.The Anwang operation led to a heavy blow against crime, but police will not relax their vigilance in the fight against personal data theft, Sun said."Police will continue to redouble efforts to fight against such crimes in the following months," he added.
