                Key components of China's 600 kph maglev train unveiled
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                CHANGSHA - CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. unveiled the key components of its magnetic-levitation train with a designed speed of 600 kph in Central China's Hunan province Tuesday.Key parts of the train's power system, including a long stator linear motor and two transformers, were unveiled in the city of Zhuzhou.He Yunfeng, an official of the company, said that different from traditional electrical motors, the long stator linear motor features a simple structure, strong climbing ability, low noise, low energy consumption, and quick start and stop.The long stator linear motor plays the role of the "heart" of the high-speed train, and the transformers provide a constant and stable direct current power for the linear motor, equivalent to a "blood supply system."The high-speed maglev train can fill the service gap between current high-speed rail and aviation services and is of great technological and economic significance for improving the country's high-speed passenger transport network. High-speed trains in China now run at a speed of up to 350 kph.A prototype 600 kph magnetic-levitation train rolled off the production line in the eastern city of Qingdao in May.The high-speed maglev train features high speed, safety, reliability, low noise and vibration, large passenger capacity, on-time performance and low maintenance costs. It can be used to connect major cities or city clusters to boost regional integration.

                    Beijing's Star Theater marks 10th anniversary with new play

            <p class="style-content">
                The Star Theater, one of the smaller theaters in Beijing, is celebrating its 10th anniversary by staging a new play, Too Crazy To Live. The show, which premiered at the theater on Sept 12, will be staged there until Sept 22.The show, based on Chinese writer Yan Leisheng's 2012 sci-fi novel Plague, is about a group of young people reacting to a horrific plague infecting humans.The 90-minute play, directed by Beijing-based Malaysian theater director Deric Gan, features five young Chinese actors playing 32 roles."The adaptation gives the novel a new life, which is beyond my imagination," says writer Yan, who watched the premiere of the play in Beijing.The Star Theater, which has three auditoriums -- each with a capacity of about 200 seats -- was the first of its kind in Beijing and has become a magnet for drama aficionados, as it offers a platform for smaller theater productions. It staged more than 600 shows last year, attracting more than 100,000 people.

                Zhao Hongwei, chief engineer at the China Academy of Railway SciencesI was born into a military family in Langfang in the northern province of Hebei.For most of my schooldays I was plagued by my father's strictness. If I failed to score 100 percent in any test, he refused to sign his name as required by the school.But thanks to that tough parenting, I have never bowed to any challenge in my career.In 2010, when the high-speed train was undergoing trial runs on the Beijing-Shanghai line, I was given just three months to modify the 16-car train into a 12-car one, while maintaining its ability to run at a maximum of 350 kilometers per hour, the highest speed possible on that line at the time.A missing bolt or one damaged cable could lead to a deadly derailment.However, there are tens of thousands of components in a bullet train, so the task seemed impossible, even for experts from countries such as Japan and Spain (which already had high-speed rail networks).After ruling out all the possible problems and repeatedly testing and adjusting the processes with my colleagues, what had been deemed impossible turned into a big success.In 2012, I was invited to become director of the Locomotive Sub-committee for the Data and Communications Department at the International Union of Railways - the first Asian to be offered the post.I am qualified to discuss advanced and innovative technologies with the world's best train experts, which is a great help to China, a latecomer to international bullet train technology. When international standards were being drawn up, I offered a lot of Chinese perspectives in terms of technical standards.When people discover what I do for a living, they always ask if bullet trains will eventually go even faster. I always say "yes".It took less than a decade for China to build the world's biggest, most-advanced bullet train network.We leapfrogged our predecessors to achieve a commercial operating speed of 350 km/h by upgrading and improving the technologies of our Japanese and European counterparts.However, speed is not the only barometer for measuring the success of our technology. There are many other factors, such as noise reduction, minimizing vibration and the comfort of the ride.We are now sparing no efforts on experiments to design a maglev (magnetic levitation) train that could run at a designed speed of 600 km/h.With the maglev train becoming a reality in the coming years, people will soon be able to "travel at the speed of light".Zhao Hongwei spoke with Wang Keju.

                    China develops permanent magnet motor for 400 kph high-speed train

            <p class="style-content">
                CHANGSHA - China has developed a permanent magnet traction motor for trains with speeds up to 400 kph, the developer said Tuesday.The newly-developed TQ-800 motor is expected to be used in a multinational interconnected high-speed train project, according to the CRRC Zhuzhou Electric Co., Ltd.Adopting a fully-enclosed and directional cooling structure, the TQ-800 motor boasts high power density, excellent low-temperature adaptability and low maintenance cost, the company said.The successful development of the motor breaks the monopoly of foreign technologies in this area and lays a solid foundation for the upgrade of rail transit technologies in China, it added.The maximum speed of China's bullet trains rose to 350 kph when the Fuxing (Rejuvenation) bullet trains started operation between Beijing and Shanghai on Sept. 21, 2017.The Fuxing trains are a substantial upgrade on the previous Hexie (Harmony) bullet trains. Entirely designed and manufactured in China, the Fuxing train is more spacious and energy-efficient, with longer service life and better reliability.

            <p class="style-content">
                BEIJING - China aims to raise its global competitiveness in the transport sector by setting up transport networks with wider coverage and higher speed, according to an official document.The country will establish a comprehensive modern transport system by 2035, according to the document jointly released by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council.The transport system will be composed of three networks: a high speed network of high-speed railways, expressways and civil aviation, an arterial network of low-speed railways, national highways and waterways, and oil and gas pipelines, and a basic network of provincial highways, rural highways, regional railways and general aviation, said Wang Zhiqing, a senior official with the Ministry of Transport.China will build a domestic travel circle to limit commutes within cities to one hour and travel times to neighboring cities and major cities nationwide to two hours and three hours, respectively.Circles for speedy logistics will be completed to facilitate domestic goods delivery within one day, shipping to neighboring countries in two days and logistics to major cities worldwide in three days, according to the document.The country will also promote intelligent transport with the support of big data, artificial intelligence, blockchain and supercomputing and adopt an environmentally friendly model of development by saving energy and controlling pollution.
