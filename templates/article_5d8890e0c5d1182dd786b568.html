                China's legal profession admission exam draws 606,700 candidates
            </p>
            <p>
                BEIJING - A total of 606,700 people have signed up for the first phase of testing of China's unified qualification exam for legal professionals this year, according to the Ministry of Justice.A total of 392,700 candidates chose to take the first phase of the exam -- test of objective questions -- on Saturday, while the remainder will sit the exam on Sunday, the ministry said in a statement.The statement said such an arrangement will allow more people to take this year's exam, as more law-related professions are requiring applicants to pass the exam.The candidates may also choose to take the exam in ethnic minority languages including Mongolian, Korean, Tibetan, Uygur and Kazakh.Candidates who pass this year's first phase and those who passed last year but failed in the second phase will be eligible to take this year's second phase of the exam -- subjective test -- scheduled on Oct 13.

                Muslim in Beijing celebrate Eid
            </a>
            <p>
                On Sunday, Muslims in China and across the world celebrated Corban Festival also known as Eid al-Adha.The historic Niujie Mosque in Beijing saw a huge congregation of Muslims praying for China and global peace.The magnificent Niujie Mosque is the oldest and the largest mosque in Beijing and also one of the most famous mosques in the world.Originally built in 996 AD, the mosque was initiated by an Arabic scholar Nasurddin and was named as "Libaisi" by the Chinese Emperor in 1474 AD. The mosque has a central axel balanced layout covering 10,000 square meter area. The Muslims also offered prayers in more than 70 mosques in Beijing.Soon after offering prayers, the worshippers went to food and sweet shops with their family members to mark the day of blessings.Talking to China Daily website, Ibrahim Khalid from Egypt said the government of China attaches great importance to religious rituals of Muslims."Eid al-Adha festival is a great day here in China. Thousands of Muslims celebrated it with us in the vicinity of Niujie Mosque. This was a manifestation of how considerate China's government is toward religious minorities," he said.The festival is celebrated by various ethnic groups of Muslim community in China, including the Hui, Uyghur, Kazakh, Uzbek, Tajik, Tatar, Khalkhas, Salar, Dongxiang and Bao'an. Many foreign Muslims living in different provinces of China also join the celebrations and offer prayers.Bilal Sabri is a journalist of Pakistan Today and Diplomag.

                Stabler hungry for more success
            </a>
            <p>
                Away from the spotlight that many of his compatriots enjoy in more glamorous sports, German wrestler Frank Stabler is preparing for one of the biggest challenges of his career.Stabler is the winner of three world titles in three categories, and now a revamp of the weight classes by governing body United World Wrestling (UWW) has forced him to go for a fourth.UWW has omitted Stabler's preferred weight category from the Olympics, so he was forced to decide between 67kg and 77kg. He bravely choose the lower division, meaning Stabler has been on a mission to shed some kilos with a strict weight-loss plan he calls "Project 67"."This is maybe the last challenge in my life as a wrestler. I have changed many parts of my life completely to reach my goals," Stabler told Xinhua ahead of the world championships, which start next Saturday in Kazakh capital Astana."Reducing weight that much is like going through hell."Hot chilis, ginger and spicy herbs are mentioned by him as helpful to "keep the engine running". White sugar is a major no-go and "no carbohydrates after 6 pm".Stabler allowed himself a day off, though, on his 30th birthday in June as he tucked into a big slice of cream cake. Having denied himself such treats for so long, he said he found the taste overwhelming.But Stabler won't be enticed back for second helpings any time soon as he works toward next year's Tokyo Olympics."I desire to prove what is possible, to encourage young kids to follow their dreams and teach the values of sports in general," said Stabler, who added that he now coaches children and is considering it as a future career - possibly even in China."Going abroad might be an option, and, yes, why not China as it is a country with great sportsmanship," he said.Stabler now trains on the family farm near Stuttgart after his hometown club decided to abandon wrestling several years ago. His gym is a refurbished cowshed positioned beside mountains of grain his father has harvested."We always hope he can sell as much as possible as this means for us we'll have more space for training," he said with a smile.As wrestling is a niche sport in Germany, Stabler regularly faces opponents who enjoy enormous funding compared to his own humble financial backing."I don't mind some of them being millionaires. I have stopped comparing wrestling in Germany with other countries. I see a challenge in beating the world's best," he said.Xinhua

                Sino-Kazakh partnership becomes permanent
            </a>
            <p>
                China and Kazakhstan agreed on Wednesday to develop a permanent comprehensive strategic partnership, a diplomatic relationship that never appeared in China's definition of bilateral ties before.The decision came as President Xi Jinping held talks with Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.The Kazakh leader, who speaks fluent Chinese, is making his first state visit to China from Tuesday to Thursday.Xi and Tokayev signed a joint statement after their talks. Witnessed by the two presidents, China and Kazakhstan signed a number of cooperation documents covering such areas as the Belt and Road, agriculture, trade and civil aviation.Hailing the China-Kazakhstan relationship as a model for friendly ties among neighbors, Xi said that China would like to deepen cooperation with Kazakhstan in all areas, boost interconnectivity, upgrade trade and economic cooperation, expand science and innovation cooperation and strengthen people-to-people exchanges.The two countries should firmly safeguard multilateralism and open global economies and make positive contributions to building a fairer global governance system, Xi said.He called on the two nations to promote the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to play a more positive role in regional and global affairs, enhance security cooperation, work together to fight the three evil forces of terrorism, separatism and extremism, and join hands to deal with challenges.In the talks, Xi said that the Communist Party of China, which has led the Chinese people to glorious achievements in the past 70 years, is leading the Chinese people to strive for the great goal of national rejuvenation.Noting that the process of national rejuvenation will never be smooth, Xi said no matter how the external situation changes, China will keep its strategic focus on its own issues, deepen overall reform, boost opening-up and promote high-quality growth.China has the capability to deal with all risks and challenges, and no difficulties or obstacles will hinder the country's progress, Xi said, adding that a stable, open and prosperous China is an opportunity for the development of the world.Tokayev congratulated Xi on the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.The great achievements made by China in the past decades have not only benefited the Chinese people but also contributed to the development of the world and promoted the progress of mankind, he said.Kazakhstan firmly supports the Chinese government and people to safeguard their national sovereignty, security and interests, he said.Kazakhstan expects to deepen cooperation with China in such areas as trade, infrastructure, energy and 5G technology, and promote people-to-people exchanges, he added.

                Ethnic games bringing people together in Henan
            </a>
            <p>
                For Sun Kai, the pursuit of his college dream continues and brings more challenges.The 29-year-old aerobics teacher of Zhengzhou Sias University is leading Henan's ethnic aerobics team to compete in the 11th National Traditional Games of Ethnic Minorities in Henan's Zhengzhou only four years after he himself was a competitor."I am honored but responsible," said Sun, a member of the Hui ethnic group, who coaches a team of high school- and university-aged Uygur, Kazakh, Hui athletes together with Han students."I was selected to coach and represent my province because of my experience four years ago."Ethnic aerobics combines traditional and ethnic dancing elements and sport aerobics. An ethnic aerobics athlete should be both power-based and artistic in their movements.Each team features 16 performers with at least four male members. Teams perform a technical routine and a free routine for three minutes and 30 seconds each.The sport was first adopted as an official competition in the Inner Mongolia Games, where Sun competed representing the host as a post-graduate student of Inner Mongolia Normal University. His team came in second.Now coaching a team from different ethnic groups, Sun is looking to incorporate all the different traditions in their routines."We performed a lot of Inner Mongolian elements last time and now we are performing more Uygur," he said after a dress reherseal. "Because we have eight Uygur students and for me the Uygur movements are more expressive in the upper body."That is how the sport training major coach tries to distinguish ethnic aerobics from ethnic dancing in appearance. "It is a sport so you need to show your strength and power, so we let the upper body do artistic and the limbs show strength."He's popular with his students. Nana Rouzi, a third grade high school Uygur student from Zhengzhou No.7 Middle School, said she is becoming stronger both physically and mentally thanks to aerobics training.
