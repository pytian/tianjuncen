                Chinese travel giant Ctrip to develop tourism in Morocco
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                RABAT - Ctrip, the largest online travel agency in China, signed on Friday in Rabat a co-marketing partnership to develop the flows of Chinese tourists in Morocco.According to Moroccan Tourism Ministry's data, 180,000 Chinese tourists visited Morocco in 2018.Before the visa exemption announced in June 2016, Morocco received an average of less than 20,000 Chinese tourists per year. In 2017, this number has climbed to 118,000.The partnership spans three years and aims at increasing the visibility of Morocco's destination in China, notably through digital advertising campaigns, the ONMT said in a statement."It will help achieving our goal of receiving some 500,000 Chinese tourists per year," it added.

                    When sun is lethal: Moroccans struggle with skin illness
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                CASABLANCA, Morocco - Determined for her 7-year-old son to attend school despite a life-threatening sensitivity to sunlight, Nadia El Rami struck a deal with the school's director: Mustapha would be allowed in the classroom, but only if he studies inside a cardboard box.Mustapha Redouane happily accepted the arrangement. He knew his mother's idea would silence the school's worries about his condition, a rare genetic disorder called xeroderma pigmentosum, or XP, which can make sun rays and other sources of ultraviolet light extremely damaging to the skin and eyes. The disorder is more common in North Africa than much of the world."I hate the sun anyways. It gives me blisters," he said, sitting on his mother's lap, his face covered with the dark brown freckles that the school director considered a distraction to other students.Now 8, Mustapha has already had 11 operations to remove cancerous growths on his skin.His family is among thousands around the world struggling with XP, and increasingly sharing advice and seeking new treatments. In Morocco, families are also fighting for recognition, government help - and the simple right to go to school.The disorder affects about 1 in 10,000 people in North Africa - more than 10 times the rate in Europe and about 100 times the rate in the United States, according to Kenneth Kraemer, who researches XP at the US National Institutes of Health.Because the disorder is inherited, XP is more common in populations where marriage between relatives is high, Kraemer said. Affected children inherit two copies of a mutated gene, one from each parent. A 2016 Moroccan government study estimates about 15 percent of marriages are between family members.Living in a country where the sun shines year-round makes them more susceptible to skin cancers that can be caused by the disorder, said Fatima El Fatouikai, a pediatric dermatology specialist at the Ibn Rochd University Hospital in Casablanca.Without protection, few XP patients in Morocco live beyond their teenage years, El Fatouikai said. It is particularly challenging in developing countries, where an awareness of the disorder and access to treatments are scarce, and in poor, rural communities where people spend more time outside.Most Moroccan children with XP don't continue their education. While US schools install window filters for XP pupils and otherwise adapt to their needs, such accommodations are rare in Morocco.Associated Press

                    2 detained in polarized demonstrations marking stabbing in Finland's Turku
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                HELSINKI - Two persons were detained as ideologically polarized processions marched on Sunday in the southwestern city of Turku, in commemoration of the 2017 terrorist attack in the city.A nationalistically oriented grouping arranged a procession and threw flowers into the river Aura. Another procession marched under the banner "Turku without Nazis", targeting the alleged ideological character of the other demonstration.Local media said some 250 people marched on the nationalist side and 500 in the "anti-Nazi" procession.Local newspaper Turun Sanomat reported that both processions went without incident, but when the anti-Nazi procession had reached its end at the Old Grand Square, the atmosphere became tense as members of the other demonstration had arrived to the scene.Both demonstrations took place under heavy police protection, with police in combat gear and motorcycle police accompanying both marches.The police said later that the two detained persons were released, without specifying the affiliations of those detained.Local media noted that last year as the first commemoration took place, 10 people were arrested.Besides the two marches, there was a third commemorative event by a youth organization. Senior police officer Gisela von Porat told newspaper Hufvudstadsbladet that the police were aware of all the three.In the stabbing incident on Aug. 18, 2017, Moroccan national Abderrahman Bouanane killed two persons and injured eight others at the Turku Market Place. He was given a life sentence by a Finnish court in June 2018.The Moroccan had arrived in Finland as an asylum seeker but had been rejected. The Turku stabbing was the first terrorist attack in Finland.Vilhelm Junnila, a member of parliament representing the Finns Party, addressed the nationalist event. He suggested that the city of Turku would start a tradition that one of the bridges of the Aura River would be lit with Finnish colors - white and blue - every year on the 18th of August.Jaakko Lindfors, a local politician representing the Left Alliance, was leading the "anti-Nazi" procession. He said it is important to be opposing racism and the extreme right wing.Newspaper Turun Sanomat interviewed local people in the streets. One of them expressed the hope that the city of Turku would take over arranging the commemorations."A city-arranged event could defuse the current polarization", she said. "But we are already two years late," she added.
