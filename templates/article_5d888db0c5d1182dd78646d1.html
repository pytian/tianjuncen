                Xi puts forward 3-point proposal on developing China-African relations
            </p>
            <p>
                 OSAKA - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday put forward a three-point proposal on building a closer community with a shared future between China and African countries.On the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in the Japanese city of Osaka, Xi chaired a China-Africa leaders' meeting, which was attended by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, also former African co-chair of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC); Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, also rotating chair of the African Union (AU); Senegalese President Macky Sall, current African co-chair of the FOCAC; and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.The leaders compared notes and reached a broad consensus on major issues such as deepening China-Africa cooperation, supporting the development of Africa and the work of the United Nations, and safeguarding multilateralism.Xi pointed out that the FOCAC Beijing summit held in September last year ushered in a new era of China-Africa relations.China cherishes its traditional friendship with Africa, Xi said, adding that no matter how the international situation changes and despite the interference of certain powers, the original aspirations of China and Africa for win-win cooperation and common development will stay unchanged and the resolve to jointly build a closer community with a shared future will not waver.At the China-Africa leaders' meeting, Xi put forward a three-point proposal.First, Xi called on the countries to be pioneers for win-win development so that the fruits of cooperation will benefit more Chinese and African people.The countries, he said, should align the construction of the Belt and Road with the AU's Agenda 2063, the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the development strategies of African countries, and bring more visible and tangible benefits to the peoples of China and Africa through the implementation of the outcomes of the FOCAC Beijing summit.Xi pledged that China will stay committed to the principles of sincerity, real results, affinity and good faith and the approach of pursuing the greater good and shared interests, honor its commitments to Africa to the letter, persistently support Africa's development, and make greater contributions to Africa's development and rejuvenation and African countries' joint efforts to become stronger.

                Facts nail the US lies on Tibet
            </a>
            <p>
                 The White Hose ratified the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018 in December, urging the Chinese government to give US journalists, diplomats and tourists unrestricted access to the Tibet autonomous region, failing which it would deny Chinese officials deemed responsible for restricting access to Tibet entry to the United States.In a report published on its official website recently, the US Department of State claimed, without any basis, that the Chinese government had systematically obstructed US officials, journalists and tourists from entering Tibet and other areas inhabited by ethnic Tibetan people in 2018.China has always kept the doors to Tibet open to the outside world. But while doing so, it has introduced certain measures, in accordance with the law, for foreigners' entry into the region. More important, Tibet is China's internal affair which brooks no interference from any foreign country.China committed to opening up furtherChina remains committed to keeping the doors to Tibet open, especially because the policy has helped China to march toward prosperity. In fact, China's rapid development over the past four decades is inseparable from the policy of reform and opening-up.At the fifth central work symposium in Tibet in 2010, the central authorities proposed to develop Tibet into an important world tourist destination, and at the sixth symposium in 2015 they vowed to forge Tibet into an important channel of China's opening-up to Southeast Asia, by making it an important part of the Belt and Road Initiative.In recent years, the central authorities have made efforts to further open up Tibet and build it into a global tourism cooperation zone.From 2014 to 2018, Tibet held four international exhibitions on its tourist culture, with the fourth one in 2018 bringing together top officials from foreign countries, including foreign diplomats in China, representatives from global tourism organizations, and scholars from across the world.'Lhasa consensus' shows constructive suggestionsAt the 2016 forum on Tibet's development in Lhasa, more than 130 scholars, journalists, diplomats and entrepreneurs from over 30 countries, including the United States, Germany, India and Sri Lanka, contributed constructive suggestions on the development of Tibet, which found voice in the 2016 "Lhasa consensus". These moves show that the central government has been supporting the opening-up initiatives beneficial to Tibet's development and the welfare of the Tibetan people.The number of tourists to Tibet has been rising steadily－from 244,400 visits in 2014 to 476,200 visits in 2018, with those of foreigners increasing from 200,000 to 241,600. The sources of foreign tourists have widened, too, because the door to Tibet is open to people of all countries.From 2010 to 2018, Tibet received tourists from 113 countries, with tourists from developed countries such as the US, Germany, the United Kingdom and Japan making up the largest cumulative group. Actually, with American tourists accounting for 16.1 percent of the total visits, the US is the single largest source of foreign tourists to Tibet.Tibet is low on oxygen and has a fragile ecosystem. Therefore, it cannot afford to play host to an endless number of tourists. Also, the region is home to a unique culture and customs. So the central government has no choice but to take suitable measures to protect and preserve these delicate features of the region.Plus, the government attaches great importance to tourists' safety. Tibet's average altitude is about 4,000 meters above the sea level, with some passes situated at more than 6,000 meters. Such high altitudes and the treacherous topography of the region can be potentially dangerous for many people, especially for those who have heart and lung diseases or high blood pressure.Tourists' safety is of utmost importanceBesides, Tibet is sparsely populated, with a population density of only 2.74 per square kilometer. This means tourists needing emergency treatment could face trouble, and if people are stranded in remote locations, they cannot be easily rescued. Never mind the complex and variable climate in Tibet and the ever-present threat of natural disasters such as landslides, high-velocity winds and sudden snowfall.For the sake of their safety, the central government has advised foreign tourists to travel in groups and visit only those areas where rescue operations can be readily launched.The central government also attaches great importance to striking the right balance between tourism development and ecological protection in Tibet. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is the source of quite a few major rivers and the "regulator" of climate in Asia, and therefore its ecosystem is vitally important to the whole of Asia. The unrestricted entry of a large number of tourists to Tibet would cause irreparable damage to the region's ecological environment and risk exacerbating global warming and the melting of glaciers.It is such concerns that have prompted the central government to promote the coordinated development of tourism in Tibet. Given the fragile ecosystem of Tibet and the potential dangers its topography and climate pose to tourists, it is natural for the central government to limit the number of tourists to the region.Protecting Tibet's unique culture is also high on the central government's agenda. So while boosting the development of tourism, the central government attaches equal if not more importance to guiding tourist behaviors and controlling the number of tourists, in order to not cause any harm to Tibetan culture or its environmental ecology.World Cultural Heritage sites need to be protectedPotala Palace, Jokhang Temple and Norbulingka Summer Palace were included on the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list in 1994, 2000 and 2001, respectively. In 2015, the Tibet autonomous region government promulgated a regulation on cultural heritage protection for Potala Palace, establishing a dynamic detection mechanism that can monitor the real-time flow of tourists to the heritage site and its impact on the cultural relics. The mechanism can warn authorities when visitors in the palace reach the optimum number so they can control their entry.China will continue to further open up, as President Xi Jinping has said. Accordingly, the scale of foreigners' access to Tibet will expand. As such, the "systematic obstruction" to foreigners' entry into Tibet, as claimed by the US act, is a gross distortion of facts and a flagrant interference in China's internal affairs, driven by ulterior political motives.People of all ethnic groups in Tibet are working with their compatriots in the rest of country to build a well-off society in an all round way by 2020, and the central government will not allow Tibet's stability and the well-being of Tibetan people to be harmed.Any country that wants to develop friendly relations with China must respect its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and refrain from interfering in its internal affairs－which is also a basic norm of international relations. So people in the US trying to use Tibet as an excuse to interfere in China's internal affairs and thus disrupt and undermine Sino-US cooperation and exchanges should stop doing so, because they will never succeed in their evil designs.The author is a researcher at the China Tibetology Research Center.

                Ex-Portugal deputy PM lauds 'connectivity' of BRI in digital world
            </a>
            <p>
                China aids globalization better than any other country and has surprised the world with the development of its digital economy, former Portuguese deputy prime minister Paulo Portas said on Saturday.Portas touted the Belt and Road Initiative as something that greatly "enhances connectivity in a global digital world"."Clearly the Belt and Road Initiative increases connectivity. With digitalization, you are connected with the world regardless of your geographical location, so you can develop your economy and society," Portas said on the sidelines of the three-day Shanghai Forum 2019, an annual gathering hosted by Fudan University and the Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies.In his view, China has dramatically leapfrogged in its contribution to global trade, from claiming less than 1 percent in the share of world trade of goods four decades ago to the current 12 percent. The jump demonstrates Beijing's embrace of globalization, he said.Advancements in e-commerce and mobile payments are also lending fresh momentum to innovation and are taking globalization to a different level, he said. "Even if one can slow the momentum of globalization, you cannot stop digitization," he said.In December, Beijing and Lisbon signed cooperation documents covering such areas as trade, culture, science and the Belt and Road Initiative, vowing to forge ahead with multilateral coordination and facilitate connectivity.Portas called the cooperation framework a "very positive move" that paves the way for companies in the two countries to explore business opportunities. As natural navigators and traders, he said, the Portuguese ardently support free trade, and he "cannot imagine an accurate and competitive economic policy in the world without China".Through digital means, Chinese companies have in recent years acted as "technological enablers" to help other countries grow their economies. For instance, Ant Financial Services Group, parent of the popular mobile wallet Alipay, has created nine local payment solutions in countries from India to Indonesia."Our aim is to open our inclusive technologies to global partners, serve 2 billion users across the world, create 100 million jobs and help 10 million small and medium-sized companies to be profitable in the future," said Xiong Wuzhen, senior director of technology at Ant Financial International.China's indigenous technologies and best practices in the past two decades are a "natural fit" for economies participating in the Belt and Road Initiative who aspire to digitize their economy, said Li Bo, assistant director at Fudan University's China Institute."We are looking to build the digital versions of all physical projects under the auspices of the Belt and Road Initiative. This will be conducive to future learning, training and exchanges of views," he said.Under the theme "Asia Amid Global Reshuffling: Challenges, Developments, and New Paradigms", the three-day forum, which ends Monday, features four mega topics - new technologies, changing global orders, China's new round of reform and opening-up, and Shanghai's bid to make itself a global city of excellence. Some 30 panel discussions have been scheduled throughout the event.

                Greater support, quicker approval are diagnosed for successThe State Council has moved to incentivize the growth of private medical institutions with streamlined approvals and greater policy support as experts underscored the importance of enabling more talent flow to the private medical sector.The cabinet decided at an executive meeting on Wednesday to expand the room of development for private medical institutions, cancelling restrictions on the number of such institutions within a certain region during urban planning procedures.Workers from public hospitals can apply for the opening of medical institutions while they are still in service or on suspension from duty without pay, according to a statement released after the meeting.The meeting also vowed improved efficiencies in government approvals, with an interdepartmental mechanism for such institutions set to be established before the end of this year.The growth of private medical institutions will effectively increase the supply of medical services, stimulate the potential of the market and unleash the potential of consumption in the service sector, the statement said.According to a report released by the National Health Commission last week, the number of private hospitals reached 20,977 last year, up by 11.8 percent from 2017. Private hospitals, with 26.3 percent of the country's hospital beds, received a total of 530 million patients, or 14.8 percent of the country's total, last year.Li Ling, a professor who has conducted research on the country's medical reforms at Peking University, said the measures by the State Council showcased the growing importance of private medical institutions in the health sector.However, she said, one of the major challenges for private medical institutions is the lack of high-quality medical workers. "It is not about money. It is about doctors," she said.Even though private hospitals far outnumber their public counterparts, a majority of patients still opt for public hospitals. "It is a lengthy process to train a qualified doctor with enough expertise," she added.The State Council meeting also came up with greater policy support for private medical institutions. To boost the number of outpatients, private hospitals can enjoy the same treatment as public hospitals on the policy of interprovincial on-the-spot settlement of medical bills through basic medical insurance accounts. More private hospitals will also be included in the basic medical insurance system, the statement said.Tax incentives of small and micro businesses as well as high-tech firms will also be made available to private hospitals, which can also obtain land use rights through government allocation, transferring or leasing.The cooperation between public and private medical institutions in the development of Internet Plus healthcare will receive support, in addition to services in long-distance medical coordination, medical examination and imaging.Private medical institutions will be given priority in undertaking rehabilitation and nursing services from top-tier hospitals, and one-stop direct payment services will be promoted between them and commercial insurance institutions, it said.For private institutions that are devoted to rehabilitation and nursing services at community levels, they can have taxes exempted based on relevant regulations, it added.Shi Lichen, founder of Beijing Dingchen Consultancy, contended that there is a need to encourage more flow of people and services, including rehabilitation and nursing, from public hospitals to private institutions."T he best way is to enable more partnerships between public hospitals and social capital so that hospitals will be incentivized to outsource rehabilitation and nursing services," he said.The meeting also called for better oversight and the establishment of reporting and handling mechanisms to crack down on wrongdoings. Those with severe credit losses will be subject to lifetime ban from the health sector.Li, the professor, said the government stepping up punishment for wrongdoing will help improve the quality of private institutions in the sector. She noted that some private hospitals, driven by profits, have tainted the reputation of the sector as a whole.The reputation of private hospitals in China suffered a blow in 2016 after Wei Zexi, a 21-year-old cancer patient from Shaanxi province, died after undergoing an experimental cancer therapy at a Beijing hospital that had outsourced work to private service providers."The key is to make sure that good money drives out bad in the market, not the other way around," she said.

                IMF report shows hollowness of manipulator claim: China Daily editorial
            </a>
            <p>
                The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in a report on Friday that the yuan's exchange rate was "broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals" and China's central bank "has had little foreign exchange interventions in recent years", a conclusion that clarifies China's innocence from currency manipulation.The IMF said that the country's external position in 2018 was "broadly in line with the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies".The organization also welcomed China's efforts to reform its exchange rate regime to make the yuan more flexible, according to its report released after its latest Article IV consultation with China that concluded on July 31.The clarification by the IMF indicates that the US Treasury's reckless claim on Monday of China engaging in currency manipulation is nothing but unfounded finger-pointing.As a developing and transitional economy, China has been reforming its currency exchange rate management regime in the past years, gradually liberalizing its currency so that its value can be increasingly determined by market forces.Its currency stand has been consistent, committed to making the yuan more reflective of market supply and demand changes. During that process, it is normal for the yuan to experience two-way fluctuations.China has vowed repeatedly that it will not use competitive devaluation to facilitate trade and as the IMF report shows, it has kept its promise.In fact, the yuan had appreciated 38 percent in nominal terms and by 47 percent in real effective terms from early 2005 to this June, making it the strongest currency among those of the G20 members.China's efforts to liberalize the yuan cannot have been ignored by the US government. But out of the hideous motive to dampen China's development on all fronts, the US government has used its Exchange Rate and International Economic Policy Coordination Act of 1988, which is deemed subjective and without quantitative standards, to nonetheless define China as a currency manipulator to pave the way for future anti-China moves.That it has opted to shun its Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, which at least has objective quantitative standards, just betrays its thuggish deliberation in singling out China as a "currency manipulator".A variety of economists and experts, including those from within the United States, have criticized the US government of failing to respect facts and evidences when it takes the yuan's fluctuation in a very short period of time to define China as a currency manipulator regardless of its latest criteria for currency manipulation set in its 2015 act.Such an arbitrary and politicized move will set a harmful precedent that is set to have a profound impact on the international economic and trade order. It disrupts the normal order of international competition and means that the powerful country can take any excuse to irresponsibly crack down on its rivals.The international community should join hands and stand up to stop such farce and safeguard international economic order.

                China takes new measures to cut financing costs for real economy
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - Chinese companies are likely to see less financing burden thanks to a string of new government policies, analysts said.In its latest move to cut financing costs for the real economy, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's central bank, unveiled a plan on Saturday to improve and reform the country's loan prime rate (LPR) mechanism.The new LPR's quotations, to be issued on a monthly basis starting Tuesday, will be based on the rates of the central bank's open market operations to better reflect market changes and should be adopted as the major lending rate reference for banks to issue new loans, according to the PBOC.The move is expected to drive down the real interest rates in the economy, as the new LPR will better reflect market rates, which had been trending down, the PBOC said.The new scheme will improve the transmission channel of the country's monetary policy, said Sheng Songcheng, former head of the PBOC statistics and analysis department.Small and micro companies with high asset quality will benefit from the reform, Sheng added.The new LPR scheme was part of a policy package released at a recent State Council's executive meeting, which called for coordinated use of different kinds of monetary tools and the greater role of financing guarantee in reducing the financing costs of the real economy.Efforts will be made to make lending rates and fees more open and transparent. Charges by financial institutions will be strictly regulated, and intermediate agencies will be urged to cut fees, according to the meeting.Rather than resorting to across-the-board interest rate cuts or reserve requirement ratio adjustments, China has been using a variety of monetary tools to channel funds into the real economy where the money is most needed.In addition to bank loans, the country has been encouraging direct financing as an important channel for companies to raise funds.In an official document released Sunday on the development of Shenzhen, the country vowed to improve the mechanisms for initial public offering (IPO), refinancing, mergers and acquisitions on the ChiNext, China's Nasdaq-style board.The document also encouraged the registration-based IPO system, which cuts listing application red tape and allows more market-based pricing, a boon to growth enterprises seeking to raise money.
