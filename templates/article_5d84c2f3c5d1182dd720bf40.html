                Xi urges more global cooperation in manufacturing
            </p>
            <p>
                President Xi Jinping has called upon greater global cooperation and mutual learning in the manufacturing sector in order to jointly seize opportunities arising from the new revolution taking place in science, technology and other industries. Xi's remarks came as he sent a congratulatory message to the opening of the 2019 World Manufacturing Convention held in Hefei, Anhui province, on Friday. He noted that the global manufacturing sector is undergoing profound reforms, and it is important for different countries to improve their innovation capacity in the sector and promote reform in quality, efficiency and impetus. China attaches great importance to the growth of the manufacturing sector, adheres to an innovation-driven development strategy, and sees promoting the high-quality development of the manufacturing sector as an important part of developing a modern economic system, he said. China stands ready to work with different parties to enable the rise of new technologies in manufacturing, contribute to the sector's high-quality development worldwide, and achieve win-win cooperation, he added.

                Poverty-stricken former logging community reborn as thriving eco-tourist site
            </a>
            <p>
                Lumbering used to be the pillar industry for Arxan in North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region. It's common that two, and even three generations of local families were involved in the industry for living.As the country promotes its ecological progress, logging was banned there in 2012. Instead of damaging the local economy, the ban opened a new chapter for green development.In addition to tourism, the city also has been gaining new impetus for development from animal husbandry and eco-industries. Its new development mode with protection of its rich forest resources as its core has helped it shed the status as a national poverty-stricken area.Yu Jiujiang, a resident in Arxan's Bailang township, is one of those who put away his logging tools and became a beneficiary of local tourism development.Like many of his peers, Yu followed his father's footstep to work as a lumberman after graduating from junior high school in 1982. The tough life of felling trees day after day is among his most unforgettable memories."We left home for work before dawn. It was dark when we came back," the 57-year-old recalled.The bitterly cold winter, which often saw temperatures plummet to minus 30 C, was the toughest time. "We worked as normal even though the snow was so thick that it could entirely bury our legs," the employee of Bailang state-owned forest farm said.With no machines available in the early days, they not only had to fell trees with simple saws, but had to carry logs out on their shoulders, he said, as he showed calluses on his hands and scars left by logs on his shoulder and back.As the forest logging quota became increasingly smaller before 2012, local authorities encouraged forest farm workers to start their own businesses. Yu seized the opportunity and started a horse farm in 2006 to serve tourists mainly at winter time when the township is covered by thick snow. In addition to horse riding, he also provides horse-drawn sled services to entertain tourists.Yu didn't expect that it would be such a success. Business especially soared after President Xi Jinping visited Arxan in early 2014. During his visit, Xi praised Arxan as beautiful in all the four seasons and hoped that city tourism would boom.Previously, Yu served up to more than 100 customers a day during wintertime. After Xi's visit, the number increased to between 500 and 600.Yu increased the number of horses on his farm to more than 100 in 2017 to meet increasing demand and also hires at least five poverty-stricken residents when he and his family members need extra help.While caring for the business, Yu also works as a ranger for the state-owned forest farm to watch out for people unlawfully felling trees and for forest fires near his home. The two jobs don't contradict with each other, as a ranger doesn't have much work to do in winter. "My family of four members could make up to 20,000 yuan ($2,817) a year," he said.According to local authorities, most families in Bailang township, which has a population of about 2,000,are now involved in tourism-related work like Yu.Bailang is just a microcosm of Arxan county. Currently, 60 percent of Arxan's population of 68,000 work directly or indirectly in the tourism industry, said Bai Feng, head of the Arxan tourism administration.Previously, local residents herded sheep and cows, but now they raise deer and roes deer and started a fish farm, all of which can serve the tourism industry. The combination of agriculture and animal husbandry with tourism not only increased residents' income but also helps preserve local vegetation resources, he said.From 2014 to 2018, Arxan's tourism revenue and tourist numbers more than doubled. Last year, the county received about 4.32 million tourists and its tourism revenue stood at 5.3 billion yuan ($746.8 million), according to the Arxan government.The per capita disposable income of the city's urban residents has kept increasing at an average rate of about 9 percent during the same period and reached 27,981 yuan last year. In 2011, Arxan was listed as a national poverty-stricken area. It was removed from the list in April.Arxan is building up an industrial pattern supported mainly by tourism and supplemented by eco-industries, plus agriculture and animal husbandry with local characteristics, said Gao Wei, Arxan's deputy mayor.Instead of taking from nature, local government has invested more than 1 billion yuan in recent years to promote its ecological progress. While planting 20,000 hectares of trees, it also carried out soil erosion treatment on almost 15,000 hectares of land, he said.Thanks to these efforts, the vegetation coverage rate of the city reached 95 percent and the forest coverage rate now stands at over 80 percent, according to the city government.Arxan was listed as a national exemplary city for promoting ecological progress in 2018.

                Sino-Russian ties offer wide benefits
            </a>
            <p>
                Boost to prosperity, stability of region and world expected as both countries agree to seek deeper, broader cooperation Broader and deeper cooperation between China and Russia will bring prosperity and stability to the region and the world amid the current international economic and political situation, analysts said as Premier Li Keqiang returned to Beijing on Thursday after an official visit to Russia. During the three-day visit, Li held talks and co-chaired the 24th regular meeting between Chinese and Russian heads of government with his Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev in St. Petersburg and met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Both countries agreed on the necessity to deepen their strategic communication and pragmatic cooperation as the world is faced with growing instability and rising protectionism. When meeting with Putin at the Kremlin on Wednesday, Li said the healthy and stable development of China-Russia relations is not only beneficial to both sides, but also conducive to the region and the world. China is willing to jointly safeguard with Russia an international system with the United Nations at its core and a multilateral trading system based on the World Trade Organization's rules, which is of great significance for promoting the development, prosperity, peace and stability of the world, he said. Noting that the bilateral ties have been upgraded to a comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era, Putin said the Russia-China relationship is an important stabilizing factor in international relations. Li Yonghui, a senior researcher of Russian foreign policy at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said Sino-Russian ties are now at their best in history, with the joint efforts of both sides since the establishment of diplomatic ties 70 years ago. As permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, China and Russia also bear a responsibility to safeguard multilateralism and free trade as well as promote fair and reasonable rules in global governance, she said. "Their joint efforts in this regard are injecting positive energy into the international community amid the ongoing resistance to promoting globalization," she said. She added that the two countries are also putting their mutual political trust into pragmatic economic cooperation so that China-Russia cooperation can go deeper in broader areas including service trade, technology innovation and agricultural products. In a joint communique signed by Premier Li and Medvedev after their meeting, the two sides agreed to create favorable conditions for closer bilateral cooperation in trade and investment, endeavoring to realize the target of $200 billion in bilateral trade. They also agreed to deepen all-around integrated cooperation in areas including oil and gas, electricity, coal and nuclear energy. Efforts will be made to improve their trade structure, foster new growth areas and develop new types of trade including e-commerce and service trade, according to the communique. When jointly meeting the media with Medvedev, Li said that as China is further opening up with its manufacturing sector fully accessible, Russian companies are welcomed to seize the opportunity and invest in China. China has been Russia's top trading partner for nine consecutive years and is also Russia's largest source of imports and destination for exports. In the first eight months of this year, bilateral trade totaled $70.59 billion, marking 4.5 percent year-on-year growth. "Despite the increasing differences between major countries and a sluggish global economy, China and Russia have maintained the highest growth rate of trade volume between major countries in recent years," said Oleg Timofeev, associate professor at Peoples' Friendship University of Russia. More potential remains to be tapped in new cooperative areas including nuclear energy, aviation, science and technology, and digital economy, he said. Alexander Lomanov, an expert at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations at the Russian Academy of Sciences, told Russia's Sputnik news agency that Russia and China have in St. Petersburg made the first pragmatic step of developing their comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era, which was elevated during President Xi Jinping's state visit to Russia in June. According to Lomanov, the 24th regular meeting between Chinese and Russian heads of government also bears special significance against the backdrop of the ongoing China-US trade tensions.
