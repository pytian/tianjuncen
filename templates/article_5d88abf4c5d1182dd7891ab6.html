                There isn't a mountain high enough or a valley deep enough to stop two cross-country runners who found love on the race circuit, Yang Feiyue reports. Chinese runners are making their presence increasingly felt on the global cross-country racing scene. While winning medals has become commonplace for these intrepid athletes, some have even managed to bag, arguably, the biggest prize of all while loading up the trophy cabinet - true love. Yao Miao approached Qi Min to offer him a drink of water during a race, which Qi gladly accepted, relieving his physical dehydration. Meeting Yao, however, ended up quenching a deeper, more spiritual thirst.  Clockwise from above: Qi Min (left) and Yao Miao train for a cross-country run in Ninghai, Zhejiang province, in July. Yao (front middle) with Qi (second from left) celebrate with other runners after finishing a cross-country race of Ultimate Tsaigu Trail held in Taizhou, Zhejiang, in April. Yao hits the finish line to snatch the female runners' championship at the race in Taizhou in April. Photos Provided to China DailyQi was running at full speed, competing in a mountain race in Guizhou province in 2016. "She (Yao) was pretty and I couldn't forget her from that moment," says the 31-year-old from Yunnan province. More importantly, Qi saw the kindness in Yao, who didn't forget to offer aid to strangers, while pursuing her own prize in the race - which she went on to win. A love of running ensured that their two hearts began beating as one and, from that moment on, they have supported and cheered each other on in their respective running careers. "It feels very warm, and I have her on my mind whenever the two of us are in a race," Qi says. For Yao, being with Qi made her training more fun. They would give each other constructive advice and spur each other on. At the moment, the couple is busy preparing for the upcoming Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc in Chamonix, France. "Training together has been more productive, which has made me more determined to go further in my running career," Yao says. With boy band looks and an athletic body, Qi beat runners from home and abroad to win the men's championship in the 46 kilometers category at the 2017 Yading Skyrun, the first World Series Skyrunning event held in China. The race took runners from the Shangri-La town in Daocheng, Sichuan province, at an altitude of 2,900 meters, over mountainous routes around the sacred Chenresig holy peak in Yading at nearly 4,700 meters, before finishing near a temple at roughly 4,000 meters above sea level. This challenge, however, seemed to agree with Qi, who was born in a cold, high-altitude village. "When I was young, I had to walk long distances through rugged mountain roads with my father," Qi says. The father and son would leave home early to collect fresh produce, such as mushrooms and herbs, and then trek to the city to sell them. It was usually dark when they returned home on foot. "Walking or running among the mountains was a daily routine to me," he recalls. This tough, early life has given Qi a flair for sports. He finished a 3,000-meter race in 9 minutes and 40 seconds in the fourth grade in school. The performance would have put him in the top three of many college sport meetings later. On a summer vacation, after Qi finished primary school, he took 4 minutes and 5 seconds to finish running 1,500 meters, which was 10 seconds quicker than many adult athletes. The performance attracted the attention of coaches of the Hubei provincial track and field team, where Qi began to receive professional running training from the age of 13. "My trainer was very experienced and strict, and he protected me very well," Qi says. "I never suffered a single injury over the next 11 years, and the special conditioning of my ankles, knees and waist has kept paying dividends to this day." However, Qi got tired of running, with its tough training schedule, and he didn't want to run at all by the time he retired from the provincial track and field team in 2015. For a 27-year-old who's been living at the training base since his teenage years, Qi was at a loss as to how to make a living in the real world when the sole source of his income was gone. Phoenix's nirvana To make ends meet, there was nothing he could do but resume running - it was the only thing he was good at. So, Qi began running marathons for prize money. Years of training enabled Qi to sweep the board at the 2016 Changsha half-marathon in Hunan province, and again at an international marathon in Qingyuan, Guangdong province. Yet, Qi's heart wasn't really in it. "I didn't train very hard for the races, not to mention for recovery," Qi says. "I drank basically every day and rested on a quite erratic basis." Going through many marathons, running along the cemented roads of the concrete jungle, Qi often felt the urge to just stop, even in the middle of a race when he was leading the way. This halfhearted approach and money-driven state ended when Qi took part in his first cross-country race in Guizhou. "I threw my hat in the ring because I saw that it offered to cover the transportation fees," Qi says. However, his inexperience of cross-country running manifested itself after about 20 km when Qi suffered a muscle spasm. He dragged his feet through a 50 km race, because it was the only way he could get his travel costs paid, but the failure benefited him in a way far more significant than financial reward. It stirred his competitive spirit once more and prompted him to work on being able to successfully negotiate cross-country running competitions. Happily, he found, the more he went cross-country running, the more he enjoyed it - as if he was returning to his roots. "I feel that cross-country running is a culture and an art, and it's close to my heart," Qi says. "I grew up in the mountains, and cross-country brought me back to them. They are the environment that I'm familiar with." Qi then stunned the cross-country circuit by winning the Yading Skyrun, a 100 km mountain race in Chongqing city's Wulong district in 2017 and the Vibram Hong Kong 100 km Ultra Trail Race in 2018. From then on, he no longer ran just for money. "I then went to races in places with beautiful scenery and surrounding that tugged on my heartstrings," Qi says. Yao shares a similar background as Qi. The 24-year-old came from a poor family and had to commute 6 km between her home and school. The experience gave her a good physical foundation and saw her selected by a local sport school in the 9th grade of her last year in middle school, when she started her running career. Yao didn't start off as a hardworking athlete and didn't stand out in all of her races until, in 2014, she made it to the third place at the Haikou Marathon, and won her first prize money, a check for 5,000 yuan ($698). The event encouraged her to keep pushing herself further in training. Running together Yao has run at least 50 km a day since 2016, which has helped her to unlock her running potential. Carrying all before her, she won almost all of the cross-country competitions she entered in 2017, as well as the 2018 Ultra-Trail World Tour. The upcoming Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc in France features numerous high altitude passages, more than 2,500 meters in some cases, amid difficult environmental conditions, including nighttime stages, wind, rain and, potentially, snow. It is a cross-country runner's dream, with a route along mountain ridges, through villages, palm plantations, deep wadis and narrow gorges. An increasing number of Chinese runners have entered the race in recent years, and they have become the second biggest force, right up there with the top-tier European runners. Competitors need a very good training, specially-adapted equipment and strong personal fortitude, and the pair have been training in France since early August. "We spend all our time training, except for the necessary rest," Yao says. Last year, the couple entered the race's 101 km category. Yao stood out in the women's group, becoming the first Chinese woman to ever win the race. This year, the two are challenging themselves against the toughest category - the 170 km race. "Although I didn't get the result I wanted last year, I am deeply drawn to the cross-country culture of the race, so I signed up again this year," Qi says. For both, the race will be the longest of all their previous runs, and they are fully prepared. "The first goal is simply to finish," Qi says.

                    Experts face hurdles in observations of habitats
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                There are no records of the Chinese pangolin breeding in captivity, and most people remain unaware of the creature's existence until they read reports that it is threatened with extinction.Wu Shibao, a zoology and ecology professor from South China Normal University in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, said, "Scientific study of the Chinese pangolin is still at a very early stage and there are only about 30 experts nationwide who know the species well."Under China's Wildlife Protection Law, wild animals that are saved should be released into the wild after they recover, according to Wu. "But this makes long-term studies of the species' living habits and reproduction impossible," he said.While scientific observation of the Chinese pangolin is still difficult, Sunda pangolins rescued from smugglers have given scientists the chance to conduct research into saving the species from extinction.This month marked two months since the birth of a Sunda pangolin at the Pangolin Research Base for Artificial Rescue and Conservation Breeding in Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.The male is a third-generation captive-bred Sunda pangolin at the base.Yan Dingyu, the senior engineer who heads breeding trials at the base, said, "We hadn't seen any reports or research papers on the successful artificial reproduction of the Sunda pangolin for more than two generations. Our experience will be crucial in saving the critically endangered species from extinction."In addition to the newborn, the research base, established in 2012, currently has 38 Sunda pangolins, with 20 wild ones saved from cross-border smugglers. Two of these later gave birth to two babies. Thirteen of the rest are first-generation animals born through artificial reproduction, while the other three are second-generation animals."Pangolins are very sensitive and find it difficult to adapt to environmental changes," Yan said. "Also, they have highly specialized diets, including ants and termites. Under conditions in captivity, it is very difficult to provide a sufficient amount of the natural foods they need."Through years of study, Yan developed a special artificial food - a mixture of ants, termites, insects, worms and animal bones, as well as plants. Proportions of the ingredients had to be adjusted several times before digestion tests showed the diet had been a success.Providing the pangolins with a comfortable environment is another challenge. Yan said the creatures usually dig holes in the wild, and the depth and location of a hole can determine the temperature and humidity level inside. Sometimes, they will move from one place to another for a cleaner environment and to prevent infection from disease.The research team designed a special air-conditioned home with a small iron cage above the ground as a room for the animals to rest in. There is also an underground activity room occupying about 2 cubic meters.But Yan said that due to a lack of money, such conditions can only meet the basic requirements needed to keep the pangolins alive. The base has only received 600,000 yuan ($86,780) in financial support from the government in the past seven years.The same problem is being experienced at the Wildlife Rescue and Care Center in Changsha, Hunan province. Since late 2017, the center has rescued 60 live pangolins seized from smugglers by customs officers.However, many died just a few days after being saved, according to Li Li, a researcher from the center."The smugglers force-fed the pangolins with cement and plaster to increase their weight in order to get a higher price. It is impossible for most pangolins to survive such forced feeding," he said.Sixteen pangolins have been saved, according to Li. But their habitat in captivity cannot match that in the wild. All of them are housed in large cages bought originally to accommodate other wild animals temporarily. Each cage is no larger than 3 cu m and there is no underground area."We need more support to improve their living conditions by building better homes for them and providing them with a much friendlier environment, similar to that in the wild. This will be very beneficial, not only for their physical but also their physiological health," Li said.Yan, from the Guangxi base, said it will cooperate with wildlife experts from Beijing Forestry University next year in conducting further research into pangolins' physiological condition to gain a better understanding of the species."If the State Forestry and Grassland Administration grants permission, we will very likely launch a pilot plan to prepare some pangolins for a return to the wild next year. Hopefully, we will see further success soon," he said.

                    Legal system for women's rights protection subject to constant improvement: white paper
                </p>
            </a>

                BEIJING - The legal system for women's rights protection has been subject to constant improvement in China, according to a white paper released by the State Council Information Office Thursday.Built on the Constitution and with the Law of the People's Republic of China (PRC) on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women at the core, a legal system for the protection of women's rights and interests now covers over 100 separate laws and regulations, said the paper, titled "Equality, Development and Sharing: Progress of Women's Cause in 70 Years Since New China's Founding."The Constitution of the PRC, as the fundamental law of the country, has maintained the principle of gender equality, according to the white paper."Over the past 40 years of reform and opening up, China has constantly cemented the legal assurance for gender equality," it noted.Law of the PRC on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women that came into force in 1992 was the first fundamental law in China designed specifically for realizing gender equality and protecting rights and interests of women.It sets forth in details the legal rights and interests of women in politics, culture, education, property, personal affairs, marriage and family.An amendment to Law of the PRC on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women in 2005 officially established the legal status of gender equality as a fundamental national policy, according to the white paper.New breakthroughs have been made in the legislation for the protection of women's rights since the 18th CPC National Congress, said the white paper, citing the enactment of Anti-domestic Violence Law in 2015 as an example.
