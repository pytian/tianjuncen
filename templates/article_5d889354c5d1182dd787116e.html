                Trump urges India, Pakistan to reduce tensions in call with PMs
            </p>
            <p>
                Empty classrooms as some schools reopen in India-controlled KashmirNEW DELHI/ISLAMABAD－US President Donald Trump spoke with the leaders of India and Pakistan on Monday, discussing prospects for improved trade ties with Washington and stressing the need to reduce tensions over Kashmir between the nuclear-armed neighbors."Spoke to my two good friends, Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi of India, and Prime Minister (Imran) Khan of Pakistan, regarding Trade, Strategic Partnerships and, most importantly, for India and Pakistan to work toward reducing tensions in Kashmir. A tough situation, but good conversations!" Trump said in a Twitter post.Relations between Islamabad and New Delhi, already hostile, have been further strained over India's decision this month to revoke the special status of its portion of the Kashmir region that both countries claim. Pakistan reacted with fury, cutting transport and trade links and expelling India's ambassador in retaliation.Modi told Trump that he was hopeful that India's commerce minister and the US trade representative would meet again to discuss bilateral trade, the Indian government said in a statement.Washington confirmed that Trump and Modi had spoken about trade."The two leaders further discussed how they will continue to strengthen United States-India economic ties through increased trade, and they look forward to meeting again soon," the White House said. Trump also stressed during the call the need to lower tensions between India and Pakistan, it said.The White House said in a statement that Trump also had spoken with Pakistani Prime Minister Khan to "discuss the need to reduce tensions and moderate rhetoric" with India over the situation in Kashmir."The president reaffirmed the need to avoid escalation of the situation and urged restraint on both sides," the White House said in a statement, adding that Trump and Khan also agreed to work together to strengthen trade and economic ties.Khan, in his second conversation with Trump in three days on Kashmir issue, "expressed serious concern over a humanitarian crisis" in the region and hoped that Washington "would play its role in resolving the crisis", Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said.Khan also asked Trump to talk to Modi about ways to lower tensions, Qureshi said.Pakistan wants a United Nations observer mission to be "dispatched forthwith" to India-controlled Kashmir and for the curfew there to be "lifted immediately", Khan added.Some schools in India-controlled Kashmir reopened on Monday but were largely empty following weekend clashes in the city of Srinagar, two weeks after India removed the region's autonomy and imposed a lockdown.The authorities said they were reopening 190 primary schools in the city, yet few children could be seen at half a dozen locations visited by Agence France-Presse.New Delhi on Aug 5 ended the special constitutional status of Muslim-majority India-controlled Kashmir, where a 30-year-old unrest against Indian rule has killed tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians.Hours before its move, India curtailed movement and shut down phones and the internet, bringing in tens of thousands of troops to turn the main city of Srinagar into a fortress.Nearly 120,000 extra soldiers have been deployed, a security source said, joining around 500,000 already in the northern Himalayan region divided with Pakistan since 1947.Around 20 percent of landlines were working on Monday, an AFP reporter said. But mobile phones and the internet remained severed.Agencies

                Indian gunfire kills 3 Pakistani troops
            </a>
            <p>
                ISLAMABAD - The Pakistani army said on Thursday that three soldiers were killed as Indian forces opened fire along the Line of Control in the disputed Kashmir region. An army statement said that the Indian army has increased firing along the line in "efforts to divert attention from the precarious situation" in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Pakistan's army responded with gunfire and says it has killed five Indian soldiers and injured many others. India denies any of its soldiers were killed.

                Chinese UN envoy calls for peaceful means to resolve Kashmir issue
            </a>
            <p>
                UNITED NATIONS -- The Kashmir issue should be resolved properly through peaceful means in accordance with the United Nations Charter, relevant Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreement, a Chinese envoy said on Friday.Zhang Jun, Permanent Representative of China to the UN, told the press after a UN Security Council consultation that the issue of Kashmir is an issue left from history between India and Pakistan.According to relevant Security Council resolutions, the status of Kashmir is undecided and it is an internationally-recognized disputed area, he added. "The Kashmir issue should be resolved properly through peaceful means in accordance with the UN Charter, relevant Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreement.""This represents the consensus of the international community," he said.The Security Council on Friday held an informal consultation on India-Pakistan question and listened to the briefings given by the UN Secretariat on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and the work of the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP).The Council members said they are deeply concerned about the current situation and hope that the relevant parties will exercise restraint and not take unilateral action that will escalate tensions. They called on the two sides to properly resolve the issue through dialogue.The constitutional amendment by India has changed the status quo in Kashmir, causing tensions in the regions, Zhang said, adding that China is deeply concerned about the current situation and opposes any unilateral action that complicates the situation.China calls upon the relevant parties to exercise restraint, act prudently, and in particular, not take actions that will aggravate tensions, the envoy said.Zhang said that India's move has also challenged China's sovereignty interests and violated bilateral agreement on maintaining peace and stability in the border area. "China is seriously concerned.""I wish to emphasize that such practice by India is not valid in relation to China, and will not change China's exercise of sovereignty and effective administrative jurisdiction over the relevant territory," he added.Both India and Pakistan are China's friendly neighbors and major developing countries, said Zhang, adding that they are both at a crucial period of development.China calls on the two sides to set store by development of their own and peace in South Asia, find a proper solution to their historical grievances, discard the zero-sum game mentality, avoid unilateral action, and settle disputes peacefully to jointly maintain peace and stability in the region, the envoy said.

                The closed-door United Nations Security Council meeting on Friday, convened at the request of Pakistan on the situation in the disputed Kashmir, the first since 1965, ended without even an informal statement, prompting the Indian media to boast of India "thwarting lobbying by China, Pakistan".While New Delhi may see, and frame, it that way, the latest conflict it has provoked with Islamabad, will not end up as the kind of net gain it assumes.The ambitious administration of reelected Prime Minister Narendra Modi was swift in changing the status of Kashmir under India's domestic laws, insisting it was a "purely internal affair", but no change in Indian law changes the legal status of Kashmir as a disputed territory, over which Pakistan also claims sovereignty in its entirety. Besides escalating tensions not only with an estranged neighbor, and very possibly at home, it should also spark concern among the international community.The demographic changes New Delhi reportedly seeks through the move may or may not serve its agenda well. But the unilateral change to the status quo has already conspicuously upgraded tensions with Pakistan.Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged "heavy" fire last week across the line of control dividing the India- and Pakistan-controlled parts of Kashmir, during which several people were killed.As the latest UN Security Council meeting demonstrated, it is nearly impossible for the institution charged with preserving global peace to produce anything substantial regarding a controversial subject like this. At the end of the day, it has to be straightened out by Islamabad and New Delhi.In the Simla Agreement of 1972, both countries promised to settle the final status of Jammu and Kashmir by "peaceful means".There is no way out of the current impasse unless both parties exercise restraint, and return to the negotiating table. The only viable option is indeed constructive bilateral engagement.Their present priority is to make sure the situation does not further escalate, and get out of control.Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh's recent remarks about a possible change to his country's principle of "no first use" of nuclear weapons is worrying in that doing it may trigger a dangerous and exhausting nuclear arms race between the two neighbors. Which will inevitably threaten regional security.Kashmir has ignited two major wars between the two nuclear-armed arch-rivals. It should not be allowed to cause another one.New Delhi is apparently annoyed by outsider concerns about what it did. But the international community must not remain silent as the dangerous standoff may have broader consequences for the region, and beyond.

                Some curbs reimposed in India-controlled Kashmir
            </a>
            <p>
                SRINAGAR, India-controlled Kashmir－Indian authorities reimposed restrictions on movement in parts of India-controlled Kashmir's biggest city, Srinagar, on Sunday after overnight clashes between residents and police in which dozens were injured, two senior officials and eyewitnesses said.Since Saturday, there have been a series of protests against the decision on Aug 5 by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government to revoke the autonomy of the region.The officials said security forces had been pelted with stones on 47 occasions on Saturday night in the Kashmir Valley, and more than 20 on Sunday. One said the protests were growing more intense.On Saturday, about two dozen people reported to Srinagar's two main hospitals with injuries, mainly from pellets fired by Indian forces, said the officials, who declined to be named. Residents and police said many people with pellet wounds were not seeking treatment for fear of being identified and arrested.The state and federal governments did not respond to questions about the number of incidents and the level of injuries.India has imposed a security lockdown in its portion of Kashmir to avoid violence in reaction to the move to change the territory's status.The government has said it was gradually restoring phone lines and easing the lockdown, but changes were slow. Public buses were running in rural areas, but soldiers limited the movement of people on mostly deserted streets in Srinagar, the region's main city.The Press Trust of India reported that restrictions were reimposed in parts of Srinagar after violence was reported on Saturday.About 300 Kashmiris returned to Srinagar on Sunday from their Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia. Many of them became emotional while reuniting with their family members who met them at the city's airport. Due to the security and communications lockdown, many travelers were unable to contact relatives and friends in the Kashmir region.On Monday, Pakistan said Indian troops fired across the Line of Control in the disputed Kashmir region, killing two civilians.Pakistan and Indian often exchange fire in the Himalayan region, but tensions have increased since Aug 5 when New Delhi changed the status of India-controlled Kashmir, which is split between the nuclear-armed India and Pakistan. Both countries claim the entire area.Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Monday that civilian casualties occurred on Sunday because of "unprovoked cease-fire violations" by India in the border villages of Hot Spring and Chirikot.Pakistan and India have fought two wars over control of Kashmir since they won independence from British colonialists in 1947.AGENCIES

                India and Pakistan have to find a way out of security dilemma
            </a>
            <p>
                India and Pakistan have locked horns again, exchanging fire across the Line of Control on Saturday, one day after the United Nations Security Council convened an unofficial meeting on the dispute over Kashmir between the two neighbors.That New Delhi has scrapped the special status of India-administered Kashmir and thus changed the status quo of the disputed region has led to the flaring of tensions between the two neighbors. However, it is the security dilemma that India and Pakistan have been struggling to overcome for decades that is at the root of the problem.The two countries should have shaken off the burden of colonialism and treated each other as friendly neighbors after the British colonial rulers partitioned India into two countries in 1947. But the two sides have not shown the courage, confidence and wisdom to break from their colonial past and embrace a brighter future.The three wars, plus the 1999 Kargil conflict, the two sides have fought and the continuous exchange of fire across the Line of Control between them have made their bilateral dispute one of the most pressing issues in the world. No wonder India's move to change the status quo in Kashmir has evoked a strong response from Pakistan.The security dilemma has not only hurt the two countries' development but also affected regional peace and development. Both India and Pakistan have invested huge resources in pointless military confrontations, and diplomatic and public relations campaigns, as well as tried to develop nuclear weapons that are extremely costly to make and maintain. They could have used these resources to promote socioeconomic development had they not been locked in a security dilemma.In terms of regional development, the contradictions between the two sides have seriously restricted the integration of South Asia and made the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation all but defunct. Worse, the security dilemma has forced the two sides to see each other as enemies.But after decades of confrontation, both India and Pakistan should have realized the security dilemma is extracting a very high price from them. In terms of national strength, India largely outperforms its neighbor and constantly squeezes Pakistan's say in the international community, with many Indian strategists claiming that, if the strength disparity between the two sides continues to widen in favor of India, Pakistan will eventually cave in.The security dilemma, however, is a result of cognitive conflict, not the strength gap between the two sides. It would be impossible to end the conflict between the two sides if Pakistan's security concerns are not addressed. Besides, despite being relatively weak, Pakistan has enough power to restrain India's development and make India's dream of becoming a major power increasingly challenging and uncertain.As for Pakistan, its most pressing task should be to develop a modern national identity, stabilize its domestic politics, ensure orderly socioeconomic development, and promote tolerance among different religious and ethnic groups. And since its "nuclear deterrence" has reduced the possibility of a full-fledged war with India, Pakistan should allocate more resources to expedite development, including building the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.It is hoped, however, that in the long run, India and Pakistan would reach an agreement to "shelve their disputes and seek common development" and thus end the security dilemma. Given its advantage in national strength, India should adopt a strategy of restraint while trying to better understand Pakistan's complex political landscape and security situation. India should also try to comprehend and address Pakistan's genuine security concerns and pay heed to the Pakistani government's goodwill gesture of holding talks, rather than trying to strategically isolate Islamabad and issue irresponsible statements such as the one on changing India's "no first use" nuclear policy.It is also hoped the two countries would adjust their strategic thinking and build a more benign relationship which in turn would stabilize bilateral ties and promote regional peace and development.The author is deputy director of and an associate researcher at the Institute of South Asian Studies, China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations.
