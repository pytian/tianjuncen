                Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday his views and those of his Ukrainian counterpart Petro Poroshenko were "very close" on finding a political solution to the conflict in Ukraine, and called for both sides to observe a cease-fire.Outlining what he said was a seven-step plan "to end the bloodshed", Putin suggested Kiev and the rebels could reach an agreement at a meeting of the international contact group on Ukraine on Friday in the Belarussian capital Minsk.Putin's proposals included calls for both the rebels and Ukraine to halt military operations. He called on Ukraine to move its forces back from the front lines and refrain from shelling in civilian areas.
