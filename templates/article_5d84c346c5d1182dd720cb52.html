                Syrian army declares resumption of military operations in Idlib
            </p>
            <p>
                DAMASCUS - The Syrian army on Monday declared in a statement the resumption of military operations in the northwestern Idlib province, citing the cease-fire violation by the rebels, the state news agency SANA reported.The Syrian army said the "terrorist groups" refused to abide by the cease-fire deal in the de-escalation zone in Idlib and launched several attacks on civilians in nearby areas.The army statement assigned the blame on the Turkish-backed rebels, saying that the "Turkish government allowed its tools of terrorist groups in Idlib to continue their attacks and aggression".Given the fact that the cease-fire was conditional, the Syrian army will resume its military operation against the groups, the statement added.Earlier in the day, the pro-government al-Watan newspaper said the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front rejected to withdraw from the de-militarized zone in northwestern Syria as planned in recent Syrian talks.The Nusra Front, the backbone of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group, rejected to withdraw 20 km in depth of Idlib province as agreed upon by Turkey and Russia.Citing remarks by Abu Muhammad al-Golani, leader of the Nusra Front, the newspaper said that Golani declared his rejection to withdraw the 20 km regardless this request is made by "friends or enemies".By saying friends, Golani meant Turkey, which is backing and negotiating on behalf of the rebels, according to al-Watan.The 13th round of Syrian talks in the Nur-Sultan, capital of Kazakhstan, previously known as Astana, concluded on Aug 2 with the guarantors of the talks, as well as government and opposition delegations, agreeing to revive a cease-fire in the de-escalation zone and the retreat of the rebels 20 km in depth of Idlib.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported violations to the cease-fire, which went into force on the evening of Aug 1.The Observatory, however, said that there was a halt in the ground confrontation and airstrikes.Meanwhile, Golani said that battles could continue after the end of Eid al-Adha feast, a four-day feast that starts on Aug 11.His remarks mean that the recent cease-fire could fail entirely given the fact that the Nusra Front and its umbrella of the HTS are the strongest among other groups in Idlib.The de-escalation zones' deal was established last September under the supervision of Turkey and Russia.It includes Idlib, as well as countryside areas of the nearby provinces of Hama and Latakia and areas in Aleppo province in northwestern Syria.Idlib, in particular, is the last major rebel stronghold in the country.Last April, the military showdown returned on the surface and battles were reported in the northern countryside of Hama near Idlib.The army managed to capture key areas in the quest to advance into Idlib.Still, the battle for Idlib is considered a difficult one because of the fact that all of the rebel groups that retreated and defeated in other parts of the country have gathered in Idlib with no place else to go.

                UN vows to protect civilians in wars
            </a>
            <p>
                A Chinese envoy called for efforts to prevent conflict by resolving issues peacefully for the protection of civilians."Conflict prevention and conflict resolution through peaceful means represent the most effective way of protecting civilians," said Ma Zhaoxu, China's permanent representative to the United Nations.This year marks the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, a cornerstone of international humanitarian law. It also marks the 20th anniversary of the Security Council making the protection of civilians an item on its agenda."The Security Council should earnestly fulfill its primary responsibility of maintaining international peace and security, and strive to resolve conflicts by promoting dialogue and consultation and political negotiations, so that civilians can be spared from the scourge of war," he told the council in an open debate on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, held at UN headquarters in New York on Thursday."We must oppose the use of force or the threat of the use of force, and oppose power politics and bullying," he said.He called for the international community to form a concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, build partnerships based on dialogue rather than confrontation, friendship rather than alignment, so as to create a world of lasting peace and universal security.He also asked the international community to nurture an awareness of a shared future for mankind and advocate for the concept of global governance based on the idea of shared growth through collaboration.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said a culture of protection in the Security Council and across the UN has been in place for the past 20 years, including the deployment of special advisers in peace operations to protect children and all civilians from acts of sexual violence in conflict.Security Council-mandated UN peace operations have protected and saved countless civilian lives in many conflict zones, including South Sudan, where nearly 200,000 internally displaced civilians are currently being sheltered at protective sites.In the Central African Republic, the UN mission has supported local peace and ceasefire agreements that are monitored by civilian and military components.In addition, war criminals — including from Cambodia and the former Yugoslavia — have been tried and convicted. Security Council resolutions on the protection of medical care in armed conflict have given important focus and urgency to these issues."But, despite these advances, grave human suffering is still being caused by armed conflicts and a lack of compliance with international humanitarian law," he warned, noting that civilians continue to make up the vast majority of casualties in conflict.In 2018 alone, the UN recorded the death and injury of more than 22,800 civilians in just six countries: Afghanistan, Iraq, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen. Overall, some 1.4 million people were newly displaced across international borders, while a further 5.2 million were internally displaced.The World Health Organization recorded 705 attacks against healthcare workers and facilities in just eight conflicts, resulting in 451 deaths and 860 injuries, he continued.Separately, 369 aid workers were kidnapped, wounded or killed. Starvation of civilians was used as a method of warfare, as well as rape and sexual violence.There is also an urgent need to reduce the humanitarian impact of urban warfare, particularly explosive weapons."As bleak as the current state of protection is, there is considerable scope for improvement if we each do our utmost to promote and implement the rules that bind us to preserve humanity in war," he stressed."This is the best way that we can honor the twentieth anniversary of the protection agenda. We have the rules and laws of war. We all now need to work to enhance compliance."Peter Maurer, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), asked for unity in the Council on the protection of civilians in armed conflict."Not only are the decisions of all UN member states and especially the Security Council important, the absence of decisions by the council also takes its toll on civilians," said Maurer."In battlefields where the ICRC is today, too many actors take the absence of political convergence amongst you as a free ride for military operations without any limitations and without accountability," he told the Security Council.Maurer asked individual countries to prioritize the protection of civilians, to uphold international humanitarian law, and to set clearer frameworks for their troops and clearer ground rules."As we mark the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions this year, we urge states to recall their spirit, which is to uphold human dignity in the midst of armed conflict," he said.

                US calls Russian, Syrian air strikes 'reckless escalation' in Syria
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - The United States continues to be alarmed by Syrian government and Russian air strikes in northwest Syria and believes they are a "reckless escalation" of violence, the State Department said on Tuesday.Government air strikes, backed by Russia, have focused on the south of Idlib province and nearby parts of Hama, uprooting nearly 250,000 people. The bombing has killed 229 civilians and injured 727 others, according to the UOSSM medical charity."Indiscriminate attacks on civilians and public infrastructure such as schools, markets and hospitals is a reckless escalation of the conflict and is unacceptable," said State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus."The violence must end," Ortagus said.Hundreds of members of the US Congress signed a letter to President Donald Trump last week arguing that the United States should remain engaged with the conflict in Syria, saying they were "deeply concerned" about extremist groups in the country.Many US lawmakers, Trump's fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, have been deeply concerned about Syria policy since December, when Trump decided to withdraw all 2,000 US troops from Syria. Trump later agreed to leave a small US presence to help keep pressure on Islamic State.Reuters

                UN chief strongly condemns airstrikes in northwest Syria
            </a>
            <p>
                UNITED NATIONS - UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned ongoing airstrikes impacting civilians, including those on medical facilities and medical workers, in northwest Syria, his spokesman said Thursday.On Wednesday, several health facilities were reportedly hit in northwest Syria, including a hospital in Maarat al-Numan, one of the largest hospitals in the area.Stephane Dujarric, the spokesman, said the hospital in Maarat al-Numan was struck despite that its coordinates had been shared through the UN de-confliction mechanism."The Secretary-General reiterates his urgent call for the September 2018 Memorandum of Understanding on Idlib to be upheld," he said, referring to agreement on the de-escalation zone brokered by Russia and Turkey for Idlib in northwest Syria.Civilians and civilian infrastructure, including medical facilities, must be protected, parties to the Syria conflict must respect their obligations under international humanitarian law, Dujarric said, adding perpetrators of serious violations of international humanitarian law must be held accountable.

                Rebels withdraw from key bastion in Syria's Idlib
            </a>
            <p>
                 DAMASCUS - The rebel groups in the town of Khan Shaykhun in the northwestern province of Idlib and other key towns in the adjacent countryside of Hama province were forced to withdraw as a result of the offensive by the Syrian army in that region, a war monitor reported.The rebel groups withdrew from Khan Shaykhun in the southern countryside of Idlib for fear of being fully besieged by the Syrian army, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.The rebels also pulled out from other key towns to the south of Khan Shaykhun, including al-Latamneh, Kafr Zita and Morek, which are located in the northern countryside of Hama province, said the UK-based watchdog group.The aforementioned areas had been key bastions for rebel groups in Idlib and Hama provinces.

                Syrian army fully secures key town in Idlib
            </a>
            <p>
                DAMASCUS - The Syrian army has entered all areas in the town of Khan Shaykhun after the defeat of the rebel groups in that area in the countryside of Idlib province, a military source told Xinhua on Thursday.The source said the army units entered all areas in Khan Shaykhun, a former rebel bastion that was retaken by the army on Wednesday.The source said the military campaign that led to capturing the Khan Shaykhun had started from areas in the adjacent northern countryside of Hama province in central Syria."After launching the military operation from the northern countryside of Hama toward the towns of the southern countryside of Idlib, the army captured the town of Khan Shaykhun, which is considered as one of the major fortifications of the terrorist groups in Idlib," he said.He noted that the progress enabled the army to complete the siege on key rebel-held areas in the northern countryside of Hama."With this progress, the army has completed the siege on the towns of Morek, al-Lataminah and Kafr Zita," he said.The army has recently advanced to the town of Khan Shaykhun in a bid to capture it and secure the part of the main Damascus-Aleppo highway near Idlib.Idlib and the northern countryside of Hama are included in the de-escalation zone deal that was reached between Russia and Turkey last September.The deal, however, has largely failed despite several attempts to revive it.The latest attempt to fix the deal came earlier this month when Turkey and Russia mediated a fresh cease-fire in Idlib, which failed quickly with the resumption of the military showdown.Earlier in the day, the Syrian government declared opening a humanitarian corridor for civilians desirous of leaving battlefield areas in the countryside region of the provinces of Idlib and Hama, according to a foreign ministry statement.The corridor was set up in the Souran area in the northern countryside of Hama province to enable the civilians to leave rebel-held areas in the countryside of Hama and the adjacent countryside of Idlib.The Syrian Foreign Ministry said the measure comes in light of the Syrian government's keenness to alleviate the suffering of the civilians.It said all the humanitarian needs of the civilians will be met such as medical help and shelters.Several Turkey-backed rebel groups are located in the Idlib province near the Turkish border, but the most powerful group there is the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the umbrella group of the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front.For the Syrian army, securing Idlib would almost deal a definite defeat to the over eight-year-long insurgency against the administration of President Bashar al-Assad.Idlib is also strategically important as it shares a border area with Turkey to the north. It's also close to the coastal province of Latakia, the hometown of Assad which contains a Russia-run air base repeatedly targeted by rebel drones launched from Idlib.The capital city of Idlib also lies close to the international road linking the capital Damascus with Aleppo in northern Syria.Around 3 million people are living in Idlib, including those evacuated from other areas during the surrenders of the rebels.

                Assad adviser: Cease-fire in Syria's Idlib 'temporary'
            </a>
            <p>
                DAMASCUS, Syria - The ceasefire that was declared during the weekend by the Syrian army in the last major rebel stronghold in the northwestern province of Idlib is "temporary", Syria's presidential adviser Buthaina Shabaan said. Local media outlets cited Shabaan on Sunday as saying that the ceasefire, which entered into force in Idlib on Saturday, was a unilateral decision by Russia and Syria and is not part of any other understandings. The presidential adviser said the Turkish army, which entered parts of Idlib, will be "forced" to leave Syria. On Friday, the Syrian army agreed to observe a cease-fire in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold in the country, as of Saturday morning. The Syrian army said it reserves the right to respond to any violation by the al-Qaida-linked al-Nusra Front, the backbone of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which is the most powerful rebel group in Idlib. Hours ahead of the official Syrian announcement, Russia's Defense Ministry declared the cease-fire, noting that it is a "unilateral" move to stabilize the situation in Idlib. It urged the rebels to abandon armed provocations and join the peace process. This is the second truce announced in Idlib this month. On Aug 1, a Russian and Turkish-backed cease-fire was reached but it quickly collapsed. Since then, battles flared and the Syrian government forces were able to make notable gains, capturing key areas in the southern countryside of Idlib and the adjacent northern countryside of Hama province. The new cease-fire aims at halting the fighting in Idlib between the Syrian army and the al-Qaida-linked groups. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that cautious calm prevailed Idlib on Saturday. However, the Britain-based watchdog group said that the Syrian army fired tens of shells on rebel positions on Sunday. The countryside of Hama and the adjacent Idlib Province are included in the de-escalation zone established by Russia and Turkey last September. Under the deal, Turkish observation points were set up in some areas in Idlib and Hama. However, the deal failed to materialize as the al-Nusra Front refused to withdraw and fighting continued.

                Leaders say Syrian charter panel ready
            </a>
            <p>
                          ANKARA, Turkey - The presidents of Turkey, Russia and Iran announced on Monday that an agreement has been finally reached on the composition of a committee tasked with rewriting Syria's constitution as part of a political solution to the country's civil war, now in its ninth year.              Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told journalists at the end of the meeting with Russia's Vladimir Putin and Iran's Hassan Rouhani in the Turkish capital Ankara that differences about one last committee member have been overcome, paving the way for the committee to start working as soon as possible.                  "We portrayed a constructive and flexible attitude to determine constitutional committee members and rules of procedure. We made an effort for the political process to move forward. In short, hitches regarding the establishment of the committee were eliminated by our mutual efforts," Erdogan said.                      The leaders did not provide a time frame for the committee - set to be made up of Syrian government and opposition figures - to begin its proceedings. The procedural rules still have to be worked out, Putin told reporters.                          "The proceedings must begin rapidly," Putin said. "Extremist groups may try and destroy this process because they do not want a final agreement since they gain money from war."                              Rouhani said he hoped for elections to take place in Syria in 2020 or 2021.                                  The leaders also agreed to de-escalate the volatile situation in Idlib - the last remaining rebel stronghold in Syria - while combating extremists and protecting civilians. A cease-fire that went into effect at the end of August has been holding despite some violations.                                      Idlib is dominated by the al-Qaida-linked group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. Syrian forces, backed by Russia, targeted the armed group in a four-month ground and air offensive.                                          Hundreds of thousands of Syrians, some already displaced from other parts of the country, have moved toward Turkey's border. A major conflict in Idlib has raised the possibility of a mass refugee flow to Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees.                                              "We cannot stand by and watch a new tragedy that would affect 4 million people right next to our border," Erdogan said. "Such a calamitous development would not only affect our country but also all of Europe."                                                  De-escalation zone                                                      A joint statement issued at the end of the meeting said the three leaders underscored the need "to fully implement" an agreement reached between Turkey and Russia last year for a de-escalation zone in Idlib.                                                          The statement said the sides had agreed to take concrete steps to reduce violations." They expressed alarm "about the risk of further deterioration of the humanitarian situation," according to the statement.                                                              "We all stand for Syria's territorial integrity and insist that after the problems of security and the fight against terrorists are resolved, Syria's territorial integrity will be fully restored. This concerns withdrawal of all foreign troops from Syria's territory," the statement said.
