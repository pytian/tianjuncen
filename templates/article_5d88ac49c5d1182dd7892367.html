                    Study reveals possible mechanism behind human embryo implantation
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                BEIJING - Chinese researchers have revealed how the gene regulatory network and epigenetic mechanisms potentially control the human embryo implantation process.After a sperm fertilizes an egg, they become a totipotent embryo which is capable of differentiating into an unlimited number of specialized cell types. It travels and attaches itself into the wall of the uterus at about the seventh day, which is called implantation. Then, it is possible for the embryo to initiate a successful pregnancy.Implantation failure is a major cause of early pregnancy loss in humans. Due to the difficulty of obtaining human embryos early after implantation, rodent and monkey embryos were usually used in previous studies, which cannot accurately show regulatory mechanisms of implantation in humans.In the study published in the journal Nature, researchers from Peking University and Peking University Third Hospital observed and analyzed human peri-implantation embryos in vitro culture system for the embryo development after implantation.The researchers reconstructed the process of human embryo implantation, generating a map of gene regulatory network and DNA methylation at whole genome-scale.DNA methylation is a chemical alteration to DNA in mammals that controls how active a gene is within a cell. During peri-implantation development, embryonic cells are directed toward their future lineages, and DNA methylation poses a fundamental epigenetic barrier that guides and restricts differentiation.The researchers said that a mother-to-offspring connection is prepared to be established during implantation. The first three cell lineages produced by the embryo presented different increasing paces of DNA methylation.For instance, some hormone-related genes are expressed in trophoblasts, cells forming the outer layer of the cellular mass of the embryo.The researchers said this study provides insights into the complex molecular mechanisms that regulate the implantation of human embryos in the hope of inspiring the reproductive medicine."With the black box of this unique embryonic developmental stage being gradually uncovered, we are about to provide the possibility of early diagnosis and screening of defective embryos before the embryo transplantation," said Tang Fuchou from Peking University, corresponding author of the study.The researchers terminated the in vitro culture of embryos before day 14 in accordance to the international ethical guideline.

                    ILLEGAL SPY CAMERAS TRAP UNWARY GUESTS

                Devices in hotels, store changing rooms collect footage sold onlineLegal experts and privacy advocates are calling for a crackdown on offenses involving high-tech digital devices amid increasing reports of people being filmed secretly in places such as public restrooms and changing rooms in department stores.In Jining, Shandong province, more than 100,000 recordings were made of guests staying in hotel rooms, where 300 minicams were installed inside lamps, television sets, air conditioners and electrical sockets.In March, the Ministry of Public Security disclosed the case, announcing the arrest of 29 people for illegally filming and livestreaming unsuspecting hotel guests.The recordings were posted online. Voyeurs who bought a login ID, costing 100 to 300 yuan ($14 to $42), could access an app connected to the spy cameras and surreptitiously view activity in the rooms.Some of the perpetrators also downloaded the footage, saved it in cloud files and then sold it online.On June 15, a woman in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, noticed a button-shaped camera in the fitting room of a Uniqlo store, describing it as "a black dot wrapped in gum".On the same day, a couple who checked into the Yutai Hotel in Zhengzhou, Henan province, found a pinhole camera hidden in a socket under the TV. Police checked other rooms at the hotel and discovered another spy camera, but the manager denied responsibility.No official data has been released about the number of people who have been secretly filmed or on how many video clips or images have been posted online.According to Nanfang Metropolis Daily in Guangdong, from to 2016 to last year, there were reports of hidden cameras being found in at least 35 hotels in 24 cities.Zhang Jie, a lawyer from the PW & Partners Law Firm in Guangdong, said: "Technological development has enabled images to be shot, distributed and reproduced very easily. The easy availability of hidden-camera technology and lenient punishment for these crimes are the two main reasons that invasion of privacy is increasing. Authorities need to pay more attention to this."On Aug 8 in Fuzhou, capital of Fujian province, a woman suddenly heard a fizzing sound coming from the TV in the apartment she and her husband had rented for nearly six months."It didn't make any sense to me because we had never turned the TV on.... We never watch it," the woman said in media reports. "I checked and found a tiny hole in the side panel."She said she felt disgusted after she took the TV apart and found a spy camera connected to a circuit board and a 32-gigabyte memory card. The couple had been living under the watchful eye of the hidden camera, which was set to record activity in the room from 9 pm until the following morning.They immediately called the police. A week later, a statement issued by local police said they had arrested a suspect - the apartment's former tenant. He was given 10 days' detention.The same punishment was given to an internet technology worker who had installed the button-sized camera in the Uniqlo fitting room in Shenzhen in June.According to legal experts, legislation on the invasion of privacy does not go far enough.In China, nonconsensual voyeurism is not a criminal offense. Under the Administrative Punishments Law, anyone who secretly photographs or records others faces a maximum punishment of just 10 days in administrative detention and a fine of up to 500 yuan."In cases of such voyeurism, no criminal offense has been committed," Zhang said. "Only if the footage is distributed or sold can a case be considered under the crime of disseminating obscene material (for profit)."However, such wrongdoing invades victims' privacy and can ruin a life in a flash. The current legislation is far from being tough enough to deter voyeurism. Once these video clips are leaked online, the harm it does to victims cannot be over-exaggerated."Lawsuits optionWang Deshan, an associate professor of law at Capital University of Economics and Business in Beijing, suggested that illegal filming could be included in the Criminal Law."To address the problem, it is reasonable to include the offense in the Criminal Law. However, the Criminal Law is designed to punish those who cause severe harm to society as a whole, so legislators also have to be very careful in determining if the hidden cameras are installed in private places, how many victims are involved and if the perpetrator has violated the law before. All these must be considered," Wang said.According to Zhang, victims of illegal photography can file civil lawsuits against perpetrators, but those who advocate restricting access to hidden cameras are likely to be disappointed.Buying spy cameras online is easy, despite the fact that it is illegal in China to produce and sell "espionage equipment" that can be used to secretly monitor and photograph people.A search on Taobao and many other online stores for "micro-camera shooting" produces multiple hits. Sales of the small, square, black cameras have also been booming at many bricks-and-mortar stores, including those in Huaqiangbei, an area in Shenzhen known for selling electrical goods, according to a report on July 19 by State broadcaster China Central Television.The report documented vendors selling secret cameras disguised as pens, lighters, clothes hangers and water bottles.Most of them cost less than 300 yuan."It is illegal to produce and sell pinhole cameras without permission from the relevant State departments in China," Wang said, referring to a 2015 regulation banning the production, sale and use of "espionage equipment", including spy cameras, without government permission.In January, the Ministry of Commerce introduced an administrative regulation on e-commerce, prohibiting the sale of such equipment online.Under the regulation, once an e-commerce platform discovers illegal sales of spy cameras, it is responsible for taking necessary measures and reporting such activity to the authorities.Wang said the evolution of digital technology has prompted massive demand for hidden cameras. More important, the huge profits that can be made can encourage some retailers to break the law."But in practice, few perpetrators are prosecuted for the illegal production and sale of secret cameras. What is plain to see is the difficulty of detecting such secretive gadgets, but there is also lax law enforcement."Difficulties such as these have left many people frustrated - especially over the lack of privacy for women, the most frequent targets of spy cameras.From 2015 to last year, more than 100 women were secretly filmed by "Mr Hang", a prominent name online. He sold the videos to a pornographic website for 200 yuan each, earning a total of 600,000 yuan.He was arrested in January last year and sentenced to 11 years in prison with a 400,000 yuan fine for producing and selling intimate videos online.The difference in this case was that "Mr Hang" appeared in many of the videos.His job required him to travel widely, and he took young women he ran into at airports or high-class restaurants to his hotel room, where he had installed hidden cameras facing the bed.Until they were recognized, the women were unaware that they were being filmed."A lot of the victims found out through others who had seen the footage," said Kong Weiwei, founder of the Xiaohongmao Charity.The nonprofit organization is dedicated to detecting and uncovering "bad pick-up artist groups", a label commonly given in China to those helping men find women for anything from casual to long-term relationships.According to Legal Daily, such groups offer instructions in cajoling, duping and even threatening women with intimate videos to procure sex and/or payoffs.Kong's charity program, established in 2017, has helped more than 350 women. Many of the victims approached her and told how they had been tricked.Many of them feel so "daunted and frightened" that they cannot continue their normal social activities, Kong said. "In extreme cases, the women even commit suicide.""More than 90 percent of women targeted by these men... are secretly filmed," the 29-year-old said, adding, "But few of them go to the police, because they feel ashamed of being exposed online." Kong said she has long encouraged women to take legal action to protect their rights."Some of them tend to blame themselves for having no sense of self-protection, rather than resorting to the law. I think women should stand up (for themselves). The more cases that are reported to the police, the more this will grab the attention of legal departments. This in turn will promote social governance, which was also one of the reasons I founded Xiaohongmao."Protests in SeoulSimilar cases have been reported globally, with spy cameras being particularly prevalent in South Korea.More than 6,000 such cases were reported in the country in 2017, and about 6,800 last year, up from 2,400 in 2012.More than 5,400 people were arrested for crimes related to spy cameras in 2017, but fewer than 2 percent were imprisoned.Anger at the widespread use of hidden cameras prompted a series of protests last year in Seoul, the capital, when more than 50,000 women took to the streets to demand tougher sentencing for voyeurs.Two months later, 8,000 workers were assigned to inspect the city's 20,554 public restrooms, a move critics said would not solve the root cause of the problem.Seoul is also battling illegal filming in the accommodations sector, with a special task force consisting of government officials, police and the public being formed in June to inspect hotel rooms.But while authorities are supposed to impose stricter penalties on voyeurism, the hotels and clothing shops cannot ignore their responsibilities.Qiu Baochang, director of the Beijing Lawyers Association's Consumer Rights Protection Committee, said, "Business operators have an obligation to protect customers' privacy."Under the law in China that protects consumer rights and interests, business operators must guarantee that the goods and services they supply meet personal or property safety requirements.Wang, the law professor, said: "When a customer pays for a hotel room, he or she forms a contractual relationship with the operator. Contract law also has regulations stating that the room provided should be suitable for living, which obviously does not include the installation of hidden cameras. Consumers can seek compensation from hotel operators, even if they were not the ones who set up the hidden cameras."Bai Xiaoli, a lawyer at the Anli Partners law firm in Beijing, suggested the authorities could also send special teams to carry out regular inspections of hotels and shopping malls, as South Korea has done.The former judge said authorities should provide legal instructions for victims to safeguard their rights. For example, the Consumers Association could set up a "green channel" for complaints.Zhang, the lawyer, said the crux of this growing problem may be due to a longstanding social tradition in China."People in our country do not value their privacy very much. It is no big deal for some people if their ID number or photo are obtained and spread illegally online. This results in insufficient legal control over privacy infringements such as secret filming," Zhang said."If we want to root this out, we should also focus on how to enhance people's awareness of safeguarding their privacy. When the whole of society, including the government, pays more attention to privacy, then infringements such as secret filming may decline."The government is stepping up efforts to crack down on voyeurism.Late last month, the market regulation administration in Shenzhen raided a security products manufacturer, seizing 552 nonstandard spy cameras valued at about 60,000 yuan.Some netizens on Sina Weibo are calling for people to be more careful about privacy infringement.They post short videos online, teaching people how to use special devices to detect hidden cameras.One of the posts stated, "May we be the protagonists of our lives, not the ones under the lenses of others."zhaoruinan@chinadaily.com.cn(China Daily Global 08/28/2019 page2)

                    Australian police seize record 755 kg drugs in frozen cow hides
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                SYDNEY - Authorities in Australia have seized a record 755 kg of crystal methamphetamine (ice) uncovered inside a shipment of raw animal hides.As the largest onshore seizure of ice originating from Mexico, Australian Federal Police (AFP) confirmed on Thursday they have charged a 42-year-old Mexican national who allegedly organized the importation on behalf of an international crime syndicate.With an estimated street value of 566.3 million Australian dollars ($381 million), the operation began on Aug 13 when a freight of 18 pallets of frozen, raw and untreated cow skins arrived in Sydney labeled "Salty Bovine Skin Cuero Verde Salado De Bovino".Under closer examination, Australian Border Force (ABF) officers detected 161 silver packages of a suspicious white substance hidden within the skin.Forensic testing later determined the packages contained high-grade crystal methamphetamine."Hiding drugs in untreated cow hides presented a significant biological hazard for AFP and ABF members extracting it," said AFP Commander and State Manager for Victoria and Tasmania Amanda Kates."It once again shows organized criminal syndicates have no conscience or care for those they are targeting with their illegal products."These syndicates rely on human suffering at all stages of their activities; this occurs at the supply end in Mexico, through to the harm suffered by users and their families here in Australia."She said that consuming drugs are helping organized crime to flourish.On Wednesday, AFP officers executed two search warrants at properties in Melbourne linked to the man who was charged.Now facing the prospect of life imprisonment under Australian law if found guilty, ABF Regional Commander of Victoria and Tasmania State Craig Palmer said the arrest could not have been made without vital information gained from intelligence work."This is the fourth major detection of ice in just three months. It comes just two months after the country's largest ever onshore methamphetamine consignment here in Melbourne - 1.6 tonnes concealed in stereo speakers.

                    Millennium-old royal tomb found in North China
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                HOHHOT -- Chinese archaeologists have uncovered a royal tomb dating back around 1,000 years in North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region, according to the regional institute of cultural relics and archaeology.Found in Kailu county in eastern Inner Mongolia, the ceiling of the single-chamber tomb is decorated with crane-patterned murals. Archaeologists also unearthed valuable burial objects such as glass and gold wares, as well as a coping stone made of two huge pieces of granite, which was likely sourced from outside the area, archaeologists said.Based on its structure and design, the tomb was probably built in the early Liao Dynasty (916-1125) and belonged to the royal family, said Lian Jilin, a researcher at the institute, noting that the occupant has yet to be identified.A royal tomb cluster was discovered one km away three years ago, which provided important materials for further research on the specific position of Longhua State, an ancient city built in 902 by Yelu Abaoji (Emperor Taizu of Liao), khagan of the nomadic Khitans who once ruled the northern part of China.Excavation and further research are underway.
