                A short video clip from the Fengshen Trilogy at a Beijing International Film Festival (BIFF) promotional event in Toronto won a round of applause at the Bell Lightbox of the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).Du Yang, vice president of Beijing Culture, said she was proud to present the film project at TIFF, one of the world's top film festivals."With a total investment of over 3 billion yuan, we have assembled the world's top-notch teams to develop this project, aiming to initiate the Chinese mythology film and present China's time-honored literary epic to the world," Du said.Cui Yan, deputy executive director of BIFF, said it has made great strides in the past nine years and forged cooperation with major film festivals like TIFF."We aim to further promote Chinese film industries and strengthen the international cooperation, and build a big communication platform for films in Asia," Cui said.As a "going abroad" program, BIFF is just one of the strategic approaches for Chinese films going global.The filmmakers from North America shared their insights on the implications for the globalization of China's growing movie industry, as well as how Chinese film could integrate its culture internationally.Cameron Hood, a senior story artist, director and producer at Cameron Hood Studios, told China Daily that he loves writing stories, specifically for the world market."Like Minions, I make a lot of money in China, and I am looking for Chinese partners to see what the next big idea for the China market could be as well as for the rest of the world," he said.Hood has visited China and worked with studios in Wu Xi, and brought Western style animation to Chinese partners."We come up with lots of collaboration, because the audiences in China are going so fast. When I did master class in China … the students were very professional, and they keep learning and sharing," he added.Liz Taylor, the president of Wild Maple Films, said she is learning the Chinese language and hoping to shoot pictures and co-produce in China."I really want to collaborate with China because this is the country I really love ... the culture and the people," Taylor said.Raymond Massey of Massey Productions, who co-produced the film Iron Road with China in 2007, said the company is interested in telling Chinese stories around the world."I go to China frequently, and I am excited by China," said Massey. "I have been working with China projects every year since producing of Iron Road. China has a special place in my heart."Unlike here in North America, investors can be only behind the producers who make the movie, but Chinese film investors sometimes drive the producers, and they always ask what day they could make profits," he said.Another hiccup is the language, because Chinese movies need English subtitles in the Western market, which can limit the promotion and distribution of films. "And most of the Western audiences here only know a few Chinese filmmakers, such as Zhang Yimo, Feng Xiaogang, Jackie Chan," Massey added.

                    Dorian still slamming eastern Canada at hurricane force
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                TORONTO — The storm that has already walloped the Virgin Islands, Bahamas and North Carolina brought hurricane-force winds to far-eastern Canada on Sunday, knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of people.Dorian hit near the city of Halifax Saturday afternoon, ripping roofs off apartment buildings, toppling a huge construction crane and uprooting trees. There were no reported deaths in Canada, though the storm was blamed for at least 50 elsewhere along its path.The US National Hurricane Center said the post-tropical cyclone was centered about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Chevery, Quebec, Sunday afternoon. Top sustained winds had slipped to 75 mph (120 kph), just above the threshold of hurricane force. It was heading to the northeast, roughly up the St. Lawrence River, at 25 mph (41 kph).The track would bring the storm near or over northwestern Newfoundland or eastern Labrador during the afternoon and over the North Atlantic in the evening.Nova Scotia officials asked people in the province to stay off the roads so crews could safety remove trees and debris and restore power.The government said that up to 700 Canadian military personnel will be fanning out across the Maritimes to help restore electricity, clear roadways and evacuate residents in flooded areas.Nova Scotia Power Inc. chief executive Karen Hutt said there were over 400,000 Nova Scotia Power customers without power at the peak of the storm and 50,000 have since been restored. But she said some could remain without service for days.As the storm plowed into Prince Edward Island, about 50,000 homes and businesses were soon without power, as were another 74,000 in New Brunswick.By far the greatest devastation caused by the storm was in the Bahamas, where Dorian struck a week ago as a Category 5 hurricane with 185 mph (295 kph) winds, and then hovered just offshore for more than a day and a half, obliterating thousands of homes.Planes, cruise ships and yachts were evacuating people from the Abaco Islands and officials were trying to reach areas still isolated by flooding and debris.The country's National Emergency Management Agency said it was sending in extra staff because operations had been hampered by the storm's impact on local workers.The agency said it was setting up shelters or temporary housing for the newly homeless across the islands and appealed for Bahamians to take in storm victims.Health Minister Duane Sands said Sunday the death toll had risen by one to 44. Dorian was blamed for five deaths in the U.S. Southeast and one in Puerto Rico.Meanwhile, floodwaters were receding from North Carolina's Outer Banks, leaving behind a muddy trail of destruction. The storm's worst damage in the US appeared to be on Ocracoke Island, which even in good weather is accessible only by boat or air and is popular with tourists for its undeveloped beaches.Residents who waited out the storm described strong winds followed by a wall of water that flooded the first floors of many homes and forced some to await rescue from their attics."We're used to cleaning up dead limbs and trash that's floating around," said Ocracoke business owner Philip Howard said Saturday. "But now it's everything: picnic tables, doors, lumber that's been floating around."Gov. Roy Cooper said about 800 people had remained on the island to wait out Dorian, which made landfall Friday morning over the Outer Banks as a far weaker storm than the monster that devastated the Bahamas.The governor said officials were aware of no serious injuries on the Outer Banks from the storm. About 200 people were in shelters and 45,000 without power Saturday, according to the governor's office. Emergency officials transported fuel trucks, generators, food and water to Okracoke.Dorian also lashed the eastern tip of Maine with heavy rain, strong winds and high surf as the storm passed offshore. Several hundred homes and businesses lost power.AP

                    Amid fears of higher death toll, islanders vie to leave Bahamas

                MARSH HARBOR, Bahamas - Bahamians scrambled to escape the islands hardest hit by Dorian, which has killed at least 43 people, while the storm wreaked "havoc" farther north in Canada after making landfall near Halifax on Saturday.Even as some Bahamians began to reunite with their loved ones, the death toll - 35 so far in the Abaco Islands and eight in Grand Bahama - was likely to climb "significantly", according to Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Minnis.A loosely coordinated armada of passenger planes, helicopters and both private and government boats and ships, including redirected cruise liners, converged in the Bahamas on the horribly battered Abacos to help with evacuations, both to Nassau and to the US mainland.Evacuees began flowing out of the region as a cruise ship carrying 1,400 people docked on Saturday in Riviera Beach, Florida, CNN reported. All had documents to enter the United States.The US Coast Guard said all Bahamian ports had reopened and that it had deployed nine cutters to the islands. Six of its MH-60 Jayhawk helicopters had so far rescued 290 people.More than 260 Abacos residents arrived on Friday in Nassau, the capital, on a government-chartered ferry, part of the first wave of people to be evacuated off the archipelago's most decimated islands.Bahamas residents said conditions on the devastated islands were brutal and that the smell of unrecovered bodies, along with mounting piles of garbage, was oppressive and unsanitary.Hundreds or even thousands of people were still missing, officials said, as search-and-rescue teams continued their grim retrievals.Meanwhile, thousands of miles (kilometers) north, Dorian, now classified as a post-tropical cyclone, was "wreaking havoc over the Canadian Maritimes", the US-based National Hurricane Center said.Power outages in Canada More than 500,000 power outages were reported according to the Canadian Hurricane Center, which said the problem extended across the Maritimes, a three-province region in east Canada comprising Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.Dorian made landfall earlier in the day south of the port city of Halifax, home to Canada's Atlantic fleet."We're talking about a very dangerous storm," Bob Robichaud of the Canadian Hurricane Center told a news conference.Television images showed a downpour and howling winds in the empty streets of downtown Halifax where a crane collapsed onto a semi-constructed building and a roof was torn off another apartment.No significant injuries or fatalities had been reported, according to Halifax Regional Police late on Saturday, The Toronto Star reported.Police had evacuated 150 people from downtown Halifax, including residents of the apartment buildings, they said.In the Bahamas, the prime minister has said Nassau "cannot possibly accommodate" all the Abaco victims.For now, he said, supplies of food and water were adequate, although several witnesses from Abaco contested that.While Minnis called the loss of life "catastrophic and devastating", Health Minister Duane Sands said the final death toll "will be staggering."UN relief officials said more than 70,000 people on Grand Bahama and Abaco were in need of assistance. The UN World Food Program was sending food and supplies. The Food Program team estimated that 90 percent of buildings in Marsh Harbour were damaged.The US Coast Guard, Britain's Royal Navy and private organizations have been helping evacuate island residents to Nassau, hampered by damaged piers and airport runways.Chamika Durosier was waiting on Saturday at the Abaco airport. The island, she said, was unsafe."The home that we were in fell on us," she said. "We had to crawl - got out crawling. By the grace of God, we are alive."Agencies

                    Dorian lashes Canada, then weakens

                TORONTO, Canada - The storm that already walloped the Virgin Islands, Bahamas and North Carolina lashed at far eastern Canada with hurricane-force winds for much of on Sunday, knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of people before weakening and heading into the North Atlantic Ocean.Dorian hit near the city of Halifax on Saturday afternoon, ripping roofs off apartment buildings, toppling a huge construction crane and uprooting trees. There were no reported deaths in Canada, though the storm was blamed for at least 50 elsewhere along its path.The US National Hurricane Center said the post-tropical cyclone was centered about 600 kilometers north of Cape Race, Newfoundland, late on Sunday. Its top sustained winds continued at 95 kilometers per hour, after being above the 120 km/h threshold of hurricane force earlier in the day. The storm was heading to the east-northeast, roughly up the St. Lawrence River, at 39 km/h.The storm swept over northwestern Newfoundland and southeastern Labrador during the afternoon and moved out over the cold waters of the Labrador Sea during the night.Nova Scotia officials asked people in the province to stay off the roads so crews could safety remove trees and debris and restore power.The government said 700 Canadian troops would be fanning out across the Maritimes to help restore electricity, clear roadways and evacuate residents in flooded areas.Nova Scotia Power Inc chief executive Karen Hutt said more than 400,000 customers lost power at the peak of the storm but it had since been restored to 50,000 of them. About 80 percent of Nova Scotia's homes and businesses were blacked out - the highest in the company's history. Hutt said some customers could remain without service for days.On Prince Edward Island, about 75 percent of homes and businesses had no electricity by Sunday afternoon, according to the province's Public Safety Department.Widespread blackouts, affecting up to 80,000 NB Power customers, were reported in southern New Brunswick.By far, the greatest devastation caused by the storm was in the Bahamas, where Dorian struck a week ago as a Category 5 hurricane with 295 km/h winds, and then hovered just offshore for more than a day and a half, obliterating thousands of homes.Planes, cruise ships and yachts were evacuating people from the Abaco Islands and officials were trying to reach areas still isolated by flooding and debris.The country's National Emergency Management Agency said it was sending in extra staff because operations had been hampered by the storm's impact on local workers.The agency said it was setting up shelters or temporary housing for the newly homeless across the islands and appealed for Bahamians to take in storm victims.Bahamian Health Minister Duane Sands said on Sunday the death toll had risen by one to 44.

                    Scola remains a 'Diamond' after all these years
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Yao's old sidekick belied his age to sparkle once more at WukesongLuis Scola is no stranger to Beijing's Wukesong Arena, where he led Argentina to the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics.More than a decade later, he was selected to the All-Star Five after the FIBA Basketball World Cup wrapped up at the stadium on Sunday night.At 39, Scola was the oldest player in the tournament, but he averaged 17.9 points and 8.1 rebounds in his fifth World Cup, helping Argentina finish runner-up to champion Spain.Scola was held scoreless in the first half of Sunday's final and finished with just eight points and eight assists, but that didn't diminish his overall contribution."Scola is our leader. He is a time-stolen man. He got up at six in the morning and made himself better and better and better throughout the tournament," said Argentina coach Sergio Hernandez.In fact, Scola achieved all the goals he set for himself at the World Cup, ticking off each objective in a Twitter post: "First goal: pass the group. Second goal: enter the quarters. Third goal: qualify for the Olympic Games. Fourth goal: enter the semis. Fifth goal: win a medal."As Chinese legend Yao Ming's teammate with the NBA's Houston Rockets, Scola won the hearts of Chinese fans and earned the nickname "Diamond" at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, impressing the crowds at Wukesong with his long hair and smart playmaking.At the World Cup, he sported a different look."The hair is a little bit white now. I like it long, but when it gets white, it feels weird," Scola said after Argentina secured its quarterfinal berth with an 87-67 rout of Venezuela.The flowing locks might be gone, but his determination remains as strong as ever.Scola didn't enter the NBA until he was 27. He was a 2002 second-round draft pick of the San Antonio Spurs but didn't play an NBA season until 2007-08. He gained renown as a stalwart of the Argentine national team that defeated Team USA and won Olympic gold at the 2004 Athens Games, among other accomplishments.Scola was a star in Europe, playing mostly in Spain, but could never join fellow Argentine standout Manu Ginobili on the Spurs due to buyout constraints with his team in Europe.After a decade in the NBA that included stops in Houston, Phoenix, Indianapolis, Toronto and Brooklyn, he joined the Chinese Basketball Association's Shanxi Loongs in 2017, then transferred to Yao's old team, the Shanghai Sharks.As the only member of Argentina's 2004 Olympic champions still playing for the national team, Scola has a wealth of international experience-but he was cautious heading into the World Cup.Although he enjoys popularity among Chinese media, the Argentine star remained silent in front of local journalists but showed his friendliness by patting their shoulders or giving them high-fives. He didn't speak to them until his team made it to the last eight."I understand everyone talks about my age, but my brain is not functioning that way," said the 6-foot-9 forward. "I just enjoy playing and helping my team win."In the semifinal, Scola displayed his offensive versatility by finishing with 28 points and 13 rebounds in the victory over France-offering a strong indication he could again be a force to be reckoned with at next year's Tokyo Olympics.In other words, just what his" Diamond" nickname suggests: A solid, shiny, time-honored jewel.Xinhua

                    Overseas study no longer only for the elite
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                In recent decades, millions of Chinese have attended schools and colleges in other countries. Zou Shuo reports.Editor's note: To celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we will publish a series of stories reflecting on changes and developments in fields such as law, education, transportation and the environment. This is the third in the series."My son has been enrolled by a university in the United States.""I will go to a Canadian university as a visiting scholar next month." "It's so hard to find a job in Europe, so I will return to China after I graduate."Sentiments such as these have become increasingly common among Chinese students as the country's economic growth and rising income levels mean that going overseas to study is no longer only for the elite.As the country further opens up to the world, going abroad to study has become a common activity, with self-funded students accounting for the majority of those heading overseas.Last year, 662,100 Chinese went abroad to study, a rise of 8.83 percent from 2017, according to the Ministry of Education, which added that 90 percent of the students were self-supporting and only 65,800 received public funding.According to a report in May by Vision Overseas Consulting Co, a subsidiary of New Oriental Education and Technology Group, and Kantar Millward Brown, most parents whose children want to study overseas hold regular jobs, accounting for 43 percent of the total, a rise of 14 percentage points from 2015.Middle-level managers accounted for 35 percent of the parents, while 22 percent were high-level executives.It also found that the main reasons students choose to study overseas included expanding their horizons, enriching their life experience and improving their employment prospects and language skills.
