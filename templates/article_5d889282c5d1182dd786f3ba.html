                On the heels of US President Donald Trump's $12 billion aid package to help American farmers who may suffer losses in the tariff dispute with China, several members in the US House of Representatives are backing a plan to help fishermen and the fishing industry.Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat from Massachusetts, introduced a bill to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, which governs marine fisheries management in US federal waters. The House approved a reauthorization of Magnuson-Stevens last month.The bill introduced by Moulton would provide disaster relief for fisheries due to certain tariffs imposed by other countries, and for other purposes.Co-sponsors of the bill, introduced on July 25, are all Democrats and include representatives Chellie Pingree of Maine, Stephen Lynch and William Keating, both of Massachusetts, Jared Huffman of California and Raul Grijalva of Arizona."It was introduced on the day before the Congress adjourned for August recess, so not yet," said Pingree spokeswoman Victoria Bonney in an email on getting support from Republicans for the legislation. Republicans control the House and the Senate."Farmers haven't been the only ones to suffer the consequences of the Trump administration's sloppy trade actions. And while I'm glad that USDA (US Department of Agriculture) will offer aid to agricultural producers, the government needs to step up for others who have been harmed - especially fishermen," Pingree said in a statement.Pingree said she has heard mostly from Maine's lobster industry."They've been concerned about these tariffs for months and have weighed in with our office about the impact. For companies that do large contracts with Asian markets, it is a big concern, and Congresswoman Pingree is very worried about impacts throughout the supply chain," said Bonney.China's tariff on lobsters was launched in response to US tariffs on Chinese goods. Chinese buyers can get the same species from Canadian harvesters with only a 7 percent tariff.Jeff Bennett, an analyst at the Maine International Trade Center, said Maine sold at least $57 million worth of lobster to China last year.The Maine Lobster Dealers' Association says that lobster is the state's second-largest export to China. It estimates the loss of revenue at $60 million. There are about 4,500 licensed lobstermen and distributors in Maine, with an additional 10,000 workers in the industry, according to the association.Contact the writer at paulwelitzkin@chinadailyusa.com

                    US politicians must realize institutes aren't political tools

                There seem be two types of Confucius Institutes in the United States: those that are hailed on more than 100 campuses as a bridge to learning the Chinese language and culture, and those that are labeled by some newspapers and websites as a "political tool" of China.The US media's "flawed assumption" has contributed to such confusion, according to a senior China expert in Washington. There have been many such reports in recent weeks following two US lawmakers' letters urging a handful of schools to sever ties with the Confucius Institute. The lawmakers and media outlets have accused the programs of being a tool to expand the "political influence of China" and distort academic discourse in the US."There's a lot of assumptions and innuendo I find in the reporting," said David Shambaugh, director of China Policy Program at George Washington University. "One assumption is that a Confucius Institute somehow affects the curriculum of Chinese studies the way China is taught on campus. Absolutely wrong," the professor of political science said.Shambaugh made the remarks at a discussion at the Brookings Institution early this month. He said he has followed the Confucius Institute closely since one was set up on George Washington University in 2013. "There's a complete firewall between Confucius Institutes that teach language and...－the rest of the faculty and the curriculum on every university campus, not just at GW, across the country," he said. "So they have no impact on how Chinese studies are taught, so that's a flawed assumption that a lot of journalists leap to. They tend to take a couple of anecdotal cases and string it together and say here's a case."Speaking at the same discussion, US Congressman Rick Larsen said: "Confucius Institutes aren't what they are cracked up to be." They are trying to influence decisions and they "aren't as open-minded as what you ought to find in US academia".Before Larsen, US Senator Marco Rubio urged schools in his state of Florida to close their Confucius Institutes last month. And Seth Moulton, a Democratic representative from Massachusetts, sent a letter to Tufts University and the University of Massachusetts, Boston, in his state early this month, urging them to disassociate with the institute's programs.But Shambaugh said: "I'm of a different view than Congressman Larsen. I see them as quite benign and devoted to their primary mission of teaching language and cultural studies while at least speaking, whether it's film, cooking, tai chi, whatever… I thus far don't see evidence that they are being politicized."There were 110 Confucius Institutes and 519 Confucius Classrooms across the US at the end of last year, according to statistics from the Confucius Institute US Center in Washington. Shambaugh suggested that transparency be increased, especially by making Confucius Institute contracts available to campus officials.Patrick Collins, a Tufts University spokesman, said the university does not anticipate any changes in its relationship with the Confucius Institute, which opened in 2015, as it has made "valuable learning and cultural contributions to the university", The Boston Globe reported on March 9.As to the five schools that have received a letter from Senator Marco Rubio, the universities of North Florida and South Florida, and Miami Dade College have reportedly said they would continue the Confucius Institute operation, saying the program doesn't engage in political or religious activities.The University of West Florida decided last fall not to renew its Confucius Institute agreement when it expires in May, And Cypress high school, which also was asked by Rubio to cut ties with the Confucius Institute, did not respond to a request for comment.Hopefully, the assertion of most of the universities that they would continue with the program and Shambaugh's comment are enough to prove the accusations against the Confucius Institutes are baseless.The author is deputy editor-in-chief of China Daily USA.

                The Confucius Institute (CI) at the University of Maryland, the first Confucius Institute in the US, hosted its 13th anniversary of operations on March 28 in College Park.Representatives from the Maryland state Senate, governor's office, local CI recipient schools, CI students and parents attended the celebration to show their support and appreciation for the CI's ongoing contributions to US-China cultural exchange.Maryland Senator Susan Lee's representative Judge Chung Park expressed Lee's recognition of the work of Donna Wiseman and Jianxin Cui, director and deputy director of CI at the university.In his remarks, Park stressed that Wiseman and Cui's work to promote understanding between different cultures and languages "can make our country better"."I think it's great that our cultures learn about each other," said Kathleen Connor, district director for Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin, referring to CI's mission of promoting Chinese language and culture.Shawn Eum, a policy adviser in the governor's office, also offered support from the governor and presented citations to Wiseman and Cui."Being able to know Chinese and English plays a key role not only internationally but even domestically," said Eum. "It really empowers individuals. I know for the governor's office, we are always looking for talented young minds who know more than one language."Recently, CIs across the country have been facing criticism from US politicians and scholars, who accuse the centers of operating as tools of Chinese propaganda and China's foreign influence operations in the US.Several US lawmakers have publicly urged CI recipient universities in their states to reconsider or terminate the relationships, including Republican senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, as well as Democratic Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts."We are not a tool of the Chinese government," said Rebecca McGinnis, coordinator at CI at the University of Maryland, in response to the allegations."Several times over the past years we have been criticized for being subjects of propaganda. We simply have to say, OK, you voice your opinion, but we feel that this relationship with China is providing opportunities for language-learning and cultural understanding, which is supremely important," McGinnis said.Sandra Suber, assistant principal at Centennial High School in Howard County, Maryland, lamented the recent widespread skepticism."If the Confucius programs are not allowed to continue, we will deprive our students of some wonderful educational opportunities," Suber said.Patrick McCarthy, world and classical language department chair at Meade High School in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, expressed the same disappointment."It has all been about what can we do for the students,"he said.A lot of the criticism targets the CI curriculum and textbooks that come from Hanban, the Confucius Institute headquarters, which is a public institution affiliated with the Chinese Ministry of Education.Yian Ke in Washington contributed to this story.leshuodong@chinadailyusa.com
