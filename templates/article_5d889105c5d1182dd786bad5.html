                The Exhibition of National Image Design at the Beginning of the Founding of the People's Republic of China has made this year's Beijing Design Week special and impressive, said organizers of the exhibition. The exhibition, which debuted at the China Millennium Monument in early September, features sorted national image designs and has released many historical materials that had never been officially open to the public, organizers said. The exhibition, which will run until Oct 7, comprises three parts of national images, architecture and designs closely related to people's lives. The first part displays 18 cases involving designs of the national flag, national emblem, renminbi, commemorative stamps, medals and Hongqi cars.  A painting depicting the founding ceremony of the People's Republic of China attracts attention of visitors at the exhibition. Photos by Wang Zhuangfei / China DailyAmong them is the story of the national emblem design. Due to unsuccessful open collection, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference entrusted the task to two teams - the construction department at Tsinghua University led by renowned architects Liang Sicheng and his wife Lin Huiyin and the applied fine arts department at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, represented by noted artists such as Zhang Ding. Zhang proposed the Tian'anmen Gate theme in June 1950 while Liang and Lin suggested the five-star theme in September 1949. A cog, ears of rice and wheat, and ribbons happened to coincide in initial designs by the two teams. Mao Zedong, founder of the PRC, announced in September 1950 that the national emblem would be made up of the national flag, Tian'anmen Gate, a cog, and ears of rice and wheat. Different early designs of the emblem are displayed at the exhibition, complete with an explanation of the designs and related file photos. The architecture section mainly showcases spatial planning of Tian'anmen Square and architectural design of the Monument to the People's Heroes and the Great Hall of the People. Exhibits include hand-sketched designs, construction drawings, old photos and other historical records reflecting designers' thoughts. The last section presents Chinese-branded products made between 1949 and 1966, including trucks, sedans, bicycles, televisions, sewing machines, radios and cameras, as well as their external views, models and related photos. "We see our national flag and emblem every day, but we are not very clear how they were created," said Wang Yudong, general manager at Beijing Design Week Co. The exhibition even shows the day-to-day work of the designers to showcase intense preparations in early years of the PRC, Wang added. He said the PRC was founded on the ruins of war and rebuilt people's life totally relying on national industry, ranging from automobiles and bicycles to sewing machines and watches. For the exhibition, designs of the China-made products and some objects have been shipped from across the country to Beijing. "The exhibition showcases the difficult process of founding the PRC and we, from the design field, are very proud that designers made important contributions during the period," Wang said. The exhibition is co-hosted by the design week's organizing committee and the Academy of Arts and Design at Tsinghua University. The academy's predecessor is the Central Academy of Arts and Design, which was set up in 1956, the first higher education institution featuring design after the foundation of the PRC. Many teachers, students and alumni from the academy were involved in related design of national images since its establishment. Jia Yanliang, a graduate of the academy, designed the Hongqi CA770 sedan and Beijing's BK651 bus in the 1960s. Jia provided his design drawings of Hongqi sedans to the exhibition.

                Travelers will be able to pass through customs inspections faster than ever at the soon-to-be-opened Beijing Daxing International Airport."The new airport is equipped with the best inspection technologies in China. Our goal is to significantly cut inspection times and make travelers more comfortable," said Gao Ruifeng, deputy director of Beijing Customs."We are now ready to introduce unobtrusive inspections, which means that the majority of people entering China via the new airport won't need to line up or lift their luggage onto inspection machines themselves while going through customs inspections."The new airport, located 46 kilometers south of the capital's downtown district, is expected to open later this month.At the new airport, all luggage from international flights as well as from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, will be scanned by high-speed CT scan inspection machines before being loaded onto baggage carousels.The new machines developed by Tsinghua Tongfang Co can scan at twice the speed of traditional CT scan inspection machines, said Zhao Zhao, a passenger inspection officer at Daxing airport."The machines are also equipped with a high-tech image evaluation system that can flag suspicious luggage within two seconds," Zhao said.After collecting their luggage, passengers pass through quarantine inspection gates. During the seconds that passengers take to pass through these gates, sensors collect data on body temperature and test for radioactive materials.If any irregularities are detected, flap doors on either side of the passageway will be automatically closed and customs officers alerted, Zhao said.Advanced systems will be used for departing passengers that allow for one-stop security and customs checks, thus streamlining the process."Such integration is the first in China. It's designed to cut waiting times for passengers," Gao said."Although customs inspections at the new Beijing airport will be the strictest in China, for most passengers, passing customs inspections at Daxing airport will be as pleasant as a walk in the park," Zhao said.
