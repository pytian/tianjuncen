                    Amorepacific partners with Alibaba to attract more Chinese consumers

            <p class="style-content">
                South Korean cosmetics company Amorepacific Group is consolidating its digital footprint in China by forging a strategic partnership with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and setting up a dedicated office for better engagement with the Chinese internet giant.The company behind leading beauty brands from Sulwhasoo to Laneige is looking to incubate new products tailored to the Chinese market, facilitate online-to-offline sales, gain precise consumer insights and explore opportunities in overseas markets.Amorepacific's special liaison office was established in Hangzhou, where Alibaba has its headquarters. The deal is a sign of its intention to unlock the potential of the beauty market through smart adoption of big data, said Amorepacific China President Gao Xiangqin."Digitalization has been an ongoing area of investment for us in the past several years," said Gao."E-commerce is an avenue we value a lot and will be our business focus from now on."Ideally, the Amorepacific-Alibaba office is designed to shorten the average length for new product introduction to six to nine months, from the typical 24 months by many Japanese and South Korean cosmetic companies, said Hu Weixiong, general manager of fast-moving consumer goods practice at Alibaba's Tmall site."In the early stage, the office can enhance coordination between Alibaba and Amorepacific's headquarter office and hopefully speed up the decision-making process for the introduction of new products in China," said Hu.The collaboration is also expected to draw expertise from Tmall Innovation Center, Alibaba's in-house product co-creation program, which relies on Alibaba's 674 million active users to extract consumer insights and conduct a myriad of pre-launch tests from pricing to packaging, Hu noted.China is Amorepacific's second largest market after South Korea, recording revenue of 7.26 billion yuan ($1.02 billion) last year, official figures showed.Foreign brands are flocking to ride China's digital wave through similar partnerships. In April, Japanese cosmetics brand Shiseido entered into a partnership with Alibaba through a similar liaison office and an initiative to jointly develop a new shampoo targeting young female users.As retail sales growth for the first seven months of 2019 slowed to 8.3 percent in China, retailers are moving to strengthen digitization along the retail value chain through smart supply chain management powered by technology and big data, with a laser focus on experience, a report by global consultancy PwC released on Tuesday said."The drive for customization is to better navigate the Chinese market and understand consumers whose disposable income and shopping preferences vary greatly," said Jennifer Ye, PwC China Consumer Markets Leader. "Foreign brands are hoping to leverage such collaboration to grasp the 'touch moment' of local shoppers in a bid to exert a long-term influence."It is trend-following young consumers who are driving cosmetic companies to become the avant-garde advocates of localized innovations, said Jason Yu, general manager of consultancy Kantar Worldpanel China."Emerging beauty trends normally debut online. In the foreseeable future, companies in other sectors are likely to follow suit and invest in the marriage of digitalization and customization," Yu said.

                Lollipops with a spicy Chongqing hotpot flavor recently went viral online after Alibaba founder Jack Ma tasted it at a fair in Hangzhou on Sept 14.This snack, created by a Chongqing hotpot chain Peijie Hotpot, has three flavors from mild, medium to strong.At 35 yuan ($5) per piece, the lollipops quickly sold out at the fair hosted by the Taobao Maker Festival in Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang province.The exhibition and trade fair is currently underway at the Hangzhou Boiler Factory and the West Lake until Sept 25. It brings traders of Taobao, Alibaba's e-commerce platform, face-to-face with customers.More than 1,000 products ranging from technology, Chinese style, fashion, design, and cuisine are competing for consumers' attention, with novelties becoming the hottest items of this year's festival.

                    Peppa Pig rights owner lauds China's IP protection efforts
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China's adoption of internet technologies in court filings is a "fantastic development" that in part drives the country's "massive improvements" in intellectual property protection, according to a senior company executive representing the Peppa Pig brand and its related trademarks.Tim Pfeiffer, the senior vice-president of Business Affairs for the Family & Brands division at Entertainment One UK Ltd, the company that manages Peppa Pig, said that the introduction of the Internet Court has allowed China to better adapt to the digital environment and emerging trends such as the sharing economy.Pfeiffer made the remarks in light of the order issued by the Beijing Internet Court to car-sharing platform Beijing Togo Technology Co Ltd to stop its infringement of the Peppa Pig trademark.During the 2018 Beijing International Automotive Exhibition, Togo used the image of Peppa Pig on its vehicle fleets as well as for subsequent business promotions.The court had also fined the company 500,000 yuan ($70,561) for using Peppa Pig content without authorization."'Convenient, fast and intelligent' describes the process of this litigation case. The modular design of the entire process allows complex litigation processes to be understood at a glance," said Pfeiffer, adding the court has employed a variety of methods, such as online broadcast and promotion through WeChat accounts to make the process linear and transparent.Pfeiffer believes that while the sharing economy is booming in China, there must still be a clear distinction between sharing and the violation of copyrights."This case is, to some extent, a landmark judgment in the development of China's IPR protection," he said. "It is the manifestation of how China is steadily implementing guidelines to effectively promote the creation and application of intellectual property rights and more strictly implement the IPR protection system."Pfeiffer said that he expects trademark applications and IP litigations to increase exponentially in China as international brands continue to expand their presence here.Technologies developed by domestic internet giants could prove to be useful in helping China's judicial systems deal with the influx of new IPs by international companies.For example, Alibaba Group currently employs algorithms to identify and remove infringing items before they can even get on the e-commerce platform, according to Matthew Bassiur, vice-president and head of global IP enforcement.The e-commerce company also issues alerts for products with a significant number of customer complaints and investigates its manufacturing, distribution and supply chain, he added.
