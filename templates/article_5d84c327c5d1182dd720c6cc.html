                The University of Salford, Manchester, has since the 1960s assembled an art collection of some 700 items, which are not only for students and faculty members, but also exhibitions around the world.A selection of image-based works from The University of Salford Art Collection will be on show at this year's PHOTOFAIRS | Shanghai, from Sept 20 to 22 at the Shanghai Exhibition Center.Curated by Ying Kwok, the exhibition titled Taking the Leap will introduce to people the diversity and dynamics of Salford's collection. And it will offer potential collectors clues on how to collect experimental, conceptual works that combine photography, moving images, video and other techniques, revealing a unique landscape of digital art.PHOTOFAIRS | Shanghai has become a leading destination for photo-based works and artists exploring with the medium. The sixth edition of the annual fair will bring together 50 galleries and the works of some 200 artists from home and abroad.

                EU's Barnier rejects UK's backstop demand
            </a>
            <p>
                Brussels reiterates it will not water down its protection of Irish borderBritain was warned once again on Sunday that the European Union cannot remove the Irish border backstop from the proposed Brexit withdrawal agreement.The EU's top Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has rejected British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's demands for the Irish backstop to be scrapped and said that he is "not optimistic" of avoiding a no-deal outcome, where Britain leaves the EU without a deal on Oct 31.In an article for the Sunday Telegraph newspaper, Barnier said the backstop measure had to remain in place to protect the integrity of the bloc's single market while ensuring an open border on the island of Ireland.Johnson had said he was encouraged in his bid to axe the backstop by recent meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, who appeared to suggest openness to alternatives.But Barnier said Brussels remained unconvinced after "intense discussions with EU member states on the need to guarantee the integrity of the EU's single market, while keeping that border fully open".Johnson has vowed to take the country out of the EU on Oct 31 without a deal unless Brussels agrees to revise the divorce agreement. He has threatened a no-deal scenario whereby the United Kingdom immediately quits the EU's tariff -free single market and customs union.The government of his predecessor, Theresa May, spent two years negotiating the withdrawal agreement with Brussels, which the British Parliament has failed to pass on three occasions.Johnson has now sought to suspend Parliament in the lead-up to Brexit day to avoid opposition and some rebel Conservative MPs blocking a no-deal scenario.On Sunday, Johnson warned his fellow Tory MPs to back him to deliver Brexit or see Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn take over and "plunge the country into chaos".In an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper, Johnson warned that a Tory rebellion this week would jeopardize a planned 3.5-billion-pound ($4.25 billion) injection into local services.The prime minister has promised to unveil the "biggest, most generous spending review since the height of Tony Blair's New Labour". He claims local councils will get 3.5 billion pounds extra－the first rise in their budgets for a decade－with 1 billion pounds earmarked for social care.Johnson plans on Monday to tell former cabinet ministers Philip Hammond, David Gauke and Dominic Grieve, that they have to make a "choice".He told The Sunday Times: "I just say to everybody in the country, including everyone in Parliament, the fundamental choice is this: are you going to side with Jeremy Corbyn and those who want to cancel the referendum? Are you going to side with those who want to scrub the democratic verdict of the people－and plunge this country into chaos?"Or are you going to side with those of us who want to get on, deliver on the mandate of the people and focus with absolute, laser-like precision on the domestic agenda? That's the choice."Meanwhile, thousands of protesters have taken to the streets across the UK in cities including Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and Belfast to protest against Johnson's plans to suspend Parliament in the run-up to Brexit.Parts of central London were brought to a standstill, as people chanted: "Boris Johnson, shame on you."A small group of counter-protesters, marching in support of the prime minister, also arrived in Westminster. Johnson's plan to prorogue Parliament prompted an angry backlash from MPs and opponents of a no-deal Brexit when he announced it on Wednesday.If it happens as expected, Parliament will be closed for 23 working days. Critics view the length and timing of the suspension－coming just weeks before the Brexit deadline of Oct 31－as controversial.

                Van Dijk, Ronaldo, Messi finalists for FIFA player award
            </a>
            <p>
                MILAN — Netherlands defender Virgil van Dijk has joined five-time winners Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi as the three finalists for the FIFA best player award. United States forward Megan Rapinoe is the favorite for the women's award.The announcement of the final three in each category — including best coach and best goalkeeper — was made Monday at San Siro. The winners will be announced at a ceremony at Milan's iconic Scala theater on Sept 23.Luka Modric, who won the award last year after leading Croatia to the World Cup final, did not make the 10-man shortlist.Van Dijk joined Ronaldo and Messi after helping Liverpool win the Champions League title in June.Rapinoe is competing against World Cup-winning teammate Alex Morgan and England forward Lucy Bronze.All three of the finalists for the men's coach award work in the Premier League: Liverpool's Jürgen Klopp, Manchester City's Pep Guardiola and Tottenham's Mauricio Pochettino.While Klopp won the Champions League with Liverpool and Guardiola steered City to a second straight Premier League title, Pochettino has never won a trophy in his managerial career — although he did lead Tottenham to the Champions League final.United States coach Jill Ellis, who won back-to-back World Cup titles before stepping down after more than five years in charge, was nominated for the award for the best coach in women's soccer. She is joined by England's Phil Neville and the Netherlands' Sarina Wiegman. The Netherlands lost to the United States in the World Cup final.Liverpool also has a contender for the best goalkeeper award. Alisson up against City's Ederson and Barcelona's Marc-André ter Stegen.Christiane Endler, Hedvig Lindahl and Sari van Veenendaal are the three finalists for the women's goalkeeper award.The winners will be voted on by national team coaches and captains, selected media and online fan voting.AP

                Plenty of loans but no mega deals as transfer window closes
            </a>
            <p>
                PARIS - The transfer window closed gently across much of Europe on Monday evening with a flurry of loan deals instead of the anticipated bang of a mega move.Several big-name players changed clubs on loans, including Mauro Icardi, Nikola Kalinic on loan from Atletico Madrid and Henrikh Mkhitaryan.The biggest names among the permanent transfer were a pair of Central American veterans: Keylor Navas and Javier Hernandez.The closure interrupted the saga surrounding Neymar, the world's most expensive player, who will stay at Paris Saint-Germain having failed to get the move back to Barcelona that he craved.Real Madrid had also been linked with Neymar as well as Manchester United World Cup winner Paul Pogba and Tottenham's Christian Eriksen as part of the expensive refurbishment of Zinedine Zidane's squad.Pogba excited some suspicious speculation earlier in the day when he dropped out of France's two upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers with an "ankle problem."Real did do one deal with PSG. It even involved a World Cup winner, but the marquee name was the Madrid club's backup goalkeeper.

                Livestreaming platforms playing to win
            </a>
            <p>
                Chinese digital broadcasters are gearing up efforts to acquire the media rights of major sports events around the worldZhang Hao, 34, is a fan of Bayern Munich soccer club and loves watching the Bundesliga, Germany's premier soccer competition, during weekends."In the past, I watched soccer matches on CCTV-5, China Central Television's sports channel, but now I have shifted to livestreaming sports platforms," said Zhang, an employee with a tech company in Beijing.Zhang said CCTV lost the media rights to the Bundesliga last year, while PP Sports, a livestreaming platform under China's retailer Suning.com Co, has secured exclusive linear and digital rights to the league's fixtures broadcast on the Chinese mainland for the next five years, until the conclusion of the 2022-23 season."I need to pay 12 yuan ($1.7) for some high-profile competitions each time, such as Bayern Munich vs Dortmund, and I am considering purchasing a one-year membership."Chinese livestreaming sports platforms are gearing up efforts to win the media rights of major sports events around the world.PP Sports has acquired the broadcasting rights of some top soccer events around the world, including the English Premier League, Germany's Bundesliga, Italy's Serie A, France's Ligue 1, the Asian and European Champions League competitions, the Chinese Super League and the UEFA Europa League.Sun Weimin, vice-chairman of Suning, said the company will continue to increase investments in the sports sector, with hopes of using high-quality content to attract more users.In 2016, PP Sports obtained the exclusive broadcasting rights for EPL matches on the Chinese mainland and in Macao in a three-year deal starting from the 2019-20 season."In recent years, we have been studying our users, and it's obvious that sports have become a lifestyle," said Sun, noting the paying subscribers of PP Sports have exceeded 6 million."PP Sports can become the vehicle and medium to connect resources, commercialization and soccer together in one ecosystem. Commerce and soccer, this is Suning's real area of expertise," he said.In the new season, PP Sports will provide fans in China with a live match broadcasting service, using special visual technology to create a unique match atmosphere, multi-angle replays and expert tactical analysis, bringing fans as close to the Premier League as possible.The digital broadcaster is establishing news bureaus in London, Manchester and Liverpool, and will also use live broadcast, images and articles, short-form video, fan zones and offline events to provide supporters with a rich experience and content.

                Chinese buyers cash in on weak pound in Manchester
            </a>
            <p>
                The city of Manchester in the North West of England is proving to be a property investment hotspot for Chinese buyers after the weakness of the pound on the international currency markets meant prices became hugely favorable for overseas investors over domestic buyers.A document produced by the local authority said before it had even happened, the prospect of Brexit was taking an economic toll on Manchester's building industry, and picked out Japan and China as two countries whose investors were benefitting as a result."Evidence suggests that buyers from China and Japan saved 16 percent and 27 percent respectively on the purchase price of a city center apartment compared to domestic investors buying in sterling," it said."As a result, overseas investors have been able to carry the additional costs associated with the 3 percent stamp duty land tax levied on purchases for second homes."The increasing cost of imported materials, which also has an impact on labor costs, is adding to the situation, which is only expected to get worse if Brexit happens, and has already contributed to a 15 percent increase in the cost of building development over the last two years.Council leader Richard Leese added that future planning was not being made any easier because local authorities had been "for a long period of time starved of information" about Brexit."After the deferral of Brexit to Oct 31," he said, "basically civil servants effectively put down their pens on planning for a very long period of time and it's only really in the last few weeks that we have started to see urgency from government in terms of dealing with the likely consequences."Manchester has the second-largest Chinatown in the United Kingdom, with a history dating back to the early part of the 20th century. Historically, the city was a key player in the Industrial Revolution and home to much of Britain's manufacturing industry, and in the modern era it is famed around the world for its music scene and two hugely successful soccer teams, bitter rivals Manchester City and Manchester United.Manchester is also home to several universities, with the University of Manchester having around 5,000 Chinese undergraduate students, and in 2017, it received donation of 5 million pounds ($6.16 million) from Hong Kong businessman Lee Kai Hung to establish a Chinese institute and Chinese culture gallery at the Manchester Museum. China's minister of science and technology, Wang Zhigang visited the university this summer to see the work of the new institute in action.Following President Xi Jinping's highly publicized visit to the city in 2015, direct flights between Manchester and Beijing were introduced in 2016, and since then it has been an increasingly popular destination for Chinese visitors, something the city has deliberately encouraged.Manchester Airport is the third-largest in Great Britain and in October 2018 it appointed a Mandarin-speaking marketing manager to work specifically on its Chinese social media and assist with Hainan Airlines' operations at the airport.These efforts contributed to the airport winning a gold award at this year's Chinese Tourist Welcome Awards, organized by the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute, in recognition of the specific effort it has put into welcoming Chinese travelers.

                Neymar looms large as PSG renews Euro offensive
            </a>
            <p>
                PARIS - Real Madrid's visit to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday is arguably the blockbuster matchup of the opening Champions League round, but one that will bring back unhappy memories for the host.When the clubs last met in the competition's last 16 two seasons ago, a Neymar-less PSG lost 2-1 at Parc des Princes to crash out 5-2 on aggregate, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring three times over both legs.That was one of three consecutive exits in the first knockout round for PSG, which has failed to make its mark on the Champions League despite the hundreds of millions of euros spent by its Qatari owners.

                Ronaldo faces Atlético again; depleted PSG takes on Madrid
            </a>
            <p>
                Cristiano Ronaldo faces a familiar foe as Juventus opens its Champions League campaign at Atlético Madrid on Wednesday, while his former team Real Madrid visits a Paris Saint-Germain squad that will be without the attacking trio of Neymar, Edinson Cavani and Kylian Mbappé.Ronaldo scored a hat trick in the round of 16 last season to help Juventus eliminate Atlético, a team he repeatedly thrived against when playing for its crosstown rival.Real Madrid caught a break for its opener in Paris as Neymar won't be able to play for PSG because of a suspension and Cavani and Mbappé are injured. Madrid, meanwhile, will be able to count on Eden Hazard, the former Chelsea playmaker who made his competitive debut with the club in a Spanish league game on Saturday."Since I arrived I felt the connection that Real Madrid has with the Champions League," Hazard said. "Being here is a dream for me and I hope to make the most of it."Manchester City visits Shakhtar Donetsk in its quest to succeed in the European competition under Pep Guardiola, while Tottenham — last season's runner-up — travels to Greece to face Olympiakos.Five-time European champion Bayern Munich hosts Red Star Belgrade.GROUP A Karim Benzema and the rest of Real Madrid's forwards will be going against former teammate Keylor Navas, the Costa Rica goalkeeper who joined PSG after lifting three straight Champions League trophies with the Spanish club from 2016-18. He made an impressive debut for PSG in Saturday's 1-0 home win against Strasbourg, making a crucial save in each half when the score was 0-0."The past is behind me. I had a great time with Real, but now I want to begin a new chapter in my career," Navas said. "I want to win trophies."With Neymar suspended for the first two group games and Mbappé and Cavani recovering from minor injuries, coach Thomas Tuchel has a real headache in attack. Fourth-choice striker Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting had a poor game against Strasbourg and was replaced by Mauro Icardi, who is lacking match fitness following a difficult time with Inter Milan in Italy's Serie A. Tuchel may choose to use ángel Di María pushed further forward.Madrid will be without veteran left back Marcelo because of a back injury.In the other group match, Belgium's Club Brugge hosts Turkey's Galatasaray.GROUP B Despite a Bundesliga and German Cup double from his first season, Bayern Munich coach Niko Kovac is under pressure to do better in the Champions League.Kovac's team was beaten by Liverpool in the round of 16 last season, marking the first time in seven years that it failed to reach at least the quarterfinals.The team is going through an overhaul following the summer departures of Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery, James Rodriguéz, Mats Hummels and Rafinha.Marquee signing Philippe Coutinho has joined on loan from Barcelona, through it remains to be seen how the Brazilian fits into Kovac's game plan. World Cup winners Benjamin Pavard and Lucas Hernández arrived to shore up the defense.Tottenham begins its quest to return to the final when it visits Olympiakos in the other group match.GROUP C Manchester City and Ukrainian champion Shakhtar Donetsk face each other for the third consecutive year in the group stage.Two years ago, City won 2-0 at home and lost 2-1 away, when it had already secured a spot in the last 16. Last season, City won 3-0 away and 6-0 at home, with Gabriel Jesus scoring a hat trick in the second game.Dinamo Zagreb hosts an Atalanta side that is making its tournament debut after a club-record third-place finish in Serie A last season. The Bergamo-based squad appears to be picking up right where it left off last season following a stoppage-time winner by Duvan Zapata in a 2-1 victory at Genoa on Sunday.GROUP D With his hat trick in the round of 16 last season, Ronaldo almost single-handedly overturned Juventus' two-goal first-leg deficit against Atlético.The star forward is in top form again, coming off a four-goal performance for Portugal against Lithuania two weeks ago.Juventus struggled in a scoreless draw at Fiorentina in Serie A on Saturday, though, and it hasn't quite adjusted to the tactics of new coach Maurizio Sarri.Atlético lost its perfect record in the Spanish league in a 2-0 loss at Real Sociedad at the weekend.Bayer Leverkusen coach Peter Bosz knows a good start at home to Lokomotiv Moscow is crucial in a group with heavyweights Juventus and Atlético both favored to go through.Leverkusen's unbeaten start to the season came to an end Saturday in a 4-0 loss at Borussia Dortmund, the side's heaviest loss since April 2018.AP
