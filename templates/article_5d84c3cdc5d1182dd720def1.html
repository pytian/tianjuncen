                Bolton's exit doesn't signify policy change: China Daily editorial
            </p>

                The dice were loaded against him, for he was not only opposed to letting up the pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and against the US president's suggestion of a possible meeting with the Iranian leadership, but also a likely cause of the failure of Washington-Taliban talks.But that he would be fired for being a foreign policy hawk, a trait for which he was made the US national security adviser, is something very few imagined.So does John Bolton's departure from the White House suggest a change in US foreign policy?No matter what the answer is, the United States should reflect on its "America first" foreign policy over the past couple of years, which has heightened tensions and sparked frictions in many parts of the world.In June 2017, Washington withdrew from the Paris climate accord, undermining the global efforts to fight climate change. In May 2018, it pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal, which was reached after intensive talks among major world powers to ease tensions in the Middle East. The heightened tensions that followed the US' decision almost sparked a war.And last year, it unilaterally imposed additional tariffs on imports from various countries, especially China. Accusing China of forced technology transfer, it refuses to see reason and has instead intensified the trade row.Worse, in violation of the three Sino-US communiqués, Washington has continued to sell arms to Taiwan, increasing uncertainties across the Straits. It has also beefed up its forces in the Asia-Pacific region, with its navy frequently transgressing Chinese waters in the name of freedom of navigation.In its desperate attempts to "make America great again", the US administration has resorted to trade protectionism, throwing the world economy out of gear. And Washington's "maximum pressure" and unilateral actions, from sanctions against Iran to tariffs on Chinese goods, are threatening overall global stability.Because by the time Bolton became national security adviser — on April 9, 2018 — the US administration was already pushing ahead with its "America first" strategy, his departure is not likely to bring about any major changes in the US foreign policy. Let us be clear: Bolton was fired not for being a foreign policy hawk, but because of his disagreements with the US president on some major issues.That the US administration will realize the harm it has caused to the world and change its ways is a welcome thought but too good to be true.

                Doubt casts on Afghan election as insecurity intensifies
            </a>
            <p>
                KABUL -- The increased Taliban onslaught and deteriorating security have spelled fear among the war-weary Afghans ahead of presidential polls.An Afghan presidential election hopeful has asked for postponement of the upcoming presidential election, believing people would not attend the process due to the harsh security situation.The Sept 28 poll will be the fourth presidential election in Afghanistan since 2001, when the United States invaded the country following the Sept 11 attacks, ousting the Taliban regime.Addressing a gathering of his election campaign, Ibrahim Alokozay citing the critical security situation, said that "holding an inclusive and transparent election was impossible under the current deteriorating security."According to him, the poll results would not eventually be acceptable if the process was held under the current circumstances.The countdown for the upcoming poll has already begun, particularly when the United States canceled the talks with the Taliban, after the militants' claimed suicide car bombing that killed two foreign soldiers, including an American, and 11 others in the Afghan capital Kabul.The Taliban militants intensified fighting across the country after US President Donald Trump tweeted that he has called off negotiations with the Taliban group, blaming it for having no power to continue the peace process.Some Afghan citizens cast doubt on the election process and say people would not dare to join the polling centers for tough security reasons."We are facing growing insecurity, everywhere is fighting, people will not dare to go to the voting centers and I will not attend the process," Daud Nejrabi, a Kabul resident told Xinhua, adding that the peace process must be resumed to have a possible peaceful and inclusive presidential election in the country.Another Kabul resident and a government employee, Suraya Raiszada said she dares not to go to the election polls as Taliban militants have warned to target anyone who goes to vote."We are receiving death threats on a daily basis, from the militants in big cities and districts as well, in case we attend the presidential election. The security must be strengthened and the security of polling stations must be guaranteed before the polls," she said, hoping the security forces could remove all security challenges for the people to attend the election.Taliban militants have boycotted the election, warning they will disrupt the process.The extremist group has attacked three provincial capitals and overrun several districts within the past two weeks, causing heavy casualties on security forces and civilians.Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani and election commission officials are consistently emphasizing that the vote would be held on the scheduled date and that the militants did not have the ability to disrupt the process.Meanwhile, Afghanistan's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Adela Raz has recently said that the Afghan government was committed to holding a transparent, free, credible and inclusive election.Some 9.6 million eligible registered voters are expected to cast ballots in more than 5,300 polling centers across the country.

                Taliban shadow provincial governor among 12 killed
            </a>
            <p>
                AYBAK, Afghanistan -- A total of 12 militants including Mawlawi Noorudin, the shadow governor of Taliban for the northern Samangan province, were killed as fighting aircraft struck the armed outfit's hideout in the relatively restive province on Sunday, army spokesman in the region Mohammad Hanif Rezai said."Acting upon intelligence report, the fighting planes targeted a hideout of the Taliban rebels in Dara-e-Suf Payan district Sunday morning, killing 12 rebels including Mawlawi Noorudin, the shadow governor of Samangan province," Rezai told Xinhua.Without providing more details, the official said the security forces would continue to chase the insurgents elsewhere in the province.Taliban militants have not made comments on the report yet.

                IN BRIEF (Page 6)

                Afghanistan Taliban kill at least 26 in Kabul suicide blast A Taliban suicide bomber killed at least 26 people and wounded dozens near a campaign rally for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Tuesday, with the insurgents warning of more violence ahead of elections. About an hour after the attack, another blast also claimed by the Taliban rocked central Kabul near the US embassy. It was not immediately clear if the second blast claimed any lives. The explosions came after US President Donald Trump abruptly ended talks with the Taliban on Sept 10 over a deal that would have allowed the United States to begin withdrawing troops from its longest war. South Korea Seoul files WTO export dispute with Tokyo South Korea has initiated a WTO dispute against Japan's latest export curbs, the World Trade Organization said on Monday, amid increased tensions between the two Asian neighbors. In July, Japan imposed tighter controls on exports of three materials to South Korea used in smartphone chips and displays following a diplomatic row over compensation for forced laborers during Japan's occupation of the Korean Peninsula during World War II. Under WTO rules, South Korea and Japan should meet within 30 days and if these talks fail, South Korea can request adjudication by a dispute settlement panel. The Philippines At least 15 dead as truck falls off cliff At least 15 villagers were killed and several others injured when the truck they were riding in lost control and fell off a cliff on Tuesday, in a remote mountain village in the southern Philippines, police and the Red Cross said. Provincial police chief Joel Limson said the truck was negotiating a downhill road in Tboli town in South Cotabato province when its brakes apparently failed and plummeted down a ravine. Police, Red Cross volunteers and villagers retrieved the 15 bodies from the wreckage. At least five of the injured were hospitalized in critical condition, Limson said.
