                    Car sales keep falling but hope on horizon with peak months

                Industry organization predicts full market recovery may take two to three yearsThe downward spiral in China's automotive market did not stop in August. Officials at the country's leading industry organization say it may take two to three years for the market to recover.Overall vehicle sales in the world's biggest vehicle market stood at 1.96 million in August. It represents a fall of 6.9 percent from the same month last year, according to figures released last week by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.Statistics show that August was the 14th month of falls since a dip was noticed in July 2018.Total vehicle sales in the country in the first eight months of 2019 totaled 16.1 million, down 11 percent from the same period last year.At the start of 2019, the association said the fall may become less severe in coming months. This is because of a lower comparable base figure from the second half of last year and the expected peak months of sales in September and October."We expect the market to see some sort of a rebound this year, but we are not sure about how much it will rebound," said Shi Jianhua, a deputy secretary-general of the CAAM.The association estimated sales this year would be the same as in 2018. But they scaled down the estimate to a 5 percent drop in the middle of the year, to 26.68 million vehicles."From what we have seen, it would be a feat if it would be a 5 percent drop," said Shi.He said favorable measures in past years triggered impulse purchases. This coupled with factors ranging from China's slowing economic growth to Sino-American trade tensions is hurting car sales.Shi said the market would be more resilient if the authorities had not imposed curbs on car purchases in some cities and released financial stimuli in some years.Under the current situation, car sales will hover at a low level for two to three years, he predicted.Carmakers are not optimistic either. BAIC Group, Chinese partner of Hyundai and Mercedes-Benz, estimated the market would fall around 7.5 percent this year from 2018."It will be a decent job if China's vehicles sales in 2020 reach the level of this year," said BAIC President Zhang Xiyong at an industry forum held earlier this month in Tianjin.SAIC Motor, China's largest carmaker, saw its sales in the first eight months of this year stand at 3.86 million. This is down 14.81 percent from the same period last year. Deliveries of all its major sales contributors, from SAIC Volkswagen to SAIC GM, fell in the same period.

                    China-US trade tensions likely to affect help to global poor: Bill Gates
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has warned that trade tensions between China and the United States are likely to affect global initiatives aimed at conquering poverty, contagious diseases and other global woes.Gates, who founded the foundation in 2000 with the aim of helping people around the world lead healthy, productive lives, told Chinese media recently that a healthy and constructive relationship between China and the US not only benefits the two countries, but also bolsters progress toward addressing major global issues."I see anything that cuts down global cooperation as a potential step backward, where the people who would get hurt the most by it are the poorest in the world," he said ahead of the launch of the foundation's Goalkeepers Data Report on Tuesday, an annual report card on efforts to improve living conditions for people worldwide, especially those in poor countries.As concerns run high that the China-US trade war might trigger a global economic downturn, Gates said foreign aid donations, which were determined by overall government budgets, would possibly take a hit.He said the idea of caring for other people, like African children dying of malaria, could be dismissed or made less of a priority. "People tend to turn inward when government budgets get tight," Gates said.In a worst-case scenario, the mortality rates of infectious disease would go up, as critical medicines that treat malaria, tuberculosis and some HIV drugs risk losing their efficacy due to potential resistance, Gates said."If we don't get generous contributions to those organizations (that deliver vaccines), it results in literally millions of deaths," he said. "If you don't keep infectious diseases in check, they just keep expanding and expanding."A self-proclaimed "impatient optimist", Gates said he feels upbeat about future trade talks between the two countries."I'm a huge believer that China and the US getting along is the most important bilateral relationship in the world," he said. "I'm hopeful that the trade problems can get behind us and that we can go on to work constructively together."Gates said the partnership between the foundation and China is progressing at full speed and had deepened over the years.Last year, China unveiled its International Development Cooperation Agency, which is responsible for overseeing and coordinating the country's expanding foreign assistance programs.The foundation is now working with the agency, Gates said."It has helped us understand China's priorities and to coordinate our work with China in an even better way," he said.The foundation launched the Goalkeepers Data Report in 2017 as an initiative to spur action and chart progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015.The 2019 report examines the issue of inequality across genders, districts and countries and discusses transferable practices that can help close the gap.

                    4 Chinese killed in Utah bus accident identified
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                PANGUITCH, Utah - Authorities in Utah on Saturday identified the four Chinese tourists killed in a bus crash in the US state, and the tour company is dispatching employees from China to help those injured. Three women and one man perished in the crash on a highway running through the red rock landscape of Utah on Friday. The victims have been identified as Ling Geng, 68, Xiuyun Chen, 67, Zhang Caiyu, 62, and Zhongliang Caiyu, 65. They were all from Shanghai. They were part of a tour group made up of 29 tourists and one leader. They came from Shanghai and the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang, according to a news report on the media website huanqiu.com. The tour leader came from Hebei province, near Beijing, according to the Zhejiang Online news site. Five passengers remained in critical condition on Friday night, and the death toll could rise, Utah Highway Patrol Sergeant Nick Street said. All 31 people on board were hurt. Twelve to 15 on board were considered to be in critical condition shortly after the crash, but several of them have since improved, Street said. Not everyone was wearing a seat belt he said. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture and Tourism urged the travel agency, Shanghai Zhuyuan International Travel Agency, to spare no effort in rescuing the injured and handling their affairs. Lu Yong, the travel agency's general manager, said the agency's partners in the United States sent 10 staff members to hospitals to help the victims communicate with doctors and police. The News Perspective program, part of the Shanghai Media Group, said in an article on its official social media account that seven relatives of the victims were expected to leave for the US on Monday or Tuesday with travel agency staff and officials from the culture and tourism bureau. The news program's social media post included photos of parts of the itinerary, indicating the accident occurred on the seventh day of a 16-day trip and also included visits to Yellowstone National Park, Salt Lake City and Las Vegas. They were scheduled to fly to the East Coast after the western US stops. The Chinese embassy in the US said on social media that it was sending staff to help the victims. The crash happened near a highway rest stop a few miles from southern Utah's Bryce Canyon National Park, an otherworldly landscape of narrow red-rock spires. Authorities believe the driver swerved on the way to the park on Friday morning. But when he yanked the steering wheel to put the bus back onto the road, the momentum sent the bus into a rollover crash, authorities said. The driver, a US citizen, survived and was talking with investigators, Street said. He didn't appear to be intoxicated, but authorities were still investigating his condition as well as any possible mechanical problems, he said. There was some wind, but it was not strong enough to cause problems, Street said. The US National Transportation Safety Board has sent a team to investigate. Millions of people visit Utah's five national parks every year. Last year, about 87,000 people from China visited the state, making them the fastest-growing group of Utah tourists, according to state data. More than half of visitors from China travel on tour buses, said Vicki Varela, managing director of the Utah Office of Tourism. Associated Press (China Daily Global 09/23/2019 page7)
