                    Lord mayor keen to strengthen London-China links
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The UK is ready to work with China to foster inclusive growth and champion open trade at a time of shifting global balances, the newly-installed Lord Mayor of the City of London has told China Daily.Peter Estlin, 57, was speaking in an exclusive interview with China Daily at his Mansion House office, located at the heart of London's historical financial district, three weeks after taking office as the 691st lord mayor."The desire is to drive towards free trade, remove the barriers, reduce poverty … allow a greater degree of collaboration, respect sovereignty and respect community, that's what we're looking to do as we move forward," he said.The centuries-old grand temple portico and ornate banqueting hall of the Mansion House are reminders of the bygone era of the British empire, but Estlin acknowledges time and the world have changed.Domestically, London is fighting to maintain its status as a leading global banking center amid the uncertainty of Brexit, and internationally the UK is defending its inherent values of market openness at a time of trade frictions and protectionist pressures.Estlin's role as lord mayor is to be an ambassador for London's financial services sector, helping the City of London forge international partnerships. In March 2019, he will be doing just that when he leads a British delegation to China to meet Chinese financial companies and regulators to discuss further collaboration opportunities.The day-to-day concerns of the city set the tone for his daily agenda, but Estlin said he wants to take a longer-term view to strengthen multilateralism and connectivity. As such, he said, the UK and China have much in common, highlighting the China-led Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, as a great platform to foster shared and sustainable development"BRI is not simply about infrastructure. Projects also contribute to local economies, and help teach local workers skills in construction and other areas," said Estlin, adding that such upskilling is already happening in markets such as Pakistan, where many BRI projects have been built in recent years.BRI, proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2013, advocates improved connectivity of infrastructure, trade, ideas and knowledge among countries and regions.In recent years the City of London has actively branded itself as the BRI's finance hub, in an effort to secure deals and hedge against the pessimism of Brexit uncertainties. Just last month the City joined the research arm of China's central bank to launch a new report highlighting the role of London and other global financial centers in financing BRI projects.The report found that since 2013, more than 4,500 BRI projects have been financed globally, with an expected total project value exceeding $5 trillion. A number of British banks are heavily involved in the projects' financing. For example, Britain's Standard Chartered funded more than 50 BRI deals in 2017 alone, and last December it announced an additional $20 billion commitment to BRI projects by 2020.A banker by trade, Estlin has enjoyed a distinguished career at Salomon Brothers Asia, Citigroup and Barclays. His work has taken him to China numerous times, giving him an insight into the country's remarkable economic transformation over recent decades.His first visit was in 1998, just 20 years after the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy, which changed China from a planned economy to a market-driven one, allowing international companies greater access."China was perfectly friendly", Estlin says, recalling his initial impressions from his first visit, to help Solomon Brothers Asia build relationships with Chinese banks and regulators.After a few moments of reflection, he added that back then China struck him as "much more cautious" in its approach to both domestic policy and growing international engagement."In fairness, China was still navigating its path as a country, in terms of where it is positioning itself. If I do the compare and contrast, China in 1998 was more oriented towards its domestic agenda," he said.Three years late, in 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization, an event that paved way for China's rapid export-led growth. With that came confidence and an international perspective. "Today, China's role on the international stage is far more prominent and deserved," he added.In 1978, the size of China's economy was just one-40th that of the US, but during the past 40 years, China's GDP has grown by an average of around 9.5 percent a year. By 2017, the size of China's economy had grown to more than three-fifths that of the US, according to International Monetary Fund estimates.With economic growth, China also took a leadership role on many multinational issues. Key examples include China's commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change, and championing of globalization through opening up its market for greater international access through initiatives such as last month's inaugural China International Import Expo, or CIIE, in Shanghai.Inevitably, such engagement also led to closer collaboration between China and the UK. An example is when China used its G20 leadership to put green finance on the summit agenda for the first time, China invited the UK to co-chair this agenda.The UK was a country of honor at the CIIE, and according to British government estimates, the hundreds of British companies that attended the expo jointly secured around 2 billion pounds ($2.56 billion) worth of orders. There are many other such examples of collaboration, especially in the "golden era" of relations since China's President Xi Jinping's UK state visit in 2015.Estlin said meeting Xi in London in 2015 allowed him to understand China's strong international commitment."He showed China's interest in wanting to help to set an international framework and a recognition that if China is to continue to grow, growth has to take place internationally. We continue to be grateful to China for opening up its markets and the country has promised to look further at liberalization, to encourage more people to invest in China, which creates a sense of participation and a richer dialogue," he said.

                    Speech by Ambassador Liu Xiaoming at the Chinese for Labour Gala Chinese New Year Banquet 2019
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Speech by H.E. Ambassador Liu Xiaoming at the Chinese for Labour Gala Chinese New Year Banquet 2019: Put People First and Deliver Benefits to the PeopleMr. Jeremy Corbyn,Mr. Sonny Leong,Members of the Shadow Cabinet,Ladies and Gentlemen:Good evening!It is a real delight to join you at the Chinese for Labour Gala Chinese New Year Banquet to celebrate the Year of the Pig.This is the 26th Chinese New Year celebration that I have attended this year. Over the past weeks, I was glad to see the Chinese New Year becoming a festival of both the Chinese and British people. This is a vivid demonstration of the ever-stronger popular support for China-UK friendship.I watched the video message sent by Mr. Corbyn early this month, wishing Chinese people a happy Chinese New Year. The message has been warmly received by the Chinese communities in the UK and across the world.This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. It is also the 65th anniversary of the establishment of China-UK diplomatic relationship at the level of chargé d'affaire.In the past 70 years, it was when the Labour Party was in office that China and the UK achieved three major leaps in our relations:The first leap was the diplomatic recognition of the People's Republic of China three months after its founding. The UK was the first major Western country to do so;The second leap was Hong Kong's return to China. This enabled our two countries to shed the burden of history and move on;The third leap was the establishment of China-UK comprehensive strategic partnership, which was the very first between China and an EU member state.I wish to take this opportunity to express my appreciation and thanks to the Labour Party for your contribution to the development of China-UK relations.In the new era of ever-deepening globalization, how should a government or a political party set its goal?President Xi Jinping said, "The people's aspiration for a better life is our goal." The Labour manifesto clearly states that the Party is "for the many, not for the few".In China-UK relations, putting the people first and working for the many is not only the goal but also the foundation.How to deliver more benefits to our people? My answer is this: We must stay "committed to doing three important things".First, China and the UK should stay committed to open cooperation, so as to deliver the benefit of cooperation to the people of both countries.Chinese companies have invested more in the UK in the past five years than they did in the previous 30 years. Now the accumulated investment from China totals more than $20 billion. According to UK statistics, British export to China reached $27.47 billion in 2018, increasing by 30.1% year on year, much higher than the UK's GDP growth.As China deepens reform, opens wider to the world and shifts to high-quality development, China will create more opportunities for other countries in the world, including the UK.There will be two such opportunities this year which we hope the UK will seize, namely, the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation and the Second China International Import Expo. We invite the UK to share in the opportunities of the Belt and Road Initiative and to introduce more products and services to the Chinese market.It is our hope that the UK will remain open and inclusive, resist disruptions and continue to foster a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory business environment for Huawei and other Chinese companies in the UK.Second, China and the UK should stay committed to exchanges and mutual learning, so as to gain more popular support for China-UK friendship.Friendship between the people is the most valuable resource for China-UK relations. As we speak, there are more than 190,000 Chinese students studying in the UK, and over 10,000 British students in China; more than 600 British primary and secondary schools have included the Chinese language in their curriculum; and more than 1.5 million mutual visits are made every year.These are facilitated by greater ease of travel. Last year alone, eight new direct flights were launched between the cities of our two countries, increasing the total number to 168 flights per week. This means on average there is one flight for every hour.China and the UK are different in social system, history, culture and development stage, but both are time-honoured civilisations. As Mr. Corbyn said in his New Year message, it is important that we offer "the hand of friendship" and be "kind to each other".To be specific, we should follow the principles of mutual respect and equality, and view each other's development as opportunities, rather than challenges, still less threats.Moreover, we should enhance exchanges and cooperation between our parties, legislatures, media, youth and women. This will enhance mutual understanding, deepen friendship and cement public support for our bilateral relations.Third, China and the UK should stay committed to peaceful development and work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind.Today's world is a place where the interests and future of all countries are deeply intertwined. Peace and development remain the theme of our times.Both China and the UK are defenders of world peace, supporters of the multilateral system and participants in economic globalisation. In the new era, it is all the more important that westand firm against protectionism, unilateralism, the "Cold-War mentality" and "gunboat diplomacy";uphold the rule-based international trade system;take the lead in building an open world economy;and work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind.There is a great deal our two countries can do to deliver more benefits to the people of the world.Ladies and Gentlemen:China attaches great importance to strengthening relations between the political parties of our two countries.Last year, Mr. Cai Qi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Party Secretary of Beijing, paid a successful visit to the UK. During the visit, he had a very good meeting with Mr. Corbyn. I would like to repeat the invitation for Mr. Corbyn and Labour Party delegations to visit China whenever it is convenient to both sides. We also hope the Labour Party will take an active part in the 11th China-UK Leadership Forum to be held in the UK this year.I would also like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to Chinese for Labour, which will celebrate the 20th anniversary this year. In the past 20 years, you have worked vigorously to encourage members of the Chinese community to get involved in politics. You have also made great efforts to enhance China-UK dialogue and exchanges.Tonight's banquet is my last Chinese New Year celebration this year. In China, we have a saying, "It is never too late to have a delicious supper." I wish to thank the Labour Party for bringing the Chinese New Year celebrations for the Year of the Pig to a successful conclusion.In the new year, we stand ready to work with the Labour Party to make new and greater contribution to the steady development of China-UK relations and to deliver more benefits to the people of our two countries.In conclusion, I wish everybody a happy, healthy and prosperous Year of the Pig!Thank you!

                Learn the Oriental Wisdom and Understand the Future of ChinaChairman Stephen Perry,Professor Martine Albrow,Dr Martin Jacques,Chairman Fang Wenjian,My Lords,Distinguished Guests,Ladies and Gentlemen:Welcome to the Symposium on Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy.This is the 46th year of my career as a diplomat, and the 10th year as Chinese Ambassador to the UK. Many British friends asked me, "What has impressed you most during your time in the UK?" My answer is: the successful state visit by President Xi Jinping to the UK in 2015.It was memorable not just because it was the first time for me to receive a head of state from China as Ambassador. More importantly, this historic visit ushered in the China-UK "Golden Era". It also charted the course for China-UK relations in the second decade of the 21st century.At the banquet held by the Lord Mayor of the City of London, President Xi Jinping said,"The path that the Chinese people follow has been a choice of history. What the Chinese people want is a better life. What the Chinese people long for is a world of peace and development."He also said that "China will stand firm with all other countries to meet whatever challenges that may lie ahead", and that "roads will only become broader when more people travel on them".These powerful words reflect a strategic thinking. They embody the oriental wisdom that values the common good, inclusiveness and mutual learning. They also demonstrate President Xi Jinping's vision, courage and responsibilities as a leader of a big country.As the Chinese Ambassador to the UK, I regard it as my mission to enhance mutual understanding, mutual trust and cooperation between China and the UK, and to tell the story of the real China to the people of the UK and of the world.In recent years, the increase of media reports on China has been exponential. But to be frank, these reports are not all of good quality. There are more negative voices than positive ones. China's development is regarded as an opportunity by some but a challenge or even a threat by others.So, how will a richer and stronger China behave? How will it influence the world? To these questions, Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy has provided the best answer. To understand today's China and China's diplomacy, one must study and try to understand Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy.Now I would like to share with you my views by answering three questions.First, what is at the core of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy?Last June, I attended the Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs in Beijing, where Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy was established as the guiding thought that provides basic principles and guidelines for China foreign policy. It is an innovation, a breakthrough and a leap forward in the evolution of the thought on China's diplomacy.Now I would like to share with you my understanding on Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy from three perspectives.First, Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy inherits and develops China's cultural and diplomatic tradition.The pursuit for peace, good neighbourliness and harmony has been running in the blood of the Chinese nation.For generations,We have prized and pursued "peace for all under heaven";We have believed in win-win as embedded in the ancient teaching that "the interests to be considered should be the interests of all";We have upheld the ideals of harmony and inclusion rooted in the words of ancient philosophers, such as "there should be harmony without uniformity" and "do not do unto others what you would not have them do unto you";And because of our belief that "all under the sun belong to one big family", we are convinced that countries should always come to each other's assistance and work towards the same direction.These are the traditional Chinese wisdoms behind China's diplomacy.This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. In the past 70 years, we have formed the diplomatic tradition with unique Chinese features, namely, independence, peaceful development and win-win cooperation.Several decades ago when China itself was struggling to make ends meet, we shared what little we had with other developing countries striving for independence and economic growth.In 1976, I was a junior diplomat in Zambia, where I had the honour to attend the handover ceremony of Tazara, a railway linking Tanzania and Zambia. More than 60 Chinese workers died in the process of building Tazara and were laid to rest on the African continent. Tazara highlights the value of putting righteousness above material gains. It embodies the spirit of equality and win-win cooperation. These ideas have always been deeply embedded in China's foreign policy.Following the adoption of the policies of reform and opening up, China came to the strategic conclusion that peace and development were the theme of the times. This fundamental judgment continued to be the bedrock of China's diplomacy up to and after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.At the same time, China's diplomacy has also kept abreast with the changing times and made new progress in line with the evolving landscape abroad and reality at home. We have put forward a number of new ideals, proposals and initiatives that are imbued with Chinese characteristics, embody the spirit of our times and provide guidance to the progress of mankind.Second, Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy encapsulates the concepts and practice of China's diplomacy.At the centre of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy are ten key concepts known as ten "persistent efforts". These concepts are the essence of China's diplomacy that are extracted and distilled from China's long-held principles and decades of practice.Together they constitute the foundation of the idea and practice of major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics.Out of the ten concepts, I would like to stress three.First, making persistent effort to build a community with a shared future for mankind, with the aim of safeguarding world peace and promoting common development.This lofty goal of China's diplomacy in the new era has been written into the Constitution of China and the Constitution of the Communist Party of China. It is also endorsed in the documents of important regional and international organisations including the UN.Second, making persistent effort to advance the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in line with the principle of achieving shared growth through discussion and collaboration.BRI is the overarching design for China's opening up and international cooperation and will remain so for a considerable period of time to come. This is an important measure to open up China's market wider to the world in the new era. More than six years after it was proposed, BRI is becoming the most popular public goods and largest platform for international cooperation.Third, making persistent effort to follow a path of peaceful development based on mutual respect and win-win cooperation.This is a basic principle that must be upheld in China's diplomatic initiatives on a long-term basis. Peaceful development is a path to common development. It is leading to a new type of state-to-state relations.Third, Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy provides an assessment and definition on the development of the world and the role of China.President Xi Jinping pointed out that the world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a hundred years:Last century, mankind experienced two World Wars and a Cold War that lasted for nearly half a century.The 21st century is witnessing accelerated multi-polarisation, the rise of emerging countries and profound adjustments in the international landscape. At the same time, the world economic growth remains sluggish, the financial crisis is taking its toll and unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.Under such circumstances, how does China see itself and the world? Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy provides the best answer:We should strive for national revitalisation;We should promote the progress of mankind;We should adopt a historical perspective, see the big picture and play our role.China's hard work over the past decades has not only brought about a better life for its more than 1.3 billion people. It is also an important contribution to peace and prosperity in the world and the common interests and benefits of people of all countries.No matter what development stage China reaches, it will continue to be a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of international order.

                    Xi calls for dialogue of civilizations
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Event aims to promote cross-cultural exchanges, mutual understandingIn Beijing's leafy Olympic Green stands a stately edifice, the curve of whose facade, inspired by the eaves of ancient Chinese architecture, symbolizes a bridge connecting different cultures around the world.The design of the building, the China National Convention Center, befits an event it is about to host on Wednesday - the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations initiated by President Xi Jinping to promote cross-civilizational exchanges and mutual learning across this culturally diverse continent and build an Asian community with a shared future.Xi has long been a believer in, advocate of, model for and contributor to communications across civilizations. Whether during the time he lived in a cave dwelling in a remote village decades ago, or now standing at the helm of the world's most populous country, he maintains that exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations have empowered human progress as well as global peace and development.That conviction matters even more today. In a world beleaguered by alarming anti-globalization sentiment, rising protectionism and unilateralism, mutating security threats and resurging assertions of a "clash of civilizations", cross-civilizational communication is of vital significance and in dire need of fresh vitality.Teenager's passion Over 40 years ago a teenager fascinated by Faust, a masterpiece of Western literature written by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, walked over a dozen kilometers of bumpy and dusty country road just to borrow the book from a fellow student.That teenager was Xi Jinping.It was toward the end of the 1960s, an age of scarcity with little to read, when Xi was sent from Beijing to work as a farmer in a poverty-stricken village in northwestern China's Shaanxi province.An avid reader of not only Chinese but also foreign literary works, Xi read whatever books he managed to find during his seven years there, from old Chinese textbooks to plays written by William Shakespeare."To be, or not to be," Xi pondered the question on the barren Loess Plateau, and eventually made up his mind to dedicate himself to serving his country and the people.Like other young men, Xi would emulate his favorite protagonist in the books.After reading What Is to Be Done?, a novel written by the Russian author Nikolai Chernyshevsky in which the leading character lives an ascetic life, even going so far as to sleep on a bed of nails to strengthen his will, Xi removed his cotton-padded mattress and chose to sleep directly on a brick bed so as to strengthen his own willpower."Art and literary works are the best way for different nations and peoples to understand and communicate with each other," Xi said in 2014 when recalling the books he had read during his youth.President's endeavor As one of the busiest globe-trotting world leaders, Xi misses no opportunity to promote mutual respect, understanding and learning among different cultures and civilizations wherever he goes."What's past is prologue," he quoted Shakespeare - whose works he first read 40 years ago - at the British Parliament during his state visit to the United Kingdom in the autumn of 2015, shedding light on his country's perspective on China-UK relations.Ahead of his state visit to Italy in March, Xi, in a signed article published by leading Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, told the story of Chinese emissary Gan Ying sent to search for Da Qin, the Chinese name of the Roman Empire, during the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220).Recalling the article, Francesco Sisci, a senior consultant for the Italian Minister of European Affairs, said he "saw in between the lines an amicable and wise leader".Quoting pearls of wisdom from other cultures has been a hallmark of Xi's speeches on the global stage, which demonstrates not only his art of communication, but also how open the Chinese are toward other civilizations.Yet his commitment goes far beyond that. His overseas trips have seen him attend cultural events, reach out to the local people and pay visits to landmarks of cultural heritage.A photo from Xi's 2015 trip to the UK - which went viral - shows the president enjoying a pint of Greene King IPA beer in the company of his British host, then prime minister David Cameron, at a pub near London.In a speech delivered in 2014 at the headquarters of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Xi reeled off his tours of cultural heritage sites from Mexico's Chichen Itza, an archaeological site of the Maya civilization, to Uzbekistan's Samarkand, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Central Asia."I have visited many places around the world," Xi said, adding "what I like most is exploring the varied civilizations of our five continents".Statesman's vision A highlight of Xi's trip to Italy emerged in the picturesque and culturally significant Villa Madama, where the president and Italian Prime Minster Giuseppe Conte witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding on bilateral cooperation within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative.The BRI, proposed by Xi in 2013, was inspired by one of the most renowned legacies of cross-civilizational communication in history - the Silk Road, a network of ancient trade routes linking China in the East with ancient Rome in the West and beyond.A priority of Xi's signature initiative is to build a road connecting different civilizations where mutual respect will replace discrimination, exchanges will replace estrangement, and mutual learning will replace clashes.The vision was reflected in Xi's speech at the UNESCO headquarters, during which he highlighted diversity, equality and inclusiveness among civilizations and the role cross-civilizational exchanges and mutual learning have played in fueling the progress of humanity.The landmark address, published in May this year by Qiushi, one of the most influential periodicals in China, whose name means "seeking truth", is no less and even more relevant today, given the world's present challenges.Among the global threats of security and climate change is the thinly veiled sense of superiority held by some in the West, who are in the midst of resurrecting an outdated "clash of civilizations" theory.What fuels conflict and leads to armed conflict is the absence of real dialogue, said Helmy al-Namnam, a former Egyptian minister of culture, ahead of the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations."China's initiative to hold a major conference on the dialogue of civilizations in Asia is a very important move to pave the way for the language of dialogue over the language of conflict," he said.(China Daily Global 05/15/2019 page4)

                    UK's 'name and shame' effort targets food waste
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                When the numbers are laid out, the problem of global food waste is tough to swallow.Moral considerations are glaring－people waste about a third of all food produced on the planet each year, according to the charity Waste and Resources Action Programme, while 815 million people are undernourished.The economic loss is huge. Each year, 1.3 billion tons of food, valued at $940 billion, is wasted around the world.The environmental cost is similarly concerning: Food waste accounts for 8 percent of global greenhouse emissions.In Europe－where 88 million tons of food waste is generated annually at a cost of 143 billion euros ($160 billion)－countries are increasingly rallying to tackle the problem.Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European Commissioner for health and food safety, has described food waste as the "most repulsive side of consumerism", and Michael Gove, the UK's environment secretary, has labeled the issue an "environmental, economic and moral scandal".Denmark has emerged as a regional leader in terms of waste reduction, thanks in large part to the efforts of activist Selina Juul, whose charity Stop Wasting Food has helped slash annual food waste in the country by 25 percent.Looking for a protagonist to lead the charge in the UK, Gove recently assigned businessman Ben Elliot to be the nation's food surplus and waste champion.Elliot is best known as the chief executive of luxury lifestyle group Quintessentially, which provides private concierge services to the world's rich and famous.His celebrity connections have already borne fruit. Last week, actress Liv Tyler took part in a 300-mile cycle for a food charity, while singer Elton John and author Sophie Dahl have donated at other events organized by Elliot.But it is his combative rhetoric that has some of the biggest food players in the UK paying attention.Through an initiative called Step Up to the Plate, Elliot is challenging the food services industry to cut waste in half by 2030. More than 100 companies, including Starbucks, Tesco, Waitrose and Nestle, have signed on over the past month, and Elliot says a further 51 big hospitality companies are "in the crosshairs"."We are going to name and shame" organizations that are doing a bad job, and also recognize those doing a good job, Elliot said.Via this initiative and several others, Waste and Resources Action Programme estimates that the UK now leads the world in terms of food waste prevention activity.

                    Speech by H.E. Ambassador Liu Xiaoming at the Official Banquet of the China-UK Business Leaders Forum: Produce New Outcomes and Provide New Impetus
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Lord Mayor Alderman Peter Estlin,Mr. Richard Burn,Distinguished Guests,Ladies and Gentlemen:Good evening!It is a real delight to join you at the official banquet of the China-UK Business Leaders Forum hosted by the City of London.Today is my "City Day".Early in the morning, I was at the London Stock Exchange for the Market Open in honour of the 15th World Chinese Entrepreneurs Convention coming to London.Right after that, I was here in the Guildhall for the International Forum for Green Finance hosted by Asian Financial Cooperation Association.And now, here I am again joining you for the banquet of the China-UK Business Leaders Forum.Never before in my more than nine years as Chinese Ambassador to the UK have I ever visited the City three times and given three speeches on economic and financial subjects in a single day!I think this gives full testament to the vitality of China-UK financial cooperation. It shows the financial sectors of our two countries are bound together in a community with shared interests in win-win cooperation.The international financial sector is experiencing enormous transformation. This is as a result of constant upgrading of new technologies such as big data and cloud computing, which is giving birth to new concepts such as fin-tech, inclusive finance and green finance.I cannot agree more with the theme of today's forum, namely, "A Partnership for Sustainable and Innovative Growth". I think it reflects the new trend in the development of international financial services. And it encourages us to explore new frontiers of China-UK financial cooperation.We must all ask ourselves this question as we go forward: Where do we go from here for China-UK financial cooperation? How can we achieve greater progress?I think we should make the following three efforts.First, we should match our comparative strengths.The City of London, as a top financial centre in the world, has a time-honoured history, extensive management expertise and a rich talent pool.At the same time, London is also the world's largest RMB offshore trading centre and the second largest RMB offshore clearing centre. It is home to overseas branches of eight banks and many insurance companies from China.China, with its newly-acquired financial strength, and the UK, with its traditional financial power, have comparative strengths in financial services, management and innovation. The strengths of our two countries combined could achieve multiplying effect.Second, we should fully leverage the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).BRI could add wings to China-UK financial cooperation.Britain is the first major Western country to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the first to sign the Guiding Principles on Financing the Development of the Belt and Road, and the first to appoint a special envoy and set up an expert board for BRI.China and the UK have also worked together to launch the G20 Green Finance Study Group, signed an agreement on cooperation in third markets, and issued the China-UK Strategic Plan for Financial Services.China-UK cooperation on BRI and at multilateral forums will surely have a positive, extensive and profound impact on the world.Third, we should make full use of China's opening-up policies.China is deepening reform and opening its door wider to the world. It has taken concrete steps to open up the financial sector.In April last year, China issued detailed measures and a timetable for further opening up the financial sector. Last July, the Chinese Government announced 11 measures, including bringing forward the deadline for lifting the foreign ownership caps in joint venture firms in sectors such as securities, future and life insurance from 2021 to 2020. This speedy opening up promises a brighter future for China-UK financial cooperation.Talking about China-UK financial cooperation, I would speak highly of a special project. At the end of last year, Lord Mayor Alderman Estlin and I witnessed the launch of the China-UK Charity Initiative. This is a joint venture between Chinese and British financial sectors. I am glad to see that in less than a year, this initiative has borne fruitful results. It has funded a school for poor children in Shaanxi Province, and it will launch a heath care project in a poor village in Yunnan Province.I wish the China-UK Charity Initiative great success. I am sure it will make greater contribution to the charity work of our two countries.Ladies and Gentlemen:The Chinese people often say, "We should seize the day and seize the hour."We are living in a complex and constantly-changing world. It is a world full of new opportunities and new challenges. It is a world that offers invaluable opportunities for China-UK financial cooperation.I hope and believe that the financial communities of our two countries will tap the potential and seize the opportunities. I can count on you to make sure that China-UK financial cooperation will produce new outcomes and provide new impetus for financial and economic growth in the world!Thank you!
