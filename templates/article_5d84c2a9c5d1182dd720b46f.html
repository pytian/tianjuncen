                The resource tax on several scarce minerals including tin ore, molybdenum ore, magnesite and talc have been raised according to a recent notice jointly issued by the Ministry of Finance and State Administration of Taxation, Economics Information Daily reported Monday.The tax on tin ore has been raised the highest, 20 times the previous figure, said the report. "All the minerals concerned are scarce resources, which are of important strategic values. The tax raises signal the government is strengthening efforts in resources conservation," said a staff member from China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association.According to statistics from the association, China ranks first in terms of tin ore, molybdenum ore, and magnesite reserves.Taking molybdenum, a nonrenewable mineral, for example, China's reserves account for 38.4 percent of the world's total, according to the United States Geological Survey. Japan and Russia have established molybdenum strategic reserves, said the report. Officials from the Ministry of Finance and State Administration of Taxation once said that China's resource tax rate is quite low and a tax increase is beneficial for protecting important resources.An Tifu, professor at Renmin University of China, said that resource tax reform constitutes an important part in the overall tax reforms, which needs to undergo a structural adjustment. The added tax may increase the costs of enterprises, therefore proper adjustment of other taxes should be taken into consideration so as to help enterprises maintain a balance in tax payments.

                China levies resource tax in Xinjiang
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - China's government Tuesday introduced a new tax on sales of crude oil and natural gas in the western Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said Wednesday.The 5 percent tax is aimed to increase revenue for the local government of the resource-rich Xinjiang, and is part of a support package for the region unveiled at a central work conference held in Beijing last month.The new measure, a shift from current taxes based on output, is also a move to save natural resources by raising the consumption cost. The government intends to impose the tax nationwide after regional trials.Thick oil, high condensation oil and high sulphur natural gas are taxed less at 3 percent, while oil recovered by tertiary methods is taxed at 3.5 percent.Jia Kang, director of the Institute of Fiscal Science under the MOF, said the new policy was a big step forward in the country's reform of resource taxation.The reform has been postponed twice in recent years. It was first delayed in 2007 on concerns that it would help speed up price hikes and add inflationary pressure to an overheating economy. The second delay in 2008 was caused by fears of hurting enterprises amid an economic slowdown resulting from the fallout of the financial crisis.The introduction of the tax came at the "best time" as China had seen gradual and steady recovery from the economic slowdown and had not seen "apparent" inflationary pressures, said An Tifu, an economist with the Renmin University of China.Experts said the trial reform would pave the way for a nationwide rollout.It would also improve the pricing mechanism for resources products and economic restructuring, and increase tax revenues for local governments, Jia said.China previously imposed a volume tax of up to 30 yuan ($4.39) per tonne of crude sold and up to 15 yuan per thousand cubic meters of natural gas sold.Xinjiang was rich in crude oil and gas, with output of crude oil at 25.18 million tonnes last year, said Professor Wang Yudai, of the Party School of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.The amount accounted for about 13.3 percent of China's total crude output, which stood at 189.49 million tonnes in 2009.The new tax policy would increase returns on crude sales by 4 billion to 5 billion yuan, bringing up to about 6.3 billion yuan to the local government fiscal revenue, Wang said.Chen Yuenian, official from the Xinjiang taxation bureau, said the increased revenue could be used to improve people's livelihoods and environmental protection.President Hu Jintao said last month that resources development should be directly linked to the welfare of the local people.However, there are concerns that the new tax would erode income of oil and gas producers, including the country's two biggest companies, PetroChina and Sinopec.The two companies were not commenting Wednesday.A report from Guotai Junan Securities said PetroChina's crude output in Xinjiang accounted for 17.92 percent of the company's total and the figure for gas was 35.36 percent.If the tax was levied from the start of this year, the company's pre-tax profit would drop by 2.21 percent in 2010, with the price of crude oil at $80 per barrel, according to the report.Wang said the trial run of the resources tax would add to costs for oil and gas companies, which would probably in turn increase prices downstream.However, the new measure would help improve management of companies and reduce waste, and be conducive to energy conservation and environmental protection in Xinjiang, Wang said.

                Govt puts out details of budgets
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - The public can expect to review the ways that the central government departments spend tax money on overseas travel, cars and receptions for the first time in June. Eighty-eight of China's 98 central government departments had published their budgets by Friday, the Ministry of Finance said, whereas 75 departments had done so last year. Earlier this month, an executive meeting of the State Council, China's Cabinet, ordered the 98 central government departments to publish such information this year. Certain departments have gone so far as to release budgets showing their spending on specific items, rather than spending on certain categories or spending out of certain funds, the Ministry of Finance said on Saturday on its website. Related readings: Central departments issue budgets to public A cure for fiscal failure?Upon receiving the legislature's approval of the report, the Ministry of Finance and other departments will publish information about their spending on the three items for 2010 alongside their planned spending for 2011. Taxpayers in China have seldom been able to review spending on the three items. Responding to what many consider to be an absence of transparency, the State Council issued a statement in May saying, "the access to financial budgets still falls short of people's expectations, especially since some departments lag behind others in making their budgets public and some of the information being released does not contain enough details." The State Council called on Party and government departments to manage their money in accordance with the law and improve the "depth and scope" of the financial information being released. Many government administration experts said the progress toward those goals announced by the Ministry of Finance is a "good start" on China's "long road to full transparency". "Only detailed budgets can actually enable our people to participate in supervision," said An Tifu, a professor in fiscal finance at Renmin University of China. "But it's not only the spending on these three items that attract public attention that ought to be disclosed. More departments should release details on other items, in accordance with international standards". Government officials told China Daily that audits and other checks are needed to ensure published budgets are credible, since there are many ways to practice deceptive accounting. Spending on travel, cars and lavish receptions, for example, can be recorded under categories. The Ministry of Science and Technology published its annual budget in April, saying it will spend about 40.2 million yuan ($6.2 million) on overseas trips, vehicle purchases and official receptions this year. In 2010, 18 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities disclosed their fiscal budgets and budgets for government funds and 27 provincial-level regions publicized such information in 2011.

            <p>
                          BEIJING - A research institute under China's top science think tank said on Tuesday that it has terminated a contract to buy a printer chip for 20 times the market price.              The decision came amid protests from critics who had deemed the purchase to be extravagant.                  The Chinese Academy of Sciences' national space science center issued an announcement online saying its procurement officers "could not find other suitable chips" when it had agreed to buy the device.                      According to an order form published anonymously online, the center agreed in November to pay 6,274 yuan ($980) for an HP 128-megabyte chip to be used in a black-and-white printer. Other products that can be used for the same purpose carry a price of about 300 yuan on the open market.                          In a statement released on Tuesday, the center said it never paid the price listed in the contract.                              "The procurement procedure is not finished yet," it said.                                  "The procurement office found the flaws in the contract and therefore did not pay. The contract has been terminated."                                      The statement also said the center's departments will pay more attention to procurement to ensure that State research money is not misused.                                          Wang Gangqiang, a researcher on governance with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the center is not a government agency but is still subject to procurement requirements because it receives public money.                                              Publicity officials with the Chinese Academy of Sciences declined to say whether anyone from the center will be punished for any irregularities found in the procurement.                                                  Some media have reported that the seller in the chip deal was to be the technology supplier Beijing Huajiang Technology.                                                      Zhou Xuan, who is in charge of the company's government-equipment sales, declined to say if the company had signed a contract arranging for the chip to be sold at the unusually high price to the center.                                                          Following the center's statement on Tuesday, calls to Zhou's cell phone went unanswered.                                                              Zhang Wang, a worker in Zhou's team, said the case is unusual because Beijing Huajiang Technology has set unified prices for each of its products. To sell them to the government, it must first go through a bidding process.                                                                  On Tuesday, netizens left 14,500 comments about the case on Yahoo. Most of them denounced the chip contract as being evidence of "corruption".                                                                      "It's surprising that an institute that is so aloof in an ivory tower could be so corrupt," said a netizen from Jinan in Shandong who did not identify himself.                                                                          Another netizen from Chongqing said there apparently is "a kickback included in this deal".                                                                              Previous reports have said that government agencies in Jianyang, Sichuan province, and in Fushun, Liaoning province, had bought iPods under the guise of procuring "portable hard disks" or "USB flash disks".                                                                                  The misuse of public funds cannot be stopped unless the details of government procurement are made open to the public, said Wang Baoming, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Governance.                                                                                      "Only detailed budgets can actually enable our people to participate in supervision," said An Tifu, a professor in fiscal finance at Renmin University of China.

                China's State Council, the cabinet, plans to include more cities to levy property tax in 2012 after Shanghai and Chongqing were chosen as the first pilot cities a year ago, Economic Information reported Friday, citing information from the official website of the central government.Despite speculation about potential pilot cities, first-tier cities are better choices because their housing markets are relatively more mature and second-hand houses there have replaced newly built houses as the main body of sales, said Chen Guoqiang, vice-president of China Real Estate Society.Guangzhou and Shenzhen are the prime candidates of all the qualified cities boasting a thriving property market, according to Wang Haibin, a chief analyst of World Union, a property market consultancy.However, the latest report by Founder Securities showed that well-equipped second-tier cities are more likely to be favored.Property tax can help curb speculative home purchases as people have to take the cost of carry into account when deciding to buy houses, said Chen.The tax is supposed to evolve into a long-standing system rather than a temporary means to control real estate market, he added.In addition to its important role in reducing market bubbles, property tax will also bring in substantial revenues for local governments suffering financial difficulties, said Professor An Tifu from Renmin University of China.But the problem with the current property taxation is setting up a good coordination mechanism to ensure equality in levying property tax on individuals. It is often very difficult to tell qualifiers apart from duty-free houses considering the complex housing situations in China, warned Yang Zhiyong, a researcher at National Academy of Economic Strategy under Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.According to a study, an improved formula is to tax stocking houses as well as new homes.In light of a fair tax law, the taxation should cover both luxury and common houses unless they are defined as property concerning the residents' right to exist, the study said.Some rural houses with limited property rights could also be included to benefit farmers and local governments. This will be a good way to legitimize these types of houses, which rarely meet current urban land regulations, said Yang.

                China's fiscal reform will boost growth
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - Less tax for small businesses and more financial support for local government are on the cards as the Chinese leadership considers to start reforming the fiscal system.On August 1, the turnover tax was replaced by a value-added tax (VAT)  in the transportation industry and six service sectors.VAT and turnover tax were suspended for businesses with monthly revenue below 20,000 yuan ($3,257) on August 1, benefiting more than 6 million enterprises.The VAT refers to a tax levied on the difference between a commodity's price before taxes and its cost of production, while turnover tax refers to a levy on a business's gross revenues.The reform reduced taxes by over 50 billion yuan for small businesses in pilot regions in the first half year. Billions in tax reductions are expected when the reform expands nationwide.Fiscal reform is crucial to China's economic overhaul, said Yang Zhiyong, a researcher at the Institute of Finance and Trade Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).Over-reliance on land sales for fiscal revenue and poor real estate market control are at the heart of changes to the tax system, Yang added.The current fiscal system was established in 1994, and delegated powers to local governments while reinforcing the central government's sway on the macroeconomy. The system has to be improved as many cash-strapped local governments now face debt problems, Yang said.The upcoming Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) is certain to bring about further fiscal reform, with Premier Li Keqiang expecting ministries to roll out new tax plans.Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said in August that changes to tax on business turnover, consumption, resources and property will continue in the name of economic development.One major issue is enhanced budget disclosure and budget performance management. Supervision of how the government meets the budget target is vital, according to Bai Jingming, deputy director of the financial sciences institute at the Finance Ministry.The top Chinese fiscal regulator in late August issued a timetable for disclosing budgets and final accounts for governments above the county-level before 2015, while the State Council, China's cabinet, issued a similar timetable for disclosure of spending on receptions. vehicles and overseas trips.A flat fiscal pattern and more fiscal support for governments of cities and towns can increase growth, Bai added.Meanwhile, the personal income tax, resource tax and property tax are expected to be amended to improve income distribution and slow down  runaway housing prices.The key in reforming fiscal systems is balancing the government and the market, Yang Zhiyong said, "more rational and clearer roles will enable them each to boost the economy."Challenges remain for China's fiscal progress from interest groups and the public, said Prof. An Tifu, a finance expert with Renmin University."Once reform is outlined, the government will have more resolve and take concrete steps to carry it out," An said.

                President Xi Jinping chats with quake-hit villagers from Xiaozhai in Ludian county, Yunnan province, on Monday during his first inspection tour of the year. An earthquake in August left at least 617 people dead and 112 others missing. XINHUAYunnan county still recovering from disaster as winter settles inPresident Xi Jinping visited the quake-hit area of Ludian county in Yunnan province on Monday, inquiring about the livelihoods of the quake victims in the winter, Xinhua News Agency reported. August's magnitude-6.5 earthquake left at least 617 people dead with another 112 people missing and 3,143 people injured. It also forced the relocation of 254,000 residents and affected more than 1.08 million people. Xi told the quake victims that he feels for the loss of family members and friends, and was very concerned about how they were faring during the winter and with the reconstruction work. "I was very worried about how the relocation work was going, whether you can have hot food to eat, whether the children have schools to go to and if there are medical services available," he was quoted as saying. In a relocation camp in Xiaozhai township, Xi talked at length about issues including food, subsidies and sources of income with Zou Tifu, who was living in a tent with his grandson. He also inquired about the prices of vegetables and other groceries in the quake-hit area. Authorities in Ludian, a poverty-stricken mountainous area in northern Yunnan, should combine reconstruction work with poverty relief efforts, he said.Zhou Shangbi, an official with the civil affairs authority in Longtoushan township, the epicenter of the quake, said that despite efforts from authorities, there are still residents living in the remote and mountainous regions who are suffering from a shortage of necessities, including blankets and quilts."Some injured people missed the handout of disaster relief resources because they were being treated in hospital. They are also short of resources," she said.Fighting pollutionXi also called for authorities to step up environmental protection efforts as he visited the Dali Bai autonomous region in west Yunnan on Tuesday. "Yunnan has a very good natural environment. We must treasure it and not let it go to ruin in our hands," he was quoted by Xinhua News Agency as saying. He also said authorities should further improve water quality in Erhai lake, a renowned tourist attraction in the province.xuwei@chinadaily.com.cn
