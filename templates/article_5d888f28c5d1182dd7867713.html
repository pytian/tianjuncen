                He says two nations have similar strategic guidelines, adding that eastern neighbor brings strength and impetus to global growthAs China's neighbor and strategic partner, Kazakhstan appreciates China's achievements in fields such as social welfare, improvement of people's lives and poverty elimination, Shakhrat Nuryshev, Kazakhstan's ambassador to China, told Xinhua News Agency earlier this year.In these aspects, leaders from China and Kazakhstan have similar strategic guidelines, ensuring all people's well-being is fundamental for a country's prosperity in the 21st century, he said.Nur Otan, the ruling party of Kazakhstan, held its 18th national congress in February and passed its development guidelines for the period before 2030. The guidelines include new measures and priorities, such as guaranteeing people's high living standards, increasing their income and helping the low-income group, as well as improving education and healthcare, according to the ambassador.China has accumulated rich and successful experience when dealing with the similar issues, Nuryshev said, adding that he paid attention to "Chinese solutions" to the issues during this year's two sessions in March."We think highly of China's persistent efforts in poverty alleviation," Nuryshev said.He said China lifted more than 10 million people out of poverty every year in recent years. He said China did not enjoy the results alone, but shared its successful experience and stories with other countries and regions on reducing poverty.The Belt and Road Initiative, which was proposed by the Chinese government in 2013, also won praise from Nuryshev and he said it significantly increased liberalization of international trade and investment.Nuryshev said the initiative has won support from the majority of countries on the five continents and China has signed cooperation deals with more than 150 countries and international organizations. Trade in goods between China and other countries and regions involved in the initiative has reached $6 trillion in total to date.It, beyond doubt, will help people from related countries and regions to gain welfare, Nuryshev said.He said Kazakhstan is an important hub among different continents, countries and regions and the country's new economic policy, called Nurly Zhol - or "bright path", and the BRI are being connected smoothly. In total, 55 projects worth more than $27 billion are being implemented under the frameworks of BRI and Nurly Zhol, which will help fund companies that make high value-added products and create jobs."I think connection between the Nurly Zhol policy and the BRI not only helps increase the two countries' economic and trade relations, but also will promote such relations between Europe and Asia," he said.

                New airport in Beijing planning to enhance revenues with improved facilities, servicesChina's new $13 billion Beijing Daxing International Airport is expected to become a vital cog in global airport transfer passenger flows and improve Beijing's standing as a major global aviation hub, industry experts said.With its centralized design and vertically stacked domestic and international departure halls, the Daxing airport will offer passengers more convenient and faster services for check-ins, transfers, security checks and baggage reclaim, said France-based ADP Ingenierie, the architectural designer of the airport.Beijing has always been seen as a major transfer point for flights to the Americas and Europe. Out of the existing passenger flows at the Beijing Capital International Airport, nearly 20 percent is for departures and transfers from Beijing, indicating the huge potential.International airports vie with each other to attract more transfer passengers as it brings in more revenue due to higher demand for catering services, duty-free shopping and other related services. From the administrative perspective, it generates more money via aircraft parking and other service usage fees.On average, roughly 10,000 passengers transfer through the Beijing airport daily, according to data from Carnoc, a leading civil aviation website. The new airport, located 60 kilometers south of the city center, is expected to become China's largest integrated transportation hub and draw more international transfer passengers."The Daxing airport is more designed as a transfer airport. With a convenient layout, passengers need to walk only short distances for flight transfers, and could save more than an hour of transit time compared with the existing capital airport," said Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst.With its superior facilities, the Daxing airport will give Beijing the much-needed impetus to attract transfer passengers from Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan, US aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co said in a recent report."With growing capacity, carriers should consider how to raise their efficiencies at the two hubs and find ways to increase the proportion of transfer passengers," said Richard Wynne, managing director for regional marketing in China at Boeing Commercial Airplanes."A good connecting hub does not need to be in the middle of the country. Beijing has a good geographical location for international transfer passengers who fly from the Pacific and Europe," he said.Indeed, that to some extent also explains why the major State-owned carriers are banking on the new airport to bolster their fortunes. China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines, which currently have a market share of 12 percent and 13 percent in Beijing, are looking to improve it to 14 percent and 19 percent, after getting more slots at Daxing. The share of Air China will, however, fall from a dominant 43 percent to 42 percent, Boeing said.The Beijing Capital International Airport is currently the second busiest airport globally after Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and has been plagued by slot constraints. More than 50 domestic and foreign carriers have already evinced interest in operating flights from the Daxing airport.A large number of cities own multiple airports globally, but not many have two large-scale comprehensive airports, except some cities such as London, New York, Bangkok and Shanghai. With Daxing, Beijing joins the list."The opportunities brought by the new airport will help Chinese carriers to increase their operating efficiencies and profits, and offset the rising costs of managing complicated schedules. For instance, London has six airports in the area, and British Airways has been one of the most profitable airlines globally," Wynne said.Shanghai-based China Eastern said the opening of Daxing airport will be a historical growth opportunity for the carrier, and it will get more international flights rights in Beijing. By 2025, it is expected to account for 40 percent of the market share at Daxing airport."We will put 200 aircraft into operation at the new airport, with a total investment of more than 120 billion yuan ($16.7 billion), and launch more flights that connect China with the Americas, Europe, Oceania, Southeast Asia, South Korea and Japan," said Huang Pu, general manager of China Eastern Airlines' planning and coordination division in Beijing.China Eastern is also applying for new international flight rights from Daxing airport to some major global metropolises. During the first quarter of this year, international flights contributed 31.7 percent of sales revenue to the company, it said.Daxing airport has already started to sell some domestic and international flight tickets, and some of these are cheaper than the ones that operate on the same routes from the capital airport on the same day. A round-trip flight between Daxing airport and Helsinki in November would cost about 2,000 yuan cheaper than the same flight that departs from the capital airport."In the next few years, the capital airport will still be the first choice for business travelers. The price advantages of Daxing airport will attract more leisure and price-sensitive travelers," said Lin."In the short term, Daxing airport is likely to offer cheaper tickets than the capital airport to attract more passengers. Meanwhile, with increased overall capacity, ticket prices of the capital airport may go down as well, and passengers will be able to enjoy preferential tickets fares," he said.

                    BRI makes investment ties stronger than ever
                </p>
            </a>

                Entrepreneur calls China the gateway of international trade for KazahkstanAs China and Kazakhstan are closely linked with the Belt and Road Initiative, businesses from both sides have deepened their two-way trade and investment activities in recent years.According to Chinese Customs, trade between China and the Central Asian country reached $11.42 billion during the first seven months of this year, growing 8.7 percent year-on-year.Kazakhstan's exports to China increased 17.4 percent to reach $5.19 billion in the same period. The substantial growth resulted in a more balanced trade, as China's surplus decreased 48.8 percent to $630 million.China's investment in Kazakhstan also saw a steady growth last year. According to the Foreign Ministry of Kazakhstan, Chinese investment amounted to $1.5 billion in 2018, representing an increase of 6.1 percent year-on-year.As the country highlights foreign investment in its economic growth, many entities in Kazakhstan are in close contact with Chinese investors.According to a Xinhua New Agency report, the Astana International Financial Centre - Kazakhstan's regional financial services hub - said it is keen to attract Chinese investment in BRI projects and medium-sized enterprises in central Eurasia countries.During a June 18 presentation in Shanghai for Chinese investment companies, AIFC Governor Kairat Kelimbetov said the AIFC and its stock exchange, the Astana International Exchange, aim to "connect investors with promising projects that require financing to realize their full potential".Kelimbetov said BRI projects in the region are "a clear and important priority"."Another equally promising opportunity lies with mid-cap companies in Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Georgia and other countries in the region that are eager to engage with Chinese investors," he said. "We are helping to bring them together."Earlier that month, China's Silk Road Fund signed a memorandum of understanding on a strategic partnership with the AIFC and a framework agreement with Astana International Exchange to subscribe for a portion of common shares through the China-Kazakhstan Production Capacity Cooperation Fund, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Silk Road Fund, according to earlier reports in China Daily.The cooperation is expected to help better align the BRI with Kazakhstan's new economic policy Nurly Zhol ("bright path" in English), strengthen China-Kazakhstan bilateral ties in key areas, advance Kazakhstan's financial reforms and the development of its capital market, and provide an incentive for Kazakhstan's social and economic progress, according to a fund spokesman.It will also allow Silk Road Fund to leverage its financial expertise to boost the two countries' cooperation in production capacity through financial partnerships, the spokesman said.The deepening partnership under the BRI framework has resulted in enhanced presence of Chinese companies in Kazakhstan.According to a Xinhua report, the first phase of the Shelek 60-megawatt wind power project in Kazakhstan began construction on June 27, 2018.It was built by China's power development company PowerChina and is invested in by PowerChina and Samruk-Energy Company, Kazakhstan's largest State-owned energy development company.The project is located in the Ili River Valley, in the west extension of the Tianshan Mountains in Kazakhstan. It is about 150 kilometers from Almaty and 210 km from the Khorgos Land Port in China.After its completion, the project is expected to greatly alleviate the power shortage in southern Kazakhstan, a PowerChina representative said.While more Chinese investments are flowing to Kazakhstan, businesses from the Central Asian country have strengthened their presence in China.Kazakhstan's Continental Bridge Supply Chain signed an agreement with the Jiaozhou city government in February to build a farming products processing and commodities trade center in Jiaozhou, according to reports on the official website of the Qingdao city government.Jiaozhou is a part of the coastal metropolis of Qingdao in Shandong province.The project will demand a total investment of $100 million and will cover a land area of 50,000 square meters.It is designed to process high-quality wheat from Central Asia and Russia, producing flour targeting the Chinese and overseas markets.The project will also include a cross-border trading center for bulk cargo made in China, such as textiles and household appliances.As the inland country of Kazakhstan stands at the center of the Eurasia Continental Bridge that connects the eastern coasts of China and western coasts of Europe, many businesses in this country view China as the gateway for their international trade.Alexander Machkevitch, chairman of Eurasian Resources Group, said: "When Kazakhstan became independent, many people predicted it would find trouble because it was a landlocked country. People always recognize a coastal country has better conditions to develop its economy."However, the fact is that we don't need sea, because China is the seaward gateway for Kazakhstan."ERG now runs a cooperative project, Kazakhstan Aluminum Smelter, with China Nonferrous Metal Industry's Foreign Engineering and Construction.China accounts for 20-30 percent of ERG's total sales. It is a key sales destination for its high-carbon ferrochrome, cobalt and copper, according to the company.
