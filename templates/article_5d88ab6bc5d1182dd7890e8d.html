                Job training helps Africans build brighter future
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                East Africa's current population stands at more than 150 million, with approximately 80 percent of the young people unemployed. And every East African country is striving to achieve certain development milestones according to their respective national development policies.Traditionally, education in these countries has been focused on academic advancement from the primary to the university level, with formal employment after that. Employment opportunities are limited and cannot absorb the large number of youths who graduate each year from the local tertiary institutions.The alternative, therefore, has been to enroll them in institutions that offer technical and vocational education and training, known as TVET, in order to promote self-reliance and self-employment and, indirectly, increase employment opportunities.During the 2nd Africa-China-World Bank Education Partnership Forum's TVET Workshop in September last year, it was noted that developing countries were striving to make technology-based development advances, but were constrained by the shortage of an adequately skilled workforce.TVET programs in East Africa have traditionally been government-led and have suffered challenges such as inappropriate skills training compared with labor market realities; theory-based curriculum instead of combining theory and practical uses; delivery by poorly skilled teachers in ill-equipped institutions using obsolete technology; and the absence of guaranteed placement for graduates.The 2018 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing adopted an Action Plan that included China committing to provide basic vocational training for the African workforce.In July, Kampala, the capital of Uganda, hosted the China-Africa Vocational Education Academic Exchange Seminar, which was attended by representatives from China, Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia and host Uganda. This gave a platform for experts to discuss opportunities that vocational training and education offered for Africa's development.The seminar, inaugurated by John Chrysostom Muyingo, Uganda's state minister for higher education, provided an opportunity to showcase China's strength in vocational education, promote the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, and implement China-Africa cooperation strategies flowing from FOCAC Beijing 2018. Furthermore, the Kampala Initiative adopted the establishment of the China-Africa Vocational Education Community.Yang Xiaochun, the deputy director-general of the China Center for People to People Exchanges of the Ministry of Education, has noted the utility of setting up a mechanism to explore vocational education cooperation between China and East African countries.The Chinese technical and vocational education and training model should be replicated in the East African countries to facilitate increased industrialization.While China's TVET program is government-led, it is, however, conducted in collaboration with the private sector to ensure responsiveness to the market's evolving needs.First, there is a continuous review of the programs. At the same time, industries and government have collaborated to design training programs that match the local industries' needs.Second, industries collaborate with the TVET institutions to design curriculums and set standards.Third, the Chinese government provides incentives to local companies to cooperate with the TVET institutions in the graduation of competent TVET trainees.Fourth, the TVET teachers receive incentives from the government to acquire academic as well as technical skills.Fifth, China has heavily invested in its TVET institutions, which have evolved into highly competitive programs.While enhancing bilateral cooperation between China and East African countries as part of the Belt and Road Initiative, there's an opportunity to adopt China's TVET model and revamp East Africa's TVET programs.The shift from an academic-centered workforce to a technically skilled workforce will boost ongoing industrialization efforts.For East Africa's youth, it's an opportunity to build a community of shared future for mankind and build a bright future for China-Africa vocational education.The author is senior associate at the Africa Policy Institute in Nairobi, Kenya.

                Romer Environmental Protection (Shenzhen) Co Ltd on Tuesday signed a $10,000 sales contract with Uganda Kings School, during the opening ceremony of China-Uganda Industrial Capacity Cooperation Exhibition at the Uganda Manufacturers Association showgrounds, in Uganda's capital, Kampala.According to Michael Qiu, the general manager of Romer's Kenya branch, it was their fourth time to attend similar expos, having attended the previous ones in Uganda and Ethiopia last year, where they also signed deals.During the first ever China-Africa Industrial Capacity Cooperation Expo held in Nairobi in October 2017, organized by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Kenya's president Uhuru Kenyatta ordered 20 sets of Romer's water treatment equipment after watching the onsite demonstration.Nile Machinery Co Ltd, another Chinese company participating in the Uganda edition, also secured a $10,000 crushing machine sales contract in the first day of the expo.Last year at the Nairobi exposition, the company sold out a set of limestone crushing and sand making equipment, worth more than $7 million.Similarly to the Chinese companies, local enterprises are also looking at benefiting maximally from the expo.Daniel Katamujere, the managing director of Uganda Katamu Industrial and Engineering Co, said the expo has provided a platform for exchange between the Chinese and Ugandan enterprises on the investment opportunities in the east African country and possible areas of cooperation between the two countries.At the expo, Katamujere is specifically interested in signing contracts with Chinese manufacturers of agricultural machinery and engineering vehicles, with the hope of becoming their sales agent in Uganda.He said the agricultural machinery from China can help Uganda realize higher yields as well as enable the country to upgrade its industrial capacity.

                    StarTimes injects $1.9m in Kenya's local content development
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                StarTimes Media, a Chinese pay TV company, is investing Ksh200 million ($1.9 million) toward the development of local content in Kenya to be aired via a self-produced channel, dubbed Rembo TV.The entertainment channel will focus mainly on reality television shows, targeting female audiences, with a language policy comprising of 60 percent Kiswahili, 30 percent English and 10 percent vernacular.Speaking during the launch event on Monday, Andy Wang, the chief executive officer of StarTimes Media Kenya, said they have already partnered with over 30 Kenyan content developers."We want to play a significant role in encouraging and empowering the development of local content in Kenya. This will be another of our unique selling points that subscribers will find at StarTimes," he said.Wang said the idea behind establishment of the channel, one of a kind in the East African country, was conceived after intensive research, planning, content analysis and development."Our core aim was to establish a platform that will strategically fill a gap existing in the Kenyan broadcasting sector, the lack of a channel dedicated to female audiences," he said.Rembo TV will be available across three eastern African countries, namely Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.Timothy Owase, the chief executive officer of the Kenya Film Commission, said the continued investments in local productions are an indicator of the growth experienced in the industry.He said the commission is aggressively working on positioning Kenyan productions to rival other competing industries specifically Tanzania and Nigeria."Rembo TV is a continuation of progressive efforts to not only grow viewership locally, but equally sustain the industry as a viable business opportunity for both content developers as well as artists," Owase said.Dr. Ezekiel Mutua, the chief executive officer of the Kenya Film Classification Board, said it's encouraging to see more broadcast players taking local content production seriously, noting that it's key in enabling Kenyans in creative arts to professionalize their talents."Television continues to be a strong medium through which information, entertainment and education is pushed across diverse audiences. I am therefore impressed to see the introduction of a channel specifically targeting female audiences," he said.Mutua said the board is committed to the development of arts and cultural information by creating, maintaining and updating appropriate resources while establishing strategic alliances, both local and international, toward the development, coordination, regulation and promotion of Kenyan heritage.He said the film industry is a critical sector that has great potential to not only economically empower Kenyans, but also equally advocate for a socially responsible society."It is my hope that with such partners as StarTimes Media, we will further responsibly tell our rich stories while promoting our culture through such strong platforms that are broadcasting across continents," he said.Francis Wangusi, director general of the Communication Authority of Kenya, said it's heartening that there are many platforms where the local artists can explore their creativity.Wangusi said currently Kenya has 83 free-to-air TV stations and 16 subscription stations, including five internet protocol TV channels."All these platforms are in need of content, hence an opportunity for our artists and young creative minds to express themselves and be judged by the public," he said.Wangusi lauded StarTimes for launching Rembo TV, noting that they have been challenging broadcasters to create a niche market where they can be identified.He called on StarTimes to develop children's content, which will make them grow into responsible citizens as well as promote the industry to another level."I would also want to see an educational channel where professors would give lectures. We would like to emphasize education for proper growth of the community. I also want to challenge StarTimes to set up a production studio in Kenya, to be able to turn out excellent professionals into the market," Wangusi said.

                    Zambian gov't dispels report of using Huawei technology to spy on opponents
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                LUSAKA -- The Zambian government on Friday dismissed a US news report alleging that it used Chinese telecommunication giant Huawei Technologies to spy on political opponents.A report by the Wall Street Journal alleged the Chinese telecommunication firm helped governments in Zambia and Uganda with the technology to spy on political opponents.Uganda's Chief Government Spokesperson Dora Siliya said the report was false and deserved condemnation, adding that the Zambian government was a government of laws and could not, under any circumstance, engage in illegal interception of communications of its citizens.She noted that the country's telecommunication regulator, the Zambia Information and Communication Technology (ZICTA), was a lawful regulator whose functions do not extend to illegalities as alleged by the reports."ZICTA operates under authority of the Zambian constitution, which explicitly guarantees our citizens the right to privacy of the personal conservations, data and information," she said in a release.The government will continue to safeguard the right to privacy, she said, urging the public to dismiss such reports.Earlier, in a statement issued on Thursday, Huawei also refuted the US news report alleging that the company aided the Ugandan government to spy on opposition politicians.Huawei referred to the report titled Huawei Technicians Helped African Governments Spy on Political Opponents by the Wall Street Journal as unfounded, with inaccurate allegations against its business operations in the east African country.

                    Chinese group helps slum children discover their talents
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Esther Ayuma, a 16-year-old student in a secondary school, born and brought up in Mathare, the second-largest slum in Kenya's capital Nairobi, always admired and was passionate about dancing.Convinced that artistic dancing is one of the best paying careers across the globe, she yearned for an opportunity to discover and nurture her talents but she lacked a platform.The launch of an art program by Dream Building Service Association, a Chinese charity organization operating in the slum, was thus an unexpected and timely opportunity. She has been nurturing her skills under the organization since 2014 and has participated in four talent shows organized by the charity.On Saturday, the organization's fourth talent show was held, where both younger and older children exhibited their dancing, modeling and artistic skills."My dream is to establish a dance group in the future, and to perform in events in and outside the country, as well as train young girls and boys to discover and nurture their dancing skills," she said.
