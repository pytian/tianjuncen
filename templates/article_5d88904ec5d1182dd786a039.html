                Nazarbayev made the remarks when meeting with visiting Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli on Tuesday in Astana, capital of the Central Asian country.Nazarbayev said he was very glad to be invited by Chinese President Xi Jinping to attend the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing and that he will discuss with Xi detailed plans to integrate Kazakhstan's development strategies with China.Xi will attend the opening ceremony of the forum and host a round-table leaders' summit, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday in Beijing at a press conference.At least 28 heads of state and government confirmed attendance at the forum, said Wang, the highest-profile international meeting on the Belt and Road since Xi put forward the initiative in 2013 during a speech in Astana.The initiative aims to build a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient Silk Road trading routes, leading to mutually beneficial economic outcomes for every nation it reaches.Zhang, who arrived in Astana on Monday night for a three-day visit, said that his visit is aimed to forge ahead the implementation of the previous consensus reached by both presidents, and prepare for the meetings between Xi and Nazarbayev in 2017.Hailing the fruitful achievements scored by both countries under the Belt and Road Initiative in recent years, Zhang said both the cooperation scale and quality have reached a new level.He suggested the two countries to further enhance integration of development strategies, deepen cooperation in major areas and expand new areas so as to ensure more achievements in the future.China welcomes Nazarbayev's attendance at the forum in May, Zhang said, expressing the hope that the two countries can further promote cooperation via the occasion.The year marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Kazakhstan.Speaking highly of the sound development of the relationship, Nazarbayev said the achievements Kazakhstan scored in recent years cannot realize without China's strong support.Kazakhstan firmly supports China's domestic and international policy and the Belt and Road Initiative, he said.During his meeting with Kazakh Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev on Monday, Zhang called on both sides to give full play of the role of the dialogue on production capacity and investment, enhance information communication and policy coordination, and expand economic and trade cooperation.He encouraged the two sides to forge ahead the signing of the new version of investment protection treaty and strengthen cooperation in areas including financing, agriculture, animal husbandry, connectivity and customs.The two sides need to cement energy cooperation, managing well the China-Kazakhstan crude oil pipeline and natural gas pipeline, Zhang said.Zhang also called for a consensus at an early date on the detailed plan of hosting the Chinese Year of Tourism in Kazakhstan this year.Sagintayev said Kazakhstan attaches great importance to bilateral ties with China, calling on both sides to enhance innovation cooperation in order to realize a two-way trade volume of 40 billion U.S. dollars in 2020.According to Chinese Ministry of Commerce, up till the end of 2016, China is the second largest export market and the first largest import source of Kazakhstan.Meanwhile, Kazakhstan is China's biggest trade partner in Central Asia and China's biggest investment destination in the Eurasia region.Also on Monday, Zhang co-chaired the eighth meeting of the China-Kazakhstan Cooperation Committee with Kazakhstan First Deputy Prime Minister Askar Mamin.The two witnessed via video link the rolling-off of the final assembly line of Chinese Ankai coaches, a model project of bilateral production capacity here in Kazakhstan.

                    Jiangsu scholarships lure BRI students
                </p>
            </a>

                Jiangsu province is fueling new ways to attract students from countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries. Zhang Xiang reports.Indonesian student Narulita Wardhani used to worry about whether she would be able to secure a good job after university, as employment pressure for fresh graduates in Indonesia is "unimaginably high".That was before she entered Nanjing Polytechnic Institute (NPI), a college based in Jiangsu, East China. The school offers joint programs with Chinese employers with operations overseas, provides skills training for international students, and helps them find jobs with Chinese businesses in their home countries after graduating.Narulita completed her program earlier this year and smoothly secured a job at the Indonesian branch of Jiangsu Delong Nickel Co. Now, four months on from graduation, she's not only in full-time employment, but also gaining valuable experience every day.With Narulita happy to be working in her desired company and getting well paid, her employer, the Delong company, was also sending positive messages back to her alma mater."Narulita's solid academic background and excellent language proficiency has made her the ideal person Delong has always been looking for," said Cong Qian, deputy director of the International Education School at NPI.Cong sees Narulita and her Indonesian classmates as playing a supporting role in Delong's successful expansion into Indonesia. The program has strengthened connections between NPI and Chinese enterprises, and boosted the school's confidence."Riding on the breeze of Jiangsu launching the Talent Selection Program (TSP), our school will strive hard to attract more students from BRI countries," Cong said.According to Cong, the TSP is a provincial plan targeting overseas students, especially those from BRI countries, to pursue studies in Jiangsu. The plan was launched at the provincial capital of Nanjing on Dec 18.Lin Yue, head of the division for international cooperation and exchange at Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, said that the launching of TSP was inspired by Jiangsu's growing popularity among overseas students in recent years."We set up a specialized scholarship for BRI students last year, known as the BRI edition of the Jasmine Jiangsu Government Scholarship. It has received a warm response from the applicants and has provided some 3 million yuan ($455,139) to 60 students."Jiangsu was impressed by the students' eagerness, and decided to create a more open environment, making studying in Jiangsu accessible to more students, and hence the new plan."With study places increasing to 1,700, students like Narulita, who are keen on developing professional skills, will share 30 percent of those placements. They will attend orientation training programs jointly initiated by Jiangsu colleges, Chinese companies with foreign operations, and overseas governments and agencies."It will on one hand help the 'acclimatization' of Chinese companies, while on the other hand equipping governments in their own home countries by providing with more qualified professionals," Lin said.As well as students looking to acquire professional skills, those interested in scientific research or determined to work in key industries will also be included in the new plan. They will share 20 and 50 percent of the 1,700 places.Jin Quanyuan, dean of the College of International Education at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA), described TSP as "an attractive plan that will be sure to help the school's present overseas student cultivation programs reach new heights".Jin offered aircraft engineering, the school's traditional strength and the most popular major among overseas students, as an example."We started enrolling Nepalese students in 2005, and in recent years we have cultivated over 200 Nepalese graduates," Jin said."They are now working in the Chinese branches of renowned aircraft manufacturers like Airbus, or carrying out related operations back in Nepal."The fruitful results have established confidence in NUAA and inspired the school to lure more overseas students, as sophisticated disciplines such as aircraft engineering have been in urgent need of enthusiastic researchers."TSP has prepared 20 percent of the total 1,700 places for scientific manpower," Jin said. "That's quite generous. I hope our school can provide quality education to more graduate and doctoral students."His foreign partners, Arman SadyKov and Askar Shekenov, heads of the Kazakhstan A-Education agency and the Azerbaijan Perspective Study, also made positive remarks about the plan.Arman, who started helping Kazakhstani students seek learning opportunities in Jiangsu three years ago, said he has been impressed by TSP's focus on cultivating scientific researchers."Our country has large reserves of crude oil, thus oil engineering's been a top choice for our students," Arman said."TSP is really nice, I like it all; plus Jiangsu has pleasant weather and rich culture. I hope more Kazakhstani students can benefit from the plan and study in Jiangsu."Askar, who initiated the business of sending Azerbaijani students to Jiangsu two years ago, paid more attention to the scholarship TSP offers."It [scholarship] is a new solution for our students, and everyone is interested in it," he said. "I hope the plan can give opportunities to the best students in our country."Chen Ying contributed to this story.

                NUR-SULTAN, Kazakhstan - Kazakhstan's president said on Tuesday a criminal investigation has been opened into a munitions depot blast that killed two people and left 165 injured in a town in the south of the country. Authorities evacuated Arys, a town of 44,000 people, following Monday's blast. The defense ministry said a fire caused the ammunition to explode. Newly-elected President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on Tuesday visited the injured at a hospital in Shymkent, a city close to Arys. The blasts occurred at a military base near Arys in the former Soviet republic's southern Turkestan province, which houses a large Soviet-era storage facility for explosive munitions. Regional governor Umirzak Shukeyev said Arys had been almost completely evacuated on Monday but warned explosions at the depot might continue for several days. "The scale (of fires) is very large and this could go on for a few days," Shukeyev said. Three people were arrested for looting in Arys, Interior Minister Erlan Turgumbayev said. The cause of the fire which led to the explosions was unclear. Similar incidents in the area, in 2009, 2014 and 2015, were blamed on negligence and failure to observe safety regulations. Social media users shared videos of residents fleeing the area, where properties were damaged, as huge plumes of smoke rose in the background. Kazakhstan's Prime Minister Askar Mamin said on Tuesday during a government meeting that "one civilian and one serviceman" were killed and 165 people had sought treatment. Tokayev said in a tweet he had ordered the interior and defense ministries to prevent further explosions and pledged perpetrators would be "prosecuted under the law". "A criminal case has been opened," he said. He pledged the government would restore the town and compensate victims. Afp - Reuters (China Daily 06/26/2019 page11)
