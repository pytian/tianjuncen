                Iran's Rouhani warns Macron of looming nuclear step
            </a>
            <p>
                TEHERAN - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Saturday, warning him Iran would take the next step in reducing its nuclear commitments unless Europe lives up to its own undertakings. Tensions have spiked in the Gulf since May last year when US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers - known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. Ships have been attacked, drones downed and oil tankers seized in the Gulf in recent months. Macron has been leading efforts to de-escalate the situation and he expressed hopes of bringing together Rouhani and Trump for a meeting during a G7 summit days ago. But Rouhani has downplayed the likelihood of that happening unless the US first lifts crippling sanctions that it has slapped on Iran since pulling out of the deal. "If Europe cannot operationalize its commitments, Iran will take its third step to reduce its JCPOA commitments," Rouhani reportedly told Macron in the phone call. However, "this step, just like the other ones, will be reversible", he added, quoted on the Iranian government's website. "Unfortunately after this unilateral move by the US, European countries did not take concrete measures to implement their commitments," he continued. "The contents of JCPOA are unchangeable and all parties must be committed to its contents," he said. Rouhani said Iran had two priorities: For all parties to the JCPOA to fully implement their obligations and "securing the safety of all free maritime transportation in all waterways including the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz". Macron's office released a statement later on Saturday in which he stressed the importance of "the current dynamic to create the conditions for a de-escalation through dialogue and building a durable solution in the region". A French diplomatic source said it was important, after recent discussions between Paris and Teheran, to establish that President Rouhani was "still ready to negotiate. And that is the case". Twelve months on from the US pulling out of the nuclear deal, Iran began reducing its commitments. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said on Friday that just over 10 percent of Iran's uranium stockpile was now enriched up to 4.5 percent, above the 3.67 percent limit stipulated in the 2015 deal. It also said Iran's total stockpile of uranium, which under the accord should be no more than the equivalent of 300 kilograms of uranium hexafluoride, now stood at roughly 360 kilograms. Iran has not specified what its third step might be in reducing its commitments to the deal. Agence France-Presse (China Daily Global 09/02/2019 page7)

                Calm required to safely navigate trade storm
            </a>
            <p>
                US leader seems intent on fueling and manipulating Sinophobia in the belief that it will force China's concessions Although not a member of the G7, China was nevertheless on the minds of those leaders gathered in French seaside town of Biarritz, for the group's annual meeting chaired this year by French President Emmanuel Macron. On his way to the G7 summit, the top US leader showed he was ready to dangerously escalate the trade war with China that he triggered in March 2018. Neither of the two meetings between the presidents of the two countries - on the sidelines of the G20 summits in Buenos Aires and Osaka - were able to pave the way for a trade agreement. The US leader decided to add even more pressure on the already complicated Sino-US trade relations on his way to Biarritz. In a tweet, he took the risk of initiating a new Cold War. Indeed, his mention of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) on Aug 23 2019 was a highly dangerous provocation. After the declaration of a national emergency, US federal law would then authorize the US President to order the US companies to stop doing business with China seen as an unusual and extraordinary threat to US national security. The impact of such a decision would be an enormous blow to the world economy already hurt by an uncertain geopolitical horizon. But the US leader seems intent on fueling and manipulating Sinophobia in the belief that it will help get him reelected next year. To understand the China policy of the current US administration, one needs to keep in mind its two major - and wrong - assumptions. First, it is of the opinion that China's success owes everything to US generosity and benevolence. Second, the administration assumes that a trade deal can be imposed on Beijing through a series of spectacular injunctions and mounting threats. These do not accord with reality. China is moving back into a position of centrality in global affairs thanks to its own efforts. And while the US administration's increasingly aggressive China policy can create a situation in which there is less interconnection between the two countries, it could even mean a decoupling, but it can't undermine and stop the Chinese renaissance, a deep historical long-term trend largely independent from short-term external variations. In the series of tweets mentioning the IEEPA, Donald Trump added a revealing - and deeply false - remark: "We don't need China" which is a baseless idea. Reinforced by a group-think phenomenon, especially since the departure of chief economic advisor Gary Cohn, it carries with it a disgraceful Sinophobia and a refusal to conceive of a world in which power has been redistributed, to some extent. Truth, however, imposes itself. On all major global issues, China has become indispensable. For world peace, for economic, social and environmental progress, China is needed as never before. The position on free trade expressed by the UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the fact that the journalists covering the G7 were focusing on Beijing, the time spent on China at the final news conference given by the US and the French presidents, are evidence of China's importance in world affairs. Beijing reacted wisely to the most recent series of tempestuous tweets from the US leader. Vice-Premier Liu He, on another occasion, called for calm on the final day of the G7 meeting, which allowed the G7 leaders to reassure, at least temporarily, the markets and the analysts. No matter the force of the tempest, it is the captain's capacity to remain calm which will increase the chance of reaching less dangerous waters. China and the US must find a way to reach an agreement. In parallel, and as indicated by French President Emmanuel Macron, an important part of the long-term solution to the Sino-American tensions will be a reformed World Trade Organization. We are clearly at a critical moment. Calm and vision should be our guides toward new forms of negotiated equilibrium.

                Mike Pompeo wraps up Brussels trip
            </a>
            <p>
                Top US diplomat seeks 'reset' with EU yet Trump tweet disparages the blocUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrapped a two-day visit to Brussels on Tuesday aimed to "reset" a fast deteriorating relationship, but the transatlantic divide is growing wider on many critical issues.In Brussels, Pompeo met new European Parliament President David Sassoli as well as three incoming leaders: Ursula von der Leyen, the next president of the European Commission; Charles Michel, the next president of the European Council; and next top EU diplomat, Josep Borrell. The three will take office in the coming months.Pompeo did not meet outgoing EU leaders such as European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, European Council President Donald Tusk and EU foreign policy chief Federica Morgherini.A European Commission spokeswoman did not comment on the meetings at daily briefings. The US State Department released a brief statement, saying Pompeo and Van der Leyen "reaffirmed that a strong US-EU partnership is critical to prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic and around the world"."The two expressed a shared commitment to working together on a broad range of global issues," said the statement.US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland described the trip as "solely and exclusively to see the four leaders with the objective of resetting our relationship", according to Reuters."Our relationship had reached multiple impasses on multiple fronts and resulted in a lot of uncomfortable, cranky conversations," Sondland said, adding that US President Donald Trump had endorsed the trip.But the words were immediately followed by Trump's tweet on Tuesday, saying those who want him to "get together with the EU and others to go after China trade practice remember, the EU & all treat us VERY unfairly on Trade also. Will change!"The transatlantic relations have taken a dramatic downturn since Trump took office in January 2017. Trump's decisions to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal have shocked EU leaders, who see the landmark deals as their major achievements on global stage.The US and the EU are also risking a trade war. Both have threatened punitive tariffs on each other over aircraft subsidy row involving Boeing and Airbus.While they reached a deal last month to boost US beef export to Europe, Trump has indicated that additional tariffs on European cars are never off the table, an especially disturbing message to EU's largest economy Germany, which is a major car exporter to US and experiencing an economic slowdown.Trump has also threatened to slap punitive tariffs on French wines if France goes ahead with the digital services tax that targets tech giants such as Google, Facebook and Amazon.At the G7 summit in France late last month, Tusk, the European Council president, vowed that EU will "respond in kind" if Trump punishes French products. He said the EU "will protect French wine with genuine determination" and "France can count on our loyalty".Besides opposing Trump's "America First" unilateralism and protectionist trade policy, EU leaders are angry at Trump's support for Brexit and no-deal Brexit and his disdain for the EU as an institution.In its memos made public on Tuesday to the new EU leadership, Bruegel, a leading European think tank based in Brussels, said "the US has become a less reliable partner than it was five years ago and some even doubt how strongly it will defend liberal democracy".It said while the EU is traditionally closer to the US, the Trump administration's rejection of multilateralism has made the EU uncomfortable with the US position, and has opened the door to closer political relations with China, which has assumed the mantle of multilateralism, according to the memos compiled by the think tank's scholars who are meeting in Brussels on Sept 4-5 for their annual meeting.
