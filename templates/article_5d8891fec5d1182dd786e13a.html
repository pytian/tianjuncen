                UK MPs vote to take control of the Commons agenda
            </p>
            <p>
                The United Kingdom government suffered defeat in Parliament on Tuesday evening when MPs voted to take control of parliamentary business and debate a bill to block a no-deal Brexit from the European Union.On Tuesday evening, 328 members voted in favor of taking control of House of Commons proceedings, versus 301 against.The results means parliamentarians may now put forward a bill on Wednesday that would effectively outlaw a no-deal Brexit, and potentially push back the UK's exit date from Oct 31 to late January.Twenty-one Conservative Party members rebelled during the vote which handed Prime Minister Boris Johnson a sizeable defeat. Prior to the vote, the government had threatened to expel any such rebels. Following the vote, Johnson confirmed that he would table a motion to trigger a general election. The government will now look to hold a vote on Wednesday to approve a general election in October.In a potential election, Johnson would hope to win a mandate to press ahead with his Brexit plans and gain a majority in Parliament in order to push through legislation.Triggering a general election requires the approval of two-thirds of Parliament. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the opposition would only back such a move if MPs were allowed to first vote on the bill to block no-deal.

                Rebel MPs poised to fight in parliament to stop no-deal Brexit
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON -- Rebel Tory members of the British parliament are poised to join their colleagues from opposition Labour to bring forward a bill later Tuesday in a bid to stop Britain leaving the European Union on Oct 31 without an agreement.The bill will be tabled as the parliament resumes after summer recess amid threats by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to call a snap election.Johnson faces a showdown in the parliament in the pivotal week as members of parliament aim to take control of the agenda to stop a no-deal Brexit, observers here said.Downing Street has warned the prime minister would push for a general election on Oct 14 if members of parliament successfully vote to block a no-deal Brexit.But to trigger an election, Johnson would need the backing of two-thirds of members of parliament, including some opposition legislators.The next general election is not due until 2022.Former British Chancellor Philip Hammond said Tuesday that he believes Tory rebels will back the bill, and he vowed to fight deselection, threatened by Johnson as he called on Tory members of parliament to support him on Brexit or get kicked out of the party.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he is ready to go to the polls, but some in his party are suggesting otherwise.Johnson has insisted Britain must leave the European Union on Oct 31, with or without a deal."I want everybody to know -- there are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay," the prime minister said Monday outside 10 Downing Street. "We are leaving on 31 October, no ifs or buts."

                Brexit impasse raises prospect of election gamble
            </a>
            <p>
                But no-deal opponents could further frustrate Johnson by denying him voteThe United Kingdom looks increasingly likely to be heading for a general election less than two months after Prime Minister Boris Johnson took office, as he tries to take the country out of the European Union on Oct 31, which he has said will happen "do or die, come what may".A vote on delaying the possibility of a no-deal Brexit was due to take place late on Tuesday, with the government widely expected to suffer a defeat, fueled by several Conservative MPs refusing to vote along party lines, despite the threat of being barred from standing as party candidates at any subsequent election.Johnson replaced Theresa May as prime minister at the end of July, after three years of her failing to make any progress on Brexit.On her watch, its date was postponed three times, prompting Johnson's "Do or die" statement, but faced with the possibility that this might mean a no-deal Brexit, widely predicted to cause chaos ranging from transport gridlock to food and medicine shortages, and even potential civil unrest, a combination of opposition parties and dissenters within his own Conservative Party looks set to have blocked Johnson's legislative path.In an address on Monday, he said that he did not want an election, and that if MPs did vote to block a no-deal Brexit, they would "plainly chop the legs out from under the UK position".However, he was almost drowned out by loud shouts of "stop the coup" from protesters who had gathered outside Downing Street, clearly picked up by broadcast microphones.His comments also failed to impress his internal opponents. That evening, defying the deselection threat, the local constituency party of Philip Hammond, one of Johnson's most prominent opponents, reselected him as its candidate for the next election."I am going to defend my party against incomers, entryists… people who are at the heart of this government who care nothing about the future of the Conservative Party," Hammond told the BBC.On Tuesday former education secretary Justine Greening announced she would not stand at the next election, a clear message she would vote against the government, with several other colleagues also announcing they would defy party instructions.Johnson looks to want to call the bluff of his opponents with a short-notice election next month. But he could repeat May's blunder of 2017, when she gambled on an election to strengthen her negotiating position, only for it to backfire disastrously and lose her seats.However, in another twist, even if Johnson wants an election, one is not necessarily guaranteed, as under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, two-thirds of MPs must approve such a move.Despite Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn saying he would be "delighted" at the prospect of an election, many senior party figures are warning against walking into what they see as a Johnson trap.

                PM Johnson loses control of the agenda as Tory rebels oppose him
            </a>
            <p>
                British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced he would seek to trigger a snap general election after defeat in a key House of Commons vote meant he lost control of the Brexit process.The defeat means members of Parliament were due on Wednesday to vote on a bill that would delay Britain's departure from the European Union if a new withdrawal deal cannot be agreed before Oct 19.Tuesday's Commons defeat by 328 votes to 301 gave control of Wednesday's parliamentary agenda to MPs who seek to block a no-deal Brexit and force the prime minister to seek an extension from the European Union.MPs that favor remaining in the EU drafted the bill that would force Johnson to delay Brexit until Jan 31, if he cannot agree a withdrawal deal with the EU.Labour and the Liberal Democrats have said they will block an early election until the threat of a no-deal Brexit is removed.It was Boris Johnson's first significant parliamentary vote as prime minister, and after three hours of debate it ended in a decisive defeat when 21 Tory rebel MPs, including two former chancellors, joined opposition parties to vote in favor of taking control of business in the Commons, with the aim of passing legislation to prevent a no-deal Brexit.The 21 rebels, including several former cabinet ministers, were subsequently told by Johnson's government that, as a result of their actions, they will "lose the party whip" and can no longer represent the Conservative Party.In response to the defeat, the prime minister said he would table a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act to call an election.Johnson told the House of Commons: "The consequences of this vote tonight means that Parliament is on the brink of wrecking any deal that we might be able to get in Brussels. It will hand control of the negotiations to the EU. I don't want an election but if MPs vote tomorrow (Wednesday) to stop negotiations and to compel another pointless delay of Brexit, potentially for years, then that would be the only way to resolve this."Johnson and his government want a general election before Brexit, in the hope they can win and go back to Brussels with a mandate to leave — deal or no-deal.The government's motion that could trigger an election was expected to be voted on later, possibly also on Wednesday, but it would need a two-thirds majority to pass and that would require the support of opposition MPs.Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn made clear on Tuesday evening that Johnson would only get what he seeks when a no-deal Brexit option was removed.Corbyn said: "He wants to table a motion for a general election — fine — get the bill through first, in order to take no-deal off the table."While Labour's refusal to back it would limit the likelihood of Johnson's motion succeeding, other avenues remain open to the prime minister to push for a snap election — including triggering a confidence motion in his own government.

                Johnson suffers defeat on second Brexit vote
            </a>
            <p>
                United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suffered a second defeat in the House of Commons in two days, with MPs voting 327 to 299 in favor of a bill that blocks a no-deal Brexit.The legislation is designed to force the government to request a three-month delay to Brexit, instead of leaving the European Union on Oct 31 with no deal in place.The bill now goes to the House of Lords, which has just days to debate the legislation before Parliament is suspended next week.After the result, Johnson urged members to back a motion for an early general election, which needs the support of two-thirds of Parliament to pass.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the opposition would only back the move once the new Brexit legislation is enshrined into law.The proceedings marked another torrid day in Parliament for Johnson, who has faced a rebellion from within his own party on each of the last two votes concerning Brexit.

                UK lawmakers reject PM's motion for early election on Oct 15
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON - British lawmakers on Wednesday rejected a motion tabled by Prime Minister Boris Johnson calling for a general election on Oct 15, dealing another blow to the prime minister, who vowed to take his country out of the European Union on Oct 31 with or without a deal.The lawmakers voted 298-56 on the motion, after the House of Commons passed a Brexit delay bill to prevent a no-deal departure from the European Union.Johnson failed to get sufficient two-thirds majority House of Commons required by law for an early general election, which is not due until 2022. Johnson would have needed 434 votes to succeed in his bid to dissolve parliament.After the vote result was announced, Johnson said that Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is the first leader of the opposition in the country to "refuse the invitation to an election".Johnson said that he had "an obvious conclusion that he (Corbyn) thinks he will not win" in the snap election if it is held next month as he proposed.In return, Corbyn accused the prime minister of "playing a disingenuous game" to force a no-deal Brexit. He said his party would back an election after the bill had been passed, but not before.Corbyn told MPs that Johnson's offer of an election was "a bit like an offer of an apple to Snow White from the Wicked Queen... offering the poison of a no deal".Before the voting, Johnson said the no-deal bill passed minutes earlier essentially ended Brexit negotiations and handed control to Brussels."Today parliament has voted to stop, to scupper any serious negotiations," he told MPs.Johnson said the purpose of the no-deal bill was to take away the right of Britain to determine how long it wants to stay in the EU, and to hand the decision to Brussels.Indicating why he wants a general election, Johnson said it would enable the country to now decide whether the leader of the opposition, Labour's Jeremy Corbyn, or he goes to Brussels."I think it's very sad that MP's have voted like this, I do, I think It's a great dereliction of their duty," Johnson added.

                British PM Johnson's own brother quits on eve of Brexit election campaign
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan to kick off what is in effect an election campaign casting parliament as the enemy of Brexit was overshadowed on Thursday when his younger brother quit the government, citing the national interest.As the United Kingdom spins towards an election, Brexit remains up in the air more than three years after Britons voted to leave the bloc in a 2016 referendum. Options range from a turbulent 'no-deal' exit to abandoning the whole endeavour.Ahead of a speech in northern England where the prime minister was expected to begin an informal election campaign, his own brother, Jo, resigned as a junior business minister and said he was stepping down as a lawmaker for their Conservative Party."In recent weeks I've been torn between family loyalty and the national interest - it's an unresolvable tension & time for others to take on my roles," he tweeted.The 47-year-old, who campaigned to remain a member of the EU in the 2016 referendum while his older brother was the face of Vote Leave, has been in parliament since 2010, serving in several ministerial roles.The move comes in a frenetic week for the premier, who said his brother had been "a brilliant, talented minister and a fantastic MP", and that the decision would not have been easy.After wresting control of the lower house of parliament on Wednesday, an alliance of opposition parties and rebels expelled from Johnson's Conservative party voted to force him to seek a three-month delay to Brexit rather than leaving without a deal on Oct. 31, the date now set in law.

                British lawmakers prepare court action to enforce Brexit delay
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON - British lawmakers are preparing legal action in case Prime Minister Boris Johnson tries to defy legislation compelling him to seek a further delay to Brexit, the BBC reported on Saturday.An opposition bill which would force Johnson to ask the European Union for an extension to Britain's departure to avoid a no-deal exit on Oct 31 was approved by parliament's appointed upper chamber, the House of Lords, on Friday.Queen Elizabeth is expected to sign it into law on Monday.The government had no immediate comment on the BBC report, which said lawmakers, including Conservatives expelled this week from Johnson's ruling party, have lined up a legal team and are willing to go to court to enforce the legislation if necessary.Johnson, a leader of the campaign to leave the EU during the 2016 Brexit referendum, took office in July after his Conservative party predecessor Theresa May quit following three failed attempts to get a deal with Brussels through parliament.The new prime minister says he wants to take Britain out of the EU on Oct 31, with or without a deal with the bloc.Johnson has said he has no intention of seeking an extension and would rather "die in a ditch" than delay Brexit.Saturday's Daily Telegraph reported that the prime minister is prepared to defy parliament's instruction to request an extension to the Brexit process if he fails to agree a new deal.The newspaper quoted Johnson as saying he was only bound "in theory" by the new legislation.Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was aware of the lawmakers' legal moves. "The courts making a decision to try to make a prime minister abide by the law, made by a parliament, of which he is a member. These are strange times for democracy," Corbyn told BBC television.An opinion poll on voting intentions, carried out by Survation for the Daily Mail, put the Conservatives on 29 percent, down 2 percent from the previous poll, with Labour unchanged on 24 percent. The Liberal Democrats were on 18 percent, with the Brexit Party on 17 percent.
