                TOKYO -- The 2019 China Festival, a fair that presents Chinese cuisine, specialties, culture and entertainment to the Japanese people in an effort to promote bilateral friendship, kicked off on Saturday in downtown Tokyo.In the two-day festival in Yoyogi Park, where a spectacular stage and some 100 booths selling Chinese cuisine and specialties were set up, Chinese and Japanese artists will give shows, and groups of art performance from China's Hubei,Heilongjiang and other places are expected to present performances with local and ethnic characteristics.People lined up in front of the various booths to taste traditional Chinese cuisine, including Sichuan spicy cuisine, dumplings and others.Kong Xuanyou, the Chinese ambassador to Japan, delivered a speech at the opening ceremony, saying that the China Festival is a platform for people to get to know China closely and carry out non-governmental exchanges between China and Japan.Kong hoped that through various activities of the China Festival, Japanese people can experience China's time-honored history of 5,000 years, feel the traditional cultural ties between the two countries, understand China's development and changes in the new era, and find new common values and emotional resonance.As this year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and Japan has entered the new era of Reiwa, the Chinese side hopes to take the China-Japan Youth Exchange Promotion Year in 2019 as an opportunity to promote mutual understanding, develop friendship and inject new momentum into bilateral relations, he said.Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister and chief advisor of the executive committee of the festival, said that the festival serves as a platform for people-to-people exchanges and it is a meaningful part of cultural exchanges, which are the foundation of state-to-state exchanges.On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the two neighbors should re-examine bilateral relations and think about how to achieve friendly development through exchanges in the future, he added.The festival is hosted by the Chinese Embassy to Japan and the executive committee of the 2019 China Festival for the fourth consecutive year this year.

                    Typhoon heads to northeast Japan after lashing south

                TOKYO - A powerful typhoon is heading northeast to Japan's main island of Honshu on Sunday after lashing parts of the country's southern islands with heavy rains and winds that caused flooding and some minor injuries.Typhoon Tapah was passing near Nagasaki in southern Japan on Sunday afternoon, after hitting other parts of southern Japan, including Okinawa, the two previous days.Okinawa prefectural government had issued an evacuation advisory to nearly 334,000 people.Japan's Meteorological Agency said the storm was moving northeast at a speed of 30 kilometers per hour, with maximum winds of 162 km/h.It was on course to travel through the channel between Japan and the Korean Peninsula before moving toward northern Japan on Monday, when it is expected to weaken and be downgraded, the agency said.The storm prompted cancellations of more than 400 domestic flights, according to national broadcaster NHK.The typhoon hit Okinawa on Friday and Saturday and left 21 people with minor injuries. The storm disrupted air and train travel in the region during what is a three-day weekend.In Nobeoka City in Miyazaki prefecture, a tornado believed to have been triggered by the typhoon damaged at least one house and injured two people slightly, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency. The winds blew a cargo container into an electricity tower, causing power loss to some train stations in the area.The city postponed Sunday's entrance exam for city employees due to the typhoon.The approaching typhoon also caused fears in parts of Chiba, near Tokyo, which was hit hard by another typhoon earlier this month. That typhoon damaged many houses and electric poles, causing widespread blackouts in the prefecture and triggering criticism and concern about aging infrastructure systems in the country.Cleanup and power restoration efforts continued on Sunday in parts of Chiba.Tapah followed on the trail of Typhoon Faxai, which barreled through Tokyo earlier this month, packing record winds that brought down power lines, caused travel chaos and disrupted Rugby World Cup preparations.It resulted in a lengthy blackout on the outskirts of Tokyo that left tens of thousands of people without power for more than a week.AP - AFP

            <p class="style-content">
                The online Chinese TV series Ten Years Late starring actor Dou Xiao and actress Gulnezer Bextiyar premiered on Sep 19 on streaming sites iQiyi and Tencent Video.It tells of the love stories of six young Chinese who pursue their dreams in big cities, with a focus on the tourism industry. The crew traveled to Shanghai, Suzhou, Shenzhen and counties in Japan for shooting to showcase beautiful scenery and different customs and practices.Producer Yang Shanshan said that the portrayals of the characters are lifelike and they're from different backgrounds. The playwright team modeled the six major characters on lives of those who were born in the 1980s and 1990s.Also, the team went to regions in northeast Japan that are less popular among Chinese tourists, but where the snow views and island scenery is stunning.Tao Shiming, the deputy director of the China Alliance of Radio, Film, and Television, said the characters represent young people's attitude to life. The picturesque views are likely to arouse audiences' interest in traveling to the sites featured in the film.

                    Japanese carmakers gain momentum in China despite downward trend

                Despite China's 14-month fall in car sales, major Japanese brands are bucking the downturn with increasing sales in the first eight months this year.China's overall vehicle sales stood at 1.96 million in August, a fall of 6.9 percent from the same period last year, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. And it is the 14th month of sales falls since July 2018.Total vehicle sales in the country in the first eight months of 2019 totaled 16.1 million, a drop of 11 percent from the same period last year.However, Japan's Nissan, Toyota and Honda achieved decent sales in China from January to August.Nissan's sales in China grew for the second straight month in August, up 2 percent from the previous year to 129,659.According to Nissan, 10,459 of its seventh-generation Altima sedan sold in August, up 12.5 percent year-on-year. And its 14th-generation Sylphy model had total sales of 11,467 last month.In August, the automaker sold a total of 45,216 sport utility vehicles, increasing 16.5 percent from the year earlier. In the first eight months, sales of Nissans in China edged up 0.2 percent to 956,270.During the same eight months, Toyota delivered a total of 892,866 vehicles in China, an increase of 7.7 percent on the previous year.Insiders hold that sales achieved by Toyota in China are being generated by the Toyota New Global Architecture, or the TNGA, as well as its compelling product portfolio.The TNGA-based models include the Avalon hybrid, as well as hybrid versions of the Camry, Corolla and Levin sedans.Honda sold 124,155 vehicles in August in China, up 5.9 percent from a year earlier. As for the sales achieved from January to August, the brand sold 985,514 vehicles, an increase of 18.4 percent from the same period in 2018. Honda's two most sought-after models, the Civic sedan and the CR-V crossover each sold more than 20,000 units in August.The hybrid variants of Honda's CR-V, Accord, Inspire and Odessey together achieved sales of 13,274 in August.Honda and Toyota have demonstrated strength in hybrid technology that few others can match, according to Yang Jian, managing editor of Automotive News China.Hybrids have not only enabled the two major Japanese carmakers to buck the downturn in China's new energy car market, but have also helped position both companies for future sales and profit growth, Yang added.Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consulting firm Automotive Foresight, said: "The sales growth of Japanese auto brands reflects that China's automotive market is maturing and customers here are rational when buying a car."Japanese vehicles are widely accepted for their excellent quality, favorable brand reputation and fuel economy, which has been proved by an array of top-selling models such as the Corolla and the CR-V, Zhang noted.

                    Asian economies generate buzz for hydrogen fuel cells
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China, Japan and South Korea have all set ambitious targets to put millions of hydrogen-powered vehicles on the road by the end of the next decade.But to date, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have been upstaged by electric vehicles, which are increasingly becoming a mainstream option due to the success of Tesla's offerings as well as sales and production quotas set by China.Critics argue FCVs may never amount to more than a niche technology. But proponents counter hydrogen is the cleanest energy source for autos available and that with time and more refueling infrastructure, it will gain acceptance.China, far and away the world's biggest auto market with some 28 million vehicles sold annually, is aiming for more than 1 million FCVs in service by 2030. That compares with just 1,500 or so now, most of which are buses.Japan, a market of more than 5 million vehicles annually, wants to have 800,000 FCVs sold by that time from about 3,400 currently.South Korea, which has a car market just one-third the size of Japan, has set a target of 850,000 vehicles on the road by 2030. But as of the end of 2018, fewer than 900 had been sold.Hydrogen's proponents point to how clean it is as an energy source, since water and heat are the only byproducts, and how it can be made from a number of sources, including methane, coal, water and even garbage. Resource-poor Japan sees hydrogen as a way to greater energy security.They also argue that driving ranges and refueling times for FCVs are comparable to gasoline-powered cars, whereas EVs require hours to recharge and provide only a few hundred kilometers of range.Many backers in China and Japan see FCVs as complementing EVs rather than replacing them. In general, hydrogen is seen as the more efficient choice for heavier vehicles that drive longer distances. Hence, the current emphasis on city buses.Only a handful of automakers have made fuel cell passenger cars commercially available.Toyota Motor Corp launched the Mirai sedan at the end of 2014 but has sold fewer than 10,000 globally. Hyundai Motor has offered the Nexo crossover since March last year and has sold just under 2,900 worldwide. It had sales of about 900 for its previous FCV model, the Tucson.Honda Motor's Clarity Fuel Cell is available for lease, while Daimler AG's GLC F-CELL has been delivered to a handful of corporate and public-sector clients. Buses are seeing more demand. Both Toyota and Hyundai have offerings and have begun selling fuel cell components to busmakers, particularly in China.Several Chinese manufacturers have developed their own buses, notably State-owned SAIC Motor, the nation's biggest automaker, and Geely Auto Group, which also owns the Volvo Cars and Lotus brands.A lack of refueling stations, which are costly to build, is usually cited as the biggest obstacle to widespread adoption of FCVs. At the same time, the main reason cited for the lack of refueling infrastructure is that there are not enough FCVs to make them profitable.Consumer worries about the risk of explosions are also a big hurdle and residents in Japan and South Korea have protested against the construction of hydrogen stations. This year, a hydrogen tank explosion in South Korea killed two people, which was followed by a blast at a Norway hydrogen station. Then there's the cost. Heavy subsidies are needed to bring prices down to levels of gasoline-powered cars. Toyota's Mirai costs consumers just over 5 million yen ($46,200) after subsidies of 2.25 million yen. That's still about 50 percent more than a Camry. Automakers contend that once sales volumes increase, economies of scale will make subsidies unnecessary.Reuters
