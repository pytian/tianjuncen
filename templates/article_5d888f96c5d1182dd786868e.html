                World leaders, officials denounce Egypt's deadliest attack at Sinai mosque
            </p>
            <p>
                BEIJING -- World leaders and officials have strongly condemned Friday deadly terrorist attack on a mosque in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, which claimed the lives of at least 305 people.At noon on Friday, some 25 to 30 assailants bombed and opened fire at the mosque, killing 305 worshippers, including 27 children, and wounding 128 others, according to Egyptian authorities. It was the first terrorist operation to target a Muslim mosque in Egypt's modern history.Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday sent a message of condolences to his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to offer his deep condolences and sincere sympathy to President Sisi, the families of the victims and the injured.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang also stressed that China will join hands with Egypt to firmly oppose any forms of terrorism.Russian President Vladimir Putin said that "The murder of civilians in the course of an act of worship is striking with its cruelty and cynicism," confirming that Russia was ready to further enhance cooperation with Egypt in fighting international terrorism.US President Donald Trump offered condolences to the people of Egypt after the "heinous" attack. "There can be no tolerance for barbaric groups that claim to act in the name of a faith but attack houses of worship and murder the innocent and defenseless while at prayer," said the White House.Sebastiano Cardi, president of the United Nations (UN) Security Council, said, "The members of the Security Council condemned in the strongest terms the heinous and cowardly terrorist attack", and he wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also condemned the attack, extended his deepest condolences, and wished a swift recovery to those who have been injured.European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted that he was "appalled by the attack on a mosque in North Sinai. My thoughts are with Egypt and all those affected by this evil and cowardly act."European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker "condemned in the strongest possible terms this barbaric and cowardly act deliberately targeting peaceful and innocent people," adding that "Europe stands beside you in solidarity just as you have stood with us in the past."European Union (EU) foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini denounced the attack, saying "No one should be killed because of their religion, no sacred place should be profaned by violence and terrorism. People of all religions...are united in the fight against terrorist violence.""Perpetrators of such unbearable acts must be held responsible," she said, adding that the EU "will continue to stand with the Egyptian authorities and people as they confront the threat from terrorism."German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said in a statement that "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this perfidious terrorism, which once again has not even spared places of worship and peaceful people of faith from its brutal atrocities."French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian denounced the attack by saying, "France stands resolutely with Egypt in this latest ordeal. We will continue to stand together in the fight against terrorism and fanaticism."Swiss President Doris Leuthard echoed, saying that "her thoughts are with the victims and their families."Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar also tweeted that he was "deeply saddened by the horrific attack... This is a terrorist attack that deserves all condemnation."Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos conveyed condolences to the victims' families and his wishes for a fast recovery of those injured.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi strongly condemned "the barbaric terrorist attack on a place of worship in Egypt", saying that "India resolutely supports the fight against all forms of terrorism and stands with the people as well as Government of Egypt."Pakistan Foreign Ministry also condemned "in the strongest term the heinous terrorist attack against innocent worshipers," saying his country "stands in full solidarity with their Egyptian brethren in this moment of anguish and tragedy."A statement released by Israeli Prime Minister's Office denounced "the horrific and criminal terrorist attack" which occurred close to Egypt's border with Israel, saying that "Terrorism will be defeated even more quickly if all countries work against it together."Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said, "I strongly condemn the heinous attack in Egypt and offer condolence to the Egyptian people... Attacking people during Friday prayer is against humanity and Islam."The Iraqi Foreign Ministry confirmed the country's solidarity with Egypt and extended sincere condolences to the families of the martyrs and wishes swift recovery of the wounded.King Abdullah II of Jordan and Morocco's King Mohammed VI also voiced their full solidarity with Egypt and the Egyptian people.Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted, "Once again the cowardly hand of terrorism targeted the dear nation of Egypt... It does not differentiate between places even if they are mosques and place of worship."Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah condemned the attack that violates all religions, norms and human values, and voiced his country's solidarity with Egypt and his full support to all measures taken by Egypt to maintain its security and stability.The United Arab Emirates (UAE) strongly condemned "this terrorist crime, which is contrary to all human values and principles, the teachings of Islamic law and divine religions," the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in Abu Dhabi said in a statement.Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, widely known as Farmajo, said, "We stand united with our brothers and sisters in Egypt against terror," calling for effective international cooperation against terrorism.Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said, "We pray that Egypt may be consoled and that it may be granted the courage to bear this loss, and to bring the perpetrators of this vile act to justice."Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi said, "Tunisia is fully committed to the Egyptian side in this painful circumstance, especially as we support all measures from the Egyptian authorities to ensure the safety of citizens."Sudan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its strong condemnation of the terrorist attack and its condolences to the families of the victims and to the government and people of Egypt, describing the incident as "a crime contradicting all humanitarian values and principles."Libya's UN-backed prime minister, Fayez Serraj "strongly condemns the cowardly treacherous terrorist attack," saying that "This terrible crime against a house of God can only be carried out by those who have no human or religious morals."The Sri Lankan government offered the deepest condolences and urged the international community to join hands to find effective ways and means to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.The Brazilian government expressed its condolences to the families of the victims, its wishes for the prompt recuperation of the injured and its solidarity with the people and government of Egypt.Terror attacks started to rise in Egypt following the military ouster of former President Mohamed Morsi in July 2013 in response to mass protests against his one-year rule and his currently outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group.Since then, most of the attacks have focused on restive North Sinai, killing hundreds of policemen and soldiers, before they later started to extend to other provinces and target the Coptic minority in their churches.

                Merkel says Germany wants to deport more failed asylum seekers
            </a>
            <p>
                BERLIN -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday that Germany wanted to increase deportation of failed asylum seekers to ensure better safety in the country. The chancellor made the remarks in a statement issued after the confirmation that Anis Amri, a Tunisian national suspected of carrying out a truck attack on a Christmas market in downtown Berlin, was shot and killed by Italian police officers in a routine patrol in Milan early Friday morning. Merkel mentioned specifically asylum seekers from Tunisia, saying that she had told Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi in a phone conversation that Germany wanted quicker deportation of Tunisian asylum seekers whose applications had been rejected. "I told the Tunisian president that we have to significantly speed up the deportation process and increased the number of people expelled," the chancellor was quoted as saying in the statement. The truck attack on the Christmas market raised many questions, she said, vowing that her government would take necessary measures to make the country better secured. She said she had ordered a comprehensive investigation into the attack which took place near Berlin's iconic Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church on Monday evening, killing 12 people and injuring 48 others.

                Tunisia, Turkey sign four cooperation agreements
            </a>
            <p>
                TUNIS -- Tunisia and Turkey signed Wednesday four cooperation agreements concerning security, economic and environmental issues during Turkish president's visit to the north African country.In terms of security, the convention stipulates military cooperation between the two countries in addition to training courses of Tunisian military competencies."Our two countries will make concerted efforts to boost bilateral cooperation, particularly in tourism and trade," said Erdogan at a joint press conference with his Tunisian counterpart Beji Caid Essebsi.Excluding a 300 million dollars grant already pledged to Tunisia, the Turkish President has announced his intention to grant 300 million dollars in additional funding.Referring to certain regional and international issues of common interest such as the Libyan conflict and the Syrian crisis, the Turkish President said his country's position and that of Tunisia "are similar."With regard to the Libyan affair, Erdogan confirmed the upcoming opening of an embassy in Tripoli.This is Recep Tayyip Erdogan's third visit to Tunisia and the first as president, following the visits in 2011 and 2013 as prime minister.Since 2011, Turkish funding in Tunisia has reached 500 million dollars, including 200 million dollars in security.Throughout the year 2016, the volume of trade between Tunisia and Turkey was one billion dollars, including 240 million dollars for Tunisian exports and 760 million dollars for Turkish exports.

                Presidential speech sparks mixed reactions across Tunisia
            </a>
            <p>
                 TUNIS - Speech of Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi which was broadcasted Monday evening has aroused different reactions on political scene across the country."The breakdown in consensus between the Islamist party Ennahdha (the main ally of the coalition in power in Tunisia) and Nida Tounes (founded by Essebsi) came after the support of Ennahdha to the current government of (Tunisian Prime Minister) Youssef Chahed," said Ridha Belhaj, leader of Nida Tounes.According to Belhaj, "Tunisian president issued a strong message by insisting that next presidential and legislative elections must take place in December 2019 and this deadline must be respected.""Essebsi criticized the current government's inability to resolve the country's economic crisis while calling on Prime Minister Youssef Chahed to address Parliament (Assembly of People's Representatives, ARP) to renew its legitimacy," said Belhaj.Imed Khmiri, official spokesman of Ennahdha, insisted that his party did not break off relations with President Essebsi."Ennahdha will always focus on the consensual process with the president and the divergence of points of view absolutely does not mean breaking with the approach of dialogue," Khmiri said.Zouhair Hamdi, leader of opposition party Popular Front, the main left-wing alliance within the ARP, said "the content of the speech finally settled the conflict within the ruling majority coalition."However, he said that "Essebsi recognized the delicacy of the country's economic situation, in particular the indebtedness and the trade deficit, hence the failure of the whole system.""Through his speech, the president has shown that he no longer masters the tools to bring the country out of social, economic and political crisis," noted Issam Chebbi, Secretary General of the Republican Party."The split between the two main parties at the top of power could generate social tensions in the future," said Nizar Makni, policy specialist in Tunisia and Mena Zone.He added that "reforms in Tunisia require a large consensual process and the lack of trust will only lead to chaos and demonstrations."

            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING -- President Xi Jinping on Sunday sent a congratulatory message to Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi, the rotating president of the Council of the Arab League, on the 30th Arab League Summit in Tunis.In his message, Xi praised the AL's efforts to promote peace, stability and development in the Middle East.He also noted that the AL has been advocating political solutions to pressing issues and contributing to the unification and self-improvement of the Arab world.Xi emphasized that China and the Arab states share a deep-running tradition of friendship. During the eighth ministerial meeting of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum held in Beijing last July, the two sides agreed to establish a future-oriented strategic partnership of comprehensive cooperation and common development, which was a new starting point for Sino-Arab cooperation.China is willing to work with the AL to enhance strategic mutual trust, promote practical cooperation, strengthen people-to-people exchanges and implement the Declaration of Action on Sino-Arab Belt and Road Cooperation, said Xi.By doing so, the two sides will build a brighter future for the Sino-Arab strategic partnership and contribute more to the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, Xi added.
