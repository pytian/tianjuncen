                As Jakarta sinks, Indonesia revives plans to relocate capital
            </p>
            <p>
                Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, has another problem in addition to its traffic and pollution: The city of 10 million is sinking.Some researchers predict that large swaths of the city could be entirely submerged by 2050, and they said north Jakarta had already sunk 2.5 meters in 10 years, the BBC reported last month.Indonesian President Joko Widodo has revived plans to relocate the capital. At a recent Cabinet meeting, Widodo asked his ministers to come up with suggestions, the Jakarta Globe reported on April 29.The president said there were three choices, according to the Globe report: Leave the capital where it is in Jakarta; move it to an area within a 50- to 70-kilometer radius of the city; or move the capital off the island of Java altogether.Building a new capital could take between five and 10 years and cost as much as $33 billion, The Jakarta Post quoted National Development Planning Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro as saying.The idea of relocating is not new, according to Gervasius Samosir, a Jakarta-based consultant with global group YCP Solidiance. "Presidents from Sukarno onward have mentioned the need to relocate the capital," he told China Daily.But on all occasions, the idea did not get beyond the discussion stage.Now, President Widodo has revived the decades-old plan and favors Palangkaraya, a city of about 260,000 people on the island of Borneo that is relatively free from natural disasters and located near the center of the archipelago.Planning Minister Bambang told a news briefing after the Cabinet meeting on April 29 that the new capital would likely be in the "geographic center of Indonesia".Other criteria will include land availability, water supply, proximity to the coast and foreign territory, and existing infrastructure."We have to find a location that is really minimal in terms of disaster risks. And because Indonesia is a maritime nation, the new capital city should be located near the coast, but not necessarily by the sea," he said."We want to have a new city which besides reflecting Indonesia's identity is a modern, international-class city, or a smart, green and beautiful city," the minister said.Yayat Supriyatna, an urban planner at Trisakti University in Jakarta, told China Daily that Widodo is serious about moving the capital - "by announcing it in front of high-ranking state, executive, legislative and judicial leaders during a joint sitting at the presidential palace on May 6".He said there were a number of factors favoring a new capital, with Borneo being an ideal location. "It is strategically located in the middle of Indonesia, and a great deal of the land is already owned by the government or state-owned companies. This would reduce investment costs for infrastructure and relocation.""It is also free from potential earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, floods, erosion and forest fires. It has abundant water resources and is free of air pollution."Heri Andreas, a lecturer on the Institute of Technology Bandung's earth science and technology faculty, said Jakarta "has a long history of flooding, as it sits on a flood plain where 13 rivers cross the city". Due to land subsidence and rising sea level, the city is now suffering from coastal flooding and tidal inundation, he added.Andreas said the advantage of choosing Palangkaraya as the new capital would be that it is "not a large city now, but it does have infrastructure, and from all accounts it is in good shape".karlwilson@chinadailyasia.com

                British politician, soldier and diplomat: Paddy Ashdown dies
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON - Paddy Ashdown, the face of centrist politics in Britain for more than a decade and a one-time marine commando who sought to secure peace in the former Yugoslavia, died on Saturday after being treated for cancer. He was 77.Ashdown led the Liberal Democrats for 11 years up to 1999, steering it to become a campaigning force in British politics against the Conservatives and the Labour Party.The party said Ashdown died on Saturday evening after a short illness. He had recently been hospitalised with bladder cancer.It said he would be remembered as someone who made an immeasurable contribution to furthering the cause of liberalism.Tributes came in from across the political spectrum. Prime Minister Theresa May said Ashdown served his country with distinction. "He dedicated his life to public service and he will be sorely missed," she said in a statement.Calling Ashdown a "true patriot", former Conservative Prime Minister John Major said: "In Government, Paddy Ashdown was my opponent. In Life, he was a much valued friend."Jeremy John Ashdown was born in India on Feb. 27, 1941, the eldest son of an Indian army colonel. When he was five, his father became a pig-farmer in Northern Ireland.He was educated at an English private school where he earned the nickname Paddy because of his strong Irish accent.He spent years in the Royal Marines, and was on active service as a commando in the jungles of Borneo. He entered parliament in 1983 and was virtually unknown when he became leader of the pro-European party five years later.

                Abandon Jakarta: Indonesia again mulls plan for new capital
            </a>
            <p>
                JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesia's decades-long discussion about building a new capital has inched forward after President Joko Widodo on Monday approved a long-term plan for the government to abandon overcrowded, sinking and polluted Jakarta.Widodo decided at a special Cabinet meeting to move the capital outside of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, said Planning Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro. It was one of three options discussed. The other alternatives were moving to a location near Jakarta or staying put and relocating all government buildings to a special zone around the presidential palace.The site for a possible new capital hasn't been announced, but Palangkaraya on the island of Borneo has often been rumored as the location. Brodjonegoro, however, said eastern Indonesia is favored."This is a big job, impossible to take just one year, it could take up to 10 years," he said.Prone to flooding and rapidly sinking due to uncontrolled ground water extraction, Jakarta is the archetypical Asian mega-city creaking under the weight of its dysfunction. Only 4 percent of Jakarta's waste water is treated, according to the government, causing massive pollution to rivers and contaminating the ground water that supplies the city. Congestion is estimated to cost the economy $6.5 billion a year.Before the Cabinet meeting, Widodo said other countries such as Malaysia, South Korea and Brazil set up new capitals as part of their development as nations."The idea to move the capital city appeared long ago," he said. "But it has never been decided or discussed in a planned and mature manner."Improving inadequate infrastructure in the country of 260 million has been Widodo's signature policy and helped him win a second term in elections earlier this month.Brodjonegoro said a new capital would require an area of 30,000 to 40,000 hectares (about 74,000 to 99,000 acres) and have a population of between 900,000 and 1.5 million.Jakarta has a population of about 30 million in its greater metropolitan area.AP

                Brunei airline caters for growing Chinese visitors with multilingual booking website
            </a>
            <p>
                The Royal Brunei Airline (RB), the sultanate's national carrier, hoped to facilitate the growing interest of travellers from China and other East Asian countries into the country.Its website has recently added simplified and traditional Chinese language options, as well as Korean and Japanese, and will be adding two more languages in due times.Deputy Minister of Finance and Economy Hj Abdul Manaf said in an interview with Xinhua on Wednesday that the Brunei Tourism Development Department is continuously working with other relevant agencies including RB and travel agents to promote the country as a tourist destination."With RB further doing their part in helping to facilitate travellers, including their multilingual website, we hope to see further positive trends in tourist arrivals," he said."RB increased connections with destinations in China, South Korea, Japan and other cities, including regional Borneo cities, can also boost tourist arrivals," the deputy minister said.He noted that at the moment, Brunei major arrivals are coming from East Asian markets and developing a multilingual website is a good move to facilitate visitors from these markets."It is true in any business that it is important that we can offer the services in their language. So, we offer Chinese language and also a Korean and Japanese language, and we will be adding two more languages as we go along," RB CEO Karam Chand told Xinhua, adding that RB has also jointly worked with the Brunei Tourism Development Department to revamp their website.Since 2015 after a record low in 2014, the number of international arrivals through Brunei International Airport has continued to grow.According to the Brunei Tourism Development Department, the positive growth can be attributed to the high impact of travel demand from markets such as China, South Korea and Japan.China ranked No. 1 among the top 10 visitor countries in 2018, due to the increase of air connectivity from newly scheduled flights with a 23.6-percent share from a 20.9-percent share in 2017.

                JAKARTA - Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Friday formally proposed to parliament a plan to move the country's capital from Jakarta, on the crowded island of Java, to Kalimantan on the island of Borneo.Widodo made the proposal during his state of the union speech at parliament, a day before the country celebrates its 74th independence anniversary."I hereby request your permission to move our national capital to Kalimantan," said Widodo, who will be sworn in for a second term in October after winning April's election."A capital city is not just a symbol of national identity, but also a representation of the progress of the nation.

                Widodo pledges to move capital, boost economy
            </a>
            <p>
                JAKARTA, Indonesia - Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Friday he would press on with plans to move the nation's capital and roll out measures to kick-start Southeast Asia's biggest economy as it feels the sting of slowing global growth. Widodo asked parliament to sign off on a plan for a new capital in Borneo, shifting Indonesia's political heart from Jakarta - one of the world's fastest-sinking cities that is plagued by a host of ills, from eye-watering traffic jams and pollution to the risk of earthquakes and floods. "I'm asking for your permission to relocate our capital to the island of Kalimantan," he told lawmakers, referring to Indonesia's portion of Borneo, in a sweeping state-of-the-nation address. "A capital is not only a symbol of a nation's identity, it also represents its progress," he added. Widodo did not reveal a specific location for the country's new capital or timing for any move. Speaking a day before the 74th anniversary of Indonesia's independence, the recently reelected leader said his second term would focus on cutting red tape and luring foreign investment. He pledged to boost lagging productivity, turn Indonesia into an electric-vehicle hub and focus on improving worker skills in the sprawling country of about 260 million people. Analysts have said Indonesia should overhaul its rigid labor laws and dizzying bureaucracy, which have been cited as barriers to investment. "We have to be faster and better than our neighbors," Widodo said. "We're facing a tumultuous global economy and geopolitical change." Later Friday, Widodo announced a spending budget of 2.5 trillion rupiah ($175 billion) for 2020, and ticked up the government's economic growth forecast for next year to 5.3 percent, from an earlier 5.2 percent. "That's going to be difficult to achieve given current global conditions," said University of Indonesia economist Lana Soelistianingsih, referring to the new forecast. Widodo struggled to lift growth in his first term despite a huge roads-to-railways infrastructure building blitz. The economy has been expanding around five percent annually, but that is well short of the seven percent Widodo had pledged in his first term. This week, it posted its slowest rate of quarterly growth in two years. Agencies (China Daily 08/19/2019 page11)
