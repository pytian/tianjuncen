                Chinese firms share experience to build IT infrastructure with BRI economies"The weather in Zambia is good these days, and my mood is as good as the weather!" said Liu Shaobing, chief representative to Zambia of Inspur Group Co Ltd, China's largest server maker."We recently signed new contracts with local governments and will send 5,000 machines to five key local cities to help them build smart taxation systems," Liu said in an internet call interview.According to him, the Zambian government is ramping up its push to strengthen infrastructure construction and the local demand for informatization is also surging, which creates good opportunities for Inspur.Liu, who has been working in Africa for 11 years, is one of a growing number of Chinese employees who are working in countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, as Chinese tech companies are scrambling to expand their overseas presence.Equipped with cutting-edge technologies and years of experience in serving a huge domestic market, established tech heavyweights including Inspur, Huawei Technologies and Lenovo Group Ltd are accelerating internationalization to take their technologies, solutions and services abroad.Take Inspur's presence in Zambia for example. Liu said the African country used to only have handwritten invoices, and tax evasion was serious.In 2016, the local government began global bidding to build a smart tax system. In January 2017, Inspur beat eight other global companies to win the bid with its mature invoice management software and hardware integration system, or IMS. Inspur has also become the exclusive IT supplier of Zambia's smart tax project.In January 2018, Inspur's IMS system was successfully launched in Zambia. The 2,000 tax control terminals deployed in the first phase of the project covered 16 cities across the country, involving 144 different industries."As of now, the system has been trouble-free operating stably for more than 10,000 hours, providing a technical guarantee for the reasonable and legal tax payment of Zambian taxpayers," Liu added.The case is part of Inspur's broader efforts to expand its business in the countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative. The company's products and services are available in 120 countries and regions."China is the most sophisticated IT market and the largest data producer in the world," said Sun Pishu, chairman and CEO of Inspur. "Our four decades of experience in building information infrastructure is of great value to other developing economies."Inspur has already built an education cloud platform for the Thai government to boost local students' learning efficiency.Its prowess in super computers also helped scientists from Saudi Arabia map the genome of the date palm, whose fruit is a staple food in the region. It has also established cooperation with more than a string of countries on tax informatization."When venturing into markets related to the Belt and Road, Inspur not only exports products and services, but shares its experience in leveraging information infrastructure with other developing economies," Sun said.To date, the Chinese IT conglomerate has also held a large number of overseas training programs on big data, cloud computing and tax informatization systems, which it said helped countries like Egypt, Ethiopia, South Africa and Vietnam train technicians and officials.In 2017, Inspur also formed an alliance with global tech giants including IBM and Cisco Systems Inc to provide IT solutions to countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative.Amb Kabiru Rabiu, a representative of the government of Kano, which is an important province in Nigeria, said earlier that the alliance is bringing high-tech solutions to countries like Nigeria, one of the most populous countries of Africa, which can meet the country's urgent need for solving mounting security problems and promoting intelligent education.Just like Inspur, Huawei is also ramping up its push to expand its presence in the countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, as it scrambles to bring its telecom equipment, cloud services and smartphones to more foreign companies and consumers.The Shenzhen-based company announced in February that it has partnered with Rain, South Africa's mobile data-only network operator, to jointly launch a 5G network in the country. This move has made South Africa one of the first countries to launch the superfast fifth-generation mobile communication technology.With Huawei's end-to-end 5G solutions, Rain has been able to build the 5G network using its 3.6-gigahertz spectrum. In the first rollout phase, Rain has deployed a number of 5G sites in key areas in Johannesburg.Willem Roos, chief executive officer of Rain, said the network will provide fiber-like speeds without the installation complexities, time delays and cost of laying fiber in under-serviced areas.Huawei's products and services are already available in more than 170 countries and regions. In 2018, Huawei recorded $105.2 billion in revenue, with about half of that from overseas.Specifically, 28.4 percent was from Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 6.6 percent from the Americas, and 11.4 percent from the Asia-Pacific region.Guo Ping, rotating chairman of Huawei, said at a news conference in March that an increasing number of foreign countries and clients are choosing the company's products and services, with good growth already recorded from January to February of this year. And he expected such momentum to continue in the remaining months of 2019.The company's expanded footprint in the global cloud computing arena seems to be a good example. Huawei will soon build cloud computing nodes or availability zones in Brazil and Chile, Zheng Yelai, president of Huawei's cloud business, said in late March.Huawei has been partnering with Spanish telecom carrier, Telefonica, to operate cloud services in Latin America, but as Huawei's consumer business, including smartphones, is becoming increasingly popular in that region, it has decided to launch its own cloud brand there."We have had a fabulous performance in foreign countries. By the end of this year, Huawei Cloud's overseas performance is likely to exceed that of other Chinese cloud service providers," Zheng said, without providing more details.Such results are backed by Huawei's technological prowess, which is a long-term result of its years of heavy input into research and development. In 2018, its R&D spending surpassed that of Microsoft, Apple and Intel.According to the latest statistics from the European Union, Huawei spent 101.5 billion yuan ($15.1 billion) on R&D investment, ranking fourth among the global companies behind Samsung, Google and Volkswagen.Alongside Huawei's increasing international popularity, its brand awareness in overseas countries and regions is also surging.Huawei was the top ranked Chinese firm in the Top 50 BrandZ Chinese Global Brand Builders, a report jointly prepared by advertising holding company WPP, its research firm Kantar Millward Brown, and Google.The company started operating public cloud services in South Africa in December. It is deploying a regional data center in Johannesburg, from which its cloud services can cover neighboring countries and regions. More data centers are also in the pipeline to extend its reach across the continent.Edith Mutethya contributed to this story.

                Programs effectively fight gender violence
            </a>
            <p>
                Zambia, South Africa and Uganda have embraced effective measures in the fight against gender-based violence that others can emulate, according to several female African judges.The judges spoke on the sidelines of Kenya-European Union-Spain peer learning seminar on the criminal justice system and gender-based violence, held in Nairobi last week.Gender-based violence cases include sexual violence such as defilement, attempted defilement, rape, attempted rape, sexual exploitation and abuse. This is in addition to forced prostitution, domestic violence, economic abuse, psychological humiliation and human trafficking.Other forms of violence are traditional practices such as early marriage, female genital mutilation, honor killings, widow inheritance and forceful initiation for boys.Hannah Okwengu, chairperson of the Kenya Women Judges Association, said Zambia has achieved significant success through establishment of special courts to deal with cases of gender-based violence.The fast-track courts established to speedily deal with the case are the result of a partnership between the government of Zambia and a team on gender-based violence comprising several United Nations agencies with UN Development Programme as the lead agency.The courts have equipment to ensure victims' protection from intimidation and from facing their alleged perpetrators."It's commendable that the courts have ensured that a case is finalized within three months after it's reported," Okwengu said.Roselyn Nambuye, a Kenya judge, said Zambia has set a benchmark with its law on gender-based violence. She noted that the country's chief judge is a woman."The chief justice has been in the forefront in actualization of some of the programs like setting up the gender-based violence fast-track courts. There has to be a way to fast-track such cases, because when a case involving a family is prolonged, more harm is done to the family than justice," she said.The Zambian legislative body was the first in Sub-Saharan Africa to pass a sophisticated and inclusive law on gender-based violence in 2011.Cases of gender-based violence in Zambia decreased by 6 percent in the first quarter of 2019, translating to a decrease of 356 from 5,940 recorded in 2018, The Sun newspaper reported.Nambuye praised South Africa's diversion program for juvenile offenders. It diverts some prima facie cases involving criminal sexual activity from the criminal justice system to extra-judicial programs. The goal is not to make offenders less accountable for their actions but rather providing them with an opportunity to rethink their lives without a criminal record, she said.Okwengu cited the initiative in which South African Women Judges Chapter sends educators to visit schools and talk to both boys and girls about gender-based violence. They have produced a skit on coping with sexual violence, a YouTube video, access to emergency phone numbers and access to social platforms.The United Nations Population Fund has invested significantly in Uganda's efforts to address gender-related violence, producing achievements in laws, regulations, guidelines and policies at the national level and adapted for the sub-national level.

            <p>
                The groundbreaking ceremony for the first generation of the Output and Performance Based Road Contracting (OPRC) road project in Zambia was held on July 12, whose construction is contracted by POWERCHINA.Zambian President Edgar Lungu completed the excavation and filling work accompanied by an operator, marking the official groundbreaking of the project.More than 2,000 people attended the groundbreaking ceremony, including ministers, senior cabinet officials, provincial governors, members of parliament, local chiefs, media reporters, and local residents.Zambian President Edgar Lungu attends the groundbreaking ceremony for the first generation of OPRC road project on July 12. [Photo/POWERCHINA]In his speech, President Lungu said that the Zambian government has prioritized the development of infrastructure, as well as the strategy of developing Zambia's transportation industry and building the country into a regional transportation hub.He noted that the project can not only bring great convenience to residents' lives, but also will promote the development of the transportation industry and stimulate local commercial potential. He also thanked POWERCHINA for participating in Zambia's infrastructure construction and benefiting the local people, while expressing his appreciation for the engineering strength of POWERCHINA and his wishes that the project is completed on schedule.Since its entry into the Zambian market in 2000, POWERCHINA has completed or is implementing projects in various fields, such as the Kafue Gorge Lower Hydropower Station, the Kariba North Hydro Power expansion project, and the Kitwe-Chingola road reconstruction project.Zambian President Edgar Lungu cuts the ceremonial ribbon of the first generation of the OPRC road project. [Photo/POWERCHINA]As the general contractor for the project, POWERCHINA will carefully formulate a rigorous and scientific construction schedule, as well as strengthen communication and cooperation with all units to ensure the steady progress of the project construction.The first generation of the OPRC road project is a start-up project for 12 World Bank-financed OPRC-type projects.With a total length of 254 kilometers, the project is located in Mkushi town of Central Province in Zambia, consisting of seven sections of roads.The scope of the project includes design, repair and improvement works, city road improvement projects, community infrastructure projects, consultancy services, as well as road maintenance works.

                Failure to tackle trade friction may fuel global economic turmoil: Zambian think-tank
            </a>
            <p>
                LUSAKA - Failure to tackle the trade friction between the United States and China may fuel a global economic turmoil due to its ripple effects, a Zambian think-tank said Tuesday.The trade friction started by Washington affects not only the two largest economies themselves but also other developing countries like Zambia, said Bernadette Deka-Zulu, the think-tank's executive director.Resolving the trade row is in the best interest of all parties and the overall global economy, she said."All of us are being affected, so these wars must be sorted out. Smaller countries with small economies are highly dependent with our relationship with other countries as well. This (trade friction) should be put an end to," she said.The US government announced on Aug 15 that it will impose additional tariffs of 10 percent on Chinese goods worth about $300 billion in two batches, effective from Sept 1 and Dec 15, respectively.In response, Beijing announced its decision on Friday to impose additional tariffs on US imports worth about $75 billion. Washington then vowed to retaliate with further tariffs later in the day, fueling fears of economic consequences that would spin out of control.

                Scores arrested in S. Africa for looting foreign shops
            </a>
            <p>
                Early morning traffic was paralyzed and drivers forced to use alternative routes as violence broke out in several parts of Johannesburg in South Africa for the third day.Despite the arrests of 91 people on Monday, the spate of violence and looting of foreign-owned shops continued to spread in the province of Gauteng.It is still unclear what triggered the unrest with rumors ranging from the shooting of a taxi driver by drug dealers to the burning of a building in the central business district where three people died.The violence started last week in the capital Pretoria, 53 kilometers north of Johannesburg, leaving a trail of destruction on several major streets that continued to spread as more foreign-owned shops were targeted.The Gauteng provincial police spokesman, Colonel Lungelo Dlamini has described the perpetrators as criminal opportunists. He has announced that the police were on high alert and strong action would be taken against the perpetrators.Those arrested face crimes including public violence, malicious damage to property and theft.The Zambian government has issued a travel advisory warning its truck drivers to avoid traveling on South Africa's major routes, amid threats of violence in the haulage sector targeting foreigners.Such violence breaks out sporadically in South Africa, where many nationals blame immigrants for high unemployment, particularly in manual labor, AFP reported.Analysts believe that the sporadic attacks of foreign nationals in South Africa in recent years are indications of economic discontent among local people. South Africa's ambitious plans to push up foreign direct investments may be damaged."As long as South Africa's economic growth remains slow, desperate people will attack foreigners whom they perceive as getting more than they should from a broke government offering limited resources, it doesn't matter whether this is true or not," said Emmanuel Matambo from the University of Johannesburg.The department of Statistics SA, a government agency, is expected to release the second-quarter GDP figures on Tuesday. It already announced that the construction, mining and trade sectors are in recession. The economy slumped sharply in the first three months, contracting by 3.2 percent.Earlier this year, the International Monetary Fund lowered South Africa's projected GDP growth rate for 2019 from 1.4 percent to 1.2 percent, placing the country among the worst performers in sub-Saharan Africa.The unemployment rate in the country also rose by 1.4 percent in the second quarter of this year to 29 percent in the previous period, according to latest government data. This means about 6.8 million South Africans are unemployed.The country has the highest inequality rate in the world, with a World Bank report finding that 1 percent of the population own 70.9 percent of the country's wealth.
