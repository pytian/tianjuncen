                Pakistan's Miracle Motorway - the Multan-Sukkur
            </p>
            <p>
                On the banks of the Chenab River sits Pakistan's 7th largest city, Multan. The air on July 24 was as humid as any other summer day, only this time, the residents awoke to an unprecedented level of activity. The major cultural and economic center of southern Punjab was now connected to surrounding regions by the Motorway 5.Inaugurated on May 6, 2016, the M5 mega project was developed as part of a pilot project for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), under the framework of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with a total investment of around $2.89 billion.The strategically-placed six-lane M5 starts from Multan and connects Jalalpur, Peerwala, Ahmed Pur East, Rahimyar Khan, Sadiqabad, Ubaro, Pano Aqil and finishes at Sukkur. The 392-kilometer M5 Sukkur-Multan Motorway is a part of the country's Peshawar-Karachi Motorway. It is designed for speeds of up to 120 km. The motorway has 12 service areas, 10 rest areas, 11 interchanges, 10 flyovers, and 426 underpasses.The project is particularly significant since it has been constructed to resist flooding with the help of the latest technology and methods, including the Intelligent Traffic System. It is equipped with FM broadcasting, 360-degree angle monitoring, WIFI in service areas and ample night lighting.Sukkur-Multan Motorway relied on domestically produced materials and goods such as 60 million bricks, 6 million tiles, 1 million tons of cement, 9,200 sets of machines and tools and created more than 29,000 jobs for locals during construction. The M5 also enables residents to improve their standard of living by connecting schools, small bridges, avenues, wells and water channels.CPEC projects have largely helped Pakistan overcome economic constraints, attracting large funds as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). The world has begun ranking Pakistan among the top potential economic powers of the future, with a recent World Bank report listing Pakistan among the top 15 emerging economies of the globe.Federal Minister for Communications Murad Saeed said they appreciate China's contribution towards Pakistan's economic progress in the form of CPEC, which is an attractive reflection of the Pakistan-China strategic partnership.At an opening ceremony held in Multan, National Highway Authority (NHA) M5 General Manager Muhammad Naseem Arif said the motorway is very impressive in terms of its quality and construction.Authorities worked closely with the China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) and overcame a number of difficulties so that they could complete the large project within three years.Li Ganchun, chief of the M5 project from the CSCEC, appreciated the security provided by the Pakistani side, saying that the M5 will help Pakistan connect its northern and southern regions, improve the country's transportation and facilitate social economic development in the region along the motorway.CPEC appears like a miracle for Pakistan's ailing economy. According to Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Yao Jing, CPEC has generated around 75,000 direct and indirect jobs - but this figure is just the tip of the iceberg. A recent World Bank report has claimed that at the current pace, CPEC will create more than one million jobs in Pakistan by the year 2030.Since Prime Minister Imran Khan has refocused on establishing vocational training institutes and Special Economic Zones across the country, millions of new high- and low-end jobs are expected to be created due to economic activities generated by the CPEC.Following China's investments, other regional and global players have also jumped in to boost economic activity in Pakistan. Saudi Arabia has signed an investment agreement of over $20 billion with Pakistan. The United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Turkey, Russia and Malaysia have also announced investment ventures in Pakistan.European economic giants Germany, France and the United Kingdom are also exploring opportunities to invest in Pakistan as it grows into an investment-friendly destination after the recently announced revolutionary visa regime by the government of Pakistan, opening up the country to investors, tourists and visitors from across the globe.Bilal Sabri is a journalist of Pakistan Today and Diplomag.

                Cooperating to build a promising future
            </a>
            <p>
                2016 is the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Pakistan. Thanks to the commitment of successive Chinese and Pakistani leaders and the concerted efforts of our two peoples, we have forged an allweather friendship and pursued all-round cooperation. Such friendship is truly unique and unparalleled. Over the past 65 years, China and Pakistan have become extremely close and shared both joy and woe. Sino-Pakistan friendship is being carried forward from generation to generation and has become the common aspiration of people from all walks of life from both countries. Through efforts made over several generations, our all-weather strategic cooperative partnership has transcended changing times and achieved remarkable things. On the basis of mutual trust, mutual support and equal treatment, our time-tested relationship has become deeper, more fruitful, more substantial and more people-oriented with each passing day, setting a good example for state-to-state relations. We will never forget that Pakistan was both one of the first countries to recognize the People's Republic of China and the first Islamic country to enter into diplomatic relations with China. At critical times when China sought to break international deadlocks, resume its lawful seat at the United Nations and explore ways to carry out reform and opening-up, Pakistan always came forward with selfless and valuable assistance. When China was hit by natural disasters or faced difficulties, Pakistan always extended a helping hand. In 2008, when the devastating earthquake struck Wenchuan, China, Pakistan responded immediately by flying more than 20,000 tents, which was its entire reserve, to China. The Pakistani medical team on the transport plane had to remove all the seats to make room for the tents. They sat on the floor of the plane all the way to China. Similarly, whenever Pakistan has been in need, China has come to its aid. China firmly supports Pakistan's efforts to uphold sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. When Pakistan was severely hit by floods in 2010, China provided immediate relief assistance via air and land routes. We dispatched China's largest-ever medical relief team and sent a large convoy of vehicles and helicopters to carry out rescue operations. This was the first time that such operations had been undertaken in the history of China's rescue assistance. Following the terrorist attack in Peshawar at the end of 2014, China invited the students who were injured in the attack and their families to spend some time in China to recuperate. We were happy that those poor, traumatized children could be healed through the love and care of the Chinese people. China and Pakistan are close partners pursuing win-win cooperation. On the basis of our strong political relationship, which enjoys solid public support, our all-round cooperation is making new progress. Bilateral trade volume reached $18.9 billion last year, an increase of 18.2 percent compared to the year before. China has become Pakistan's largest investor and trading partner. Pakistan is China's largest investment destination in South Asia. Our two countries and peoples have benefited from increasingly friendly cooperation. Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to Pakistan, which opened a new chapter in our bilateral relationship. Both leaders agreed to upgrade the bilateral relationship to an all-weather strategic cooperative partnership and continue to promote the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The CPEC is a major pilot project of the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by President Xi. It has become the framework and platform for comprehensive and substantive cooperation between China and Pakistan. The CPEC has won across-the-board support from the political parties and peoples of our two countries. It will provide new opportunities and a new vision for, as well as new impetus to, Sino-Pakistan relations. Currently, the CPEC is making constant progress. Eight power projects, including Port Qasim and Sahiwal Coal Power Plants, Karot Hydro Power Project are under construction. The Karakorum Highway Phase II (Thakot to Havelian section) and Karachi-Lahore Motorway (Multan to Sukkur section) were recently inaugurated. The feasibility study of the Gwadar Eastbay Expressway and Gwadar New International Airport is under way. The repairs and upgrades to Gwadar Port are due to be completed soon. Both sides are now in close consultation on industrial cooperation. The progress will not only boost the economic growth of China and Pakistan, but also promote the livelihoods of millions of people in the region. Looking to the future, China and Pakistan will deepen their already close friendship and work together to fulfill their ultimate ambitions. Both China and Pakistan have their own national development goals. We both shoulder the historical mission of achieving national renewal, realizing the great dream of building a prosperous country and delivering a better life for our peoples. On the auspicious occasion of the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between our nations, both sides should take this opportunity to carry forward the all-weather friendship and deepen all-round cooperation. In the process of fulfilling our dreams, we should fully leverage our geographic proximity and economic complementarity to share opportunities, meet challenges head on, pursue common development and substantiate the Sino-Pakistan ideal of shared destiny. This will enable us to create greater benefits for the Chinese and Pakistani peoples, contribute to the stability and prosperity of our region and lead the way in building a community of common destiny in Asia. We should deepen cooperation on regional and international affairs so as to safeguard the interests and rights of developing nations and contribute to the stability and prosperity of our region and the world at large. Sino-Pakistan relations have a glorious past and a promising future.

                 ISLAMABAD - Pakistan's Minister for Planning, Development and Reforms Ahsan Iqbal said on Sunday that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has turned the strong political relations of Pakistan and China into deep-rooted economic ties.Talking to the state-run Radio Pakistan in Lahore, Ahsan Iqbal said that under the CPEC, as many as nine industrial zones will be established across the country within the next two to three years, which will generate massive employment opportunities.The Pakistani minister said that coal-powered energy projects with total power generation capacity of 1,320MW electricity have already been completed at Sahiwal in Punjab and at Port Qasim in southeastern port city of Karachi.He further stated that 300MW solar power project has also been made operational in Bahawalpur in southern Punjab under the CPEC.The planning minister pointed out that the incumbent government is tapping the Thar coal reserves, which could be the major source of electricity supply for the South Asian country for the next four hundred years.The planning and development minister informed that the road network between southern cities of Quetta and Gwadar has been renovated which has shortened the traveling time between the two cities to only eight hours.He mentioned that the reconstruction of Karakoram Highway and the extension project of Havelian-Thakot Motorway, Multan-Sukkur Motorway, and Hakla-Dera Ismail Khan Motorway will be completed by the end of the ongoing year.The work on the Karachi, Peshawar, and Quetta Circular Railway Projects has also been commenced under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, he concluded.
