            <p class="style-content">
                The aftermath of the death of Jeffrey Epstein reverberated through US politics and the criminal justice community on Sunday.The disgraced financier and convicted sex offender was found unresponsive in his cell Saturday morning at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in Manhattan, a federal lockup. Paramedics were unable to revive Epstein, who reportedly hanged himself.Epstein, 66, was not on suicide watch, even though on July 23 he was found in his cell with bruises on his neck that may have been a suicide attempt or the result of an assault.The New York City Medical Examier's Office completed an autopsy on Sunday, but has not yet released the results.At the MCC, two jail guards are required to make separate checks on all prisoners every 30 minutes, but that procedure was not followed overnight, according to a source. Guards are required to make another check every 15 minutes on prisoners who are on suicide watch.A person familiar with the MCC's operations told The Associated Press on Sunday that one guard in Epstein's unit was working a fifth straight day of overtime and another was working mandatory overtime.Also, the New York Post reported Sunday that no surveillance video captured Epstein's last minutes.Epstein had been charged by federal prosecutors in New York of grooming teenage girls for sexual purposes. He jetted between opulent residences in Manhattan, Florida, New Mexico and the US Virgin Islands."Today's events are disturbing, and we are deeply aware of their potential to present yet another hurdle to giving Epstein's many victims their day in court," Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement. "Our investigation of the conduct charged in the indictment – which included a conspiracy count – remains ongoing."What makes the case intriguing to so many is that Epstein socialized with famous politicians and celebrities, including former president Bill Clinton, President Donald Trump, Great Britain's Prince Andrew and lawyer Alan Dershowitz.Some 2,000 pages of documents related to a since-settled case against Epstein by one of his accusers were made public by a federal appeals court on Friday.Former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson and former US senator George Mitchell of Maine were mentioned in the documents. Both men denied any wrongdoing.The news of Epstein's death fueled multiple conspiracy theories and made its way into the 2020 presidential election contest.On Saturday, the president retweeted a message from comedian and commentator Terrence K. Williams, who said in part that Epstein "had information on Bill Clinton & now he's dead".Cory Booker, a US senator from New Jersey and Democratic presidential candidate, said Trump's retweet was "just more recklessness"."He is giving life to not just conspiracy theories but really whipping people up into anger and worse against different people in this country," he said on CNN.The FBI and the Department of Justice's inspector general have opened investigations.US Attorney General William Barr said he was "appalled" to learn of the death in federal custody.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic congresswoman from New York City, tweeted: "We need answers. Lots of them."White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said investigation of Epstein should continue despite his death.More than a decade ago, Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida to charges of solicitation of prostitution from a minor in a deal with prosecutors that was widely criticized as too lenient.Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey on July 6, and pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls as young as 14, from 2002 to 2005.A November expose by the The Miami Herald helped renew public pressure on Epstein.Reuters contributed to this story.

                    Democrats fight over healthcare in first US presidential debate
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                MIAMI - Democratic presidential contenders battled over healthcare coverage during their first debate on Wednesday, reflecting the party's divisions on whether to abolish private insurance and shift to a Medicare-for-All system.In a surprisingly heated first round of back-to-back debates featuring 10 candidates each night, several contenders also clashed over border policy as some of the lesser-known candidates vied for attention in the crowded race to take on Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election.During the debate in Miami, US Senator Elizabeth Warren and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio were the only two candidates to raise their hands in support of eliminating private insurance.Warren, a leader of the party's progressive wing who has been surging in opinion polls, said private insurance was taking advantage of Americans. She backs a government-sponsored Medicare-for-All approach and criticized those who say it is not politically feasible."What they are really telling you is they just won't fight for it. Healthcare is a basic right, and I will fight for it," she said.But former US Representative John Delaney, an outspoken critic of Medicare for All who supports a universal healthcare approach that includes private insurance, said Democrats should not throw away a system that some Americans are happy with."I think we should be the party that keeps what's working and fixes what's broken," Delaney said.After years of defending former Democratic President Barack Obama's landmark healthcare law known as Obamacare from Republican attempts to repeal it, Democrats have struggled during the campaign to agree on the best approach to fixing it.Senator Bernie Sanders, which has gained support in Congress, would create a government-operated plan that eliminates private insurance. It is modeled on the Medicare government healthcare program for seniors.Former US Representative Beto O'Rourke said private insurance was "fundamental to our ability to get everybody cared for," but de Blasio cut him off."Congressman O'Rourke, private insurance is not working for tens of millions of Americans when you talk about the copays, the deductibles the premiums - it's not working. How can you defend a system that's not working?"O'Rourke also had a heated exchange with his fellow Texan, former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, over the separation of families and detention of migrants at the southern border.Castro said he would decriminalize border crossings by migrants, which he said led to the separation of families. He challenged O'Rourke and others to support him.O'Rourke said that as a congressman he helped introduce a bill that would ensure that those who are seeking asylum and refuge in the United States are not criminalized.Castro responded: "I'm not talking about the ones that are seeking asylum, I'm talking about everybody else." He accused O'Rourke of not doing his homework.The intensity of the exchanges, after six months of a relatively mild and dispute-free campaign, reflected the high stakes in what could be a make-or-break moment for some of the contenders struggling to be noticed in the field of more than 20 candidates.All 10 participants in the first encounter had an opportunity to step out of the shadow cast by front-runners Joe Biden and Sanders, who are scheduled to take the stage on Thursday night.Warren, gaining strength in opinion polls, was the headliner on the opening night. She was joined onstage by nine other candidates, including US Senators Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar and O'Rourke.Washington state Governor Jay Inslee said he was the only candidate on the stage that had passed a public healthcare option and a law protecting a woman's right to reproductive health and health insurance.That drew a sharp response from Klobuchar."There are three women up here who have fought pretty hard for a woman's right to choose," she said, looking at Warren and congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.Trump hinted he would not tweet his reactions live during the first debate, which is taking place as he flies aboard Air Force One to Osaka, Japan, for a G20 summit.But shortly after it began, he could not help himself."BORING!" he tweeted.

                    Trump says Democratic congresswoman 'should apologize to America'
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump on Sunday stepped up his attacks on four liberal Democrats in Congress, all women of color who have criticized his policies, calling on them to apologize as he himself faced charges of racism.The Republican president's incendiary comments dovetail with the anti-immigrant stance he has embraced since his 2016 campaign for the White House, which included saying Mexico was sending rapists into the country and seeking to ban people from Muslim-majority nations."I don't believe the four Congresswomen are capable of loving our Country. They should apologize to America (and Israel) for the horrible (hateful) things they have said," Trump said in a Twitter post.Trump ignited controversy last weekend when he tweeted that the Democratic congresswomen should "go back" to where they came from if they do not like the United States.Three of the lawmakers - US Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan - were born in the United States. Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota came as a refugee from Somalia and is a naturalized citizen.The first-term congresswomen, known as "the squad," have been very critical of Trump and have also challenged their own Democratic leadership.US Representative Elijah Cummings, the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight Committee, denounced Trump's latest attack and said he had "no doubt" that Trump was a racist."These are folks and women who love their country and they work very hard and they want to move us towards that more perfect union that our founding fathers talked about," Cummings, who is African-American, said on ABC's "This Week.""So when you disagree with the president, suddenly you're a bad person. Our allegiance is not to the president. Our allegiance is to the Constitution of the United States of America and to the American people."A day after saying his audience at a campaign rally in North Carolina went too far in chanting "Send her back!" about Omar, Trump on Friday defended the crowd members as "incredible patriots."Omar said after Wednesday night's rally that Trump was "spewing fascist ideology." On Saturday, Ocasio-Cortez accused Trump of intentionally egging on the vitriol, pausing while the crowd chanted."Roll back the tape ... He relished it. He took it in and he's doing this intentionally," she said at a town hall meeting on immigration in Queens.Stephen Miller, Trump's top immigration adviser, said the president made clear he disagreed with the "Send her back" chants."The core issue is that all the people in that audience, and millions of patriotic Americans all across this country are tired of being beat up, condescended to, looked down upon, talked down to by members of Congress on the left in Washington, DC, and their allies in many quarters of the media," he said on "Fox News Sunday."Reuters

                    US House passes 2-year budget deal to raise spending, suspend debt ceiling
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - US House passed a budget deal Thursday that will boost overall spending levels and suspend the federal debt ceiling for the next two years.The agreement, struck between the White House and Congress in a bipartisan fashion Monday, covers fiscal years 2020 and 2021, and would raise overall spending levels by $320 billion above the strict limits set in 2011.It would also suspend the federal debt ceiling until July 31, 2021, preventing the United States from defaulting on its payment obligations. The Treasury Department has estimated that a potential default could have happened as soon as early September.The passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 in the House by a vote of 284-149 came one day before lawmakers in the chamber leave town for the summer recess."This agreement was reached and it will meet the needs of the people whom we are honored to represent," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as she advocated the passage of the bill during a debate before lawmakers cast their votes. The Democratic congresswoman led the Congress in negotiating the deal with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who represents the administration in the talks.The Senate's recess starts on Aug 2, giving the upper chamber additional time to vote on the measure. If passed by the Senate, the proposed bill will be sent to President Donald Trump's desk for signature.Trump tweeted earlier in the day urging House Republicans to support the deal, which is not yet a law until the president signs on it. Trump applauded the agreement, saying it "greatly helps our Military and our Vets."Representing a significant bipartisan compromise, the bill will see the budget cap for discretionary spending rise to $1.37 trillion in 2020 and $1.375 trillion in 2021. It includes parity between increases in defense spending and domestic, non-defense outlays, a priority for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat.While Democrats managed to clinch $77.4 billion in "offsets" for spending increases -- down from the original White House proposal asking for $150 billion -- Republicans can boast the victory of securing more defense spending in the agreement -- $738 billion in 2020 and $741 billion in 2021.Meanwhile, the $320-billion rise in overall spending levels for the next two years is $30 billion less than what the Democrats have sought.Non-defense spending for fiscal 2020 would total $632 billion, up nearly 4.5 percent above the comparable fiscal 2019 numbers. For 2021, spending in domestic programs would be further boosted to $635 billion."We are securing robust funding for crucial domestic priorities," Pelosi said. "We have always insisted on parity in increases between defence and non-defense."In addition, the legislation would avoid the automatic cuts looming in January that would have reduced $55 billion in domestic spending and shrank military spending by $71 billion compared with 2019 levels.The automatic across-the-board cuts, known as "sequester," were established in the Budget Control Act of 2011. It intends to cut spending for federal agencies totaling $1.2 trillion during the decade ending 2021, when the law is set to expire.With the spending levels being raised, the agreement would permanently end the sequester, a move hailed by Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in a joint statement Monday as an important win for Democrats."Importantly, Democrats have achieved an agreement that permanently ends the threat of the sequester," they said. "We are pleased that the Administration has finally agreed to join Democrats in ending these devastating cuts."The deal, however, has met with opposition from fractions on Capitol Hill. The conservative House Freedom Caucus in an op-ed published Thursday in USA Today criticized the bill, saying it is "deeply flawed.""With the national debt rapidly approaching an astonishing $23 trillion, it's obvious what Congress should be focused on," wrote Republican Representatives Mark Meadows, Jody Hice and Warren Davidson, who are all members of the conservative group. "We should be working around the clock, canceling Congressional recess if necessary, to hammer out a budget agreement that responsibly cuts spending and sets the country on a track to fiscal solvency."Yet, House Republican leaders and House Democrats by and large are supportive of the deal. While calling the agreement "not a perfect deal by any means," Congressional Progressive Caucus, a progressive group in the House, said in a statement Wednesday that "with this agreement, we can finally begin to end this harmful chapter of self-inflicted austerity."The group added that the deal "will allow for major, long-overdue investments in domestic priorities -- including housing assistance, food aid, education and job training."

                    California can’t stop interstate gun flow
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The mass shooting in Gilroy, California, is fueling renewed debate in the state and across the country about interstate gun trafficking, especially when bordering states have comparatively weak gun laws.The shooting on Sunday at the Gilroy Garlic Festival left three people dead and 12 others wounded before police shot and killed the 19-year-old gunman, Santino William Legan.Authorities said that on July 9 in Fallon, Nevada, he legally bought the military-style semiautomatic rifle used in the shooting. Fallon is a six-hour drive from Gilroy.California is among the states with the most stringent gun laws in the US. It's illegal to sell handguns to anyone under age 21, while the federal minimum age to purchase a firearm is 18. The state also has banned assault weapons since 1989, which inspired a 10-year federal assault weapons ban that expired in 2004.A new law, which went into effect on July 1, makes California the first state to require background checks for every ammunition purchase.But state officials can't stop firearms flowing into the state from neighboring Nevada and other places where gun laws are less stringent, said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra."The reach of the California law ends at our borders, and so we cannot control what other states do, and that's what makes it so tough," he said at a news conference on Monday."California's doing its part,'' Governor Gavin Newsom told reporters when he visited the Gilroy shooting victims at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center on Monday. "But the folks in the White House have been supporting the kinds of policies that roll back the work that we're doing in states like ours to get rid of large-capacity magazines, to address the issues that we're trying to advance on background checks."Newsom pushed for the background-check system when he was lieutenant governor.A bill has passed the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives for mandatory background checks nationwide, but no vote has been scheduled in the Republican-led Senate.A 2017 study found that in the two weeks after a gun show in Nevada, gun-related injuries and deaths jumped in nearby California cities.In that same year, data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives show that 24,130 of 41,527 firearms recovered and traced in California in 2017 were from other states, or 60 percent of the total.Nevada voters passed a ballot measure in 2016 requiring a background check for firearm transactions between private parties, including at gun shows. But the state attorney general put it on hold, saying it wasn't enforceable.The top source states for California's recovered firearms include Arizona, Nevada and Texas, which are scored "F", "D" and "F", respectively, in terms of gun-law strength, by the San Francisco-based gun-control group Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.So far this year, more than 32,000 gun-violence incidents have occurred in the US, including 248 mass shootings, and 8,534 people were killed, according to Gun Violence Archive, a not-for-profit corporation.A new study — "American firearm homicides: The impact of your neighbors" — found that states with strong gun laws, such as California and Illinois, have increased rates of gun crime and homicide when they border states with weak gun laws, such as Arizona and Indiana.To stop the illegal purchase of trafficked weapons, Congresswoman Robin Kelly on Tuesday introduced the "Preventing Gun Trafficking Act'', which would prevent prohibited purchasers from obtaining guns by creating a federal firearms trafficking statute."One of our greatest challenges to combating gun violence in our communities is that Illinois is an oasis of commonsense safety laws surrounded by a desert of misguided 'guns everywhere, rules nowhere' ideology," Kelly said in a statement on Wednesday."In fact, more than half of all crime guns used in Chicago come from outside Illinois, largely from the bordering states of Indiana and Wisconsin, which have extremely weak laws," she said.David Chipman, senior adviser at Giffords Law, said in a statement on Wednesday: "Too often, law enforcement faces the tough job of solving a gun crime after a tragedy. It's time to put more focus on stopping criminals before they get a firearm and put communities at risk."Gun-trafficking is a nationwide problem, and officials say the Northeast is a major center of gun trafficking.Though New York and New Jersey also have gun laws that rank among the tightest in the country, firearms flow up Interstate 95 from the South into both states through what has become known as the "Iron Pipeline''.Between 2010 and 2015, 3 of every 4 guns recovered by authorities in New York state whose state of origin could be determined came from outside New York, officials said.Neighboring New Jersey contributed less that 1 percent of New York's trafficked guns. But almost half of them came from six states with comparably lax gun laws, according to data from the New York attorney general: Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.For the first quarter of 2019, more than 4 of every 5 identified guns used in crimes in New Jersey came from out of state, largely from the same pipeline that feeds New York.With few exceptions, officials said that those states allow sales between private parties at gun shows without background checks, as well as handgun purchases without first obtaining a permit.State and local officials, gun-control advocates and others say the real solution to gun trafficking lies in changes to federal law that states will have to follow.Only Congress and the president can set a baseline, such as universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, and requiring a license to buy and own a firearm.The day after the Gilroy shootings, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, sharply criticized the Senate for not advancing gun-control legislation."Enough is enough. Congress has a responsibility to every family torn apart by gun violence to act, and help advance a future that is finally free from this senseless violence," Pelosi said. "Every day the Senate refuses to act is a stain on the conscience of our nation."

The state also has banned assault weapons since 1989, which inspired a 10-year federal assault weapons ban that expired in 2004.A new law, which went into effect on July 1, makes California the first state to require background checks for every ammunition purchase.But state officials can't stop firearms flowing into the state from neighboring Nevada and other places where gun laws are less stringent, said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra."The reach of the California law ends at our borders, and so we cannot control what other states do, and that's what makes it so tough," he said at a news conference last week."California's doing its part," Governor Gavin Newsom told reporters when he visited the Gilroy shooting victims at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center on July 29. "But the folks in the White House have been supporting the kinds of policies that roll back the work that we're doing in states like ours to get rid of large-capacity magazines, to address the issues that we're trying to advance on background checks."Newsom pushed for the background-check system when he was lieutenant governor.A bill has passed the Democrat-controlled US House of Representatives for mandatory background checks nationwide, but no vote has been scheduled in the Republican-led Senate.A 2017 study found that in the two weeks after a gun show in Nevada, gun-related injuries and deaths jumped in nearby California cities.In that same year, data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives show that 24,130 of 41,527 firearms recovered and traced in California in 2017 were from other states, accounting for 60 percent of the total.Nevada voters passed a ballot measure in 2016, requiring a background check for firearm transactions between private parties, including at gun shows. But the state attorney general put it on hold, saying it wasn't enforceable.The top source states for California's recovered firearms include Arizona, Nevada and Texas, which are scored "F", "D" and "F", respectively, in terms of gun-law strength, by the San Francisco-based gun-control group Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.So far this year, 32,998 gun violence incidents have happened in the US, including 250 mass shootings, and 8,712 people were killed, according to Gun Violence Archive, a not-for-profit corporation.A study, American Firearm Homicides: The Impact of Your Neighbors, published this year found that states with strong gun laws, such as California and Illinois, have increased rates of gun crime and homicide when they border states with weak gun laws, such as Arizona and Indiana.To stop the illegal purchase of trafficked weapons, Illinois Congresswoman Robin Kelly on July 30 introduced a bill that would prevent prohibited purchasers from obtaining guns by creating a federal firearms trafficking statute."One of our greatest challenges to combating gun violence in our communities is that Illinois is an oasis of commonsense safety laws surrounded by a desert of misguided 'guns everywhere, rules nowhere' ideology," Kelly said on Wednesday."In fact, more than half of all crime guns used in Chicago come from outside Illinois, largely from the bordering states of Indiana and Wisconsin, which have extremely weak laws," she said.David Chipman, senior adviser at Giffords Law Center, said on Wednesday: "Too often, law enforcement faces the tough job of solving a gun crime after a tragedy. It's time to put more focus on stopping criminals before they get a firearm and put communities at risk."California isn't alone with gun-trafficking problems. It's nationwide problem, and officials say the Northeast is a major center of gun trafficking.Though New York and New Jersey also have gun laws that rank among the tightest in the country, firearms flow up Interstate 95 from southern states through what has become known as the "Iron Pipeline".Between 2010 and 2015, three of every four guns recovered by authorities in New York state whose state of origin could be determined came from outside New York, officials said.Neighboring New Jersey contributed less than 1 percent of New York's trafficked guns. But almost half of them came from six states with comparably lax gun laws, according to data from the New York attorney general: Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.For the first quarter of 2019, more than four of every five identified guns used in crimes in New Jersey came from out of state, largely from the same pipeline that feeds New York.With few exceptions, officials said that those states allow sales between private parties at gun shows without background checks, as well as handgun purchases without first obtaining a permit.
