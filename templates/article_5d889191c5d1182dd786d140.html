                Nations move to aid cyclone victims
            </p>

                Death toll from disaster in three southern African countries has surpassed 550 The international community has moved to provide humanitarian aid to the victims of Cyclone Idai that hit Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe on March 15, killing more than 550 and leaving thousands of others homeless. The United Nations said Cyclone Idai has killed 242 people in Mozambique and 56 people in Malawi, according to government reports. Another 259 deaths have been cited in Zimbabwe by the country's defense minister. China, the European Union, the African Union, and the United Kingdom, among others, have offered help for the victims. The China International Development Cooperation Agency said on Thursday that China will provide humanitarian assistance to Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, Xinhua News Agency reported. Without unveiling the details of the assistance, CIDCA spokesman Tian Lin said China expresses condolences to the affected people and is ready to offer a hand for the reconstruction work in the cyclone-stricken countries according to the needs of the affected areas. On Wednesday, the Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe and the local Chinese community donated food, purified water and equipment worth $200,000. Chinese Ambassador Guo Shaochun expressed deep condolences and sympathy over the lost lives and to the bereaved families. "As a true brother, friend and partner to Zimbabwe, China feels what the Zimbabwean people are feeling and will always stand with you," Guo said. In addition to the humanitarian aid, Guo said China was willing to share experiences with Zimbabwe, noting that the Asian country is prone to natural disasters and hence possessed massive experience in disaster preparedness and relief. In Malawi's capital Lilongwe, the Chinese embassy on Wednesday donated $50,000 to help the southern African country. Wang Xiusheng, Chinese charge d'affairs in Malawi, said China will also donate 2,000 bags of rice, adding that Chinese businessmen in the country will contribute $41,000 to the victims. On Monday, the UK announced that it will provide up to $7.9 million of humanitarian relief to Mozambique and Malawi. This will be followed by an extra $15.8 million of support, including food, water and shelter to the survivors. The EU on Tuesday released $4 million in emergency aid to the three countries. Christos Stylianides, the EU's commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis management, said in a statement that the funds will be used to provide logistical support to reach affected people, emergency shelter, hygiene, sanitation and healthcare. "In addition, we are sending our technical experts on the ground and our Copernicus satellite system has been activated to identify needs and help our humanitarian partners and the local authorities in their response," Stylianides said. On Tuesday, Tom Babington, acting spokesman of the United States Agency for International Development, announced that the agency had mobilized $700,000 in total assistance to the three countries. "Of this, $200,000 was for relief efforts in Mozambique in response to the damage caused by Cyclone Idai, and $500,000 was provided in response to the flooding in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi earlier this month," Babington said. The Tanzanian government on Tuesday donated a consignment of drugs and medical sundries to assist the victims. The relief included 200 tons of maize to be delivered to Malawi, and 24 tons of medicine, with each of the three countries receiving eight tons. On Wednesday, Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairman of the African Union Commission, announced immediate support of $350,000 to the three countries, with Mozambique, the hardest hit of the three, to receive $150,000 from emergency AU funds. The UN's Central Emergency Response Fund allocated $20 million on Wednesday to ensure aid reaches those most affected. The cyclone made landfall on Thursday night near Beira in central Mozambique, bringing heavy rain and flooding to the three countries. Mozambique was the most affected with 90 percent damage of Beira. edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily 03/23/2019 page7)

                Chinese community provides Cyclone Idai emergency aid in Zimbabwe
            </a>
            <p>
                In a strong show of solidarity, the Chinese community in Zimbabwe have donated cash and goods valued at $200,000 to help the victims of the Cyclone Idai, a tropical storm that wreaked havoc in the country during the past week.At least 100 people in the province of Manicaland, Masvingo and were killed by the flash floods by Cyclone Idai while thousands of people have been displaced and rendered homeless after their homes and property were destroyed.At a handover ceremony to the government of Zimbabwe on Wednesday, Guo Shaochun, the new Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe, said the goods were China's show of empathy to Zimbabwe to help the country cope with the disaster that has also affected Mozambique and Malawi."On behalf of the Chinese government, I would express our deep condolences and profound sympathy to their lives lost and to the bereaved families of the victims of the disaster. As a true brother, friend and partner to Zimbabwe, China feels what the Zimbabwean people are feeling and will always stand with you," he said.The mobilised goods, the first batch of more aid to come from China, comprised food, tents, water and blankets. They were sourced from Chinese business organisations that include Sino-Zim Wildlife Foundation, Chinese Federation of Zimbabwe, Chamber for Chinese Enterprises in Zimbabwe and Zimbabwe-China Business Association.Ambassador Guo added that China as a country prone to natural disasters possessed massive experience in disaster preparedness and relief and therefore was prepared to share its experience with Zimbabwe to help its people cope well with the current disaster.Li Song, chairlady of the Sino-Zimbabwe Wildlife Foundation, said her organisation had also made available a helicopter, three volunteers and three boats to assist rescue efforts in the affected areas.This is not the first time the Chinese community has donated toward a national cause. Last year, the community donated cash and materials for a national campaign to tame a ravaging cholera outbreak.Martin Rushwaya, the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Defence, said Zimbabwe was extremely grateful to China for responding positively to call by President Emmerson Mnangagwa for assistance for victims of Cyclone Idai.He added that gesture of goodwill by China confirmed the excellent relations that exists between the two countries and demonstrated that China was indeed a friend of Zimbabwe including in times of need."This donation of various assortments of food items and blankets by the Chinese embassy in conjunction with the Chinese business community will go a long way in alleviating the plight of the victims of the cyclone. As you are aware the eastern parts of the country were affected seriously by flooding caused by Cyclone Idai. As we speak close to 100 people have been confirmed dead, while several hundred are reported missing and still to be accounted for," he said.There has been outpouring of relief in the wake of Cyclone Idai induced floods as Zimbabweans have come together in their numbers, making donations in cash and kind to help victims of the tropical storm.Mthuli Ncube, the minister of Finance and Economic Development, announced this week that government had released $50 million for emergency and infrastructure restoration. However, more resources are required to rebuild the affected areas, in what disaster experts have described as probably the worst humanitarian crisis in years.

                Disease fears mount in Mozambique
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIRA, Mozambique－Disease is threatening to aggravate the already dire conditions facing millions of survivors following the powerful tropical cyclone which ravaged southern Africa 10 days ago, officials warned on Sunday.Cyclone Idai smashed into Mozambique's coast, unleashing hurricane-force wind and rain that flooded swathes of the poor country before battering eastern Zimbabwe－killing 705 people across the two nations.Amid the ongoing crisis, Zimbabwean television ZBC on Sunday reported that a young woman had given birth while sheltering from the floods in a tree.Speaking at a briefing in Beira, 1,000 kilometers northeast of the Mozambique capital Maputo, Lands Minister Celso Correia said it was now "inevitable that cases of cholera and malaria will rise".The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs' deputy head Sebastian Rhodes Stampa warned at the briefing that disease outbreaks in inaccessible areas could be "really problematic".Aid workers from across the world are continuing to arrive in the region to bring help to hundreds of thousands of affected people across an area of roughly 3,000 square kilometers.Survivors are struggling in desperate conditions with some still trapped on rooftops and those rescued in urgent need of food and medical supplies."The government is already setting up a cholera treatment center to mitigate cholera. We should not be frightened when cholera issues arise," added Correia, describing efforts to control the emerging humanitarian crisis."It is normal. It's almost inevitable. Malaria, we know how it arises. We have lots of wetlands and we're going to have malaria that is sure to come up (there)."Wilfried Deliviai, a 19-year-old resident of Beira, said he felt "sorry for our town, our city, because we suffered a lot to build it"."Houses are completely destroyed, and some people don't have money to rebuild their businesses－and many businesses are going to fail," he said.More than 2 million people have been affected in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi where the storm started as a tropical depression causing flooding which displaced nearly 1 million people. Hundreds are still missing in Mozambique and Zimbabwe.In its daily update, the UN Humanitarian Office said 74,600 women affected by the cyclone are pregnant and around 60 percent of them are due to give birth within the next six months. At least 7,460 are at risk of life-threatening complications.The International Committee of the Red Cross said it had recorded some cases of cholera so far but the UN was unable to confirm the reports.Stampa described efforts to reopen the main access road to Beira as a "big victory"."We will be able to bring more help to families living in this affected area," he said.Those living in affected areas of Mozambique began to trickle back to church over the weekend.The Ponta Gea Catholic Cathedral in Beira was miraculously undamaged by the storm while the church next door was leveled."The people don't know what to do because they lost their houses. They have no food, they don't know where to sleep－this brings sadness and anxiety," said Father Pedro, who conducted Mass in darkness late on Saturday.Much of the area hit by the cyclone remains disconnected from electricity supplies, complicating rescue efforts at nightfall.As many as 109,000 people are living in shelters across central Mozambique, many of them located in and around Beira.Those shelters also "run the risk of infectious disease such as diarrheal disease and measles", said James McQuen Patterson, UNICEF's health and nutrition chief."Further, as many families have lost everything, some sleeping in the open, the risk of pneumonia, particularly among children increases considerably," he said.AFP

                At least nine illegal Zimbabwean miners die after mine collapse
            </a>
            <p>
                HARARE - At least nine illegal gold miners have died in Zimbabwe after they detonated explosives underground and were trapped at a mine owned by unlisted London-headquartered Metallon Corporation north of the capital Harare, the company said on Monday.Metallon put its Mazowe Mine on care and maintenance last September, citing viability problems. One of Zimbabwe's biggest gold producers, it still operates three other mines.Metallon said in a statement the mine collapse happened on Sunday when illegal miners gained access to underground shafts and blasted explosives."Tragically nine panners lost their lives. None of these miners were employees of Metallon and all those involved with keeping the mine on care and maintenance have been accounted for," Metallon said.At least 24 people died in February when underground shafts were flooded at two abandoned mines in Battlefield, which is to the west of Harare.With formal unemployment above 80 percent, thousands of young men risk their lives daily working in dangerous underground tunnels in search of gold, Zimbabwe's largest mineral export earner.The southern African nation has been working to regulate thousands of people who illegally dig for gold everywhere, including on farms and abandoned mines, mostly under the cover of darkness. Reuters

                Zimbabwe's cooperation with China always a win-win: Trade minister
            </a>
            <p>
                Zimbabwean Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Sibusiso Moyo said that Zimbabwe's cooperation with China has always been a win-win and one of mutual trust.He said that Zimbabwe's geographical location in southern Africa, combined with the support of the Chinese government, its financial institutions and companies in funding roads, rail, energy, telecommunications, and many other projects, presents vast opportunities for being a regional hub and a strategic partner under the Belt and Road Initiative.Despite accusations that China's infrastructure financing under the BRI is pushing countries involved in the initiative into a "debt trap", Moyo said that in any cooperation framework, including the BRI, it is important that countries identify and adopt appropriate financing models that limit exposure to debt."It should also be noted that the issue of debt sustainability is a sovereign issue, which should not be a concern to other countries. Our cooperation with China is and has always been on the basis of win-win and mutual trust," he said.He added that Zimbabwe would also like to draw lessons from China's experience of achieving rapid economic growth and prosperity, and the "unparalleled feat" has resulted in millions of people being lifted up from poverty."The Chinese success story is an illustration of a combination of coordinated strategic planning, effective management and implementation, hard work, discipline and perseverance that must be emulated," he said.Over 80 African ministerial-level officials from 53 countries are in Beijing attending the Coordinators' Meeting on the Implementation of the Follow-up Actions of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation that began Monday and ends Tuesday."We hail FOCAC (the forum) for establishing a platform that continually reviews its implementation mechanism and also note with satisfaction the commendable progress made so far," he said.He said forum members desire to ensure that the agreed Beijing Action Plan of 2019-2021 is implemented in pursuit of mutually beneficial cooperation. In light of this, these meetings are important as they give further impetus to that progress.He added that the trend towards unilateralism and protectionism by some countries in the world goes against the grain of multilateralism, which is widely accepted in international discourse."Zimbabwe stands firmly against such tendencies and embraces President Xi Jinping's vision of a community with a shared future for mankind," he said.
