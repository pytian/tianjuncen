                A third defeat leaves PM grappling with a perilous crisis over BrexitLONDON - Britain's exit from the European Union was in disarray after the implosion of Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit strategy left her under pressure from rival factions to leave without a deal, go for an election or forge a much softer divorce, Reuters reported.After one of the most tumultuous weeks in British politics since the 2016 referendum, it was still uncertain how, when or even if the United Kingdom will ever leave the bloc it first joined 46 years ago.A third defeat of May's divorce deal, after her pledge to quit if it was passed, left one of the weakest leaders in a generation grappling with a perilous crisis over Brexit, the country's most significant move since World War II.Parliament was scheduled to vote on different Brexit options on Monday and then May could try one last roll of the dice by bringing her deal back to a vote in parliament as soon as Tuesday."There are no ideal choices available and there are very good arguments against any possible outcome at the moment but we are going to have to do something," said Justice Secretary David Gauke, who voted in the 2016 referendum to stay in the EU."The prime minister is reflecting on what the options are, and is considering what may happen but I don't think any decisions have been made," he told BBC TV.Many in May's party, though, have lost patience. The Sun newspaper reported that 170 of her 314 Conservative lawmakers had sent her a letter demanding that Brexit take place in the next few months - deal or no deal.The UK was due to leave the EU on March 29 but the political deadlock in London forced May to ask the bloc for a delay. Currently, Brexit is due to take place on April 12 unless May comes up with another option.The labyrinthine Brexit crisis has left the island country divided: Supporters of both Brexit and EU membership marched through London last week. Many on both sides feel betrayed by a political elite that has failed to show leadership.Meanwhile, hundreds of people gathered at the Irish border on Saturday to protest against Brexit, fearing that departing the EU will result in the reimposition of a 'hard' or physical border with EU member Ireland that could become a target for violence, Agence France-Presse reported.Parliament was due to vote at around 7:00 pm local time on Mon-day on a range of alternative Brexit options selected by Speaker John Bercow from nine proposals put forward by lawmakers, including a no-deal exit, preventing a no-deal exit, a customs union, or a second referendum."We are clearly going to have to consider very carefully the will of parliament," Gauke said.A senior Conservative suggested on Saturday that the UK may be forced to create a national unity government to end the impasse."If the government refused and Theresa May felt she could not implement what Parliament had identified as a way of leaving the EU, then I think we would have to think very hard about whether a cross-party coalition ... could do that in order to make sure that the U.K. does leave the EU in an orderly fashion," former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan told BBC.With no majority yet in the House of Commons for any of the Brexit options, there was speculation that an election could be called, though such a vote would be unpredictable and it is unclear who would lead the Conservatives into it, Reuters reported.The Sunday Times said May's media chief, Robbie Gibb, and her political aide Stephen Parkinson were pushing for an election against the will of her chief enforcer in parliament, Julian Smith.The Conservative Party's deputy chair, James Cleverly, said it was not planning for an election. But the deputy leader of the opposition Labour Party, Tom Watson, said his party was on election footing.Labour's foreign affairs spokeswoman, Emily Thornberry, said it could try to call a vote of no confidence in May's government."We don't know if she is going to remain prime minister, if we are going to get somebody else, who that other person is going to be - it is a mess," Thornberry said.Opponents of Brexit fear it will make Britain poorer and divide the West.Supporters of Brexit say while the divorce might bring some short-term instability, in the longer term it will allow the UK to thrive if cut free from what they cast as a doomed attempt in European unity.Agencies

                    May's offer to quit fails to break Britain's Brexit stalemate

                LONDON - British Prime Minister Theresa May failed to sway hardline opponents of her European Union divorce deal on Wednesday with an offer to quit, but parliament's bid to agree an alternative fell short, leaving the Brexit process as deadlocked as ever.May told her Conservative lawmakers she would step down if her Brexit deal was finally passed by parliament at the third attempt, in a last-ditch bid to win over many of her party's eurosceptic rebels.But some were unmoved and the Northern Irish party crucial to getting the agreement through said it would reject the deal again.Britain was supposed to leave the bloc on Friday but Brussels agreed last week to put back the divorce date until April 12 to give it a chance to resolve a three-year crisis that has split the country down the middle.However, it still remains uncertain how, when or even whether the United Kingdom, the world's fifth-biggest economy, will leave the EU. The possibilities that it will leave with no deal to soften the shock to its economy, or delay the departure date to hold a general election, have increased as other options fade.While May's deal continued to stumble, an attempt by parliament to take control of the process by holding a series of indicative votes on other options produced no immediate way through the impasse.None of the proposals, many of which involved closer alignment with the EU than May envisages, won the support of a majority of lawmakers."In a spectacular display of indecision, the House of Commons has voted against remaining in the EU and every version of leaving the EU," tweeted James Cleverly, the Conservative Party's deputy chairman.Nevertheless, some proposals fared better than May's deal had done two weeks ago, and parliament was due to hold more indicative votes on Monday after refining the options most likely to secure a majority.

                    British lawmakers reject all four Brexit options in second round vote
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                LONDON - British lawmakers on Monday voted to turn down all the four proposed Brexit options on the table, the second time since Friday that none of MPs' proposed Brexit options wins clear backing in the House of Commons.MPs voted down all the four Brexit proposals chosen by House Speaker John Bercow in a bid to break the current Brexit deadlock. The British government has until April 12 to decide how Britain will leave the European Union (EU).None of the four alternatives to British Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal receives support from a majority of MPs in the second round of "indicative vote," which kicked off at around 20:00 BST on Monday and whose results were announced at around 22:00 BST.MPs voted 261 to 282 to reject the proposal that the United Kingdom stays in the single market and negotiates the customs union with the EU.The customs union proposal means Britain's close trading relations with the European Union after Brexit.Under the Common Market 2.0 proposal, the UK would leave the EU, but retain the free flow of goods and make contributions to the EU budget.Meanwhile, MPs also voted 191 to 292 to turn down the idea to give lawmakers power to stop a no-deal Brexit.They voted 280 to 292 to oppose the proposal that confirmative public vote will be conducted on Brexit.MPs also voted 273 to 276 to reject the proposal to negotiate permanent customs union with the EU.None of the Monday votes on the proposals are legally binding, meaning it will be up to the British government if they act on the results.Conservative MPs have been given a free vote, but cabinet ministers will be told to abstain. The opposition Labour Party ordered its MPs to vote for the customs union.Prime Minister May is seeking a fourth vote on her Withdrawal Agreement, which has been rejected by the parliament three times since January.The first round of unbinding "indicative vote" was conducted on March 27, in which none of MPs' eight proposed options secured a majority, but among them, the proposed options about a customs union with the Europan Union and a referendum on any deal received most support from the lawmakers.Many of those eight options have returned for round two, but some have been replaced with new alternatives.The prime minister, who is struggling to hold her party together, warned Sunday night that she faced resignation and a split in the Conservative Party if she agrees to pursue a "soft" Brexit this week.The British cabinet is expected to meet on Tuesday morning to consider how to proceed with the vote outcomes amid speculation about possible resignations, a general election or change of Tory leader."My party refuses to compromise, I regret therefore that I can no longer sit for the party," an emotional Conservative MP Nick Boles said in the parliament chamber shortly after the announcement of the vote results to quit the party."I accept that I have failed," he added.British cabinet ministers were once again reportedly instructed to boycott the votes as MPs make a second attempt to coalesce around an alternative deal.May had suggested she would "engage constructively" with the indicative votes process.May's plan that she negotiated with the EU has been rejected twice by historic margins in Parliament.The withdrawal agreement section of her deal was voted down again by MPs on Friday.Mrs May now has until 12 April to either seek a longer extension from the EU to take a different course or decide to leave the EU without a deal.

                    UK army investigates Corbyn target practice video
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Britain's Defence Ministry has launched an investigation into a social media video apparently showing British soldiers using a picture of Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn for target practice.The Ministry of Defence confirmed the video is legitimate and that an investigation has been launched. The incident is understood to have happened within the past few days in Afghanistan, on a shooting range in Kabul used by deployed soldiers to practice close-protection techniques.A Labour Party spokesman said: "This behaviour is alarming and unacceptable. We have confidence in the MoD to investigate and act on this incident."The issue was addressed later in the Commons, when the Speaker John Bercow said he would be "horrified" if service personnel behaved that way to any MP.The soldiers were using paint "simunition" rounds, not bullets, but multiple holes can be seen in the picture of Corbyn's head. The video carries the caption "happy with that"."We are aware of a video circulating on social media, this behaviour is totally unacceptable and falls well below the high standards the army expects, a full investigation has been launched," an army spokesman said.The soldiers, from the 3rd battalion, Parachute Regiment, have been spoken to and are due to leave Afghanistan shortly because their tour is coming to an end.The Labour Party leader Corbyn said: "I'm shocked, obviously, that this sort of thing has happened."I hope the Ministry of Defence will conduct an inquiry into it and find out what was going on and who did that."Corbyn is unpopular in parts of the military because of his past policies on Northern Ireland, the Trident nuclear program and opposition to the Iraq war and other foreign interventions.Nia Griffith, the shadow defence secretary, wrote to Gavin Williamson, the secretary of state for defence, calling for him to ensure the investigation "is thorough and carried out in a timely manner".Williamson later replied on Twitter: "I commend the prompt and clear leadership shown by the army in investigating this troubling video." It is understood he would wait until the investigation concluded before commenting further.Labour sources highlighted that Corbyn and other Labour figures have been targeted in recent weeks and months, while the party pressure group Momentum said it reflected the "radicalising effect the rightwing press is having".Referring to the current febrile atmosphere in British politics, Corbyn said: "Yes people have disagreements and yes people have divisions."Conduct those divisions and disagreements in a respectful way. Don't descend into something ugly and violent."

                    EU's new lifeline may not be enough to save May
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                On Thursday, the European Union gave British Prime Minister Theresa May until Oct 31, four months more than what she had sought, to resolve the domestic deadlock over Brexit.The lengthy and lingering Brexit process shows that the May government cannot handle the pressure from the British parliament and EU leaders. To begin with, the May government didn't consider the opposition's suggestions on Brexit seriously, and couldn't sort out matters within the ruling coalition and counter the EU's tough demands.Hard-liners within the Conservative Party-Democratic Unionist Party coalition government refuse to accept the "backstop" arrangements for Northern Ireland (that is, not having a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland under any circumstances) in the Brexit negotiations with the EU. For example, Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the hard-line Brexiters, said he couldn't accept the deal, and the DUP openly claimed May had compromised British interests on the issue.To make matters worse, May is also facing opposition within her Conservative Party. After the second Brexit amendment was rejected, many among the Tories said May should resign. This added fuel to former British foreign secretary Boris Johnson's campaign against May and helped him re-emerge as a possible alternative to May in the future.The hung parliament following the snap election in June 2017 forced the Conservatives to form a coalition government with the DUP, which presaged that the Brexit negotiation would encounter many twists and turns. Plus, the failure of May's initial Brexit plan meant the deal with the EU would face strong resistance from British members of parliament.Subsequently, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn gave a call for a second referendum to settle the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU. However, there are contradictions within the Labour Party, too, over Brexit. Which means there are not only inter-party differences but also intra-party disagreements over Brexit.About 1 million Britons participated in a massive demonstration on March 23 to express their frustration with the Brexit process and demand a second referendum. But a second referendum could be held only after the parliament discusses and decides whether it would be on a hard or soft Brexit, or on staying with or leaving the EU.Besides, there is little possibility of the parliament approving May's third Brexit deal if it is not substantially changed. In fact, John Bercow, the speaker of House of Commons, has said that since May's two previous Brexit drafts have been rejected, the third must have substantial changes.Therefore, it appears May's government has little chance to reach a new deal with the EU. Which means the British government needs to renegotiate with the EU. Ironically, it also means Britain which decided to leave the EU has to take part in the European Parliament elections on May 23.Ever since Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty was invoked in March 2017, the UK's negotiating position has been weakening for various reasons, including internal political wranglings and the EU's tough conditions, although European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker both have said the UK's dominant right in Brexit is still in the hands of its people.So, given the remote possibility of a large-scale compromise on either side, what the EU could do is to count on the May government's political acumen to get the new Brexit deal through the British parliament. And to maintain stability, the EU could try to minimize the negative effects likely to be brought about by Brexit.And since the EU would accept a hard or soft Brexit, or for that matter a no-deal Brexit, the onus is squarely on May to decide whether to try and get another draft Brexit deal through the parliament, call a snap poll, organize a second referendum or just demit the prime minister's office.The author is a researcher at the Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
