                Hong Kong grapples with its own, new Pandora's Box
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                The myths of ancient Greece are so potent that thousands of years after they first circulated, they are still known today and are familiar even to Hong Kong schoolchildren.Such is the story of the Pandora's Box, and the girl who couldn't resist the temptation of opening it despite expressing instructions not to do so, only to find that she had unleashed upon the world every kind of trouble and unhappiness.It takes little imagination to believe that this is what has happened in Hong Kong.Yuen Long in the northwest New Territories was, not so long ago, best known to Hong Kong people as the home of "wife cakes", a favorite delicacy.In fact, it is a fascinating area with more complexities than that. Indigenous residents are proudly aware of their long history preserved in ancestral halls that are hundreds of years old, as well as ancient walled villages.This was the only part of Hong Kong that militarily resisted British colonization in a brief war in which the villagers were inevitably outgunned.Even so, their traditions were more important to them than the artificial new line dividing the Chinese mainland from Hong Kong and the chaos of World War II, the Japanese occupation, and the consequent lawlessness that allowed this area to re-establish its own way of doing things.More recently, its rural character was profoundly affected by the development of new towns and the Small House Policy, both of which added to the wealth of the district and of individuals.The characteristics of clannishness and suspicion of outsiders have, however, not been obliterated. It all makes for a powerful brew of a very special culture, some of which was captured in the local film Overheard 3.Equally interesting in a different way is the Fujian settlement at the eastern end of Hong Kong Island. In older times, there were more of these clusters of people from the same part of China, naturally gravitating toward others who spoke the same dialect.This particularly cohesive group successfully lobbied for old-age welfare benefits to be accessible to them even after a move back to their home province on the mainland, so strong is their identification with Fujian.These two groups, in very different corners of Hong Kong, used to be simply part of the rich mosaic of our community.Now, since the Pandora's Box was opened by the confrontations over the extradition proposals, they stand accused of aggression toward the demonstrators.The fact of the matter is that human beings love violence. If we were honest, most of us would have to admit that we like to counter life's frustrations with punches, swearing and worse.Much of what we consider civilized society is an attempt to put a lid on that particular variant of the Pandora's Box, constraining ourselves to accept the referee's decision in all sorts of activities and restraining the powerful from lashing out just because they can. What happens when those restraints are removed?We have seen the effects over the last couple of months: plenty of injuries; a measurable rise in mental distress, even implicated in suicides; the trashing of property; and estrangement and alienation between family members and different groups.Anarchy is a bit like getting drunk: The first few drafts are delicious, but the hangover and the realization of the damage that has been done are horrible.It is also a trap. Once begun, with two sides pitched against each other, it becomes almost impossible to step down, only much easier, even if in reality more painful, to continue a cycle of retaliation until all is laid waste.If Hong Kong schoolchildren know the story of Pandora's Box, then they also know how it ended: When everything seemed completely disastrous, a tiny creature that had been overlooked emerged from the maligned box.This was Hope. Hong Kong has always been rather a hopeful place, its population's roots including many who were willing to take chances and run risks to make a better life for themselves and their families.Even now, groups and individuals are actively talking and thinking about how to find a constructive way forward and away from the current crisis.One of the most lauded historical events of the 20th century was the peaceful end of apartheid in South Africa, achieved without violence despite the years of hatred and oppression that had gone before.Nelson Mandela was acclaimed as a hero for his part, but the role of F.W. de Klerk, the then-president of South Africa, is sometimes given insufficient credit.An establishment figure all his life, he had to demonstrate graciousness and wisdom to negotiate with a former enemy in order to achieve the greater good for his country.Where are Hong Kong's figures of comparable stature who will allow us to believe in Hope now?The author is a co-host of RTHK's Back-Chat radio program and supporter of various welfare NGOs. She is a former assistant director of social welfare.

                    BRI poised to take greater shape

                World leaders attending key gathering on initiative in BeijingThe future shape and direction of one of the world's most important initiatives is set to be decided in Beijing.Some 37 heads of state or government, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, will take part in the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, which begins on Thursday.Alongside them will be 5,000 participants from more than 150 countries.All the participants will make their way to the China National Convention Center for the three-day event, which is themed "Belt and Road Cooperation: Shaping a Brighter Shared Future."At the first forum two years ago, the initiative progressed to being one that all countries could take part in, not just those along the Silk Road Economic Belt, the land route taking in Central Asia and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, which winds its way through Southeast Asia to Africa and beyond.To date, some 126 countries across the globe and 29 international organizations have signed 174 BRI cooperation documents.Since the initiative was announced by President Xi Jinping in 2013, trade volumes between China and participating countries have exceeded $6 trillion, with investments of more than $80 billion. Some 300,000 jobs have been created.Western countries, many of which will be represented at the forum by senior politicians, have increasingly embraced the initiative, with Italy in March becoming the first G7 nation to sign a memorandum of understanding.Many experts believe this marked a turning point and that other Western countries will begin to give more support to the initiative.Kishore Mahbubani, a former diploma and now an academic in Singapore, believes the forum could be a crossroads for this to happen."The fact that Italy has participated is a big deal. It is a real breakthrough, and now it is a question of getting another one or two G7 members to join," he said.The initiative is also becoming increasingly popular with many in the business community in the United States.David M. Rubenstein is co-founder and co-executive chairman of US global investment company, The Carlyle Group, one of the country's leading private equity investors."The Belt and Road has had a positive effect on China and I think it has been enormously positive on the countries in which they (China) have made investments," he said."Clearly, the US does not have anything comparable, and therefore we must recognize that we need to do more to be a visible force if we are going to have an impact on those countries (like China has had)."Martin Sorrell, founder of WPP, the world's largest advertising and public relations company and now executive chairman of S4 Capital, a marketing services company, wants to see the United Kingdom become more involved. The UK is represented at the forum by Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, who also attended in 2017."My view is that when the UK comes out of the European Union, if it does come out, it will have no choice. We will have to establish stronger relationships, both trading and political, with countries outside the EU, otherwise we will become increasingly marginalized," Sorrell said."I don't think we have yet put our best foot forward in China, and the question of whether we sign up to the BRI is just one of those decisions that has to be made."Amitav Acharya, distinguished professor of international relations at the American University in Washington, said the challenge for the initiative at the forum will be to emerge as more multilateral."The initiative needs to have more collaboration with multilateral institutions. So if, for example, you have a project with country X and China provides funding but there is also additional money from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, it will become more integrated into the global governance system," he said.Peter Frankopan, professor of global history at Oxford University, believes it is the scale of the investment that remains the most impressive aspect of the initiative, as more projects are set to be announced at the forum.In his new book, The New Silk Roads: The Present and Future of the World, he quotes Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who said: "Other countries have lots of ideas but no money. But for China, when it comes with an idea, it also comes with the money."Frankopan said: "I think he (Hun Sen) is right. These projects, for the large part, do have the ability to raise living standards and do the kind of things that large-scale international development does."However, Frankopan said that although the forum will be a chance to reflect on what the BRI has achieved, it will take much longer to make a wider judgment on this."Five years is not a great period of time in historical terms to assess it. The key test will not be whether infrastructure projects look good, but whether they can actually significantly improve the GDP and productivity of China's neighbors," he said.Daniel Ikenson, director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at United States think tank the Cato Institute, regrets that the US has not taken a more positive stance on the initiative."The US actively lobbied countries to eschew the initiative and not join. To me, that was showing a lack of confidence. The idea of bringing infrastructure to countries where it is lacking will benefit the global economy, including US companies," he said.Terry Miller, director of the Center for International Trade and Economics at The Heritage Foundation, another US think tank, agrees that the initiative can deliver benefits, but said there is a need for more clarity."It can be positive for China and the recipient countries. There is not enough knowledge about the goals that China is trying to pursue, and transparency in terms of its motives. If this were better known, it would go a long way to improving the understanding and perhaps acceptance of the project," he said.Justin Vaisse, director-general of the Paris Peace Forum, which held its first international summit last year, believes the BRI has to be seen as a step in the right direction."One's first reaction to the Belt and Road is that it is positive. It is an addition to connectivity, development and infrastructure, and not a subtraction," he said.But he hopes the forum will give the initiative greater shape and form."At the moment, it is very plastic, very flexible. China has now grown in terms of being an economic power and is now a norm-setter. We want to see what sort of norms it wants to put in place and what mechanisms," he said.Ian Goldin, professor of globalization and development at Oxford University who was economic adviser to late South African president Nelson Mandela, said the BRI is giving developing countries much more choice in terms of attracting finance."The only option for countries was to accept investment or aid from Europe, the US, or on the other side of the Cold War, the Soviet Union. Now, we are in an environment where countries have a choice because of the Belt and Road and they can decide for themselves what they do. This can only be a good thing," he said.Mahbubani, the intellectual and author of Has the West Lost It? A Provocation, said the forum will also be an occasion to celebrate the initiative's successes.He cited the 19.2-kilometer-long Kamchiq Tunnel through the Qurama Mountains in Uzbekistan, built by the China Railway Tunnel Group, now unites two regions of the country that had been historically separated. The project was completed in just 900 days."It is a wonderful initiative and has led to some significant success stories, which we don't hear enough of," he said."It should be remembered that no country is forced to join the Belt and Road, but it just so happens that the majority of countries in the world want to."Wang Linyan contributed to this story.

                    ANC leading in South African general election
                </p>

                          The ruling African National Congress, or ANC, was heading to victory in South Africa's presidential and parliamentary elections on Friday, though its performance was likely to be the worst since it came to power 25 years ago.              The ANC, headed by President Cyril Ramaphosa, was leading with about 57 percent of votes, after more than two-thirds of the voting districts counted.                  Its closest rival, the Democratic Alliance received nearly 22 percent of votes, and the left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters about 10 percent, according to result released by the Independent Electoral Commission of South Africa. The final result is expected to be released on Saturday.                      Still, the result would be the ANC's worst performance since Nelson Mandela led the party to victory in the first all-races poll in 1994, which marked the end of the apartheid. In the previous poll five years ago, it won 62 percent of the total vote.                          The ANC Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte said she is neither disappointed or surprised at the partial results, according to Agence France-Presse.                              "What I think is important to recognize is the deepening of our democracy," she said.                                  Millions of South Africans headed to the polling stations on Wednesday. Tight security was reported in all the polling stations with a minimum of two police officers per station to ensure the process runs smoothly.                                      On Thursday, police arrested 19 suspects in three KwaZulu-Natal municipalities for "double voting".                                          Mawethu Mosery, the IEC deputy electoral officer said the arrests had been made in Hluhluwe, Port Shepstone and Danhauser and that the police were conducting the investigation.                                              "The Electoral Commission is encouraged by the rapid arrest of the voters in KwaZulu-Natal in connection with alleged double voting," he said.                                                  He said any attempt to vote more than once leaves a clear footprint in the electoral process and the suspects were tracked down using that information.                                                      "The Electoral Commission has also ordered an investigation into the effectiveness of the indelible ink marker pens supplied for the elections," he said.                                                          Mosery said the IEC will urgently conduct an audit of results and votes cast in a sample of voting stations to ascertain if double voting occurred.                                                              He said the audit will cover a statistically representative sample of voting stations as well as all voting stations where complaints or allegations of double voting have been received.                                                                  According to an IEC statement, the audit will involve the capture of information showing the ID numbers of voters who cast votes at each voting station.

                No civilization is superior to another, each has its own beauty and uniqueness and has something that others can learn from The coexistence of human civilizations since ancient times was shattered by the colonial expansion of the West. The diversity of civilizations seemed to have come to an end with the "superior civilization" mentality of the Western countries, which viewed Western civilization as more "advanced" than others, and thus one that should be embraced by all countries - through use of force if necessary. In the process many civilizations have been lost or are facing crisis of survival. However, since this view has been proved wrong in history and reality, Western hegemony has reached its peak. There is now a global movement for the modernization and revival of civilizations. A growing understanding that all civilizations are equal in value, each has its own merits and shortcomings. None is perfect or superior. This is the situation at the beginning of the 21st century and it represents a new historical turning point. Modernization of human civilization began in Western Europe with the revolutions in science and technology and the revolution in France. And the course of modernization that has now begun is the revival of the diversity of civilizations, in which non-Western countries can learn from the West and catch up, while presenting their own strengths for Western countries to learn from. The history of human civilizations tells us that every civilization needs to evolve by advancing with the times. There are different approaches to modernization, even within a civilization as shown by Western countries. For the United Kingdom, it came through gradual reforms; for France, revolutionary violence; for Germany, top-down changes; and for the United States, the struggle for independence. And even within the same country, there can be different cultures, thus making diversity a normal characteristic of civilization. Such a reality is evident even in Western countries, but the diversity in the non-Western regions is more apparent with the surging tide of modernization. Now, as can be readily seen, every country has its own characteristics in the process of modernization, regardless of where it is along the path. We see that influential leaders play important roles in their own countries' modernization: Mahatma Gandhi's nonviolent and non-cooperative movement, Fidel Castro's Cuban revolution, Gamal Abdel Nasser's Arab socialism, and Nelson Mandela's struggle against the apartheid system in South Africa. Their roles have all contributed to their countries' characteristics of modernization. However, none of these successes are replicable. A stereotypical framing of civilization is not only impossible, but also very harmful. As President Xi Jinping pointed out when summarizing these historical facts: "It is only an unrealistic fantasy to attempt to establish a single civilization to dominate the world." But the Western theory in the name of "globalism" favors unity over diversity. Francis Fukuyama's famous bon mot about the end of history was in fact a supposition that had long existed, for it was already in the logic of Hegel. The difference being that for Hegel, Prussian civilization was the end, for Fukuyama, it was the civilization of the United States. Does the diversity of civilizations mean that there must be conflicts, and that these conflicts must be a matter of life and death? Why can't it be, as the ancient Chinese philosophers said: "One begets two, two begets three, and three begets all things?" Or as the Chinese proverbs goes: "Harmony generates wealth" and "harmony is supreme"? The Chinese view of human civilization is "we should act like the sea taking in all rivers". As Xi said in his keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations: "All civilizations are rooted in their unique cultural environment. Each embodies the wisdom and vision of a country or nation, and each is valuable for being uniquely its own." Civilizations vary from each other, just as humans are different in terms of skin color and the language used. No civilization is superior to others. To believe that one's own race and civilization is above others is foolish. If everyone looked and thought the same the world would indeed be a dull place to live in. Likewise, it would be less interesting with one homogenous civilization. The modern world can accommodate different civilizations which, in turn, creates a more diverse and vibrant world. It is through more than 100 years of modernization that many ancient civilizations have revived. They have restored their self-confidence and found their own identities. The unequal relationship between civilizations that were once distorted by Western hegemony is now being redressed. It is not as the US political scientist Samuel P. Huntington sees it as the "clash of civilizations", but it is rather "the return of civilization". "Return" means that the diversity of civilizations is restored, and so is their equal relations. It also means that people are thinking more about the modern meaning of ancient civilizations and using traditional wisdom to solve modern problems, such as the problems in the relations between humans and nature, morality and interests, individuals and groups, freedom and discipline. In this ever-changing world, only by relying on the joint efforts of all civilizations can we solve the common problems of mankind. The 21st century is new, and we are opening an era in which all civilizations will coexist and humans will prosper as a whole. After all, we all live on the same planet, and only common prosperity can ensure a shared future for mankind. Facing new opportunities and challenges, we should see that a human community with a shared future is not only our common responsibility but also our ideal.

                    Anti-apartheid musician Clegg dies in South Africa
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                JOHANNESBURG－Johnny Clegg, a South African musician who performed in defiance of racial barriers imposed under the country's apartheid system and celebrated its new democracy under Nelson Mandela, died on Tuesday. He was 66 and had pancreatic cancer.The Grammy-nominated singer sometimes called the "White Zulu" died peacefully at home in Johannesburg with his family, according to Clegg's manager, Roddy Quin."He fought it to the last second," Quin told the South African Broadcasting Corporation.Clegg's multiracial bands during South Africa's white minority rule attracted an international following. He crafted hits inspired by Zulu and township harmonies, as well as folk music and other influences.South Africa's government said in a statement: "His music had the ability to unite people across the races. … Clegg has made an indelible mark in the music industry and the hearts of the people."One of his best-known songs was Asimbonanga, which means "We've never seen him" in Zulu. It refers to South Africans during apartheid when images of the then-imprisoned Mandela were banned. Mandela was released in 1990 after 27 years in prison and became South Africa's first black president in allrace elections four years later.Political opposition leader Mmusi Maimane said Clegg "wrote our SA story when our country was at its worst and at its best".The Grammy-winning Soweto Gospel Choir said it was "devastated" by Clegg's death and called him a "music icon and a true South African". Fellow musicians posted similar tributes on social media.Clegg was born in England, the child of an Englishman and a jazz singer from Zimbabwe (then Southern Rhodesia). He learned about Zulu music and dancing as a teenager when he hung out with a Zulu cleaner and street musician called Charlie Mzila. He later explored his idea of "crossover" music with the multiracial bands Juluka and Savuka at a time of bitter conflict in South Africa over the country's white minority rule.Clegg recorded songs he was arrested for and "never gave in to the pressure of the apartheid rules", his manager said.The apartheid-era censorship also restricted where he could perform, yet Clegg "impacted millions of people around the world", Quin said. "He played a major role in South Africa getting people to learn about other people's cultures and bringing people together."The musician performed as late as 2017, high-kicking and stomping during a tour called The Final Journey while his cancer was in remission.He had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2015.

                    Hong Kong grapples with its own, new Pandora’s Box
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The myths of ancient Greece are so potent that thousands of years after they first circulated, they are still known today and are familiar even to Hong Kong schoolchildren. Such is the story of the Pandora’s Box, and the girl who couldn’t resist the temptation of opening it despite expressing instructions not to do so, only to find that she had unleashed upon the world every kind of trouble and unhappiness. It takes little imagination to believe that this is what has happened in Hong Kong.Yuen Long in the northwest New Territories was, not so long ago, best known to Hong Kong people as the home of “wife cakes”, a favorite delicacy. In fact, it is a fascinating area with more complexities than that. Indigenous residents are proudly aware of their long history preserved in ancestral halls that are hundreds of years old, as well as ancient walled villages. This was the only part of Hong Kong that militarily resisted British colonization in a brief war in which the villagers were inevitably outgunned. Even so, their traditions were more important to them than the artificial new line dividing the Chinese mainland from Hong Kong and the chaos of World War II, the Japanese occupation, and the consequent lawlessness that allowed this area to re-establish its own way of doing things. More recently, its rural character was profoundly affected by the development of new towns and the Small House Policy, both of which added to the wealth of the district and of individuals.The characteristics of clannishness and suspicion of outsiders have, however, not been obliterated. It all makes for a powerful brew of a very special culture, some of which was captured in the local film Overheard 3. Equally interesting in a different way is the Fujian settlement at the eastern end of Hong Kong Island. In older times, there were more of these clusters of people from the same part of China, naturally gravitating toward others who spoke the same dialect. This particularly cohesive group successfully lobbied for old-age welfare benefits to be accessible to them even after a move back to their home province on the mainland, so strong is their identification with Fujian. These two groups, in very different corners of Hong Kong, used to be simply part of the rich mosaic of our community. Now, since the Pandora’s Box was opened by the confrontations over the extradition proposals, they stand accused of aggression toward the demonstrators.The fact of the matter is that human beings love violence. If we were honest, most of us would have to admit that we like to counter life’s frustrations with punches, swearing and worse. Much of what we consider civilized society is an attempt to put a lid on that particular variant of the Pandora’s Box, constraining ourselves to accept the referee’s decision in all sorts of activities and restraining the powerful from lashing out just because they can. What happens when those restraints are removed? We have seen the effects over the last couple of months: plenty of injuries; a measurable rise in mental distress, even implicated in suicides; the trashing of property; and estrangement and alienation between family members and different groups. Anarchy is a bit like getting drunk: The first few drafts are delicious, but the hangover and the realization of the damage that has been done are horrible. It is also a trap. Once begun, with two sides pitched against each other, it becomes almost impossible to step down, only much easier, even if in reality more painful, to continue a cycle of retaliation until all is laid waste.If Hong Kong schoolchildren know the story of Pandora’s Box, then they also know how it ended: When everything seemed completely disastrous, a tiny creature that had been overlooked emerged from the maligned box. This was Hope. Hong Kong has always been rather a hopeful place, its population’s roots including many who were willing to take chances and run risks to make a better life for themselves and their families. Even now, groups and individuals are actively talking and thinking about how to find a constructive way forward and away from the current crisis.One of the most lauded historical events of the 20th century was the peaceful end of apartheid in South Africa, achieved without violence despite the years of hatred and oppression that had gone before. Nelson Mandela was acclaimed as a hero for his part, but the role of F.W. de Klerk, the then-president of South Africa, is sometimes given insufficient credit. An establishment figure all his life, he had to demonstrate graciousness and wisdom to negotiate with a former enemy in order to achieve the greater good for his country. Where are Hong Kong’s figures of comparable stature who will allow us to believe in Hope now?The author is a co-host of RTHK’s Back-Chat radio program and supporter of various welfare NGOs.
