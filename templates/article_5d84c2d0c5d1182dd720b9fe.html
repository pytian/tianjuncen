                Azerbaijan gears up to attract Chinese tourists with diverse offerings
            </a>
            <p>
                The Azerbaijan Tourism Board, the national promotional body established under the State Tourism Agency of the Republic of Azerbaijan, is now carrying out its first-ever promotional campaign in China to showcase the country's diverse tourism offerings to prospective Chinese travelers.During an event in Beijing on Friday, the Azerbaijan Tourism Board signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Ctrip and Qyer, which are both popular online travel providers in China, to establish a cooperative partnership in the development of travel products targeting the Chinese market.As an Asian country with a Western outlook, Azerbaijan boasts an exceptional combination of antiquity and novelty. From Baku’s modern Flame Towers to the medieval UNESCO World Heritage Site, the wide-ranging tourism resources in Azerbaijan can satisfy even the most discerning travelers."China has a huge potential for outbound tourism. In 2018, we only had 13,000 visitors from China, but by the end of August this year, we've already received 17,000 Chinese tourists, so the trend is on the rise", said Florian Sengstschmid, CEO of the Azerbaijan Tourism Board, in an interview with China Daily Website.In view of the significance of China as a vital international market, specific measures are rolled out to attract more Chinese visitors. Azerbaijan recently implemented a simplified electronic visa procedure, and besides applying for visas online, Chinese tourists also can obtain visas upon arrival.Speaking of the role tourism plays in facilitating people-to-people exchanges between cultures, Sengstschmid contends that tourism is the most important tool in promoting mutual understandings between people."We have political borders, but when you look at natural wonders, you will realize that there is only one planet, that is what connect us and tourism can contribute a lot to peaceful exchanges between countries", he said.The promotional campaign conducted by the Azerbaijan Tourism Board began Monday and ends Saturday in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing.

                China to play important role in meeting climate challenges: report
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW YORK - China would play an important role as the climate challenge looms, a report published this month shows.Named Guide to Chinese Climate Policy 2019 and authored by David Sandalow, an inaugural fellow at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, the report examines Chinese carbon dioxide emissions, domestic and foreign policies regarding climate change in 2018.It says that China has already played an important role in bringing down dramatically the cost of solar power and engaged in making electric vehicles. In 2018, China led the world in deployment of renewable energy, electric vehicles and nuclear power plants."The way China integrates climate change into economic development has the potential to be a model for many countries around the world" as many countries would like to emulate China's economic miracle with eyes closely on its development model, according to the report.At a panel discussion on Wednesday evening marking the release of the report, Sandalow said it is exciting to see China's announcement of the green projects at the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in April.
