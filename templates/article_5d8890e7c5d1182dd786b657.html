                Keynote Speech by H.E. Ambassador Liu Xiaoming at the CCCUK 2019 Annual Conference
            </p>
            <p>
                Keynote Speech by H.E. Ambassador Liu Xiaoming at the CCCUK 2019 Annual Conference: Build a Platform for Open CooperationGuildhall, City of London, 26 June 2019Chairman Fang Wenjian,Director General Mark Slaughter,Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles,Sir Martin Davidson,My Lords and MPs,Entrepreneurs,Ladies and Gentlemen:Good evening!It is a real delight to join you at the CCCUK 2019 Annual Conference.This is my second CCCUK event today. What is more, this is the first time that I made two speeches to one organization in one day. From your heated discussions on cooperation, I can sense your passion for entrepreneurship and confidence in the prospect of China-UK trade and economic cooperation.Since it was founded in 2001, CCCUK has worked actively to provide services to Chinese companies in the UK and promote China-UK trade and economic cooperation. Its vigorous efforts have made CCCUK an important platform:First, it is a platform for mutually-beneficial trade and economic cooperation between China and the UK.In recent years, CCCUK has worked closely with the British Government and other chambers of commerce here in the UK to host large business events attended by ministerial-level and even higher-level officials.During the tenth China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue concluded a few days ago, CCCUK hosted the China-UK Business Dinner in cooperation with CBBC and the 48 Group Club. The event brought business leaders from both countries together for discussions on mutually-beneficial cooperation. It was an excellent demonstration of the main theme of China-UK relations, that is, win-win cooperation.Second, CCCUK is a platform for policy communication.CCCUK has been an effective bridge of communication between Chinese companies in the UK and the British government departments. This has helped foster a fair, transparent and friendly business environment for Chinese companies.Last April, CCCUK hosted the "Chinese Investment in the UK" Symposium with the Department for International Trade. Participants had a candid and productive exchange of views on how to address the complex and volatile economic situation and deepen China-UK cooperation on investment. The Symposium was a great success.Third, CCCUK is a service platform for Chinese companies in the UK.The services CCCUK provides are diversified. In the past year alone, CCCUK hosted more than 30 exchange and training events to encourage Chinese companies to operate in accordance with the rules and contribute to the economic and social progress of the local community.CCCUK has also encouraged Chinese and British companies to enhance cooperation on charity works. This has produced a number of highlights in cultural and charity cooperation. One example of these efforts is the China-UK Charity Initiative jointly launched by the Lord Mayor of the City of London and CCCUK at the end of last year.Ladies and Gentlemen:This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. It is also the 65th anniversary of the establishment of China-UK diplomatic relationship at the level of chargé d'affaires.In the past 70 years, China has achieved remarkable success in its development. It has now entered a new historical stage. China and the rest of the world have become so interdependent that they are actually part of one and the same community with a shared future.In the past 65 years, China-UK relations have gone through an extraordinary journey. Today, this relationship is heading towards a more practical, inclusive and win-win future.Amid surging unilateralism and protectionism, I am confident that CCCUK will continue to uphold the principles of "Openness, Cooperation and Mutual Benefit". I am sure you will continue to encourage Chinese and British companies to engage in cooperation, share opportunities and work together to address challenges.Today I would like to share with you my three hopes for CCCUK.First, I hope you will be an advocate of China's reform and opening up.Going forward, China will take a number of important reform and opening up measures to strengthen institutional and systematic arrangements and carry out opening up at a higher level. This will create an enormous market and huge business opportunities for all the countries in the world, including the UK.I hope that CCCUK would be a leader of open cooperation, share the stories of China's reform and opening up with more people, and help them understand the opportunities created by China's development. This will help engage more Chinese and British companies in win-win cooperation.Second, I hope you would be a pioneer for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).During the tenth China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue, our two sides signed an MOU on third market cooperation. This will give new impetus to China-UK cooperation on BRI.I hope that CCCUK would seize this opportunity to help China and the UK to move one step further in the cooperation on international rule and standard-setting, green finance and risk management, and in third market.Third, I hope you would act as a facilitator of mutual learning between civilisations.President Xi Jinping said, "Civilizations differ, just as human beings are different only in terms of skin color and the language used. No civilization is superior over the others."It is important that people treat each other as equals and respect each other. It is important that we discard arrogance and prejudice. This is the only way to ensure that different civilisations achieve common progress through exchanges and mutual learning.I hope that CCCUK would enhance communication and exchanges with people from all walks of life here in Britain, encourage Chinese companies to take up corporate responsibility, enhance understanding between our two countries, and deepen friendship between the Chinese and British people. This will be your contribution to enhancing mutual learning between the Eastern and Western civilisations.Ladies and Gentlemen:As a Chinese saying goes, the flames rise high when everybody adds firewood.Chinese companies in the UK have been a driving force for China-UK relations. CCCUK has served as a bond and bridge for China-UK cooperation.I sincerely wish CCCUK more progress and greater success. I am sure you will contribute more "golden fruits" to the China-UK "Golden Era"!Thank you!
