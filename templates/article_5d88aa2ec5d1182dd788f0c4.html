                Washington and Ankara begin joint patrols in Syria
            </p>
            <p>
                AKKALE, Turkey - The United States and Turkey on Sunday began their joint patrols in northeastern Syria, aimed at easing tensions between Ankara and US-backed Kurdish forces who battled the Islamic State extremist group.Six Turkish armored vehicles crossed the border to join US forces in Syria for their first joint patrol under a deal reached between Washington and Ankara, Agence France-Presse reported.Two helicopters flew over the area as the Turkish vehicles drove through an opening in the concrete wall separating the two countries.They then headed west with the same number of US vehicles, along with an ambulance and a pickup before crossing back into Turkey.The Turkish Defense Ministry said drones were also deployed.The agreement reached on Aug 7 aims to establish a "safe zone" between the Turkish border and the Syrian areas east of the Euphrates River controlled by the Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG.Syrian Kurdish forces began withdrawing from along the Turkish border in late August.The patrol allowed Turkish forces to observe "firsthand progress on destroyed YPG fortifications and areas where YPG elements voluntarily departed the area", said Colonel Myles Caggins, spokesman for the US-led coalition against the IS group.The YPG forms the backbone of the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF - a key partner of Washington in the fight against IS extremists in Syria.But Ankara sees the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which is outlawed in Turkey.The PKK, which has waged an insurgency against the Turkish government since 1984, is blacklisted as a terrorist group by Ankara, the US and the European Union.Washington's support for the SDF has been a major point of friction with fellow NATO member Turkey.Caggins said the patrol demonstrated the coalition's "continued commitment to address Turkey's legitimate security concerns, while also allowing the coalition and our SDF partners to remain focused on achieving the enduring defeat" of the IS group.Sunday's patrol drew sharp criticism from Damascus, which labeled it a flagrant "aggression" that seeks to prolong Syria's war.It also reiterated its "absolute rejection" of the planned safe zone, calling it a violation of Syria's sovereignty.The Turkish Defense Ministry said on Sunday the joint patrols were "ongoing as planned without any delay to destroy terrorist shelters, to collect their heavy weapons, (and) to ensure necessary conditions for withdrawal and the future return of our Syrians brothers and sisters to the area".Agence France-Presse

                French, Russian foreign ministers discuss post-INF Treaty era
            </a>
            <p>
                French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov held a meeting in Moscow on Monday, discussing Washington's exit from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and the rebuilding of relations between Russia and the European Union.The two foreign ministers discussed the situation in the sphere of strategic stability after the withdrawal of the United States from the treaty, while Russia expressed the serious concern over a possible arms race."The withdrawal of the US from the INF Treaty provided a possibility of an arms race in outer space", Lavrov said.Lavrov pledged that Russia will not deploy any intermediate-range missile systems in those regions where such systems from the US are not deployed."Our position on that matter is well known. It has regularly been reiterated by Russian President Vladimir Putin," he said.Putin earlier claimed Russia will make missiles previously outlawed under the INF Treaty, but it will not be the first to deploy them.According to Lavrov, the Russian side has already invited the NATO countries to negotiate on the post-INF matter, but Russia's Tass News Agency said "NATO is refraining from any concrete reaction".The two foreign ministers met during the Russian-French Security Cooperation Council. The meeting was organized in the 2+2 format, in which the defense ministers from the two countries also met.These annual meetings were suspended after Russia incorporated Crimea in 2014 following a popular referendum, which Western countries never recognized. The EU imposed the sanctions over Moscow in the same year, according to Xinhua News Agency."The time has come, the time is right, to work toward reducing the distrust between Russia and Europe, who ought to be partners on a strategic and economic level," Le Drian said."It's not yet the time to lift sanctions," he said. But he noted that there is a "window of opportunity, an opening for calming down the situation".Reuters reported that France is willing to help remove the sanctions to Russia even if Europe and the Kremlin have sharp differences over matters including Iran, the Syrian conflict and Ukraine.But French diplomatic overture to Russia is likely to create tensions with some other EU countries."Our divisions hurt our shared interests," Le Drian added, telling Lavrov that Russia should play its part."This dialogue will only be productive if it is reciprocated and produces tangible, concrete results," he said.
