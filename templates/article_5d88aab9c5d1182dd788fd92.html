                Huawei trains Nigerian civil servants to promote e-governance
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                A total of 935 Nigerian civil servants had undergone a training program on information and communications technology by Chinese technology giant HuaweiABUJA -- Cooperation between China and Nigeria has yielded a positive result further, following the graduation of a total of 935 Nigerian civil servants who had undergone a training program on information and communications technology (ICT) by Chinese technology giant Huawei.The training, tagged "ICT for Change", commenced in January and ended in June, was held in 19 batches. It aimed at training Nigerian civil servants on core ICT capacity and boost e-governance in the country.The participants were drawn from various federal ministries, departments, and agencies, following a memorandum of understanding signed last October by the Nigerian government and Huawei Technologies Company Nigeria Limited.Boss Mustapha, the secretary to the government of the federation, described the initiative as one which signifies a further collaboration between government and private sector organizations in Nigeria.He said the training programme supports the area of automation of civil service processes while limiting bureaucratic procedures to ensure effective and efficient service delivery."This gesture is highly commendable and we look forward to more of such programmes that seek to compliment Federal Government's commitment to deliver good governance," Mustapha said.The minister of communications Ali Isa Pantami said the training program became necessary for civil servants to improve their ICT skills in order to face the challenges ahead.According to Patanmi, who is also an ICT expert, nothing can be achieved in governance if the capacity of civil servants is not being developed."That is why this training is key and we are making efforts to make sure that we lift millions of Nigerians from poverty. One of the easiest ways to do this is through ICT capacity building," he said.Speaking to Xinhua at the graduation ceremony, some of the participants at the training program said they were proud to be among civil servants who will pioneer and make effective Nigeria's digitalization goal of phasing out the use of paper in the future and adopt the digital means of processing data, as Nigeria aspires to become a smart country.With the ever-widening spread and the adoption of ICT across the globe, civil service everywhere is confronted with more and more ICT-related challenges in formulating and implementing policies, said Zhou Pingjian, the Chinese ambassador to Nigeria.Zhou noted the efforts made by the Nigerian government in partnering with Huawei to enhance ICT capacity-building for civil servants, is one of the eight major initiatives to boost China-Africa cooperation announced at the Beijing Summit of the Forum On China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) held last September.China remains committed to enhancing exchanges and cooperation between competent authorities between the two countries, sharing good practice in each other's ICT development, the envoy added.

                    Nigeria's police and army clash, president orders probe
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Muhammadu Buhari, the president of Nigeria, has ordered Defence Headquarters to set up a special committee to investigate a clash between the army and police that took place on Wednesday evening in Ibi, Taraba which led to the deaths of three police officers and a civilian.The soldiers opened fire at an undercover police team taking a man believed to be a kidnapping suspect to headquarters. The handcuffed kidnap suspect was set free by the soldiers and is now on the run.Sagir Musa, acting director of Army Public Relations, said the unfortunate incident happened because the soldiers mistook the undercover police for kidnappers.Musa said in a statement they were responding to a distress call to rescue a kidnapped victim when they clashed with the police team."The suspected kidnappers refused to stop when they were halted by troops at three consecutive checkpoints, prompting a hot pursuit. It was in this process that the suspected kidnappers who were obviously armed, opened fire at the troops sporadically thus prompting them to return fire," he said.The police force has demanded justice for the killing of their colleagues, who they said were on legitimate criminal investigation activities to arrest Alhaji Hamisu, who has been indicted in a series of high-profile kidnapping incidents in Taraba.In a statement signed by Frank Mba, public relations officer of the police force and posted on the social media, the police claimed that they identified themselves to the soldiers.The police are demanding answers from the soldiers on the whereabouts of Hamisu. "Hamisu is a millionaire kidnapper arrested by the police but paradoxically treated as a 'kidnap victim' by the soldiers and subsequently 'rescued' by them. Where is he? Where is the rescued kidnapper?" the statement read.The police are also demanding to know the source of the alleged distress report, or identity of the complainant.Speaking to State House correspondents on Thursday while briefing them on the outcome of Thursday's national Security Council meeting, Sadique Abubakar, chief of Air Staff, assured Nigerians of their safety."We want to assure Nigerians the armed forces and other security agencies will continue to work to ensure the security of Nigerians and no individual or a group of individuals undermines the integrity and sovereignty of Nigeria," he said.

                    How my China experience changed my life
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Before coming to China 10 months ago, I knew nothing much about China. My little knowledge was through television programs and lectures on community medicine in which China played a key role in ancient medicine. Previously, in my local community where I lived with my grandmother, I only knew China as a nation in East Asia with its popular movie actor, Jackie Chan. Having a history teacher as an uncle motivated me to read and study the histories of nations, and Chinese history captured my heart. With that said, after studying Chinese history I would strongly say that China is a reflection of light to nations of the world that have lost faith in themselves, particularly African nations.My aim of coming to China was to study in the MBBS program at Hainan Medical University and acquire skills that will make me useful when I go back to Nigeria. Furthermore, developing my spoken Chinese language skills from my Chinese friends and listening to Chinese folktales truly touches my heart to love and embrace Chinese culture with so much diversity. Spreading the history and showing respect to the national flag has made the Chinese people so patriotic.I understand in China that agriculture is a vital industry not just for rural people alone; this sector employs over three hundred million farmers, as well as feeding the nation at large. The agricultural sector has a great impact on the economy of China.As a result, my stay in China has taught me that food is an important medicine to the body. Back in Nigeria I never had such understanding until I came to China and observed that the Chinese did not eat just to get satisfied, but eat to be healthy. They serve their dishes based on the seasons and most times add vegetables to their meals to strengthen their immune systems. China has a long history of medicine. China promotes its traditional medicine by packaging, which adds value and a modern look to the herbs. This has shown the world the importance of traditional herbs, especially in Africa.Frankly speaking, access to university education is more difficult in most parts of the world than in China. Access to a good education is a top priority to the Chinese government, which is the reason for the evident reduction in illiteracy rates and high increase in human resources with higher educational qualifications. Chinese education is affordable for international students compared to other countries, such as in Europe and the USA. Personally, China has a great impact on my academics. Studying in this nation has changed my way of reasoning, which proves that the system of education in China does not only teach academic works but also shows ways to be disciplined, strong and wise. I once lost hope in my studies but my "laoshi" made an inspiring statement in class: "We Chinese are not the strongest, neither are we the weakest but we are not too weak to be bullied, our actions speak for our bravery", and these words gave me the courage to push on.Looking back to my 10 months in China, I can say it has opened my mind to novel ways of seeing the world. It has been a time of growth and maturity for both my mind and character; above all, it has been the most thrilling, inspiring and fulfilling years of my life. I truly believe China has a lot to teach the world at large when it comes to good governance, stability in the economy and achieving goals within a short time, with unity as a key point.China as an independent nation has proven to developing nations what being independent means. As such, China is a good example to reckon with in terms of being self-reliant, unlike African countries which claim to be independent and are still indirectly dependent on Western imperialism. In summary, China is a sea that salts waters that flows into it; all nations should embrace China's success through the BRI Program.I will conclude by saying my 10 months of studying in China have taught me dreams can come to pass; and when shared hardship forges bonds of unbreakable loyalty and understanding, it can turn into wealth creation and redefine a nation.The author is a Nigerian student studying at Hainan Medical University, in South China's Hainan province.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                    Wig sales aid growth of Henan companies
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Miriam Ginika, a businesswoman in Lagos, Nigeria, doesn't braid or weave her hair. To allow her to change hairstyles as often as she likes, Ginika, 45, has worn wigs for the past two decades."I don't wear wigs because of any hair problem, I do it for fashion and convenience," she said.Ginika said wigs are convenient and "cool", and that her favorites are curly black or dark brown.The Nigerian is one of an increasing number of consumers worldwide wearing wigs made by Chinese producers, many of which can be traced to Xuchang, a city in Central China's Henan province.Nonetheless, when Zheng Gaowei, who has been collecting human hair for a living for the past decade, returns home to Xuchang's Xiaogong village with several bags of hair, he is worried by the growing number of people he sees in beauty salons with shorter hairstyles or using dyes."Very few people leave their hair long now," he said.Zheng, 40, said that "naturally colored, less oily" wigs are the most sought-after, but coming across those "is really rare these days".Xiaogong village, which has many small workshops where hair is processed for wigs, forms an important part of the economy of Xuchang, a city known as a wig-making hub where locals have collected hair for the industry since the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).Wig companies in Xuchang account for up to half of China's hair product exports. The total output value of the city's hair products hit 23.6 billion yuan ($3.34 billion) in 2018 alone, according to the local commerce bureau.However, while more than 350 households in Xiaogong were involved in the hair industry at its peak, fewer than 100 are involved now, Zheng said."Very few young people are in this line now and they don't want to stay in the village," Zheng said. "We're left with old people, about 50 to 70 years old, in the trade."Zheng said he also travels around the country for work, going as far as Yunnan and Guizhou provinces in the south."Running around looking for hair is tough work, and whether you can get good material really depends on luck," said Zheng, who added that he can make about 10,000 yuan ($1,400) a month.Wig-making has also been a business for centuries in Xuchang's Quandian village after German merchants discovered how hair of residents there was "straight with a healthy sheen", said Zhang Tianyou, vice-president of major wigmaker Henan Rebecca Hair Products. Foreigners began to trade embroidery needles and forks for the material, and street peddlers calling out for residents' hair soon became a common sight in the village, Zhang said.Henan Rebecca Hair Products, after nearly three decades in the business, now supplies stores in more than 40 countries and regions in North America, Europe, Asia and Africa, Zhang said.The company had set up about 20 directly operated stores in the United States for high-end consumers before the US began imposing additional tariffs on imports from China, but it does not expect to be significantly hit by the trade friction, Zhang said."Even if we are faced with increasing challenges, we believe in the opportunities offered by the market," he said.The company initially focused on the domestic market, but as business became brisk, it began looking overseas and opened a wholly-owned factory in Nigeria in 2003, becoming the first Chinese wig producer on the continent, Zhang said.To satisfy the growing demand and localize its manufacturing processes, Henan Rebecca Hair Products also set up its own company in Nigeria and Ghana, said Zheng Wenqing, the company's general manager."The localization of our manufacturing processes is a priority. It can help better satisfy local demand as well as reduce costs," she said, adding that the company's reach now includes western, southern and eastern Africa.Nigeria is biggest marketGodwin Ezeigbo, the marketing manager of Rebecca Fashion Ltd in Lagos, said the company's products have been well received in the African market due to their quality and affordability.Although it has clients in such African countries as Benin, South Africa, Ghana and Kenya, the company's biggest market is Nigeria, he said."Both synthetic and human hair wigs are doing well in the Nigerian market," he said. "The sales of human hair are, however, higher than synthetic wigs, because they offer the most natural look and feel. They are also more durable than synthetic wigs."Longer hairstyles are generally more popular, but in warmer weather the shorter ones sell well, he said. Ezeigbo said demand was low during the recent prolonged rains in Lagos, but he expected sales to pick up in September. December is another peak time due to festivities held then, he added.Meanwhile, hair products from Xuchang are also top-selling items on e-commerce giant Alibaba's shopping portal, maintaining a growth rate of more than 400 percent in the wig trade alone for two consecutive years and ranking third among the most traded commodities, said Li Xiaomin, chief of the foreign trade administration section of Xuchang's commerce bureau.Online customers also prefer more personalized wigs compared with customers of traditional sales channels, said Zhang Huiting, general manager of the hair company's e-commerce department.In countries like Nigeria, Ghana and Tanzania, the company's major brands, Noble, Magic and Fashion Idol, which feature popular synthetic hair products, are "perfectly aimed at being stylish and trendy with modest prices", Zhang said.The China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative is also set to help fuel growth in the industry, boosting market and demand, she said.The rise of e-commerce has dramatically changed the industrial chain, said Wu Li, president of Xuchang Fuxin Hair Products Co, who arrived in Xuchang from Hong Kong in 2003. Wu said her company has been involved in cross-border e-commerce for nearly five years.E-commerce has prompted companies to consider the needs of consumers more effectively and connect producers more closely with customers, Wu said.Sun Weifeng, 27, who is in charge of the AliExpress global retail section of Wu's company, said getting positive feedback from customers in English has been very encouraging.In Serbia, the owner of the popular Koko Hair Studio, who prefers to be known simply as Ivana, praised the quality of Rebecca Fashion's Sleek line of wigs and said an increasing number of people are buying the wigs."I found Sleek through the internet and decided to try their products first. Then I saw how high the quality of their products is," she said.Sleek wigs offer high-quality lace and middle sections and, most important, hair material that provides natural-looking styles and soft textures, she said."Our consumers include both men and women. Some of them want longer and thicker hair just for beauty, while others unfortunately may have health problems that may make them lose their hair," she said.She said her customers range in age from 14 to 70, and that she sells from 150 to 200 wigs each month.In Xiaogong, villager Zheng Gaowei has come to realize that the era of collecting real human hair for the wig industry is on the wane. Facing that reality, Henan Rebecca Hair Products has been moving its upstream supply chain to other areas such as India, as well as focusing on synthetic fiber, the other major raw material for wigs.The company is gearing up to improve the technology behind the material, said Zhang Shaoying, manager of the company's synthetic hair production base.Challenges remainBefore 2008, the group mainly imported fiber products from Japan and South Korea, Zhang said. But it now makes its own fiber material, with nearly 200 stores helping to promote its latest products in first－and second-tier cities across China, Zhang said.Despite progress, businesses said there are many challenges to the industry's continued growth.One of the biggest challenges in the Chinese market is convincing consumers that wearing wigs is fashionable "and not just something for people who experience baldness or actors who need to play roles", said Wang Shixin, director of the technology center at Henan Rebecca Hair Products Inc."In terms of the Chinese market, it is a sunrise industry," Wang said. "The demand for this fashion will increase as people's living standards improve."Alexis Hooi contributed to this story.

                YAOUNDE -- No Chinese nationals were among the foreign sailors abducted off Cameroon, according to the Chinese embassy to Cameroon, contrarily to an early report by some media speaking of 9 Chinese hostages.According to cross-checked information obtained by the Chinese embassy on Friday, unknown gunmen attacked two foreign cargos in Cameroon waters at 11:10 pm Wednesday local time, and kidnapped a dozen of sailors, none of them were Chinese.The attack took place off the southern Cameroonian port city of Douala by "likely Nigerian pirates", a Cameroonian Navy source told Xinhua. Earlier on Friday, AFP quoted a Douala official as saying that a total of 17 people had been abducted, including "nine Chinese civilian sailors"."The Cameroon navy is conducting a thorough search and rescue mission to secure the safe release of those kidnapped," a senior official of Douala Port Authority, who asked not to be named, told Xinhua.
