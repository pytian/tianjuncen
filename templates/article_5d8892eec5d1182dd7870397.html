            <p class="style-content">
                The education supervision office under the State Council, China's Cabinet, has issued an urgent circular asking education authorities, kindergartens, and elementary and secondary schools across the country to strengthen campus safety measures after eight students were killed at a primary school in Hubei province on Sept 2.The circular, issued on Tuesday night, asked local education authorities to work with public security and market regulation authorities to inspect and eliminate campus safety hazards, focusing on the implementation of safety management policies and safety hazards at campus surroundings, school buses, campus facilities and activity venues.Local education authorities should make sure that schools are equipped with sufficient security staff and necessary protective equipment. Security staff should better fulfill their duties and prevent hazardous materials or irrelevant personnel from entering the campus, the circular said, adding that unqualified security staff should be fired and replaced.School surveillance systems should be connected with public security bureaus, and the schools should improve their police alarm systems, it said.Education authorities and schools were also asked to boost safety education and drills to improve students' survival skills.The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Public Security on Wednesday held a video conference asking all levels of education officials and school principals to make the safety of students and teachers their top priority.Everyone should be aware of their responsibilities and how to fulfill them to ensure school safety, the ministries said.In addition, schools should increase the salaries of their security staff, provide more training and hire more retired soldiers and young people as security guards, they said.On Sept 2, the first day of school, an attacker killed eight students and injured two others at a primary school in Enshi Tujia and Miao autonomous prefecture, Hubei province, local police said on Tuesday.The injured students from Chaoyangpo Primary School in Enshi's Baiyangping town were receiving treatment at a hospital, Enshi police said in a statement.The suspect is a 40-year-old man surnamed Yu, who is in custody and being investigated. The statement did not specify how the students were injured by the suspect nor the motive for the attack.In recent years, China has seen a number of attacks on school children on campus.Twenty pupils at a Beijing primary school were wounded in January in a hammer attack that police said had left three seriously injured.The 49-year-old male suspect surnamed Jia, who was a former repair worker at the school, was detained by police.In June last year, two children were stabbed to death by a man named Huang Yichuan outside an elementary school in Shanghai. Huang was sentenced to death by a court in May.

                    Former Didi driver executed for rape, murder
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                Zhong Yuan, a Didi driver who raped and killed a 19-year-old female passenger in Wenzhou, Zhejiang province, last year, was executed by a court on Friday after China's top court approved his death penalty.The Wenzhou Intermediate People's Court announced the decision made by the Supreme People's Court on Zhong's case and then executed him under the supervision of prosecutors.Before the execution, Zhong was allowed by the court to meet his family members.The 28-year-old native of Sichuan province had debts from online gambling and planned on robbing his female taxi passengers, the court said. Zhong, who worked as a driver for Didi, the country's largest ride-hailing company, had prepared tools for the robberies including knives, masks and adhesive tape.On Aug 23, last year, he unsuccessfully tried to rob a female passenger surnamed Lin. The next day, he raped and stabbed to death a 19-year-old female passenger surnamed Zhao in Yueqing county, Wenzhou. He dumped her body on the slope of a cliff near the highway.The case stirred a public outcry and triggered a nationwide safety check of drivers working in the online ride-hailing industry. It also prompted the Ministry of Transport to announce plans to tighten regulation of the industry.On Feb 1, Zhong was handed the death penalty and fined 25,000 yuan ($3,500) by the Wenzhou court after being found guilty of robbery, rape and intentional homicide. The Zhejiang High People's Court later upheld the judgment.Under the Chinese Criminal Procedure Law, any death penalty made by a lower court must be submitted to the SPC for review before execution.On Friday, the top court said in a statement that Zhong should be heavily penalized, as his behavior was extremely cruel."The ruling made by the court in Wenzhou was based on sufficient evidence and clear facts," it said. "The application of the law and the sentence given by the court were also correct and reasonable."

            <p class="style-content">
                The Junior Police Officers’ Association of the Hong Kong Police Force condemned the stabbing of an off-duty police officer by three black-clad protestors on Friday night.No Hong Kong residents will tolerate such an act, as the attackers wanted to seriously wound the police officer and have committed a serious crime, the association said in a statement on Saturday.The stabbing – several times – of the officer was also condemned by prominent figures in Hong Kong on Saturday.The officer was attacked by three men in Kwai Chung, New Territories, late on Friday night. He suffered several knife wounds to his back, shoulder and arms and was rushed to hospital.According to the Offences against the Person Ordinance, those wounding or striking with intent to do grievous bodily harm to others are liable for life imprisonment of life, the association’s statement said. Police will do their utmost to bring the suspects to justice, the association said. It also appealed to frontline officers to stick to their positions and perform their duties at this difficult moment in concerted efforts to safeguard the silent majority.

                    French prosecutor: Knife attack suspect in 'psychotic state'
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                PARIS — An Afghan man was in a "psychotic state" and on drugs during a stabbing in France that killed one person and injured eight others, but investigators haven't found any terrorist ties, a regional prosecutor said Sunday.A psychiatric evaluation of the man in custody for Saturday's attack revealed he was experiencing "paranoid delirium," prosecutor Nicolas Jacquet said.The suspect reported he "heard voices" telling him to kill, according to Jacquet. A 19-year-old man died after being stabbed with a knife in the attack outside a subway station in the Lyon suburb of Villeurbanne.Passers-by surrounded and apprehended the assailant before police arrived, according to the prosecutor. He thanked them."Their courageous, responsible intervention was decisive," Jacquet told reporters.A witness broadcaster BFMTV identified as Sofiane described trying to help people who were stabbed and rounding up others to go after the attacker.The man from Afghanistan in custody has been living in a French center for asylum-seekers, and held a temporary French residency card, Jacquet said. The suspect was first recorded in France in 2009, and subsequently traveled to Britain, Italy, Germany and Norway before returning to France in 2017.After the stabbings, the suspect gave "incoherent" accounts and three different dates of birth to police, Jacquet said. The man was not publicly named.The suspect was not on any radicalism watch list, Jacquet said.Officers searched the suspect's residence as part of the investigation, and "nothing was found showing any kind of radicalization," he said.The suspect had no police record or record of psychiatric problems, the prosecutor said. He was found with two knives but no other weapons.Two of the eight people injured remained hospitalized. French police initially said nine people had injuries but the prosecutor said the total was eight. The reason for the discrepancy was unclear.Villeurbanne Mayor Jean-Paul Bret said the man held is the only person suspected of wielding the knife.The mayor also called anti-migrant politicians "shameless" for seizing on the stabbings to push their views.French far right leader Marine Le Pen tweeted after the attack that "lax migration policy" threatens France's security.The attack raised concerns because France remains on alert after a string of deadly Islamic extremist attacks.AP

                    Policeman's wife tells her fear, discomfort about anti-police sentiment in Hong Kong
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                HONG KONG - On a recent night when an off-duty Hong Kong police officer was stabbed by a trio of masked men, Suet, wife of a Hong Kong policeman, suffered a mental breakdown.When the news came out that the ambush at a Mass Transit Railway (MTR) station in New Territories of Hong Kong left the officer with bone-deep wounds, Suet's husband Piu was on his way to the police station.Suet tried fanatically to contact her husband."I was sitting at home desperately, doing nothing except for staring at the phone screen and waiting for Piu to reply," said Suet.As the unrest in Hong Kong entered the third month, prolonged and escalating violence by radical protesters has taken a heavy toll on Hong Kong's police force. According to the Hong Kong Police Force, at least 200 officers have been attacked and injured during the continued unrest.To Suet's relief, Piu arrived at the police station safely. "But since then, he has to keep me posted about his itinerary. I have to know that he is safe," said Suet.It was not just Piu's safety that was on her mind. Amid the rising tensions between rioters and the police force, well-known for its discipline and professional performance to maintain social order, families of the latter have become a target of the former."The news of verbal intimidation and even death threats against police families, especially against our children, sent a shiver down my spine," she said.So far, the personal data of more than 1,800 police officers and their families has been illegally disclosed online since June, including pictures of the children of the police and information about their schools and classes. In some cases, teachers reportedly encouraged bullying against children of the police.In online forums such as LIHKG, radical protesters spread rumors and distorted information, or simply vent their unrestrained anger. They even share information on how to bully police's children, instructing its readers to work in a group of six with designated men acting as lookouts."We adults may have the strength to defend ourselves in the face of danger, but our children cannot defend themselves," said the mother of two.As the new academic year kicked off one week ago, she was baffled by concerns about the safety of her older son who was attending a primary school."I have to remind my son every morning not to tell anyone that his dad is a police officer," said Suet.With concerns about the safety of her husband and children in mind, Suet soon found the stress unbearable. Then, a friend of her suggested that she could open an account on Weibo, a leading Chinese social media platform, to tell the world what was happening to families like hers."We need others' support to know that we are not fighting those lurking in the darkness all by our own," she said.Since she posted the first message on Weibo on Aug. 25, the account, set up on behalf of four spouses of Hong Kong police officers, had attracted more than 120,000 fans, and support for Hong Kong police and their families kept pouring in."When you post pro-police messages and pictures on Facebook in Hong Kong, you are likely to become a target of cyberbullying and in some cases, your personal data will be illegally collected and released," said Suet. "All I get from the Chinese mainland is support and encouragement."
