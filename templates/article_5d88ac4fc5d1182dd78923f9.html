                Santa Claus may never have known the ancient trade route - who really knows? - but the Christmas season and the centuries-old spice trade share a common flavor thanks to the land we now know as Sri Lanka, Mike Peters reports.You can't make gingerbread without it. Or pumpkin pie. Or mulled wine. Or those glazed sweet potatoes that find their way to holiday tables at the end of December."It", of course, is cinnamon, a bestseller on grocery shelves. Second globally only to black pepper among the spices, according to US food giant McCormick, cinnamon was once rare indeed, a flavoring so prized that medieval traders literally died to collect the tree bark that produces it.

                Models for Eve show off the brand's new collections with embroidery patterns inspired from ethnic Miao works in Jidao village, Guizhou province. [Photo provided to China Daily]Chinese fashion brand Eve takes inspiration from the Miao group to add a rare touch to its products. This, in turn, is helping an old tradition survive. Sun Yuanqing reports.Tucked away in the mountains, Jidao village is a three-hour drive from Guiyang, the provincial capital of Guizhou province. Here, the ethnic Miao people maintain their traditional lifestyle. They live in wooden houses, preserve meat in early winter and hold gatherings at the riverside to remember their ancestors every year.On the face of it, all this might seem to have no connection with high fashion, but the community has been a source of inspiration for many designers and fashion houses, including fashion brand Eve.The Chinese brand recently made a trip to the village to make an advertising campaign for its 2017 spring/summer collection, which features Miao embroidery.Inspired by the sea, the collection features shades of blue on its suits, sweaters and coats. A smattering of embroidery adorns the classic suit silhouette.The women's collection includes sleek qipao (traditional Chinese women's dress) and dresses that highlight nature-inspired embroidery.While traditional Miao embroidery is intricate, Wu Chaohui, creative director of Eve's menswear line, says the brand has simplified it to cater to customers' modern-day needs."Traditional Miao embroidery is usually very rich and exaggerated, while modern menswear is understated. So we try to use it (the embroidery) in a selective, moderated way," he says."We want to revive this heritage by offering it to an urban clientele, and we hope this tradition will live on."

                Chinese brands draw inspiration from Miao ethnic traditions, adding flair to products while helping the old ways to survive Tucked away in the mountains, Jidao village is a three-hour drive from Guiyang, capital of Guizhou province. Here, the ethnic Miao people maintain their traditional lifestyle, living in wooden houses, preserving meat in early winter and holding gatherings at the riverside to remember their ancestors. All this might seem to have no connection with high fashion, but the community has been a source of inspiration for many designers and fashion houses, including fashion brand Eve.  Eve models show off the brand's new collections, which use embroidery patterns inspired by the ethnic Miao in Jidao village, Guizhou province. Photos Provided to China DailyThe Chinese brand recently made a trip to the village for an advertising campaign for its 2017 spring and summer collection, which features Miao-style embroidery. Inspired by the sea, the collection features shades of blue on suits, sweaters and coats. A smattering of embroidery adorns the classic suit silhouette. The women's collection includes sleek qipao - a traditional Chinese women's dress - along with dresses that highlight nature-inspired embroidery. While traditional Miao embroidery is intricate, Wu Chaohui, creative director of Eve's menswear line, says the brand has simplified it to cater to customers' modern-day needs. "Traditional Miao embroidery is usually very rich and ornate, while modern menswear is understated. So we try to use it in a selective, moderate way," he says. "We want to revive this heritage by offering it to an urban clientele, and we hope this tradition will live on." Eve has been working on a project to preserve Miao embroidery over the past 15 years with a dedicated team that documents the traditional crafts. It has established a network of craftspeople and their work, which has been used extensively in their collections and shown at exhibitions and in runway shows in Milan, London and Paris in recent years. Separately, Eve has also formed an alliance with local brands, so that all its members can make use of the database. In a related development, it helped build a museum in Guizhou to exhibit the works of the embroiderers. Xia Hua, founder and chairwoman of the Eve Group, says, "These people are preserving their heritage with their hands. I want to share their craftsmanship with the world and let it see the beauty of our country." Xia was a teacher at China University of Political Science and Law before founding the Eve Group in 1994. Eve is best known for making men's suits, and has dressed such Chinese magnates as Jack Ma and Liu Chuanzhi. The company now has five brands - Eve de Uomo, Notting Hill, Kevin Kelly, Jaques Pritt and Eve Cina. The prices of its outfits range from a few hundred to more than 10,000 yuan ($1,440; 1,380 euros; 51,175). The group currently has more than 500 stores in China, including a designer space in Beijing's Parkview Green mall that showcases its collaborations with international and local designers. The growing interest in Miao ethnic culture is also changing the lives of villagers. In Jidao village, embroiderers now hold workshops to teach children the craft. There are about 50 embroiderers in the village, with the oldest more than 80. For overseas exposure, the embroiderers were taken by Chinese designer Xie Feng to Paris Fashion Week in 2012 to exhibit their skills. As their craftsmanship has gained more exposure over the years, orders have flooded in. Now, looking to secure their future, the embroiderers have created a foundation to which they contribute 3 percent of their revenues. Its assets now total around 6,000 yuan, which they intend to use to promote their art, says Chen Qin, an embroiderer and a foundation organizer. "It is like a seed. We will use it to spread our heritage." Contact the writer at sunyuanqing@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily European Weekly 12/30/2016 page18)

                Love them or hate them, Christmas records are as much a part of the festive season as Santa Claus and turkey with stuffing. For this end-of-year Editor's Choice, explore why they're so popular among recording artists – and check out four that are packed with festive fun.As the season of making merry bears down on us again, the radio airwaves – never mind the shopping malls and supermarkets – will be ringing to the sounds of "Jingle Bells", "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" and "Frosty the Snowman".If there's one thing that has united pop bands, opera singers, rappers, country music stars and velvet-voiced crooners over the years, it has been the irresistible urge to produce a Christmas record. The results have so often been cringeworthy, so why have so many been willing to risk their hard-won credibility in search of a Christmas hit?Nostalgia and a desire to create some Christmas cheer may be part of it, but the biggest incentives are commercial – a Yuletide hit can generate millions of sales and climb back up the charts every December. In fact, the biggest-selling single of all time is Bing Crosby's "White Christmas", which has sold more than 50 million copies since its release during the Second World War. Add this to multiple versions of the song – by Taylor Swift, Kelly Clarkson and Coldplay, among numerous other artists – and "White Christmas," written by American composer Irving Berlin, has racked up more than 150 million sales.Over the years, Christmas recordings have ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous. Compare the majestic, soaring voices on the 2015 recording Carols with the St Paul's Cathedral Choir to Bob Dylan sounding like a drunken uncle who just gatecrashed lunch on 2009's Christmas in the Heart. And country outlaw Johnny Cash may have cultivated his tough guy image with "Folsom Prison Blues", but that didn't stop him from warbling through "The Little Drummer Boy" on his album The Christmas Spirit. The Beatles even used Christmas to send festive cheer to members of their fan club, recording songs and messages that were given away free on bendable, vinyl flexi-discs.Bob Geldof raised millions of dollars for famine relief with the 1984 single"Do They Know It's Christmas?" It was a worthy cause, but the title prompted critics to respond with a resounding no: starving children in Ethiopia probably didn't know it was Christmas.More recently, Mariah Carey, Justin Bieber, Destiny's Child and Kanye West have all succumbed to the lure of recording a Christmas song. And this year is proving no exception, with acts including veteran boy band 98 Degrees ("Let it Snow"), Gwen Stefani ("You Make it Feel Like Christmas") and the brother-trio Hanson ("Finally It's Christmas") all jumping on the Yuletide bandwagon.So much for having a silent night on Christmas Eve…Lindsey StirlingWarmer in the WinterNew for 2017, the American violinist uses her first festive disc to showcase her musical virtuosity. Or, as she puts it: "Prepare yourself for a potpourri of different styles and sounds from all different sides of Christmas music."

                Educators from the UK and China talk about the key learning points from their participation in a math teacher exchange program, Cao Chen reports in Shanghai. Ian Pegrum's understanding of the role of Chinese pedagogy in mathematics used to be limited to what he had heard from others-that it was based on rote learning which offered little room for creativity.But after undergoing a two-week China-UK math teacher program that was jointly launched by both countries in 2014, the 33-year-old Grade 2 teacher at the William Bellamy Primary School in Dagenham, Essex, has concluded that the Chinese pedagogy is nothing like what it is often described as.In fact, he has even described it as being "a carefully-crafted learning journey"."Children in Shanghai actually have plenty of opportunities to express their creativity through problem-solving activities," says Pegrum, who has been teaching for nine years."Contrary to perceptions that the Chinese style is very rigid, there is also much discussion in the classroom about the merits of different solutions to problems."Pegrum was one of the UK teachers who got to observe math lessons at the Shanghai Huangpu District First Central Primary School and Pudong New Area New World Experimental Primary School for two weeks in 2018.As of February 2019, about 700 teachers in primary and secondary schools from both countries have taken part in the program, according to its organizers in Shanghai. The exchange program also sees Shanghai math teachers visit British primary and secondary schools throughout the UK. All the Shanghai teachers involved in the program are highly experienced and are required to undergo a weeklong training session before they arrive in the UK.

                    Kelly Craft confirmed as new US envoy to UN
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - The US Senate Wednesday confirmed Kelly Craft as the new US Ambassador to the United Nations in a 56-34 vote, filling a seven-month-long vacancy.The largely party-line vote on Craft demonstrated a sharp contrast to that of her predecessor, Nikki Haley, who was supported by 96 senators during her confirmation vote in 2017.In a floor speech prior to the vote, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell praised Craft as "a very impressive individual to serve in the critical role of UN ambassador", despite strong concerns from Democratic lawmakers, who questioned Craft's qualifications, position regarding climate change, and possible conflict of interest."She lacks the experience necessary to stand up for American values and promote our national security on the global stage," said Bob Menendez, a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee."During her brief diplomatic tenure in Canada, she posted so many absences that I cannot describe it as anything less than a dereliction of duty," he said.Craft, 57, is currently the US ambassador to Canada, where she was involved in negotiations over a revised North American free trade pact.Craft was found to have spent more than half of her time in office outside Canada, according to a report by Menendez prior to the vote. The ambassador replied by saying that she had been spending time away from Ottawa to advance trade deals on the behalf of her country.At the hearing, Craft was also criticized by the Democrats for her previous remarks doubting the causes and severity of climate change.Craft said that she acknowledged the "vast amount of science" regarding the phenomenon and the role humans have played. "If confirmed, I will be an advocate for addressing climate change."Haley stepped down in December 2018. Former State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert was initially tapped to succeed Haley, but withdrew her nomination in February, citing family considerations.
