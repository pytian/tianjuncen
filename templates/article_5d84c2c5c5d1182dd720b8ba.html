                Gamers find success in Shanghai outskirts
            </p>

                When Zhu Renran and his friends decided to start a company, setting up in a suburban town in southern Shanghai was not the first place that would have come to mind.Fengjing, which lies on the border of Shanghai and Zhejiang province, is known among locals for its ancient water town dating back more than 1,500 years ago. Except for a few industrial parks, the town, which covers around 90 square kilometers, remains largely pastoral.Born and raised in Fengjing, Zhu moved to settle in downtown Shanghai after his graduation from college, working as a software engineer and later in corporate management in multinational companies.In July 2017, when one of his former high school classmates approached him to start a company to scout esports talent back in his suburban hometown, he agreed without hesitation."The offer was too tempting to resist," said the 26-year-old, sitting in the lobby of Innovation Town, which was established by the Fengjing town government.As an avid fan of video games, Zhu is not oblivious to China's craze for esports, which is being propelled by the country's booming video game market-already the world's largest and expected to register $37.9 billion in sales this year, according to gaming consultancy Newzoo.The market is set to grow steadily as companies like Tencent, NetEase and Alibaba compete to market video games, fill stadiums with fans and sell broadcast rights to matches.This has created a strong demand for professional gamers and live broadcasters.One of the founders is an esports coach who led a Chinese professional team-called The Wings Gaming-to win the championship of The International 2016 in the game of Dota 2.They had scouted almost every incubator and industrial park across Shanghai looking for office space, but nothing was comparable to what Fengjing could offer-free space for at least two years, free publicity and promotion for the company on any occasion the local government finds appropriate and minimal living costs in the town, which also boasts fresh air, a green environment and the serenity of surrounding countryside.In addition, the town's remote location on Shanghai's south side has had little impact on its business, as players can wield virtual weaponry in multiplayer games anytime, anywhere.Zhu's company is typical of the startups Fengjing aims to attract to transform itself into the innovation backyard of Shanghai."China has made tremendous progress in building megacities," said Zhang Bin, Party chief of Fengjing. "But we are still finding ways to develop towns with distinctive character, which has become a new engine for urbanization in terms of the economic growth and industrial transition of China. One thing we've learned from the process is that it is up to a small town itself to discover its strength and build on that strength to become distinctive."The rise of new sectors brought by technology has transformed Fengjing's remoteness (it's located 60 kilometers from downtown Shanghai) into a competitive edge, as demonstrated in Zhu's case, Zhang said.In 2015, Fengjing set up Innovation Town, where Zhu's company is based, to support and attract startups. So far, more than a dozen have thrived here, according to Chen Qiang, who has been overseeing the incubator's operations since its founding.Over the past year, Zhu's 10-member company has prospered, helping more than a dozen professionals enter the booming esports industry, either as gamers or live broadcasters.Zhu said the company is now able to break even and will continue to grow as it has started to gain recognition from the industry."We live and work in our hometown, doing what we really enjoy in an industry that has great prospects," Zhu said.

                Turkmenistan levels up in global gaming revolution
            </a>
            <p>
                ASHGABAT, Turkmenistan - Turkmenistan is dipping its toe into the world of e-sports having got a taste for gaming at a showcase sporting event it held last year.The traditionally reclusive Central Asian country is in the process of forming a national e-sports team that will represent it in events devoted to Counter-Strike, Dota 2, Hearthstone and other popular titles.Denis Oglodin, who plays under the moniker Den4EZ, has already earned the right to wear the republic's colors after his five-man team triumphed in a national contest for Dota 2 - a multiplayer battle game - on Friday."I've been into computers since I was four. Now I spend 12-15 hours behind a computer," Oglodin, a 17-year-old student at an IT college in Ashgabat, said."My parents understand me and aren't bothered by it. My goal (in gaming) is money and glory," he said.Boom time That e-sports has arrived in Turkmenistan, a country of around five million people which was practically offline just over a decade ago, testifies to gaming's global pull.The multi-billion dollar industry has even attracted interest from the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou could see medals doled out for gaming.For Emil Gasanov, who at 38 is the oldest member of the team that will represent Turkmenistan in a forthcoming Central Asian tournament, gaming's growing global prestige is exciting to see."My hobby has turned into a profession," says Gasanov, who founded one of the capital Ashgabat's first video-game clubs in 1998 and now coaches younger gamers like Oglodin for a privately sponsored cyber collective called Galkynysh.Some of the players from Galkynysh competed in an exhibition e-sports tournament held in Ashgabat in 2017.Hello, internet Turkmenistan's e-sports adventure was given a boost by the creation of a new national federation earlier this year that has backing from the culture and sports ministry.Its chief, Mekan Eyeberdiev, estimates that there are several thousand e-sports enthusiasts in the country, 70 percent of whom are students at schools and universities."Our task is to popularize this sport in Turkmenistan," Eyeberdiev said, adding that he expected "conservative views" of gaming as a hobby rather than a sport to fade over time.Obstacles to the growth of a national gaming culture include internet speeds and costs in an economically depressed country.Now authorities claim there are over two million internet users, but a standard fixed-line connection of 256 kilobytes per second costs around 190 manats ($54) per month for Ashgabat residents, which is prohibitive for many Turkmen.Overall, however, Turkmenistan could be climbing aboard the e-sports train at just the right time.Vitalii Volochai, a Ukrainian sportscaster with 10 years of experience commentating on Dota 2 tournaments, says the World Electronic Sports Games held for the first time in January last year are offering gamers from smaller countries a chance to shine that they did not have before.The event, backed by Chinese tech giant Alibaba, is the closest thing e-sports has to a soccer World Cup, with players competing in national teams and battling for a prize pot of up to $1.5 million per competition.Dota 2's equivalent of the Champions League, The International, offers even greater winnings than that.Given the tight censorship in Turkmenistan, it is perhaps surprising that the state is throwing its weight behind e-sports, some of which features graphic violence.That is something that bothers the IOC, whose president Thomas Bach has spoken of a "red line" for games involving killing while remaining generally upbeat on the possibility of e-sports' Olympic inclusion.Volochai says the debate over Olympic recognition is not something most gamers are losing sleep over, however."We don't really need the IOC or Olympics - they need us," he said.Agence France - presse

                E-sports players chase dreams of stardom
            </a>
            <p>
                Many are called but few are chosen in rapidly emerging fieldLau Wai-kin, one of many young people in Hong Kong with savvy technological skills, decided to pursue a career as an e-sports superstar a few years back. But it wasn't a quest for fame that drove him."I play computer games simply because I can make a living from e-sports," said Lau, who is known in the cyberworld as Toyz.After winning several tournaments in the game League of Legends, he was invited to join e-sports team Taipei Assassins from Taiwan. His team won the Season 2 Championship in 2012, and Lau became Hong Kong's first homegrown e-sports world champion.Lau was known as the "beast of the mid lane" (a position on the team).

Lau, being no scholar, had no such opportunity.As a whiz kid in gaming, and with minimal aptitude in scholastic studies, Lau left school at 16 and spent most of his time playing computer games. He worked in sales and as a porter before his transition to e-sports at age 19.He concedes he is too impulsive, as is often the case with young people who have had phenomenal early success. "Since I always outperformed others in games, I thought I would also be better than others in the real world. As a result, I was very self-centered while communicating with them, never considering their feelings," Lau said.He retired from the Taiwan team after a painful wrist injury, a common occurrence among e-sports players.He joined e-sports company Hong Kong Attitude, formerly named Hong Kong Esports. However, his own attitude brought criticism that he was uncooperative, and he was banned from taking part in competitions and from livestreaming by HKA.

                E-SPORTS PLAYERS CHASE DREAMS OF STARDOM
            </a>
            <p>
                Many are called but few are chosen in rapidly emerging field Lau Wai-kin, one of many young people in Hong Kong with savvy technological skills, decided to pursue a career as an e-sports superstar a few years back. But it wasn't a quest for fame that drove him. "I play computer games simply because I can make a living from e-sports," said Lau, who is known in the cyberworld as Toyz. After winning several tournaments in the game League of Legends, he was invited to join e-sports team Taipei Assassins from Taiwan. His team won the Season 2 Championship in 2012, and Lau became Hong Kong's first homegrown e-sports world champion. Lau was known as the "beast of the mid lane" (a position on the team). He earned the nickname for what many considered to be his brutal style of destroying online opponents. Now 26, Lau has reset the bar for Hong Kong e-sports players. From age 17 to 21, his winnings totaled HK$3 million ($382,000). His parents borrowed money from relatives to send his elder brother abroad for university studies. Lau, being no scholar, had no such opportunity. As a whiz kid in gaming, and with minimal aptitude in scholastic studies, Lau left school at 16 and spent most of his time playing computer games. He worked in sales and as a porter before his transition to e-sports at age 19. He concedes he is too impulsive, as is often the case with young people who have had phenomenal early success. "Since I always outperformed others in games, I thought I would also be better than others in the real world. As a result, I was very self-centered while communicating with them, never considering their feelings," Lau said. He retired from the Taiwan team after a painful wrist injury, a common occurrence among e-sports players. He joined e-sports company Hong Kong Attitude, formerly named Hong Kong Esports. However, his own attitude brought criticism that he was uncooperative, and he was banned from taking part in competitions and from livestreaming by HKA. A series of personal troubles almost ruined Lau financially. He ran out of cash when he tried to form his own team, Raise Gaming, in 2016, but this probably wasn't all his fault. His principal investor's capital was frozen before a contract issue arose with HKA, his former employer. He lost all his e-sports earnings, but persevered to lead new side G-Rex as a team director. The team is owned by the newly established company Emperor Esports Stars. "I really like the feeling of winning competitions. That's why I have dedicated myself to this field. One of the greatest pleasures of e-sports is winning against others to make myself feel stronger," Lau said. Abandoning the style of the brash kid who raised his arms and chanted at the camera when his team won the world championship in 2012, he is more reserved these days, and said he is devoting his efforts to raising another world championship team from Hong Kong. E-sports stardom is the dream of many young people who find a"sense of belonging" while playing games. E-sports is an abbreviation for electronic sports, a global market that reached $700 million in 2017 and is expected to total $1.5 billion next year, according to the analysis company Newzoo, which has its headquarters in the Netherlands. The global viewership for the League of Legends World Championship Grand Final last year, which took place in South Korea, reached 99.6 million, according to Statista, an online statistics portal. Subsidies planned Hong Kong's first e-sports festival was staged by the city's Tourism Board in 2017. The special administrative region's government has realized the investment value in e-sports, earmarking HK$100 million for the industry in the 2018-19 budget. Half of this amount will be used to build an e-sports competition venue at Cyberport, a technology incubator. The government plans to subsidize competitions to the tune of up to HK$500,000 and will make Cyberport available for such activities free of charge. The Hong Kong Legislative Coun-cil is considering an amendment to the Amusement Games Centre Ordinance that exempts game centers from police action over licensing. Compared with Lau's achievement becoming a world champion in League of Legends in 2012, when most people in Hong Kong had no idea what e-sports were, LoTsz-kin's championship triumph in the computer card game Hearthstone at the Asian Games in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, last year drew widespread acclaim. There are more than 300,000 e-sports players in Hong Kong - 93 percent of them male, and 55 percent ages 18 to 21, according to research by City University of Hong Kong. The research also found there were only 50 e-sports professionals working and training in the city. Sal-aries of professional players range from HK$5,000 a month to HK$25,000. The most popular e-sports games globally include Dota 2 (Defense of the Ancients), Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Fortnite and League of Legends. Players in the Dota 2 international tournament last year in Vancouver, Canada, competed for prize money totaling $25 million. A 23-year-old e-sports player in Hong Kong, who uses the name BlackWai, said many observers equate computer gamers with losers, but he countered this by saying that the competitors train professionally. "There are daily routines and goals for our training. We have to get a certain amount of points and destroy a set number of enemies in play. If we fail to reach the targets, we might be criticized by our coach. We treat e-sports seriously. Only when we train systematically can we hope for good results in competition," BlackWai said. E-sports, which involves playing computer games each day, might not be as easy as some may imagine. BlackWai came under severe pressure after reaching his goal of becoming a professional player competing in the game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, also known as PUBG. He said: "We took part in competitions, but we were not satisfied with the results. There were times when we almost cried after dedicating ourselves to practicing for a long time. Sometimes we forecast that we would win, but failed in the end. The greatest pressure came from the fear of letting teammates down and failing ourselves." After sitting at a computer and concentrating on computer games from 2 pm to 10 pm every day in a gaming studio in Hong Kong, Black-Wai gained just over 9 kilograms in his first year of training. Teams from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan were usually paired up for practice sessions each day. Despite putting in tremendous efforts, the team lost in the PUBG regional competition in December. BlackWai described this as a turning point in his life, as he had missed the chance of becoming a star. If the team had won, it would have represented Hong Kong in the world championship. Like Toyz, BlackWai was not interested in furthering his education, and worked as an aircraft maintenance mechanic for five years after high school. He devoted most of his leisure time to gaming and won some e-sports prizes before being invited to become a professional player in February last year. He said he felt lucky when his parents supported him in pursuing his dream. E-sports players start at age 16 and usually retire when they turn 25, as their hand-eye coordination fades and their reflexes become slower. E-sports teams are always hiring and firing. Once a player fails to excel in competition or does not cooperate with his teammates, his services are dispensed with. For example, take the G-Rex League of Legends team, which was launched in September 2016. It currently has seven members, and nine players have been sacked in the past two years. Also, the Hong Kong Attitude team, which was established in March 2013, has six players on its roster, while 26 have terminated their contracts or been fired in the past six years. Players are only one component of the industry. A large proportion comprises management boards, sponsorship companies, producers of events, e-sports livestreaming platforms, marketing companies and game analysts. A player who is fired can join a new team, if he is lucky. Players who have retired can land jobs related to e-sports, while some even turn to You-Tube, cashing in on the fame and the fan bases they have acquired. Investment forecast Eric Yeung Chuen-sing, president of the Esports Association Hong Kong, said: "I know some retired players who are earning a lot more on YouTube than when they were athletes. They receive sponsorships from advertisers and attend events." The association is cooperating with schools to organize an e-sports introductory course to promote the industry and attract talent. Yeung suggested young people consider e-sports as a legitimate option. He believes that with the increasing numbers of high-level tournaments and professional players, more people will invest in the industry, and Hong Kong should be positioned as a regional gaming hub for Asia instead of an incubator for professional players. "We have the best venue for organizing this kind of international tournament. Hong Kong is a very good place for tourists, and we have a very good internet infrastructure. If more and more big events are organized in the city, the industry will have a better ecosystem," Yeung said. Various e-sports-related companies have sprung up, including those running training venues and involved in marketing. Most do not make a profit, according to Yeung. As an e-sports idol in Hong Kong, Toyz, the city's first homegrown world champion in the field, said there are many obstacles awaiting potential players. He suggested teenagers should focus on their studies, as there are only limited vacancies for professionals. "Kids dreaming of becoming professional e-sport players are having a rush of blood to the head. I think it's a bit unrealistic. They should focus on what they have been doing- whether it's their studies or their careers. Being responsible for their lives is the most important thing of all," he said. Of the e-sports players Toyz grew up with, some have gone to the Chinese mainland or Taiwan to further their careers as coaches or livestreamers. Most retired players have switched to other jobs, but Toyz is one of the few original ones to maintain a high profile in Hong Kong e-sports. Since he retired as an athlete, no other player in the city has come close to breaking his earnings record. Toyz would like to train a new world champion from Hong Kong and make more money from You-Tube and livestreaming on Twitch, a global video platform and community for gamers. He has always focused on the money he can earn from e-sports, and as he was once the most skillful player in town, why shouldn't he?  Taipei Assassins celebrates winning the League of Legends Season 2 Championship in 2012.Provided To China Daily (China Daily 02/11/2019 page2)

                Gaming sector gets boost from esports
            </a>
            <p>
                China's booming esports industry is kicking into high gear, with hundreds of millions of players and viewers actively participating in numerous local tournaments.Esports - professional video gaming in which teams play each other in competitions - are experiencing exponential growth in China, becoming a key driving force boosting the growth of the domestic gaming sector, said a recent report.The domestic esports audience will grow to 350 million this year, a year-on-year increase of 10.6 percent, according to a report released by Penguin Intelligence. The company predicted that China will have the largest number of core esports fans globally, reaching 75 million this year.The report said esports audiences' passion is set to create a market worth 13.8 billion yuan ($2 billion) in 2019, up by 63 percent year-on-year. The growth mainly comes from income generated by tournaments, including sponsorship, media rights and money earned by clubs and players."There is still plenty of room for growth in esports players and viewers," said Wang Xu, chief analyst at gaming database Gamma Data Corp."With more gaming firms tapping into the esports sector, a growing number of key tournaments have been held by esports brands in China. And the new type of competition has gained a huge following among netizens."As local gaming regulators have tightened their grip on a market that is reaching a saturation point, esports are becoming extremely important in China.Major cities and provinces, including Hainan province, Shanghai, Chongqing, Xian in Shaanxi province and Hangzhou in Zhejiang province, are competing to become the country's new esports hub.Hainan province announced last week that a 1 billion yuan fund will be set up to promote the development of the esports sector. The money will be used to support related firms and investment in large tournaments.The announcement came shortly after Shanghai introduced a plan earlier this month to dramatically boost the local cultural industry, with the goal of becoming a global esports hub within three to five years.The International 2019, the world's largest Dota 2 esports tournaments, will be held in Shanghai this summer. It will be the first time for China to host the annual event.Xiao Hong, CEO of Perfect World Co Ltd, the Dota 2 operator in China, said TI9's prize pool will break the record set by last year's tournament, hitting more than $25.5 million."As China is currently one of the leading esports markets in the world, more top tournaments will be held in China," Xiao noted."Both esports and traditional sports have a lot of similarities. They all have fixed areas and set rules. And they all need tactics design and trained players," Xiao added."Esports fans are just like traditional sports fans. The way traditional sports fans choose their teams and watch games has a lot more in common with esports fans."

                PSG primed for China mission
            </a>
            <p>
                French giant's preseason tour aims to build on success of Wang Shuang's stayParis Saint-Germain remains bullish on making further inroads into the Chinese market despite women's star Wang Shuang's departure from the club.The Team China playmaker last week left the French giant to resume her career back home with one year still to run on her contract.However, undeterred by Wang's exit, PSG is renewing its efforts to boost its Chinese fanbase with a 12-day, three-match preseason trip for its men's team to the world's most populous nation."China is a country which is developing rapidly in football and eager to learn from and welcome European clubs. It's a pleasure for us to come to China for the second year in a row," PSG's Asia-Pacific managing director, Sebastien Wasels, told China Daily last week.PSG begins its Chinese tour against Suning-owned Inter Milan in Macao on July 27 before moving on to Suzhou, Jiangsu province, to face Sydney FC on July 30 and then traveling south to take on Rennes in a French Super Cup showdown in Shenzhen on Aug 3.The Super Cup, or Trophee des Champions, played between the winners of Ligue 1 and the French Cup, will be a revenge mission for PSG after it was stunned by minnow Rennes in the domestic cup final in April.PSG won the Super Cup's two previous Chinese editions, against Guingamp (2-0) at Beijing's Worker's Stadium in 2014 and last year against Monaco (4-0) at Shenzhen's Universiade Sports Center.The Paris side has vowed to fly all its available superstars, including Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, to China."Those games are not going to be friendly matches for us. They are real tests to win the first cup for the season," said Wasels."We want to start the season the best way possible by bringing home a trophy, just like we did last year."Win or lose in Shenzhen, Wang's exit is undoubtedly a blow to PSG's ambitions to expand its brand in Asia.The 24-year-old attacking midfielder decided to terminate her two-year contract, signed last August, following Team China's elimination by Italy in the last 16 of the Women's World Cup in France.Wang scored eight goals (including one in the Champions League) and contributed seven assists in 27 appearances for PSG.Despite the premature end to her Paris adventure, which was reportedly because of a schedule clash between the French league and China's 2020 Olympics qualifiers, Wang made a major impression at the club."In one season with us, Wang really made her mark and won the hearts of all PSG fans," said Bruno Cheyrou, PSG women's sporting director."On the pitch, she showed her true talent, seamlessly integrating into the squad. Off the field, she has become an iconic symbol who has contributed enormously to the club's reputation in China."An May online mini-series documenting Wang's daily adventures in Paris attracted eight million views and translated into an impressive spike in PSG's Weibo followers - jumping by 332,000 to a total of 1.65 million."As far as how she helped us in the brand awareness in China, it has been tremendous," Wasels said of Wang.As a relative latecomer to the Chinese market, PSG is now focused on catching up with its major European rivals here."Obviously we came after the others but we believe that we are at least as dynamic as they are and we hope we can close the gap and join the top three popular clubs in the coming years," said Wasels.Backing up those words, PSG last month signed a partnership with Chinese insurance giant Pingan Group to stage 200 trials for kids across 16 Chinese cities this summer.Through the initiative, 50 outstanding youngsters will be selected to participate in PSG's academy program in Paris, which will include a two-week training camp and visits to the club's Parc des Princes stadium.Both PSG and the French national team are renowned for their youth development, so hopes are high the club can help China unearth its own Mbappe."PSG has a strong tradition in player development and this is where we can make a difference and offer more support to the Chinese program," said Wasels.Meanwhile, PSG opened its first fan experience zone in China last year at Shanghai's downtown Xuhui district. The area featured an indoor pitch replete with FIFA-approved artificial turf, rooftop fields, a merchandise store and a club-themed restaurant with big screens.The club has also sponsored a Chinese e-sports team to compete in Dota 2 competitions as a way of targeting younger fans.

                Shanghai shows it's the host with the most
            </a>
            <p>
                Top tourney's Asian debut underlines city's global statureShanghai more than lived up to its reputation as a global center for e-sports as the annual International Dota 2 Championships arrived in Asia for the first time with a bang.Officially known as The International 2019 (TI9), the six-day event concluded in a frenzy of absorbing action at a sold-out Mercedes-Benz Arena on Sunday.Tens of thousands of gaming enthusiasts made a deafening roar as Team OG defeated fellow Europeans Team Liquid 3-1 to pocket the whopping winner's check of around $15 million.Total prize money exceeded $34 million. Team PSG.LGD claimed third place to finish as the top Chinese squad in the 18-team field.Considered one of the world's most prestigious e-sports events, The International has been staged in Europe and North America since 2011.The Shanghai tournament's 26,804 tickets were snapped up in just 53 seconds in May, with each match day welcoming about 13,000 spectators since last Tuesday.It's not surprising that TI9 chose Shanghai as host. In late 2017, the municipal government officially declared it was fast-tracking efforts to build the city into a global e-sports hub.That mainly involves delivering preferential policies and regulations to attract clubs, investment and the world's top tournaments.According to thepaper.cn, Shanghai's e-sports revenue totaled 14.6 billion yuan ($2 billion) in 2018, with the city boasting 35 e-sports venues."Ever since Shanghai set the goal of becoming a world e-sports center, the city has made many appealing policies, and these policies are the reason why TI9 could be held in Shanghai, which is also the host of many other e-sports tournaments of Perfect World," said Xiao Hong, CEO of Perfect World Co Ltd, Dota 2's operator on the Chinese mainland."In the future, Perfect World will organize more high-standard international e-sports tournaments in Shanghai. The city will become an e-sports development base for us, and we for sure will invest more in the sector."Shanghai prides itself on offering a super-smooth support system for hosting tournaments."Shanghai offered comprehensive support to TI9 in terms of venues, event promotion, security and all other services," Zhu Qinqin, deputy director of the Shanghai E-Sports Association, told thepaper.cn."It's the first time the event has come to Shanghai. To some degree, it shows the city's expertise in hosting such a high-level e-sports tournament. The event will attract more people to the e-sports sector. It also prepares the city to welcome more top-level international events."The city's effort impressed Gabe Newell, co-founder of the game's developer and publisher, Valve Corporation."On behalf of the Dota community I'd like to say thank you to the citizens and the government of Shanghai for your hospitality and kindness," said Gabe."We are absolutely delighted to hold the series here in China."There was a resounding thumbs-up from fans too. One enthralled spectator, Zhang Zixuan, said: "Four of us became friends through the game and this is the first time we watched The International on site."It's very different from watching the live broadcast on screen. We're impressed by the lighting system, stage and great atmosphere here. We started to play when we were at middle school, and we will keep our passion, although some of us have already graduated from university."Shanghai's success is part of a nationwide e-sports boom.According to the 2019 Global E-sports Development Report, the Chinese market was worth 8.5 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) last year, with that figure expected to exceed 13 billion yuan by the end of 2019.E-sports' fanbase is also snowballing. In 2018, there were about 320 million gamers and fans in China, a figure that is projected to rise to 350 million by the end of this year. Globally, it's estimated the number of e-sports fans will exceed 450 million by the end of 2019."A reason why TI9 came to our country is because China's tournament-organizing ability has been recognized by the world," said Xiao."That means we have world-class ability in event organizing, venue construction and live broadcasting. The arrival of TI9 shows the growing strength of Chinese e-sports. The world will pay more attention to the Chinese e-sports market."Chinese e-sports has transformed from being a follower to being a leader. China's development in the sector is also an opportunity for the world. The International was bound to come to China sooner or later. If The International had never come, it would be missing a development opportunity."As for what the future holds, Xiao is touting 5G technology to revolutionize the sector."5G technology will not only make the games smoother, it will also smash through the limits of hardware, improving the gaming experience together with augmented reality and virtual reality technology," said Xiao."5G tech will also deliver spectators a new experience and new angles to enjoy tournaments. Meanwhile, it will change users' gaming habits and bring changes to game design."
