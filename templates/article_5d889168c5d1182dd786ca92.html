                Anticipated ICE raids on migrants hard to find
            </p>
            <p>
                The highly publicized raids by US immigration authorities to detain and deport illegal immigrants appeared not to materialize over the weekend and on Monday.Immigrant advocacy groups in several states reported no arrests had been made, but President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday that "the ICE raids were very successful…many, many were taken out on Sunday you just didn't know about it."The raids by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were to start on Sunday and continue through Thursday and target at least 2000 undocumented immigrants in Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and San Francisco.But Jorge-Mario Cabrera, director of communications for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles, told China Daily: "No. There hasn't been any of the supposed arrests that were threatened [here.] There have been other arrests. [Our advice] has always been the same. To not open the door. To remain quiet. To be respectful of authority. Not run away and not sign any papers."The American Civil Liberties Union of New York tweeted: "We've heard some reports of ICE at subway stations, but none have been substantiated."New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter on Sunday: "We've followed up on every report today and so far, have no confirmed ICE activity."Before they were to begin, the mayors of the California cities of Oakland, San Jose and San Francisco — all sanctuary cities — had voiced their opposition. San Francisco Mayor London Breed said her city would not cooperate with ICE.Trump stressed last week that the raids would lead to mass deportation and detention of migrants, prompting fear among immigrant communities.Mark Morgan, acting director of ICE later clarified that the number would be closer to 2,000 and would focus on recently arrived undocumented families who had final removal orders from immigration courts.Ken Cuccinelli, acting US Citizenship and Immigration Services director, told CNN on Monday that he didn't know how many people had been arrested because the acting director of ICE hadn't told him. Cuccinelli said this was "presumably because operational details are kept contained within the agency executing the operation, as they should be."On Monday, the Trump administration unveiled sweeping changes to the asylum rules, the latest attempt to restrict the influx of migrant families coming to the United States.The Justice and Homeland Security departments announced plans to deny asylum to most Central American migrants and others who travel by land to enter the US from the Mexican border.Under the proposal, migrants who do not apply for asylum in the first country they get to on their way to America's southwest border would not be offered protection. Migrants who prove they did apply but were denied, will still be allowed to seek asylum at the US border.The rule will go into effect on Tuesday and is another attempt to limit asylum seekers, say critics.The ACLU said it planned to sue the Trump administration over this "unlawful" rule.

                Migrants braced for ICE raids in 10 cities
            </a>
            <p>
                Despite signs that the sweeps have started, Sunday was mostly quietFear gripped migrant communities in the US, and immigrant advocate groups were on heightened alert as federal agents prepared to carry out raids in major cities on Sunday to deport thousands of undocumented people.President Donald Trump insisted that the raids will focus primarily on deporting criminals, though he acknowledged that the agents will be targeting anyone who crossed the southern border illegally."It starts on Sunday, and they're going to take people out and they're going to bring them back to their countries," the president said. "Or they're going to take criminals out, put them in prison, or put them in prison in the countries they came from."The raids by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents were expected to take place in Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and San Francisco.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he received reports that the crackdown was already underway in the city.The mayor said ICE agents did not succeed in rounding up any residents of Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood and Harlem.A group of Chicago aldermen and activists were patrolling the city on bicycle to look for immigration authorities detaining people.In New Jersey, more than 70 people protested at an ICE Detention Center and nearby Amazon Fulfillment Facility in Elizabeth on Sunday, nj.com reported.ICE said it had arrested 20 people in the San Diego area on Friday.ICE said of those arrested, "85 percent had prior criminal convictions and/or prior criminal charges". The convictions were for drugs and weapons offenses, hit-and-run, driving under the influence, theft, domestic violence, evading law enforcement and fraud.In Tacoma, Washington, a 69-year-old man armed with a rifle threw incendiary devices at an immigration detention center around 4 am Saturday, then was found dead after four police officers arrived and opened fire, authorities said.The Tacoma Police Department said the officers responded about 4 am to the privately run Tacoma Northwest Detention Center, a US Department of Homeland Security facility that holds migrants pending deportation.The Pierce County Medical Examiner's Office identified the man as Willem Van Spronsen of Vashon Island, the Tacoma News-Tribune and the Seattle Times reported.Police said Van Spronsen caused a vehicle to catch fire and that he attempted to ignite a large propane tank and set buildings on fire. Police said that besides the rifle, he had a satchel and flares.After shots were fired, officers located Van Spronsen and determined he had been hit and was dead at the scene. The four Tacoma police officers who fired their weapons have been placed on paid administrative leave.Deb Bartley, who told The Seattle Times she has been a friend of Van Spronsen for about 20 years, described him as an anarchist and anti-fascist."He was ready to end it," Bartley said. "I think this was a suicide."Most of the United States' 10.7 million unauthorized immigrants live in just 20 major metropolitan areas, with the largest populations in New York, Los Angeles, Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth, according to Pew Research Center estimates based on government data released last month.Local ICE branches could start the raids sooner or later than Sunday, officials said, and last at least through Thursday.Amy Lin, immigrant rights program manager at Chinese for Affirmative Action, a San Francisco-based civil rights organization, told China Daily on Friday that "we have seen ICE operations in the Bay Area since last week''."Though the undocumented immigrants will be directly impacted, all people of color are targeted, '' she said. "The raids are politically motivated and meant to terrorize the immigrants and try to deter those migrants from coming into the US.''Hundreds of thousands of migrants have crossed the southern border this year, many fleeing violence and poverty to seek asylum in the US.Arrests at the border dropped by 28 percent in June, according to the Department of Homeland Security, the first time this year that the number of border crossings declined.The department said earlier this month that 104,344 arrests occurred in June, down from 144,278 in May — the highest monthly total in 13 years. It credited the drop to security forces Mexico deployed to prevent migrants from reaching the US border and the expansion of a program that forces migrants to wait in Mexico as their immigration cases are processed.The nationwide immigration enforcement operation had been announced and subsequently postponed by Trump last month over protests from Democratic lawmakers and others.Federal immigration authorities said they hoped the new effort would sweep up at least 2,000 undocumented migrants.The raids will pursue people with final deportation orders, including families whose immigration cases were fast-tracked by judges in the major cities.The administration's removal efforts will include "collateral" deportations, or "immigrants who happened to be on the scene, even though they were not targets of the raids", according to The New York Times.The looming raids could have long-lasting impacts on immigrant communities, said UC Davis School of Law dean Kevin Johnson:"There's real damage to communities. I'm not saying everybody's staying home, but people are fearful of leaving their homes, fearful of going to work, fearful of going to school, fearful of going to the doctor, fearful of going to the DMV.""It's almost like getting ready for a hurricane – it's that state of alarm that people are feeling," Melissa Taveras of the Miami-based Florida Immigrant Coalition told USA Today. "People are asking, 'Is it OK for us to go work? Is it OK to take our kids to school?'"In Los Angeles, Cristel Martinez spoke at a vigil organized by advocates in front of Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles on Friday night. She said she was born in Honduras, moved to the US when she was 9 and now is an immigration attorney."People are terrified knowing that they are going to have raids this weekend,'' she told China Daily. "I am just reminding them that they have rights, that they don't have to open the doors, and they have the right to not say anything, and they have the right to an attorney as well."In San Francisco — a so-called sanctuary city where local government officials refuse to help the federal government enforce immigration policy — activists have set up a network of hotlines to confirm reports about raids and readied volunteer lawyers to assist detainees in court."It is unconscionable that the Federal administration is continuing to target innocent immigrant families with raids that are designed to inflict as much fear and pain as possible," Mayor London Breed said in a statement on Friday.In California, government officials and police departments have stressed that local law enforcement does not enforce immigration law and is prohibited from doing so under California's "sanctuary state" policies."Know that you are in a community where you are supported, respected, and appreciated," Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said in a statement on July 11, urging city residents to reach out to the Alameda County hotline."It's hard to understand why leaders like Mayor Schaaf think, in their hubris, that they get to decide how these laws should be enforced," said Hugh Bussell, chair of the Alameda County Republican Party. "These are people who had been remanded to leave but remained in the country anyway. It's a function of the federal government to enforce the law."Robin Hvidston, executive director for "We the People Rising'', a Claremont, California-based group that supports immigration enforcement, said she was "100 percent in support'' of the raids."I completely support the removal of people that have deportation orders,'' she told China Daily. "It's about just upholding and enforcing the existing immigration laws."Lia Zhu in San Francisco, Yinmeng Liu in Los Angeles and The Associated Press contributed to this story.

                NEW YORK/WASHINGTON - The New York police officer who put Eric Garner in a fatal chokehold during an attempted 2014 arrest, fueling the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, will not face federal criminal charges, Brooklyn's top federal prosecutor said on Tuesday.Garner's death on a sidewalk during an arrest for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes, and his gasped final words "I can't breathe" caught on bystander video, played a key role in the rise of the movement decrying excessive use of force by police officers against black men and teens in the United States.Garner's family immediately blasted the decision clearing Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who put Garner in a prohibited chokehold, in a news conference as a betrayal.US Attorney Richard Donoghue confirmed the decision at a news conference."The death of Eric Garner was a tragedy," Donoghue said. "The job of the federal prosecutor, however, is not to let our emotions dictate our decisions."A lengthy Department of Justice review of the incident did not reach a conclusive determination as to whether Pantaleo willfully committed misconduct, an "essential element" necessary to bring federal charges, a senior department official told reporters at a briefing in Washington.US Attorney General Bill Barr made the ultimate call, siding with federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, who had not wanted to charge Pantaleo, over the department's civil rights division, which had wanted to bring charges, the official said.The official confirmed that no New York police officer – not just Pantaleo – will face any charges.MOTHER: 'TODAY WE CAN'T BREATHE'After meeting with federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, members of Garner's family held a news conference with civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton."The DOJ has failed us," said Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, adding that she wanted to see Pantaleo fired. "Five years ago, my son said 'I can't breathe' 11 times, and today we can't breathe because they let us down."A New York grand jury in 2014 declined to charge Pantaleo, who has been assigned to desk duty since Garner's death and faced a disciplinary trial in May at New York City Police Department headquarters.A departmental judge is due to make her recommendations to New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill, who will then ultimately decide whether to punish Pantaleo. He could lose vacation days or be fired.The NYPD said its disciplinary process on Pantaleo will not be affected by the federal prosecutors' decision.The Civilian Complaint Review Board, the city oversight agency that prosecuted the departmental trial against Pantaleo, called the Justice Department's long-delayed decision "an utter travesty.""Our last hope for justice in this case lies with the Police Commissioner," CCRB Chairman Fred Davie said in a statement. "CCRB prosecutors presented evidence at trial that showed - unequivocally - that Officer Pantaleo engaged in misconduct worthy of termination."UNION: NO 'SCAPEGOATING'New York's Police Benevolent Association union welcomed the news."Although Mr. Garner's death was an undeniable tragedy, Police Officer Pantaleo did not cause it," PBA President Patrick Lynch said in a statement. "Scapegoating a good and honorable officer, who was doing his job in the manner he was taught, will not heal the wounds this case has caused for our entire city."The New York City Chief Medical Examiner's office ruled that Garner's death was a homicide induced by "compression of neck (choke hold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police."Pantaleo's lawyers have argued he did not use a chokehold, but instead used an authorized "seatbelt" hold that slipped as Garner struggled, and that the officer did not cause Garner's death."It is always a tragedy when there is a loss of life," Stuart London, a lawyer for Pantaleo, said in a statement. "Officer Pantaleo is gratified that the Justice department took the time to carefully review the actual evidence in this case rather than the lies and inaccuracies which have followed this case from its inception."In 2015, New York City officials agreed to pay Garner's family an out-of-court settlement of $5.9 million to resolve a wrongful death lawsuit.The incident, and other high-profile police killings of black men and teens in cities including Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, set off a wave of nationwide protests in 2014 and 2015.Several Democratic contenders for the White House, including New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, condemned the decisions."Years ago, we put our faith in the federal government to act," de Blasio said in a statement. "We won't make that mistake again."Reuters

                Advocacy groups say raids not made on migrants
            </a>
            <p>
                The highly publicized raids by United States immigration authorities to detain and deport illegal immigrants appeared not to materialize over the weekend and on Monday. Immigrant advocacy groups in several states reported no arrests had been made, but US President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday that "the ICE raids were very successful ...many, many were taken out on Sunday you just didn't know about it." The raids by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement were set to start on Sunday and continue through Thursday, targeting at least 2,000 undocumented immigrants in Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and San Francisco. But Jorge-Mario Cabrera, director of communications for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles, told China Daily: "No. There hasn't been any of the supposed arrests that were threatened (here). There have been other arrests. (Our advice) has always been the same. To not open the door. To remain quiet. To be respectful of authority. Not run away and not sign any papers." The American Civil Liberties Union of New York tweeted: "We've heard some reports of ICE at subway stations, but none have been substantiated." New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter on Sunday: "We've followed up on every report today and so far, have no confirmed ICE activity." Before they were to begin, the mayors of the California cities of Oakland, San Jose and San Francisco - all sanctuary cities - had voiced their opposition. San Francisco Mayor London Breed said her city would not cooperate with ICE. Trump stressed last week that the raids would lead to mass deportation and detention of migrants, prompting fear among immigrant communities. Mark Morgan, acting director of ICE, later clarified that the number would be closer to 2,000 and would focus on recently arrived undocumented families which had final removal orders from immigration courts. Kenneth Cuccinelli, acting US Citizenship and Immigration Services director, told CNN on Monday that he did not know how many people had been arrested because the acting director of ICE had not told him. Cuccinelli said that the reason was "presumably because operational details are kept contained within the agency executing the operation, as they should be". On Monday, the Trump administration unveiled sweeping changes to the asylum rules, the latest attempt to restrict the influx of migrant families coming to the US. The Justice and Homeland Security departments announced plans to deny asylum to most Central American migrants and others who travel by land to enter the US from the Mexican border. Under the proposal, migrants who do not apply for asylum in the first country they get to on their way to the US southwestern border would not be offered protection. Migrants who prove they did apply but were denied, will still be allowed to seek asylum at the US border. The rule will go into effect on Tuesday and is another attempt to limit asylum-seekers, critics said. The ACLU said it planned to sue the Trump administration over the "unlawful" rule. belindarobinson@chinadailyusa.com (China Daily Global 07/17/2019 page3)

                Baltimore students wowed by Xiamen
            </a>
            <p>
                For 16 high school students from Baltimore, a trip to Xiamen and Beijing this summer was an eye-opener.The students, accompanied by three chaperones, visited the two cities from June 24 to July 4.For many, it was their first time to China.One of those was Madison Hall, an 11th grader at Bard High School Early College, who has been studying Chinese for four years."I was immediately and pleasantly surprised at how welcoming all the students were," Hall said. "They were a lot of fun to work with, and they had such excellent English skills. Xiamen was so pretty to visit. Every place we visited had trees and flowers, it was all so calming, even though the actual city was quite bustling with all the traffic."The group went to Xiamen Shuangshi High school to get a taste of the Chinese secondary school system.Jahnae Drummond, another 11th grader from Bard High, took a Chinese culture class before the trip and said the trip taught her more than she learned in class."Working with the Chinese students and being able to meet some of them was my favorite part of being in China. Being able to communicate with them and understand that we're not so different was a huge part of what made the trip so amazing," said Drummond.Drummond said she made many Chinese friends during the trip. "I've made one friend that I've talked to every day since I left China," she said. "I chat with her through WeChat, and we get to exchange what is different here in America and there in China. I hope to see my friends again someday, either in China or here in Baltimore."They also visited Xiamen University and Peking University.Camille Lee, a 10th grader from East Technical High School who has been learning Chinese for six years, said she was very interested in visiting Xiamen University."I want to be a marine biologist when I graduate college, and I read that Xiamen University had a program that might be good for me in that area. I was also very excited when we visited Peking University because I was able to get another school's perspective."The trip was sponsored by the Baltimore-Xiamen Sister City Committee (BXSCC) Youth Ambassadors Program, which facilitates cultural and educational exchanges between the two cities."The program has only been going for two years," said Danny Evans, vice-chairman of BXSCC and project manager of the program.His thoughts on the program were to bring Baltimore high school students and adult mentors to Xiamen, so the two cities could promote mutual understanding, increase leadership skills and prepare the youths to make a difference in the international community."The experience will serve as a gateway for BXSCC to provide further opportunities for Baltimore/Maryland students to learn more about China and its language and culture through firsthand experiences outside of the classroom," said Evans.With China's fast economic growth and emerging significant global role, sister-cities ties with Xiamen have become a key part of Baltimore's international strategy.Since an economic and cultural delegation lead by Baltimore Mayor William Donald Schaefer traveled to Xiamen in November 1985, the two cities have had a sister-cities partnership, yielding several successful collaborations.Xin (Cindy) Wang, chair of BXSCC, said, "We have at least a dozen projects and programs, which are related to business and trade, youth and education and other areas, per year. We are regularly talking with contacts in several Chinese cities about collaborative opportunities, although our focus is primarily on opportunities with Xiamen."Evans hoped Baltimore and Xiamen educational exchanges could serve as a role model for other cities around the world to engage in educational partnerships with cities in China.Some of the students who participated in the program had the same thoughts."Baltimore and Xiamen's friendship is an excellent example for other cities in the US," said Hall. "Even when national ties are shaky, local connections can be the key to keeping things stable. If more cities in the US had relationships with cities in China, I think it would mean that country relations with China would slowly get better as well."Wang thinks that countries have big geostrategic issues to consider, but cities are the front lines for providing adequate affordable housing, healthy and plentiful food options, clean water, living-wage jobs, a good public education system and a modern infrastructure of roads and bridges."We hope that the openness and flexibility provided by frank dialogue and steady exchange programs will continue undiminished, and overcome any setbacks presented by national-level disagreements," said Wang."Collaborative programs with the aim of furthering mutual understanding and accentuating shared values can benefit citizens of both countries. I trust that people-to-people exchanges such as those through sister cities will continue to help with positive relations between the citizens of the US and China."On Wednesday, the 2019 Sister Cities International Annual Conference will kick off in Houston."I believe the sister-city partnership between the US and China will develop better and better, and the relationship between people in the US and China will grow stronger. We are finding new ways to cooperate," said Carol Robertson-Lopez, vice-chairman of Sister Cities International and chair of the US-China Mayors' Summit."For the upcoming event next Wednesday, we will provide more opportunities to Chinese businesspeople and government officials. The opportunities are from Houston and Texas officials from business, including house care and research and energy related industries," she said.Zhang Jing in Washington contributed to this story.

                Trump rejects racism charge, throws it at black lawmaker
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump on Sunday said disparaging comments he made about a prominent African-American lawmaker and his Baltimore district were not racist and, without citing any evidence for his claim, he called the congressman a racist."If racist Elijah Cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district, and Baltimore itself, perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership," Trump said in a tweet.Trump had attacked Cummings, a Democrat in the House of Representatives who has long been a champion for civil rights, in a series of tweets on Saturday, after the lawmaker criticized conditions at U.S. facilities housing migrants along the Mexican border.In a post on Twitter, Trump called Cummings' district "disgusting, rat and rodent infested.""No human being would want to live there," he said.The tweets drew pointed responses from Democrats, who said the comments were racist, a charge Trump denied on Sunday."There is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know, that Elijah Cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district, and of Baltimore itself," he said in a series of posts on Twitter.Cummings' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's latest tweets. In a tweet on Saturday responding to Trump's initial barrage, Cummings said: "Mr President, I go home to my district daily. Each morning, I wake up, and I go and fight for my neighbors. It is my constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the Executive Branch. But, it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents."Cummings is the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, which voted 23-16 along party lines on Thursday to issue subpoenas to White House officials, including Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner as part of a probe into possible violations of government record-keeping laws.In an interview on CBS's "Face the Nation," acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said on Sunday that he understood why Trump's comments could be perceived as racist but he said the president was speaking hyperbolically.Trump's remarks echoed a similar attack he made in January 2017 against another black lawmaker and icon of the civil rights movement, John Lewis. He also recently told four minority women lawmakers to "go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came from.""I absolutely think it's important to call it out for what it is, which is racism," Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro told "Face the Nation.""There's a pattern here," he added. "That's how he thinks he won in 2016 and that's how he thinks he's going to win in 2020."Cummings represents Maryland's 7th congressional district, which according to 2010 census data was 54.6% black, had a median household income of $51,018, a figure above the median income for the nation as a whole.Reuters

                Uruguay issues travel warning after US mass shootings
            </a>
            <p>
                MONTEVIDEO - Mass shootings in the United States over the weekend led Uruguay's government to issue a travel warning to its citizens on Monday.The Foreign Affairs Ministry cautioned parents in particular about the potential dangers to children, given the rise in "indiscriminate violence, mostly due to hate crimes".Gun violence in the United States has taken "the life of more than 250 people in the first seven months of this year," the ministry said in a statement."Since it has been impossible for the (US) authorities to prevent these situations due, among other things, to the public's indiscriminate possession of fire arms, we especially recommend avoiding places where crowds gather," the ministry said.The administration of President Tabare Vazquez provided a list of places or events deemed to be of high risk, including theme parks, shopping centers, arts fairs, religious activities, culinary festivals and other types of crowded cultural or sporting events."In particular, we recommend not attending these places with children," the ministry warned, adding travelers should also avoid the 20 most crime-ridden cities in the United States, such as Baltimore, Maryland and Detroit, Michigan.Mass shootings in El Paso, Texas on Saturday and in Dayton, Ohio on Sunday have claimed the lives of more than 30 people and left approximately 50 people injured.On Friday, the US Department of State raised its travel alert for American citizens traveling to Uruguay, from level 1 to level 2, citing high crime.

                China's talent has Small thinking big
            </a>
            <p>
                MLB executive says schools are key to growing the domestic gameThe next big thing for Major League Baseball's initiative in China is to get more youngsters to put on gloves and pick up bats."One of the things we're working on is a much broader schools initiative," Jim Small, senior vice-president of MLB's international business, said in Beijing on Saturday."Instead of 180 schools, how can we get into a thousand schools? How do we build a broader base of kids playing baseball in China? I think that's the next big thing for us," added Small, who was attending the MLB Experience carnival and exchanged gifts with Dong Zheng, general manager of Chinese Super League Co Ltd, which has partnered with MLB in charity activities nationwide.On the question of expanding MLB's Development Centers to other parts of the country, Small is cautious."We're not sure yet. We're going through that now, because we don't know if we need more DCs," said the 57-year-old American, who was deeply involved with baseball development in China as early as 10 years ago when he was president of MLB Asia-Pacific."We think we need more grassroots programs to get more players for the three existing DCs. We want a funnel to bring more kids to the current DCs. We don't need more DCs, we just need a deeper talent pool from which to choose."If we get more kids into the current system, that might be enough - but we haven't ruled out more DCs. We are just going through a process to determine our best course of action."Small said last week's launch of a domestic professional league is a big step in the right direction."Having a pro league in China is really important. It's another step on the ladder ... and we're working at the top of that ladder," he said."We now have seven players from the DCs signed to pro contracts in the US, and we are working with the national team. We are working with the grassroots, getting more kids to play at schools. What was missing until now was a strong professional league."Some kids here might one day play in MLB, but they can also play for pro teams in China. That's important."We want to create heroes - and sometimes those heroes are going to be here in Beijing, not necessarily in Los Angeles or New York. Having a Chinese pro league is a big step on that ladder."Since MLB established its first DC at Dongbeitang Middle School in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, seven graduates have signed with MLB clubs - Xu Guiyuan (Baltimore Orioles), Gong Haicheng (Pittsburgh Pirates), Qiangbarenzeng (Boston Red Sox), Wang Yang (Philadelphia Phillies), Zhao Lun, Yin Jian and Kou Yongkang (all with the Milwaukee Brewers).Small is pleasantly surprised by the success of the DC program."We have graduated about 70 players from the academy, and seven of them are playing in the US; that's 10 percent. That rate of success is unheard of. There are no American schools that have 10 percent of their kids signing up to play professional baseball," he said."That's testament to the quality of athletes in this country. We see Chinese athletes dominating in other non-traditional sports, like track and field, swimming, tennis... so why not baseball?"We know how to build young Chinese men into professional athletes, but I'm almost more proud of our grads who are pursuing other options, either playing college ball in the US or China or playing in China's new domestic league. We have also hired some of them as coaches. The future of baseball in China is going to be led by them."Baseball, which is returning to the Olympics next summer in Tokyo, was last played at the 2008 Beijing Games, when South Korea won gold."Next year's Olympic inclusion is very important, but we really want to work on making it permanent," said Small."If we can work with the World Baseball and Softball Confederation and other organizations to get baseball back in the Olympics on a permanent basis, that will really benefit the game. Money will flow from Olympic organizing committees down to the national federations, and that funding will help grow baseball worldwide."Small said MLB is in talks with the WBSC to see how they can work together."I had a meeting with them in June, and we're going to continue to talk with them to see what we can do together to help keep baseball in the Olympic Games," he said.

                League of our own looking to long term
            </a>
            <p>
                Revamped pro competition off to encouraging start as fresh MLB input offers extra hopeWere it not for the sharp crack of the bat, the raucous cheers and drumrolls emanating from Tuanpo Sports Center in Tianjin on Thursday could easily have been mistaken for the noise of a top professional soccer match.To the surprise of media and even the players, nearly 3,000 fans turned up for the opening match of the China National Baseball League's new season－a welcome boost for everyone involved with the sport here."Today the vibe in the stadium was electrifying, making us so nervous but in a good way," said Tianjin Lions' pitcher Du Xiaoci after helping the host beat the Beijing Tigers 3-2 in the opener."For athletes like us playing baseball in China, we've been used to playing with little attention, but the new league gives us a stage and a spotlight that we never imagined we could have before," added the 27-year-old national team member.The revamped four-club league has stepped up to the plate for a third swing at becoming a fully fledged pro program.Originally established in 2002, the competition was suspended in 2011 and 2017 due to a lack of funding and exposure.Now there is renewed hope a partnership between the CNBL and Major League Baseball can make the difference this time around."For any sport aspiring for long-term growth, it's necessary to have a pro league system established on the top for kids to look up to and to aim for," CNBL commissioner Qin Xiaowen said at the signing ceremony for the agreement in Tianjin on Thursday. "Even though we are far off the professional standards set by the MLB, we are optimistic that with their help we can grow our league into a solid component of our pyramid system."The new partnership will see the MLB lend its expertise on league management, talent development, competition operation, marketing and broadcasting."We share the same understanding that a pro league is essential if China is to become a baseball-playing nation," said Jim Small, senior vice-president of the MLB's international business."What we've done is to share the information on how we are set up and how the MLB is operated. From the league standpoint, we've given them some information that we don't share with a lot of people because of the trust we have in China."We also share the best practice when it comes to how to market, how to sell tickets and how to show a baseball game on television－things that will make fans' experience more enjoyable."The goal is to enable the league to stand on its own two feet, without the help of the State-run sports system.Turning this dream into a reality, however, will not be easy.Despite the establishment of a league company encompassing the Chinese Baseball Association and its operating partner, Shougang Sports, the competition still features the same four original teams－Beijing, Tianjin, Guangdong and Jiangsu－from 2002, underlining a degree of stagnancy in terms of the sport's development in China.The four teams will play home and away for 18 rounds over seven weeks before the top two clubs square off in a best-of-five final in late October."Although understaffed at the moment, to keep a league running smoothly is critical for motivating youth to stay in the sport to feed the league with talent in the long run," said Chen Xu, president of the CBA.At grassroots level, the MLB, which established a Beijing office in 2007, has helped cultivate a domestic talent pool through its three development centers in East China's Jiangsu province.Since the first DC opened in Wuxi in 2009, a total of seven Chinese prospects have graduated through the system to sign tryout or minor-league contracts with MLB clubs, including 'Itchy' Xu Guiyuan (with the Baltimore Orioles in 2015) and 'Sea' Gong Haicheng (with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2017).While none of the Chinese prospects have seen MLB action, around 20 have suited up for teams in the CNBL this season.The MLB's help in better identifying the right sort of talent to nurture will be vital, said Kim Ng, a senior vice-president of baseball operations with the league."We also help advising on the scouting side, such as how to look for specific characteristics in players and profile them in who will be able to succeed in the league later on," she said.With the CNBL relaunched and the sport included in the Olympics again at next year's Tokyo Games, baseball is on its way to joining the sports mainstream in China, reckons Small."I am absolutely convinced that everybody in China is a baseball fan and they just don't know it yet," said the 57-year-old.
