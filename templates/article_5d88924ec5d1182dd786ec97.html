                Crawfish craze keeps industry on a roll
            </p>
            <p>
                Sector expected to maintain steady growth trend in nation as consumer demand for product surgesSeafood-savvy Chinese are eating more crawfish at restaurants and through e-commerce purchases. Resembling small lobsters, the delicacy has been quite popular on Chinese dining tables and for late-night snacks over the years.May, when crawfish mature, is the start of the peak season for crawfish consumption, and it runs until September. Crawfish can be cooked in various flavors such as spicy, minced garlic, stir-fried ginger and scallion, braised soy sauce, and innovative flavors such as cooking with salted egg yolk, cheese, and fermented bean curd."Crawfish has become one of the most sought-after and highly recognized summer foods in the country. Continuously launched new flavors in the market further stimulated the demand from consumers. They helped to enlarge consumer group scales, and raise the average spending and eating frequency," said Neil Wang, president of consultancy Frost & Sullivan in China."The process of eating crawfish is kind of complicated, which limits the use of mobile phones during meals, and thus it helped to create a natural social networking scenario for diners," he said.As an indication of how much crawfish has triggered the appetite of Chinese consumers with sophisticated tastes, a search of the words "crawfish delivery" through Dazhong Dianping, a Chinese customer review app that is similar to Yelp, results in more than 3,100 restaurants that offer deliveries in Beijing alone.Depending on different sizes, prices of cooked crawfish at restaurants are usually around 80 yuan ($11.3) to 200 yuan per dish, and most reviews from consumers said they like the food very much, according to Dazhong Dianping."Sales of crawfish have grown remarkably and rapidly in the past few years, and now it has stepped into a more stable growth period with more rational prices. Next, its growth rate is expected to slow down," said Cui He, director of China Aquatic Products Processing and Marketing Alliance.Last year, the total industrial output of crawfish in China was worth 369 billion yuan, up 37.5 percent year-on-year, according to a new crawfish sector growth report released by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in late August.In May last year, the government released crawfish sector related guidelines about the standardization of circulation grade, safety and hygiene index, packing requirement, transportation and storage requirement, providing more specific guidance and monitoring of the crawfish market.Talking of the industrial chains, sales in the crawfish cultivation sector hit 68 billion yuan last year. The processing industry yielded sales of 28.4 billion yuan, and the sales of the tertiary industry, mainly catering, came in at 272.6 billion yuan, the report said.In 2018, the total output volume of crawfish reached 1.64 million metric tons, and the total breeding areas stood at 1.13 million hectares. Among the total, crawfish cultured in rice fields accounted for over 70 percent.The yields from Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Jiangxi provinces, respectively, took the top five spots. Among which, the output of Hubei province reached 812,400 tons last year, which made up about half of the country's total output.The competition between industrial players has become more intense. Last year, major Chinese e-commerce platforms such as JD, Tmall and Freshhema, saw substantial sales of crawfish, and their cold chain distribution and logistics systems have developed fast. Fresh crawfish, peeled crawfish, condiments, cans, crawfish noodles, and many other categories, can be easily ordered online."Now, many e-commerce retailers would prefer to purchase fresh crawfish directly from breeding places, and process locally, and thus eliminate intermediate links and costs. This would be beneficial for both consumers and farmers," Wang of Frost& Sullivan said.Meanwhile, 140,000 new crawfish restaurants were opened nationwide last year, surging nearly 70 percent year-on-year, and more restaurants have launched express delivery business of crawfish. Retailers focused more on developing branded crawfish with local or national impact, according to a report by China's leading group-buying provider Meituan.Orders of crawfish delivery last year were 2.6 times higher than the previous year, and the transaction value was 4.3 times higher, Meituan said.From January to May this year, another 5,000 new restaurants selling crawfish have opened. Major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Chengdu each have more than 3,000 such restaurants."In the long term, the crawfish segment in China will maintain a steady growth trend, but the growth rate will slow down. The overall supply-demand relationship of the industry will become more balanced," said the Meituan report."The industrial chain of crawfish has been further extended, and the industrial structure will get upgraded. Crawfish will be produced on a larger and more organized scale," the report said.

                Goodwill efforts raise hopes for a deal
            </a>
            <p>
                Editor's Note: The United States has deferred the planned increase in tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods from Oct 1 to Oct 15 and China withdrew the tariffs on pork and soybean imports from the US in response. Many believe these moves will de-escalate tensions. Two experts share their views on the new turn of events in the China-US trade war with China Daily's Liu Jianna. Excerpts follow: Move encouraging and raises hopes That both sides have shown their intention to defuse the trade tensions is a relief to not only the two economies but also the world beyond. The US move also shows a subtle change in the attitude of the US leader, who while triggering the trade war against China didn't believe that the US would also have to pay a high price for it. It seems the US administration has deferred the planned increase of tariffs on Chinese imports because it has realized the trade war is detrimental to US consumers. Which in turn shows the US can still act with discretion. The fact that the US leader stopped the airstrike on Iran adds credence to this belief. It is hoped the two countries will hold the next round of trade talks based on reason in order to reach a deal, at least an interim deal. Still, the deep-rooted conflicts between the world's two largest economies, especially on China's developing economy status, are likely to continue. The conflicts could even intensify in the long term. Many say the US is staring at recession. Indeed, the US' more than 100 months of economic growth could come to an end according to the laws of economics. If the White House recognizes this fact, the US administration would more strongly feel the need to strike a deal with China at the trade talks. Tao Wenzhao, a researcher in US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences More goodwill gestures needed China seems to be less affected than expected by the trade war that it has been dragged into against its will. That is because it boasts a huge domestic market with a complete supply chain, which has ensured its strong and lasting attraction for foreign investment. According to the US-China Business Council, 46 percent of the US enterprises operating in the Chinese market reported a higher profit margin from China than their overall profit margin. Besides, despite the decline in China's exports to the US, its exports to other economies such as the European Union and the ASEAN member states increased considerably. Thanks to the complete supply chain, foreign enterprises have realized that relocating their production units from China to another country would not be cost-effective. Apart from the measures to further open up its economy, China has also increased investments abroad; its outbound direct investment was $143 billion in 2018 alone. And China's cooperation with other economies has increased the possibility of the China-EU Investment Agreement being inked next year and negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership being completed by the end of this year. Also, the efforts to strengthen intellectual property rights protection and improve the business environment are expected to help consolidate China's partnerships and collaboration with other countries. On the other hand, 300,000 jobs have been lost in the US and 0.3 percent of its growth shaved off, according to Moody's Analytics report. Therefore, it is likely that the US' economic rebound could take longer without the trade war. And the possibility of its economic boom coming to an end cannot be ruled out. Both countries want a trade deal. However, only a mutually beneficial deal is acceptable to China. More work needs to be done to reach a deal. Cui Fan, a professor of world economics at the University of International Business and Economics The views don't necessarily represent those of China Daily. (China Daily Global 09/18/2019 page12)
