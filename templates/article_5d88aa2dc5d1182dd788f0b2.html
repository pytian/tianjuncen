            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                BEIJING - Foreign capital inflow into China's A-shares market remains robust since the beginning of September after major global benchmarks announced widened inclusion of A-shares.Net foreign capital inflow reached 45.9 billion yuan (about $6.5 billion) since the beginning of this month through stock connect schemes with the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, according to a Friday report by the Economic Information Daily.The figure accounts for about 27 percent of foreign capital inflow since 2019, which stood at 167.4 billion yuan.The influx came after global index provider MSCI raised index weighting for Chinese A-shares from 10 percent to 15 percent, effective from Aug 27.Another benchmark FTSE Russell strengthened the A-shares' weighting in one of its indices from 5 percent to 15 percent, while the S&P Dow Jones Indices will weigh 1,099 A-shares at 25 percent in an upcoming inclusion.The two moves to take effect on Sept 23 are expected to generate $5.1 billion worth of inflow into the A-shares, according to FTSE Russell estimates and analysis from China Merchants Securities.Analysts believe the A-shares are at the outset of a hot streak of foreign capital influx with more to follow as the country further opens up its financial sector.China's forex regulator scraped two investment quota restrictions for foreign institutional investors earlier this month to better facilitate participation in the financial markets.

                    ROK to do all it can for successful DPRK-US talks: unification minister
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                SEOUL - ROK (The Republic of Korea)'s Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul said Thursday that his country will do all it can for the successful working-level denuclearization talks between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the United States, which were expected to resume in the near future.Kim made the remark at a ceremony to mark the first anniversary of the third summit in Pyongyang last September between ROK's President Moon Jae-in and top DPRK leader Kim Jong-un.Citing the impromptu meeting on June 30 at the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjom between the leaders of the two Koreas and US President Donald Trump, the minister said the DPRK-US working-level talks would resume in the near future.Choe Son-hui, the DPRK's first vice foreign minister, said earlier this month that the DPRK was willing to hold talks with the United States in late September to comprehensively discuss issues the two sides had taken up.Kim said both Pyongyang and Washington would cherish the opportunity for the working-level dialogue though it would not be easy as the two sides are required to overcome a "wall of age-old distrust and confrontation".The minister said that only when the DPRK and the United States make productive, reasonable negotiations based on sufficient trust, the DPRK would take a big step toward the denuclearization.He said the South Korean government will do all it can for the DPRK-US working-level dialogue to bear good fruit, while closely communicating with the US side and opening communication channels between the two Koreas.

                How fast is the broadband download speed for daily use in Chinese cities? The recently published report on Chinese broadband speed by the Broadband Development Alliance unveils the latest general picture across the nation.According to the report, China Unicom took the crown in terms of users' download speed over a 4G network among the three telecom operators, followed by China Mobile and China Telecom.From a location perspective, users in East China enjoy the fastest download speed of 24.4 Mb/s, while in Central China 23.4 Mb/s and West China 22.88 Mb/s.With different telecom operators, service sets and locations, speeds across the country will undoubtedly be different, Zhu Wei, deputy director of the Communication Law Center of the China University of Political Science and Law explained. Individual user handsets also play a role in overall speeds.Let's take a look at the top 10 cities with the fastest download speed in China.
