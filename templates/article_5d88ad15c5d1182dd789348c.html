                PM's bid for elections defeated before Parliament shutdown
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                British Prime Minister Boris Johnson suffered another defeat late on Monday before the Parliament shut down for five weeks amid scenes of protests by opposition MPs.MPs for a second time rejected his bid to hold a general election in mid-October.Earlier in the day, with formal assent from the queen, an opposition-supported law went into effect compelling the government to ask the European Union for a three-month extension if no Brexit deal is worked out by Oct 19.That means no poll could be held until the end of November, at the earliest.The parliamentary session ended in acrimony as members held up signs saying "Silenced" and shouted "Shame!" as the shutdown began at about 1:30 am on Tuesday.The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, who earlier on Monday had announced his resignation from the post, was among those to voice his opposition to the lengthy suspension. He tore into the government whip in front of MPs, saying: "It is not standard, it is one of the longest for decades, and it represents, not just in the mind of many colleagues, but huge numbers of people outside, an act of executive fiat."Several MPs were also involved in an altercation near the speaker's chair, as they attempted to prevent Bercow leaving his seat and attending the House of Lords, the next step in the formalities required for the suspension of Parliament.Conservative MPs condemned the behavior as disrespectful. Political party conference season is now approaching and MPs not due back in Parliament until Oct 14, when a queen's speech will spell the start of a new session, but the existing deep divisions will likely still remain.Bercow announced that he will leave his posts as both Commons speaker and an MP within weeks, sparking a race among MPs to take over the crucial position. He told MPs he would stand aside on Oct 31.The Guardian newspaper said the proposed timing for Bercow's departure will be seen as a passing shot at his Brexiteer critics because it could improve the chances of a remain-supporting MP succeeding him.MPs expected to stand for the post include the deputy speakers Lindsay Hoyle and Eleanor Laing, Labour veterans Harriet Harman, Meg Hillier and Chris Bryant, and the Tory MP Henry Bellingham.According to The Telegraph, the Labour Party is considering a plan to vote down the queen's speech when MPs convene again on Oct 21 if no Brexit deal has been found.Opposition MPs would then table a motion of no-confidence, which, if passed, would pave the way for a general election in early December.Meanwhile, in an attempt to outmaneuver Labour, the Liberal Democrats are making moves to cancel Brexit altogether without a second referendum when a general election is held.The party will tell voters that if their MPs win a majority, they would revoke article 50 rather than postpone Brexit again to hold a referendum.The move would effectively sever the chances of an alliance with Labour at a forthcoming general election. "I relish the chance to take the fight to Boris Johnson in an election and I'm confident we'd make significant gains," said Jo Swinson, who was elected as the party's first female leader in July.

                    8 lost bronze relics return from Japan
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Treasures to be displayed at National Museum expo that opens on Sept 17 Eight lost pieces of Chinese bronze ware with a history of over 2,500 years were returned from Japan in August, the National Cultural Heritage Administration announced in a news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. In early March, the ritual artifacts from the early stages of Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC) appeared in an auction catalog in Tokyo. However, the ancient bronzes were believed to have been illegally taken out of China, according to Guan Qiang, deputy director of the administration. Guan said the administration immediately began investigating and found signs within three days that the pieces had been illegally excavated and smuggled overseas. "Their new patinas show the bronze items were excavated from underground in a recent period of time," Guan said. "We also found that this set of bronze ware had once appeared in Shanghai in 2014," he added. "And there is no record of them in any of the 21 import and export administrations of cultural relics nationwide." Through inscriptions on the artifacts - 330 characters in total - and comparison with similar artifacts discovered by archaeologists, this set of bronzes was shown to come from an earl's tomb corresponding to a Zeng vassal state in today's Hubei province, which lasted for over seven centuries from the early Western Zhou Dynasty (c.11th century-771 BC) through the Spring and Autumn Period to the mid-Warring States Period (475-221 BC). Diplomatic negotiations and a criminal investigation soon began to seek the return of the eight artifacts. The auction scheduled for March 12 was suspended by the Japanese auctioneer, who said the artifacts were involved in "a dispute over inheritance of family property". Gong Zhiyong, deputy director of the criminal investigation department under Ministry of Public Security, said a Shanghai resident surnamed Zhou, who was the auction client, emerged as the likely responsible party in the case. He agreed to hand over the artifacts in July, and the Chinese embassy in Tokyo received them on Aug 20. "Return of the artifacts is on the basis of international law and cooperation with the Japanese," Guan said. He called the UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, which was signed in 1970, a "milestone" in setting parameters for such cooperation. China joined the convention in 1989 and Japan in 2002. An expert panel, including scholars from Peking University, Hubei Provincial Museum and other institutions, studied the artifacts following their return and concluded they "filled a void in historical studies". The Zeng state, though missing from historical manuscripts, has become known through archaeological excavations since the 1960s. Still, mention of the Zeng earl named Kefu, cited by inscriptions on the returned bronzes, was never found on any items in previous archaeological research. "It's a crucial complement for academic research on the Zeng state, particularly on its rituals and the family tree," said Deng Chao, deputy director of the National Cultural Heritage Administration's office managing museums and privately-owned cultural relics. The bronzes, including a ding (cauldron), gui (food container), yan (steamer), ling (wine container), a pair of xu (oval food containers) and a pair of hu (pots), have been listed among the highest, level-one precious cultural relics. The cultural heritage administration said the returned treasures will be included in an upcoming major exhibition on the achievements of cultural relic repatriation since the founding of New China in 1949. The exhibition will open at the National Museum of China in Beijing on Sept 17 with a display of over 600 artifacts from around the nation. Some 150,000 Chinese cultural relics have been returned from overseas via 300 cases since 1949, the administration said. wangkaihao@chinadaily, com.cn (China Daily Global 09/11/2019 page3)
