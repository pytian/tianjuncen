                Chinese artists bring joy of Moon Festival to New Zealand audience
            </p>
            <p>
                WELLINGTON -- The Ode To The Moon Festival Gala between New Zealand and China was held with high quality performances to celebrate this year's Mid-Autumn Festival at the New Zealand National Museum on Sunday night.The Gala, co-hosted by the China Cultural Center in Wellington, the Chongqing Municipal Commission of Culture and Tourism and the Chongqing International Culture and Tourism Exchange Center, was part of the China-New Zealand Year of Tourism.Artists from southwestern China's Chongqing Three Gorges Operatic Troupe presented the Wellington audience with Sichuan Opera Performance with Face-changing, Pipa Solo, classic songs, festive songs, dances, stunning magic show, as well as Bamboo Qin show, a national-rated non-material cultural legacy in China.The performances by the Chinese artists perfectly showed the charm of Chinese culture and art to the audience. During the performance, applause and cheers came one after another.Guo Zongguang, director of the China Cultural Center in New Zealand, stressed that this show was one the most important events in this year's cultural exchanges between China and New Zealand."Our Ode to the Moon series is one of the three "tentpole" events in our yearly calendar, along with Happy Chinese New Year at the beginning of the year and China Culture Week in the middle of the year. The Ode to the Moon series of events are simultaneously celebrated by nearly 40 other China Cultural Centres around the world, helping connect and bring us all closer," said Guo.Brett Hudson, a member of Parliament, acknowledged that China, now New Zealand's largest trading partner, provided New Zealanders "thousands and thousands of jobs.""Our relationship with China is extremely important. Our two-way trade now tops 28 billion New Zealand dollars (17.86 billion U.S. dollars) in 2018, that is thousands and thousands of jobs for New Zealanders to improve life styles for families, because we have a strong relationship, and it is strengthening even further through cultural exchange and better understanding of one another," Hudson said.The Moon Festival, or the Mid-Autumn Festival, is a harvest festival celebrated in China and usually falls in September or October, on the 15th day of the eighth month of the Chinese lunar calendar.

                The magic of finding an ancient civilization in your backyard
            </a>
            <p>
                It's one thing to see history on display behind a museum glass and another to experience it right beneath the soles of your hiking shoes, just as my husband Jun and I did one afternoon while wandering the hills within sight of the family home in rural Zhejiang.That ridge, one of a chain of undulating hills that encircled the village, looked like every other we had climbed before. It had the usual assortment of bamboo, pines and rhododendrons in its canopy. And the sinuous trail we followed swept through the same tangles of bracken ferns, satintail grasses, mugwort and clover we always walked through on our hikes.But at a small clearing on top, we discovered an astonishing marble historical marker, etched with Chinese characters designating the fertile ground beneath our feet the site of a civilization that flourished 4,000 to 5,000 years ago.How could such a seemingly ordinary ridge hold such an extraordinary secret? The marker offered scant introduction to the civilization, beyond that it thrived during the Neolithic Age and occupied the crest of that hill. Still, even this historical crumb left behind by a team of archaeologists thrilled me more than gazing upon one of China's national treasures in a museum, because we had stumbled upon it right in the backyard of the village where my husband grew up.According to Jun, nobody in town had ever mentioned the existence of an ancient find in the hills. As I surveyed the scene surrounding the marker, I wondered, what was this civilization like back in its day? How did they live? Were any of the stones visible around the area evidence of their society as well? Could these people have been Jun's ancestors?Later, when searching for online information about the site, we learned that archaeologists had discovered a cache of broken pieces of ancient pottery there, including the legs of ding caldrons.The team believed this site belonged to Zhejiang's Liangzhu Culture, which recently gained recognition after UNESCO added the archaeological ruins of Liangzhu City to its World Heritage list on July 6.The scattered pottery fragments recovered by the team, shown in an online photograph, reminded me of lost puzzle pieces forgotten over time, much like the ridge top itself, whose trails were disappearing into the brush as fewer people roamed them. If the find truly represented Liangzhu Culture, it would only stand with a tiny footnote in history and could never compare to the stunning jade discs that drew countless visitors to the Liangzhu Museum in Hangzhou.But I didn't mind that our site would never make headlines or rank as one of the greatest finds of the century, because it held a different kind of magic.That archaeological discovery represented a part of China's glorious 5,000 years of history, and it just happened to emerge from an otherwise unremarkable hill that had quietly witnessed generations of my husband's family thrive in the village. It's not every day that we encounter such tangible traces of the ancient past in places we have called home.But when we do, it reminds us that history is hidden all around, even where we least expect it, such as while hiking through just another ridgetop in rural Zhejiang.Contact the writer at jocelyn@chinadaily.com.cn

                Documentary details lives of nation's plants
            </a>
            <p>
                A documentary presenting the life journeys of 28 species of plants will be aired soon on multiple TV channels.The documentary, The Journey of Chinese Plants, released by the International Horticultural Exhibition, will have 10 episodes running for 50 minutes each, covering tea plants, mulberry, rice, soybeans, bamboo, flowers and gardens. It is also the longest 4k digital documentary nationwide.Zhou Jianping, executive deputy director of the expo coordination bureau, said the series discusses how plants have affected the world and have brought people back to nature."We hope audiences can better understand the values of ecological awareness and human-nature coexistence," Zhou said.The production team spent nearly three years completing the series, which involved more than 200 people.Li Chengcai, chief director of the documentary, said 133 photographers visited 93 regions in 27 provinces and autonomous regions in China, as well as seven countries including the United Kingdom, New Zealand, India and Japan.He said the documentary captured the large-scale primitive forests in the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon for the first time and traced the origin of Chinese tea plants near the region. Flowers planted at the highest mountain elevation in China were also recorded."To make plants the main shooting subject was a challenge for me," Li said. "But it was also an opportunity to make me review and rethink the meaning of living things.""I have more respect for nature and creatures through the process of using cameras to record the stories of the plants and through building up life archives for the plants via images," he added.Zhou said the documentary is an important part of the expo, as the exhibition was themed as "Live Green, Live Better" and features a vast collection of flowers, fruit trees, Chinese herbal medicine and plant landscaping techniques, as well as many ideas for green development.The expo, which runs until Oct 7, has attracted more than 110 countries and international organizations, as well as 120 nongovernmental organizations and provincial or local exhibitions.In early June, the expo welcomed more than 2 million visitors, and the 162-day event is poised to host an expected 16 million people from home and abroad.

                What I've learned in China
            </a>
            <p>
                On the tarmac of Pudong International Airport, through the window, I immediately realized that the seas and great distances could keep individuals prisoners of discoveries and therefore knowledge. From Conakry, the capital of the Republic of Guinea, to Shanghai Pudong International Airport, everything seemed different, and nothing seemed to be the same. Tossed around by the airport services and in contact with the foreign Chinese language, a feeling of shock and hallucination overwhelmed me. As for the hollow feeling in my belly, I could no longer discern it as I took those first steps to reach my destination: a university located in Jinhua, Zhejiang province.The university’s northern gate, known in Chinese as the beimen, is now associated with a life of small businesses of all kinds, which can satisfy all students, Chinese and foreign alike. Restaurants, hair salons and manicures for young women, creameries and cafés abound. A whole New York-style life replaces that of a Chinese cowboy town from 4 pm. All the young people – black, yellow and white -- mix together like a cosmopolitan district. Once again, it feels like an open fashion show all over the world. At the northern gate, everyone finds a taste for appreciating the much loved perimeter, and it is here that the first contacts with Chinese third parties outside of the university are made. Since I’ve hardly prepared much food, I then spotted a restaurant offering quality meals at a low price. That's where I've been eating for over two years. And since habits are hard to break, I can no longer go a day without eating the food. All the staff members know me. As soon as we enter the restaurant, these hardworking people flash their smiles when they hear my Chinese name: masa, masa, masa!Yiwu, the city located less than 50 kilometers from Jinhua that includes my university, is also a center for international trade. The Frenchman Bernard de la Villardière used all the superlatives in the attempt to describe Yiwu’s market during his presentation in Enquête Exclusive. The night market of Yiwu, a long corridor extending over a kilometer where merchants of all kinds gather together, has a frenetic atmosphere until 2 am. Most Africans think that the Chinese have discovered everything that is edible in nature, and the market serves up some fascinating proof for this. I discovered a line in this night bazaar selling only unusual foods. They dished up insects of all kinds. I observed the hardworking salesman, fighting against the smoke he was struggling to control on his apron of scorpion skewers, a rather popular street food. In Yiwu, the variety of foods I witnessed has had a profound effect on me -- as a Chinese saying goes, seeing once is worth hearing something a hundred times. Since in China you have to do like the Chinese, I have expanded my food choices, adding bamboo and giant frog. These are excellent dishes that I will not hesitate to eat when the opportunity arises again.My stay in China has proved a life-changing experience. As a Guinean with an education between the traces of a dying Mandinka tradition and a strong dose of Islam, I’ve had to learn so much in this country all over again. Living in China and trying to understand certain cultural and social codes requires the same precepts as those of the wise Mandinka, who says to his new student: "If you want to know who I am, stop being what you are and forget everything you know." So you can see why I’ve described my stay in China as a rebirth.Because China is a vast and diverse country, the great harmony shown by its society deserves praise. The very life of the individual being a journey is made up of challenges that are both happy and dangerous. But nothing is to be lost, because each experience gives way to learning. For me, China is a lesson that I will never stop revising and using until my last breath.Keita Moussa is a student researcher at the Institute of African Studies, Zhejiang Normal University.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                China remains reliable supplier of global fashion brands amid trade tensions with US
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW YORK - With its high efficiency, research and development capacity as well as a mature transport and logistics services, China's textile and apparel industry remains the most reliable suppliers of global fashion brands despite potential supply chain disturbances from the ongoing China-US trade tensions.This was a key message shared by industry insiders at the 20th China Textile and Apparel Trade Show at New York's Javits Center in late July.Over 500 Chinese garment, fabric and textile companies, plus other 300 companies from 16 countries and regions attended the show, which was held in parallel with Home Textiles Sourcing, Apparel Sourcing USA and Texworld USA expos.Unparalleled production capacityThere were only 192 Chinese exhibitors when the China-featured trade show debuted in the United States at Pier 92 along Hudson River in June 2000, recalled Xu Yingxin, vice-president of China National Textile and Apparel Council (CNTAC).In the past 20 years, Xu said, China has established the most complete industry value chain in the textile and apparel business.Chinese industry players now cover supply of raw materials, designing and development, weaving, dyeing and processing, garment making as well as operation and retail, he said."This is one of the big strengths for the Chinese industry and part of why China is the top supplier and we think China will remain the top supplier," said Julia K. Hughes, president of US Fashion Industry Association (USFIA).The year 2018 saw China processing 54.6 million tons of fibers, accounting for half of the world's total, and exporting $276.73 billion in textile and apparel, or 36 percent of the world's total, showed the CNTAC statistics."No other country or region in the world could match China's enormous production capacity in the textile and apparel industry in the foreseeable future," said the 6th annual Fashion Industry Benchmarking Study, penned by Sheng Lu, associate professor at the Department of Fashion and Apparel Studies of the University of Delaware, in cooperation with the USFIA."There is no problem for China's textile and apparel industry to keep competitiveness for at least ten years given Chinese unrivaled output of chemical fiber, lower costs of raw materials, sound talent and technological resources as well as one of the most dynamic and biggest domestic market in the world, " said Li Bo, vice-president of China Textile Information Center.Moving up value chainThe Chinese textile manufacturers are "proactively" moving toward automation and smart production through technological innovation, and nurturing indigenous brands to "move up the value chain," noted Xu.Ma Jiaqiang, head of home textile division with Jihua 3542 Textile Co Ltd, said his company has long set up its own laboratory and a nation-level technological center in Xiangyang, Hubei province in Central China.The company exhibited multiple functional fabrics like bamboo tencel and modal, as well as fabrics containing pearl, coconut and coffee fibers, which offer extra care for skin, remove peculiar smell or restrain bacteria."We're the earliest to develop such functional fabrics in the market, and we remain unchallenged in comparison with competitors," said Ma.Hou Chunshui, a sales manager with Shandong Charming Hometextile Company Limited, said the company, which specializes in fabrication of bed linens, cushions and coverlets, has been constantly updating their original designs to stay attractive to global buyers.Rory O'Mara, CEO and owner of e-commerce platform Saphyr Home, which offers linen and cotton bedding products, said she got her best choice from Hou's company.Cashmere yarn exporter Consinee has invested $80 million with its partners to realize the unmanned automatic operation of the entire process of transporting, loading, locking, pressing, dyeing, dehydrating, unloading and drying of raw materials. The production line will become highly automated.The ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China "actually is pushing Chinese manufacturers to move up more upscale" and "shift their production away from products that don't need to be made in China," said Hughes."That's actually going to make China more competitive in the long run," she added.Expanding global footprintChinese textile and apparel players are also expanding their presence in Southeast Asia, Africa, Americas in a bid to seize new market opportunities and reduce risks.Like what happened in developed economies, Li said, "it's a natural trend for China to transfer labor-intensive businesses outside of the country and retain the parts with high added value or technologies."Chinese textile and apparel companies' investment in the United States picked up 20.7 percent in 2018 and the accumulative investment in the United States totaled $214 million from 2015 to 2018, according to the CNTAC.Xiaofeng Li, managing director of Nantong Fenglan Textile Co Ltd, added two plants in Bangladesh in 2012 while maintaining operation of his own production capacity in China."We have plants in China, Cambodia as well as Central and South America and registered a company in the United States," said Simon Lu, managing director of Feiya America Inc..The arrangement could allow customers to collect their orders at the warehouse of Feiya America Inc. in Florida and it only take three or four days to ship products to the United States from its plants in Central and South America, according to Lu."China is here to stay"The tariffs battle with the US will do little to shake China's role as a dominant textile and apparel supplier for the US market with only 6.7 percent of respondents expecting to decrease sourcing from China significantly in the next two years, a recent industry survey found.With silk and cashmere products at its core, it is really difficult for US fashion brand Vince to source outside of China for reasons of supply chain, skill-sets and many others, said Mark Engebretson, executive vice president of global operations with Vince in a recent interview with Xinhua.Vince works with just a few suppliers in China and this makes Vince and its Chinese suppliers highly dependent on each other."China isn't gone away. It's here to stay." Engebretson said."Now, we just offer a bottom price to our US customers and would not bear any additional costs," Whiskey Zhang, manager of Chinese company Tongxiang Yuhang Fur Product Co Ltd told Xinhua at Texworld USA."US importers have no choice but to bear most of the costs as only China has such a complete industry value chain in fur business," he said.Nicolas Becerra, director of sourcing/fabric & new source development at Weissman, a company that makes costumes such as ballet wear, said "no place can beat" Shaoxing, a city in eastern China's Zhejiang province, in terms of "product quality, price, service, and flexibility.""If tariffs go up, we'll have to raise price, so does every one of our competitors. Consumers will have to pay more," said Becerra.

                How violence has disrupted Hong Kong over last 2 months
            </a>
            <p>
                HONG KONG - Starting from June, Hong Kong's opposition and some radical forces have used the pretext of peaceful demonstration to engage in violent protests.Though the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government said, on many occasions, that it has completely halted the amendments of two ordinances concerning the transfer of fugitive offenders, protesters continued to escalate violence and cause mayhem in Hong Kong.Here is a timeline of these violent activities that are aimed to trample the rule of law, sabotage social order, undermine national sovereignty and the "one country, two systems" principle.CHALLENGING GOVERNANCE AUTHORITYThe demonstrations, which started in June, repeatedly became violent clashes under the instigation of individuals with ulterior motives. Some radicals repeatedly mounted attacks on police. They surrounded Hong Kong police headquarters, disrupted government agencies and ransacked the Legislative Council (LegCo) building.-- On June 9, demonstrators started to protest against the proposed amendments. In the wee hours of June 10, well-organized radical protesters started attacking the LegCo building, blocking roads and assaulting police officers. They clashed with police, with some attempting to rob officers of their guns. Eight policemen were injured.-- On June 12, an illegal rally started around Admiralty, and some radical members stayed around the LegCo building until midnight. Well-organized protesters assaulted officers with bricks, home-made spears and even petrol bombs, injuring 22 police officers. Though police exercised restraint, the protesters continually assaulted their line of defense and forced police to use appropriate force to disperse demonstrators.-- On June 21, even after the HKSAR government announced that it had halted the amendments, violence continued. Extremist protesters surrounded police headquarters and wreaked havoc, and blocked the public from using service at the Revenue Tower and the Immigration Tower. Then they blocked Hong Kong government offices and the High Court.-- On June 26, a few 'fanatics' instigated demonstrators to storm police headquarters for the second time. They repeated similar savage behaviors. Opposition lawmakers were once again present to provide support. The personal data of some police officers was illegally leaked online.-- On July 1, rioters blocked roads and threw corrosive liquids at police officers. They ransacked the LegCo building and assailed police with toxic chemical powder. They extensively damaged the council chamber, defaced HKSAR regional emblem, tore up the Basic Law, waved a colonial-era flag and even called for an establishment of a so-called "interim government".DISTURBING SOCIAL ORDERHong Kong's social disorder worsened in July, as aggressive members unlawfully assembled or launched more demonstrations in various districts of Hong Kong. Violence spread further, affecting the normal lives of more residents.-- On July 6, disputes broke out in Tuen Mun district between protesters and residents. Residents were besieged, beaten and kicked by radicals. Protesters occupied roads and sieged Tuen Mun police station.-- On July 7, protesters organized another demonstration in Kowloon, leading to a 50-percent plunge in passengers through West Kowloon high-speed train station, compared with an average weekend. Only 31,000 passengers traveled through the station on that day. After the demonstration, some radical protesters illegally blocked roads in Tsim Sha Tsui, forcing most shops to close early in the once trendy shopping area.-- On July 13, a demonstration in Sheung Shui district ended with violent clashes with the police. A few radical protesters dismantled iron bars, blocked main roads, beat and attacked police officers with umbrellas, iron bars, suspected toxic powders and corrosive liquids. At least 16 police officers were injured. At night, the radical members continued to sabotage stores in the district. The police then launched a clearance operation in accordance with the law.-- On July 14, some radical protesters removed the roadside fence in Sha Tin district to block roads, sharpened bamboo branches as weapons, hurled bricks, umbrellas and other debris at police officers from high buildings. Fierce clashes broke out at New Town Plaza, injuring at least 10 police officers. An officer in plain clothes was attacked by a mob. Some officers were left with facial fractures. One police officer's finger was bitten off.-- On July 27, though the Hong Kong police had issued a notice of objection, some people assembled illegally at the Yuen Long district. A group of radical protesters illegally cut off traffic, sieged police vehicles, smashed car windows and smeared cars with insulting words. Police officers were deployed at the village entrances to prevent conflicts between protesters and villagers. Several radical protesters also sieged the Yuen Long police station, forcing the report room to suspend service. Opposition lawmakers were once again present to support the violent acts.-- On July 28, a number of radical protesters carried out illegal demonstrations in the central and western parts of Hong Kong Island, seriously hindering traffic. They dug up pavement bricks, destroyed street signs and lampposts, set fires on multiple roads and charged police lines. Violence again escalated, as some people carried lethal weapons such as bows and arrows and petrol bombs.UNDERMINING "ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS" PRINCIPLEA group of extreme radicals stormed the offices of the Central Government in Hong Kong, insulted the national emblem and flag of China, undermined national sovereignty and dignity and the "one country, two systems" principle.-- On July 21, radical protesters besieged and attacked the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government, defaced the national emblem in front of the building by hurling eggs and black paintballs, damaged security facilities and scrawled graffiti insulting the nation.They even raved about forming an "interim legislature" in a statement read out on the scene.-- On July 28 and Aug 4, some radical protesters mounted more attacks at the liaison office but were thwarted by riot police.-- On Aug 3 and on Aug 5, black-clad and masked extreme radicals twice ripped the Chinese national flag off the pole in Tsim Sha Tsui, flung it into the sea, in clear defiance of national sovereignty.On July 26, police arrested a suspect on suspicion of desecrating the national emblem.

                Parks help lift the spirits of city dwellers
            </a>
            <p>
                TBILISI - Sad city dwellers should seek solace in a local park, according to a survey tracking tweets that showed a walk in leafy surroundings lifts morale among Twitter users. Trees in cities are already credited with cooling and cleaning the air, along with absorbing planet-warming gases, but a team of researchers from the University of Vermont in the United States found they also increase happiness. "Visiting parks leads people to being happier," the survey's lead researcher, Aaron Schwartz, told Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. The authors scanned thousands of Twitter messages posted by more than 4,600 people from 160 parks and other leafy areas, like squares and playgrounds, in San Francisco between May and August 2016 for words indicating glee and elation. The posts were then compared with messages the same users sent out before and after the green stroll.  People in Chengdu city, Sichuan province, stroll in Wangjianglou Park, where there are a variety of trees such as bamboo and pine, as well as bridges and pavilions on the southern bank of Jinjiang River, in mid-August. Liu Guoxing / For China Daily People enjoy a pool of fresh fragrance and beautiful views of lotus flowers at the Urban Center Wetland Park of Qianguan in Dalian city, Liaoning province, in July. Liu Debin / For China DailyThey found that, on average, people used happier words and expressed less negativity while visiting a park and for up to four hours afterward. The greener and bigger the park, the happier the tweets, the researchers say in the first-of-its-kind survey published in the journal People and Nature. The analysis was based on an online tool known as hedonometer, which ranks more than 10,000 common English terms on a scale from one to nine based on their happiness value. "Laughter" is the happiest word on the scale, with a score of 8.5, followed by "happiness" and "love", while "trapped", "kill" and "jail" rank toward the bottom. Overall, tweets sent from under a tree were 2.5 percent happier than the average, a jump that although numerically small, Schwartz described as "pretty big". " (It) is about the equivalent increase that Twitter as a whole experiences on Christmas Day," he says. The holiday was the happiest day of the year on the social media platform, according to earlier research based on the hedonometer, which collects about 50 million tweets each day and scores those written in English, he explains. Although not everybody uses Twitter, the platform's demographic is quite wide and analysis based on it could provide valuable insights into the moods of a large group of people, the researchers say. With the United Nations estimating two-thirds of the world's population will live in cities by 2050, the survey's findings had important implications for city planners and health officials, the researchers say. From Montreal to Barcelona many cities are already looking at trees as a way to tackle climate change and pollution, says Donna Hume, the head of campaigns at the C40 cities climate leadership group's network. "With so many people in the world's biggest cities suffering from ever hotter streets and polluted air, mayors are turning to trees and re-wilding to create havens for people that help our planet breathe as well," she says. Schwartz says he hopes the research would provide them with extra incentives to go green and information on what type of green to prioritize, as results suggested large, lush parks were the most beneficial for mental health. Supporting the findings, Marcus Collie, a botany expert at Trinity College Dublin, says: "Though this is a Twitter study, and therefore comes with inherent bias... it nevertheless shows a positive trend that we have long suspected - contact with nature can make you happier. "So, if you can 'prescribe' a visit to nature, and this is happening on a daily basis, you can achieve a lot of health benefits at practically no personal cost. Plus, your dog and your kids will thank you!" Xinhua (China Daily Global 09/11/2019 page15)

                Program celebrating World Bamboo Day launched at International Horticultural Exhibition
            </a>
            <p>
                On Sept 19, the International Bamboo and Rattan Organization (INBAR) and the Dragonfly Design Center co-organized a series of activities at the INBAR pavilion in the International Horticultural Exhibition 2019 in Beijing.Wang Chuncheng, deputy director-general of Beijing International Horticultural Exhibition Coordination Bureau, Zeng Hui, director of Art Design and deputy director of the Organizing Committee of Beijing International Design Week, and Professor Lu Wenming, deputy director-general of INBAR, attended the event.With the theme "A Promising Material," the day-long program, a perfect manifestation of the exhibition's slogan "Live Green, Live Better," explored the various aspects of bamboo, including new material R&D, new design applications and industrial development.As a satellite program of the Beijing Design Week, the exhibition and activities aimed to showcase bamboo as a low-carbon, eco-friendly and future-facing design material that will help us face and tackle the challenges of climate change and environmental pollution, and as a carrier of culture, inspiration and sustainable living, organizers said.September 18 marked the 11th World Bamboo Day, which was founded with hope to raise awareness for environmental protection and the sustainable use of natural resources."A Promising Material" took place on September 19, for the number 919 is a homophone for "to save" and therefore conveys our plea to the planet, organizers said.As the world is faced with the existential threat of global warming and our ecosystem devastated by the increasing amount of non-biodegradable wastes, many countries have taken the action to issue plastic bag bans, implement waste-sorting policies and seek new, eco-friendly materials like bamboo, they said.Known for its biodegradable, non-polluting qualities, bamboo represents the future of green living, and has been gaining favorable attention from designers, manufacturers and policy-makers worldwide.The current lack of new bamboo materials means that the research into the applications of bamboo needs to continue, they added.To this end, Zeng Hui, Professor Fei Benhua, executive deputy-director general, International Center for Bamboo and Rattan, Fu Jinhe, coordinator of INBAR Regional Office in East Africa, Jeff Shi Dayu, founder and creative director of Dragonfly Design Center, Huang Chao, general manager of Hunan Bamboo Sea Carbon Source Biotechnology Co Ltd, gathered together as part of the program, sharing their insights and inspirations while carrying out in-depth discussions on the development, application and design of new bamboo materials.
