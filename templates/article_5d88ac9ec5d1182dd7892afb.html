                    Turkmenistan opens first China visa center
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Turkmenistan's first visa center in China opened Wednesday in Beijing to supplement the traditional visa application process at the embassy, as the country grasps tourism opportunities brought by the Belt and Road Initiative.The visa center was established to boost cultural and economic exchanges between China and Turkmenistan, further enhancing their cooperation in various fields.In the past, trade between Turkmenistan and China was mainly focused on oil because of the former's abundant natural resources. With the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative, the ancient Central Asian country is also able to benefit from China's booming tourism market."Last year, fewer than 20,000 Chinese tourists traveled from China to Turkmenistan. There is huge market potential. The newly established visa center offers more convenience to travelers, serving as a bridge between China and Turkmenistan," said You Xiangdong, general manager of Beijing Shuangxiong Foreign Service Co, the operator of the visa center.You noted that the Turkmen government is very optimistic about the Chinese market. "This year, three groups of officials from Turkmenistan's tourism bureau went to China to tackle the tourism market. We are now working on a plan to gather efforts from both Chinese and Turkmen governments and travel agencies to open up the market."According to You, in the initial stages, the company plans to invest roughly 6 million yuan ($886,000) per year into the program, and leading travel agencies from China and Turkmenistan will also get involved.Xing Xiaoliang, a tourism analyst at Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys International, said: "The Belt and Road Initiative promotes China's outbound tourism to a large extent, bringing new destinations. Many travel agencies have already launched related tourism products.""In contrast to countries and regions that are part of the Maritime Silk Road, such as Thailand, Turkmenistan, which belongs to the continental Silk Road, offers tourists different cultural and consumer experiences, fully satisfying their curiosity."For Turkmenistan, the infrastructure construction, products and services related to local tourism are at a primary stage. There is plenty of room for growth," Xing said.

            <p class="style-content">
                MOSCOW - Russia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan signed an agreement Sunday for collective use of the Caspian sea after two decades of negotiations, the Kremlin said.The presidents of the five states inked the landmark convention on the legal status of the Caspian Sea at the Fifth Caspian Summit in the Kazakh city of Aktau.Russian President Vladimir Putin said the convention "fixes the exclusive right and responsibility of our states for the fate of the Caspian Sea and establishes clear rules for its collective use", according to a Kremlin transcript.The document clearly regulates the issues of necessary delimitation, navigation and fishing regimes, fixes the principles of military-political interaction of the participating countries and guarantees the use of Caspian Sea exclusively for peaceful purposes, Putin said.According to the Russian president, the necessary regulatory base for the settlement of the legal status of the Caspian Sea will be provided by six agreements in the spheres of economy, transport and security, which were also signed on Sunday.In particular, on the basis of the agreement on economic cooperation in the Caspian, priority will be given to building up regional trade and economic ties and deepening close and mutually beneficial cooperation.Putin also outlined the prospects of cooperation between the Caspian states in the spheres of tourism, ecology and conservation of bio-resources, suppression of drug trafficking as well as prevention and liquidation of emergency situations, the Kremlin said."We need to make full use of the possibilities of the convention and signed documents to stimulate trade and economic relations between the coastal states," Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarabyev was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying.He also said that the five states have agreed to sign an agreement on confidence-building measures in the military sector, in a bid to ensure the arms balance in the region and strengthen regional security and stability.Works on the convention have been in development since 1996, and the foreign ministers of five states reached a consensus on its draft in Moscow in December 2017.

                    Turkmenistan levels up in global gaming revolution
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                ASHGABAT, Turkmenistan - Turkmenistan is dipping its toe into the world of e-sports having got a taste for gaming at a showcase sporting event it held last year.The traditionally reclusive Central Asian country is in the process of forming a national e-sports team that will represent it in events devoted to Counter-Strike, Dota 2, Hearthstone and other popular titles.Denis Oglodin, who plays under the moniker Den4EZ, has already earned the right to wear the republic's colors after his five-man team triumphed in a national contest for Dota 2 - a multiplayer battle game - on Friday."I've been into computers since I was four. Now I spend 12-15 hours behind a computer," Oglodin, a 17-year-old student at an IT college in Ashgabat, said."My parents understand me and aren't bothered by it. My goal (in gaming) is money and glory," he said.Boom time That e-sports has arrived in Turkmenistan, a country of around five million people which was practically offline just over a decade ago, testifies to gaming's global pull.The multi-billion dollar industry has even attracted interest from the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou could see medals doled out for gaming.For Emil Gasanov, who at 38 is the oldest member of the team that will represent Turkmenistan in a forthcoming Central Asian tournament, gaming's growing global prestige is exciting to see."My hobby has turned into a profession," says Gasanov, who founded one of the capital Ashgabat's first video-game clubs in 1998 and now coaches younger gamers like Oglodin for a privately sponsored cyber collective called Galkynysh.Some of the players from Galkynysh competed in an exhibition e-sports tournament held in Ashgabat in 2017.Hello, internet Turkmenistan's e-sports adventure was given a boost by the creation of a new national federation earlier this year that has backing from the culture and sports ministry.Its chief, Mekan Eyeberdiev, estimates that there are several thousand e-sports enthusiasts in the country, 70 percent of whom are students at schools and universities."Our task is to popularize this sport in Turkmenistan," Eyeberdiev said, adding that he expected "conservative views" of gaming as a hobby rather than a sport to fade over time.Obstacles to the growth of a national gaming culture include internet speeds and costs in an economically depressed country.Now authorities claim there are over two million internet users, but a standard fixed-line connection of 256 kilobytes per second costs around 190 manats ($54) per month for Ashgabat residents, which is prohibitive for many Turkmen.Overall, however, Turkmenistan could be climbing aboard the e-sports train at just the right time.Vitalii Volochai, a Ukrainian sportscaster with 10 years of experience commentating on Dota 2 tournaments, says the World Electronic Sports Games held for the first time in January last year are offering gamers from smaller countries a chance to shine that they did not have before.The event, backed by Chinese tech giant Alibaba, is the closest thing e-sports has to a soccer World Cup, with players competing in national teams and battling for a prize pot of up to $1.5 million per competition.Dota 2's equivalent of the Champions League, The International, offers even greater winnings than that.Given the tight censorship in Turkmenistan, it is perhaps surprising that the state is throwing its weight behind e-sports, some of which features graphic violence.That is something that bothers the IOC, whose president Thomas Bach has spoken of a "red line" for games involving killing while remaining generally upbeat on the possibility of e-sports' Olympic inclusion.Volochai says the debate over Olympic recognition is not something most gamers are losing sleep over, however."We don't really need the IOC or Olympics - they need us," he said.Agence France - presse

                MOSCOW -- Russia will not take an active position in negotiating new arms control treaties, but will wait for response from the West to its numerous initiatives in this sphere, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Wednesday."There is no shortage of initiatives related to these issues that we sent to our US and Western NATO colleagues," Lavrov told reporters after a meeting with his Turkmen counterpart Rasit Meredow in Turkmenistan's capital city of Ashgabat.His statement was broadcast directly by the Russian Foreign Ministry.Lavrov recalled that Russia had repeatedly reminded its Western partners of its initiatives and called for a start of talks without delay, in particular, on issues related to the possible extension of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START 3), which expires in 2021.However, as there was no reaction from Western partners, including the United States, Russian President Vladimir Putin gave instructions not to take an active position and "calmly wait when and if our Western partners are ripe to respond to proposals that had long been sent to them on the whole range of problems of strategic stability," Lavrov said.The United States has announced its withdrawal from Feb 2 from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, a benchmark arms limitation agreement signed in 1987.US President Donald Trump in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night said that Washington is ready to consider an agreement replacing the INF Treaty with a greater number of participants.
