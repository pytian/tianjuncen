                            US President Donald Trump has moved to revoke California's right to set its own vehicle-emissions standards, drawing criticism from state officials who said such a move is an attack on states' right and a blow to the global warming fight. There will be very little difference in emissions between the California Standard and the new US Standard, but the cars will be far safer and much less expensive," Trump wrote in a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday.California's tighter emissions standards are followed by 13 other states, which represents roughly a third of the national auto market, according to The New York Times

It said on Thursday in its determination that federal law preempts state and local regulation of vehicle fuel economy, including California's greenhouse gas vehicle emissions rules that are followed by about a dozen other states.The Trump administration is seeking to reverse decades of precedent that has allowed California a national role in deciding what Americans drive as it regulated vehicle emissions

                             But six weeks into the practice that prompted a domestic and international outcry, Trump reversed course and announced that his administration would stop separating families unless the parents pose "a risk" to their child. But the ACLU says that only a small number of the more than 900 children taken from their parents since June of last year were at risk and have deplored the conditions in which the youngsters are held. "The impact of separation can be particularly devastating for young children," the complaint said, urging the court to clarify the standard by which children can be separated from their parents

Since he reportedly discussed specific disarmament steps that the DPRK could promise at the Vietnam summit and corresponding measures the US would be willing to take, the bargaining on who will do what in return for what seems to be getting down to the necessary nitty-gritty.There appears to be a real need on both sides for the negotiations to move forward in order for such engagement to continue making sense

While bringing US servicemen and women home from the dangerous war zones of Syria does honor another of the US president's campaign promises, giving him one more chance to repeat the claim "promise kept", doing it in such a rash manner may create more problems than it solves. For one thing, despite Trump's claim of "historic victories" against the Islamic State extremists in Syria, many at the Pentagon reportedly disagree with the conclusion that the IS terrorist organization has been defeated

The storm looks like it could be a very, very big one indeed," the president said

The bill-signing prompted a round of applause from first responders in the Rose Garden as well as Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who was mayor of New York City during the attacks and was widely praised for his leadership in the aftermath of the World Trade Center collapse

There are many intertwined issues between China and the US (and the West in general) but the core issue is how the world (including China itself) should comprehend and cope with the rise of China and its technological giants

An editorial in the Japan Times said the US and Iran are too entrenched and the changes demanded are too great. The newspaper continued that both Iran and the US have given Abe an opportunity to make the case for direct engagement, but all he can propose are general principles and vouch for the other side's good will

                            Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly argued for avoiding long-term conflicts in the Middle East, discounted a New York Times report that the US has updated plans that could send up to 120,000 troops to counter Iran if it attacked US forces.Instead of military strike, he said the US has decided to target Iran with economic measures as the former has enacted more sanctions.Disputes involving Teheran not always military related, expert saysIt is unlikely the United States will start a war with Iran, although the tension has escalated between the two sides and the international community worries that the US is sliding toward war with Iran
