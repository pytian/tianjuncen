                CAAM: More action needed to boost car sales
            </p>
            <p>
                Industry body calls on authorities to implement government guidelinesOfficials at China's leading auto industry association are calling for local authorities to implement the central government's guidelines for boosting car consumption in the wake of vehicle sales in the country having fallen for 13 months in a row as of the end of July.Overall vehicle sales in the world's biggest vehicle market stood at 1.8 million in July, falling 4.3 percent from the same month last year, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.Total sales in the first seven months of this year totaled 14.13 million, down 11.4 percent year-on-year.The association expects the fall to become less severe in coming months because of a lower comparable base figure from the second half of last year and because of the measures implemented to help with car consumption.It estimated that China's vehicle sales would drop 5 percent this year from 2018 to 26.68 million vehicles. It has also trimmed its forecast for a rise in new energy vehicle sales to 1.5 million from a forecast of 1.6 million made at the start of the year."However, we haven't seen many local governments come up with specific measures to implement the guidelines," said Xu Haidong, a deputy secretary-general of the CAAM, when the association released the latest sales figures last week.The central government has since January been trying to boost consumption of a wide range of goods including vehicles, asking local authorities to offer subsidies or other forms of assistance and more importantly ease restrictions on purchasing and using vehicles, especially new energy ones.

                NEV makers called on to act in boosting residual value of used vehicles
            </a>
            <p>
                The China Automobile Dealers Association is calling for carmakers to help with the residual value of second-hand new energy vehicles, which is much lower than that of gasoline cars.Earlier this month, the association released its latest report on the residual value ratio of the vehicles on sale in the Chinese market in July.The report revealed that secondhand plug-in hybrid electric vehicles had a residual value ratio of 45.5 percent last month, while used fully electric vehicles had a ratio of 33.5 percent.The low residual value ratio of the used new energy vehicles in July is not an independent phenomenon. The trend has lasted for months.Previous data released by the association show the residual value ratio of second-hand hybrids was 45.8 percent in June, 46.4 percent in May and 47.5 percent in April.As for used full electric vehicles, the residual value ratio was even lower. The numbers tallied 34.2 percent in June, 32.4 percent in May and 28.8 percent in April.From the perspective of the new energy vehicle brands, Tesla, BYD and BMW ranked at the top last month in terms of the residual value ratio.The Tesla Model S had a residual value ratio of 60.9 percent last month, the BYD Tang DM tallied 50.8 percent and the plug-in hybrid version of BMW 5 Series had 47 percent.However, when it comes to conventional fuel vehicles, Toyota ranked first among joint venture brands in July with a residual value ratio of 74.4 percent.Honda had a residual value ratio of 73.8 percent, ranking second and witnessing a growth of 0.5 percentage points from June.Baojun, Changan and Great Wall Motors' Haval were top among Chinese brands. Baojun had a residual value ratio of 64.4 percent last month, while Changan tallied 59.8 percent and Haval 59.1 percent.With the introduction of new-generation plug-in hybrids and electric cars, it is difficult for previous vehicles to maintain their values, insiders said. The market performance is similar to electronic products.The report released by the association cited that besides rapid replacement, the lack of disposal channels results in low trading volume of the second-hand new energy vehicles.In an effort to solve the problem, the association has appealed to automakers for improving the residual value management of used new energy vehicles, suggesting that the officially certified second-hand vehicles be applicable for used new energy cars.Data show that there have been some 30 automakers conducting the business of officially certified second-hand vehicles since 2002.According to the report, the mechanism of officially certified vehicles has its advantages, including reducing the purchase threshold of target customers, boosting new car sales and stabilizing the brand value."The business model of officially certified vehicles could be a solution for the new energy vehicle makers, but not now," said Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consulting firm Automotive Foresight.The primary task for new energy carmakers should be improving the quality of their products, which directly affects consumers' confidence in buying a new car and a second-hand one, Zhang added.

                Overseas opportunities to boost used car sales
            </a>
            <p>
                China's carmakers look to other markets to stimulate growthCarmakers and dealers in China have ratcheted up efforts to export used vehicles in the hope of stimulating demand for new vehicles in the country.Last week, China's largest SUV maker Great Wall Motors sent its first batch of secondhand vehicles to countries including Cambodia, Nigeria and Ghana.It did not reveal the number of vehicles involved.The export was finalized through the carmaker's Tianjin-based subsidiary, which is one of five companies in the coastal city that have won government approval to sell used vehicles overseas.Tianjin is one of nine cities as well as Guangdong province allowed to undertake the business after Chinese authorities started a program in May to export used vehicles.In a document in May, the Ministry of Commerce said exports can "boost the healthy development of China's automobile industry and promote the steady improvement of foreign trade".It said local authorities should select qualified exporters and appoint third-party agencies to test vehicles bound for overseas markets to ensure their safety and quality as well as offer good after-sales services.Before Great Wall Motors' move, a dealer in South China's Guangdong province shipped 300 vehicles worth $2.5 million in early July to countries including Cambodia, Russia and Nigeria.In the same month, China's online used vehicle trade platform Uxin finalized exports of used vehicles in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi province, which were bound for Poland.Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight, said most emerging markets could be the destination of China's vehicle exports, especially the Middle East and Africa."New cars are usually too pricey for local people's budgets. The more affordable used vehicles will help solve their mobility and transport demands," said Zhang.The ministry said the potential for used vehicle exports from China is "huge" considering the vast market.The United States exported 800,000 used vehicles in 2018 and Japan shipped over 1 million such vehicles overseas, according to Bloomberg.A total of 6.86 million used vehicles were sold in China in the first half of 2019, growing 3.93 percent year-on-year, yet few were exported.Rich countries from Japan to the US have shipped at least some of their older vehicles to developing nations such as Mexico and Nigeria for decades now.Bloomberg said the trade has achieved more than getting older autos off the roads but also has helped boost new car sales by reducing the supply of secondhand alternatives.The China Automobile Dealers Association shares the same view.A longtime advocate of used vehicles, it said more transactions of used vehicles will be important in helping stimulate the need for new vehicles. China's new car market has been falling since July 2018.Sales in the first seven months of 2019 totaled 14.13 million, down 11.4 percent year-on-year, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.In developed countries, sales of used vehicles are usually twice the figure of new car sales.The opposite is true in China. Last year, secondhand car sales totaled 13.82 million, less than half of the new vehicle deliveries in the country, according to statistics from CADA.Bloomberg said it makes sense that China speeds up exports of such vehicles, saying that the country is home to 250 million registered vehicles - the largest fleet in the world - and it's just a matter of time before more of them are resold. It said the quality of Chinese cars has improved to the point where many developing-world consumers may well choose them as a cheaper alternative to used Toyotas or Fords.

                Chinese carmakers bolster financial resources as sales flounder
            </a>
            <p>
                Falling vehicle sales are increasing the pressure on Chinese carmakers and prompting many of them to bolster financial resources for the bumpy road ahead, analysts said.Vehicle sales from January to July totaled 14.13 million units, down 11.4 percent year-on-year, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. It estimated that sales would drop 5 percent this year from 2018 to 26.68 million vehicles.During the first seven months of this year, carmakers and parts manufacturers in the country had issued bonds worth 56.47 billion yuan ($7.9 billion), up 83.8 percent from the same period last year, according to the 21st Century Business Herald newspaper.And the trend has not stopped. In a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Aug 10, SAIC Motor Corp, the country's largest car group by sales, said its general assembly had passed a bill to issue bonds worth up to 20 billion yuan.This was the first time that the carmaker, which is a partner of Volkswagen and General Motors, had come up with a bond plan in 11 years, according to the 21st Century Business Herald.SAIC said in the filing the bonds would be issued "to improve cash flow and fund research as well as projects".Patrick Yuan, an analyst at Jefferies Hong Kong, said the situation had something to do with its lackluster sales."Research on smart cars and connectivity is costing a lot, and the sales are not good, so it is little wonder that SAIC has been cutting dividends since last year and is now borrowing money from the market," said Yuan.SAIC sold 439,800 vehicles in July, down 9.3 percent from the same month last year. Its sales totaled 3.38 million in the first seven months, falling 15.73 percent year-on-year.Two major sources of its revenue, SAIC GM and SAIC Volkswagen, saw their sales fall 9.25 percent and 13.49 percent respectively in the same period.SAIC is yet to release its second-quarter financial statement, but analysts at Hua Chuang Securities estimated that its second quarter net profit could fall 30 percent to 6.5 billion yuan. In the first quarter SAIC's net profit was down 15 percent year-on-year to 8.25 billion yuan.Its partner GM said its revenue from China in the first half of the year slumped 48 percent year-on-year to $611 million.SAIC was not alone. On Aug 12, China's largest new energy vehicle maker BYD said it had finished issuance of corporate bonds worth 2.5 billion yuan.With this the Shenzhen-listed carmaker has issued corporate bonds to the tune of 5.4 billion yuan this year, which it said was to "improve cash flow".In the same period, BJEV, the new energy arm of BAIC Group, issued notes and commercial paper worth 3.5 billion yuan.Great Wall Motors, which is one of the few companies that has managed to secure sales growth this year, had applied for a 4 billion yuan bond quota from the authorities.In late July, the carmaker scaled down its net profit estimate in the first half of the year to 1.53 billion yuan, which would be a 58.6 percent slump from the same period last year, and had cut its whole year sales target to 1.07 million from 1.2 million.Neil Wu, an auto analyst at consulting firm Roland Berger, said lackluster sales are hurting carmakers' revenue and profit and they have to resort to a diversified financing plan."Under current economic circumstances, banks are tightening control on loans as well, so corporate bonds are a better choice for them."Xu Haidong, a deputy secretary-general of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, said the fall will become gentle in coming months because of a lower comparable base figure from the second half of last year and more measures to help with car consumption.The central government has since January been trying to boost consumption of a wide range of goods including vehicles, asking local authorities to offer different forms of assistance and ease restrictions on vehicle purchases, especially new energy ones.John Zeng, manager of LMC Automotive Shanghai, said he expected sales growth to appear in certain months in the second half and the market is likely to rebound in 2020.At a forum on Aug 19, Xin Guobin, vice-minister of industry and information technology, said that both the market and the industry have entered a stage of adjustment since the annual sales decline since the 1990s was reported last year."Yet China's auto industry has a solid foundation for development and the trend of an upward spiral in the long run has not changed," said Xin.

                Changan, SAIC among domestic victims of continuous sales slump
            </a>
            <p>
                China's automotive industry is suffering from a downturn in the overall vehicle market, with two-thirds of the country's listed carmakers seeing falling profit in the first half of the year.Changan, partner of Ford and Mazda, was hit the hardest. Its net profit from January to June fell 239.2 percent year-on-year, resulting in a net loss of 2.24 billion yuan ($313.3 million), according to a financial statement released Sunday.The loss was the result of its sales, which fell 31.65 percent year-on-year to 825,200 units.Its joint venture Changan Ford, formerly the cash cow of the carmaker, saw a 67 percent slump in its sales in the first half of the year, totaling a meager 75,200 units.Another joint venture, Changan Mazda, also had bleak results, selling 61,200 vehicles in the same period, almost a third less than last year.Even China's largest carmaker, SAIC Motor, did not stand unscathed.Its financial statement released on Saturday showed revenue fell 19.05 percent to 376.29 billion yuan, while net profit slumped 27.49 percent to 13.76 billion yuan.It was the first time in almost a decade that SAIC has seen a falling profit.The company's total sales, including those from its joint ventures SAIC GM and SAIC Volkswagen, both among the most popular carmakers in the country, reached 2.94 million, falling 16.6 percent year-on-year.The result was achieved despite SAIC's various promotional efforts in the first half of the year.It had also scaled down its 2019 sales target to 6.5 million from 7.05 million last year. Analysts say this would be the first annual sales fall in 14 years for SAIC.SAIC was not alone. China's best-selling private carmaker Geely cut its sales target by 10 percent to 1.36 million, and the country's largest SUV producer Great Wall Motors trimmed its goal from 1.2 million to 1.07 million.SAIC also estimated that China's overall vehicles sales this year will decrease from 5 to 9 percent from 2018, which saw the country's first fall since 1990.Its pessimistic view of the market was echoed by BAIC, partner of Mercedes-Benz and Hyundai.Revenue of the Hong Kong-listed carmaker in the first half of the year grew 14.1 percent year-on-year to 87.76 billion yuan, but its profit fell 25.9 percent from the same period last year to 2.09 billion yuan.BAIC General Manager Zhang Xiyong said the market would fall around 7.5 percent this year from 2018 and the situation will not rebound soon. "It will be a decent job if China's vehicles sales in 2020 reach the level of this year," said Zhang at the International Forum (TEDA) on Chinese Automotive Industry Development held over the weekend in Tianjin.BAIC's new energy arm, BJEV, which is also a listed company, was one of the few companies that had seen growing profit.The profit of BYD, China's largest new energy vehicle maker, also saw positive growth because the segment had managed to grow at a double-digit rate.New energy vehicle sales in the first half of the year totaled 617,000, up 49.6 percent year-on-year, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.The association expected total sales this year to reach 1.5 million.

                Chinese auto industry hits speed bump in H1 2019
            </a>
            <p>
                China's listed carmakers painted a gloomy picture for the first half of this year, according to a Tuesday report by 21st Century Business Herald.Among 17 A-share or H-share listed passenger car companies, 12 saw falling net profits while five had net profit growth; for the 12 commercial vehicle enterprises, nine registered a decline in profits while three posted profit increases.The overall sales decline in the market led directly to carmakers' poor earnings, the report said. In the first half of 2019, China's automobile production and sales reached 12.13 million and 12.32 million units, respectively, down 13.7 percent and 12.4 percent year-on-year. This was due to multiple factors, such as the slowdown of the macro economy, the early implementation of Nation VI emission standards and the country's auto market saturation.As for new energy vehicles, production and sales stood at 614,000 and 617,000 units respectively, an increase of 48.5 and 49.6 percent over the same period from the previous year.Motoring companies had a larger-than-expected decline in profits for the first half of the year, and many major players in the country witnessed losses in both revenue and profit, the report said. SAIC Motor saw its revenue drop 19.05 percent to 376.29 billion yuan ($52.4 billion), while net profits slumped 27.49 percent to 13.76 billion yuan, according to its financial statements.Geely's revenue decreased 11.4 percent year-on-year, and its net profit fell by 40 percent during the same period; Great Wall Motor's revenue was reduced by 15 percent year-on-year, while its net profits had a drop of 58.95 percent during the same period.For carmakers that posted a loss, Changan Automobile suffered the largest deficit -- 2.2 billion yuan, due to the sales decline of Changan Ford and Changan Mazda.On the other hand, only two firms -- BYD and BAIC's new energy arm, BJEV -- gained in revenue and net profit in the first half of the year among the 17 listed passenger car companies, the report said. The two also ranked first and second for sales volume in China's new energy vehicle market.The sales volume of new energy vehicles is expected to exceed 1.5 million units in China this year, which is becoming a new driving force for the auto industry despite the country's subsidy withdrawal in June, the report said.

                China may one day rival established European automakers in the production of market-leading smart vehicles, according to Wei Jianjun, chairman of major Chinese automaker Great Wall Motors, which is also called GWM.Speaking from the International Motor Show Germany 2019 in Frankfurt on Tuesday, Wei said Chinese acumen in artificial intelligence will help the country compete against industry leaders in the manufacture of next generation vehicles."Germany is a highland of automobile manufacturing and Japan is a big producer of economical cars in the auto development history of over 100 years," Wei said in a speech. "In the wake of the fourth industrial revolution, where China takes the lead in the world by innovation in 5G, AI, internet, and new energy, China's auto industry is granted with a crucial opportunity for overtaking."At the trade show, Wei outlined some of Baoding-based GWM's international expansion plans, and unveiled the WEY-S, a new all-electric concept car to be produced under the company's luxury SUV brand WEY."With Chinese mobile phone, home appliance, and internet-based companies leading in the world as precedents, chances are that China's auto companies can become market leaders," Wei said.Under a separate brand Ora, GWM has already released all-electric small vehicles intended for inner-city transport. With the development of the WEY-S, the company promises a four-wheel-drive capable pure electric SUV with smart functions.As this concept car is being developed, the company plans to release an electric version of its VV5 SUV as early as 2021, as well as plug-in hybrid versions of two other models.Wei said the plan is to sell WEY-branded hybrid and electric SUVs in Europe within two years, and to establish a manufacturing facility in Europe once sales gather pace.The company currently exports the majority of its vehicles to non-European Union markets through its mass-market brand Haval. GWM also sells some pickup trucks in Italy, and recently began manufacturing cars at a site in Russia.GWM sold 26,000 vehicles overseas in the first half of this year, up 16.8 percent from the same period in 2018. The majority of GWM sales occur in China, where the company sold around 1 million vehicles last year."We plan to produce cars from China and export to the EU in the early stage," Wei told Reuters at the trade show. "We believe once we sell more than 50,000 units in the EU, we will begin to consider building a factory there."In Frankfurt, Chinese transmission manufacturer and GWM affiliate HYCET also unveiled new technology, including a new engine, a new nine dual-clutch transmission, and a new electric drive system.GWM brought in German engineering veteran Henning Gerhard to head up the HYCET team in 2014."I made many projects with Volkswagen and Mercedes, and they were all finished, so I had a long think about what I should do. I got the offer from China to start a new project from zero and that's what motivated me," Gerhard told China Daily."The biggest challenge was finding the right experts to support me. I couldn't start with just Chinese engineers, right now they are too young with not enough experience. So, I started with a small group of specialists, mainly German."HYCET and GWM's strategy of acquiring and transplanting German know-how has paid off. Under Gerhard's direction, HYCET has become the only independent Chinese auto manufacturer to produce its own transmission, and the majority of its components go to GWM cars."The next big challenge is to combine everything with e-motor; all the new projects are e-motor powered. We are making transmissions with hybrid motors and pure EV," said Gerhard.Gerhard said the company is also working on powertrains that can meet strict European emissions standards."Currently, our cars are mainly made for the Chinese market," he said. "To go to the European market there is a big challenge because of CO2 reduction, and we are working on meeting these standards with our new powertrains."Gerhard said HYCET's long-term plans involve building a client-base outside of China.

                Car sales keep falling but hope on horizon with peak months
            </a>
            <p>
                Industry organization predicts full market recovery may take two to three yearsThe downward spiral in China's automotive market did not stop in August. Officials at the country's leading industry organization say it may take two to three years for the market to recover.Overall vehicle sales in the world's biggest vehicle market stood at 1.96 million in August. It represents a fall of 6.9 percent from the same month last year, according to figures released last week by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.Statistics show that August was the 14th month of falls since a dip was noticed in July 2018.Total vehicle sales in the country in the first eight months of 2019 totaled 16.1 million, down 11 percent from the same period last year.At the start of 2019, the association said the fall may become less severe in coming months. This is because of a lower comparable base figure from the second half of last year and the expected peak months of sales in September and October."We expect the market to see some sort of a rebound this year, but we are not sure about how much it will rebound," said Shi Jianhua, a deputy secretary-general of the CAAM.The association estimated sales this year would be the same as in 2018. But they scaled down the estimate to a 5 percent drop in the middle of the year, to 26.68 million vehicles."From what we have seen, it would be a feat if it would be a 5 percent drop," said Shi.He said favorable measures in past years triggered impulse purchases. This coupled with factors ranging from China's slowing economic growth to Sino-American trade tensions is hurting car sales.Shi said the market would be more resilient if the authorities had not imposed curbs on car purchases in some cities and released financial stimuli in some years.Under the current situation, car sales will hover at a low level for two to three years, he predicted.Carmakers are not optimistic either. BAIC Group, Chinese partner of Hyundai and Mercedes-Benz, estimated the market would fall around 7.5 percent this year from 2018."It will be a decent job if China's vehicles sales in 2020 reach the level of this year," said BAIC President Zhang Xiyong at an industry forum held earlier this month in Tianjin.SAIC Motor, China's largest carmaker, saw its sales in the first eight months of this year stand at 3.86 million. This is down 14.81 percent from the same period last year. Deliveries of all its major sales contributors, from SAIC Volkswagen to SAIC GM, fell in the same period.
