                Hamilton overtakes Verstappen late on to win Hungarian GP
            </p>
            <p>
                BUDAPEST, Hungary — Lewis Hamilton overtook Max Verstappen near the end of the Hungarian Grand Prix to earn his 81st Formula One race victory and extend his championship lead.The Mercedes driver is now only 10 wins behind seven-time F1 champion Michael Schumacher's record of 91.Mercedes made a strategic gamble with about 20 laps to go to bring Hamilton in for a second tire change, while Red Bull decided to keep Verstappen out on track in the hope he could defend on a difficult track for overtaking.It proved a Mercedes masterstroke.The much quicker tires helped Hamilton swallow up Verstappen's 20-second lead and he finally got past the Red Bull on lap 67 of 70, having failed to overtake him several times earlier in the race."You have to put complete faith in the team. I had to put all the doubts out of my mind," a jubilant Hamilton said. "I'm tired, which is how it should be."Sebastian Vettel finished behind Verstappen in third place for Ferrari ahead of teammate Charles Leclerc and McLaren's Carlos Sainz Jr.Verstappen held his lead from pole position under pressure from Hamilton and his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas heading into Turn 1. But it was Hamilton who ended on top to clinch a record-extending seventh career win in Hungary, while Verstappen earned a consolation point for the fastest lap.At the start, Hamilton quickly got ahead of Bottas as they brushed each other and the Finnish driver was then overtaken by both Ferraris on the 4.4-kilometer (2.7-mile) Hungaroring circuit.Lapping two seconds slower than Vettel by Lap 6, Bottas came in for a front wing change, following contact with Leclerc's Ferrari.Bottas also had a near miss when overtaking Lance Stroll, just about avoiding contact with the Racing Point driver.By Lap 24, Verstappen complained of losing tire grip. He came in for a tire change on the next lap, coming out ahead of both Ferraris.Mercedes seemed unsure of when to bring Hamilton in for his tire change, changing their minds on Laps 26 and 27. Eventually the British driver came in on Lap 32, but a poor pit stop — lasting 4 seconds compared to 2.6 for Verstappen's — cost Hamilton momentum.Still, on fresh tires Hamilton soon caught up to Verstappen, forcing the Dutchman to defend his position from the Mercedes driver's attacks.On Lap 40, Hamilton almost got past Vertappen — first on the inside, then on the outside — but Verstappen kept his cool as Hamilton veered slightly off track attacking on the outside.Hamilton seemed to be feeling the pressure."What more can I do?" he asked his team on radio."Keep the pressure on," was the blunt reply."I can't keep the pressure on," the five-time champion snapped back.In what proved a race-winning move, Hamilton came in for another pit stop on Lap 49 — putting him 20 seconds behind Verstappen but giving him much faster tires than Verstappen for the closing stages."We should have pitted as well," Verstappen shouted, as if aware of what was coming.Verstappen's lead was wilting in the afternoon sun, and with five laps left it was just only three seconds.Minutes later, Hamilton's Silver Arrow flew past him."Lewis was on fire today," Verstappen said. "I was pushing flat out."After taking the checkered flag, Hamilton was quick to recognize his team was right all along."Sorry I doubted the strategy," he said. "Oh man, that feels good. That feels so good."So will looking at the championship standings.He now leads Bottas by 62 points and Verstappen by 69 with nine races left when the season resumes on Sept. 1 at the Belgian GP.Vettel, a four-time F1 champion, is 96 points behind Hamilton in fourth place and has not won any of the past 20 races.Ferrari has not won this season and, on a humiliating day for F1's most storied team, Vettel was more than 1 minute behind Hamilton.AP

            <p>
                LONDON -- Aston Villa were promoted to the English Premier League after beating Derby County 2-1 in the Championship play-off final at Wembley on Monday.Villa, who were relegated in 2016, pulled ahead in the 44th minute thanks to Anwar El Ghazi's strike and doubled the lead in the 59th minute with a second goal from John McGinn.Derby, managed by Chelsea legend Frank Lampard, made it 2-1 in the 81st minute when substitute Jack Marriott's effort from eight yards took a deflection off Martyn Waghorn on its way in.Villa, beaten in last year's final by Fulham, was the third team to win promotion from the Championship after winners Norwich and runners-up Sheffield United.

                Tiger getting back into Asian swing
            </a>

                All it took was one tweet to trigger talk of a "fun fall" when the PGA Tour's juggernaut heads to Asia with a promise of raising the decibel levels and extending the game's rising popularity in the Far East.In 27 words, Tiger Woods informed his 6.5 million Twitter followers he will play in the inaugural Zozo Championship in Japan, one of three mega PGA Tour tournaments teeing off in Asia in October.The Asian swing, which offers nearly $30 million in combined prize money, also features The CJ Cup @Nine Bridges in South Korea and the World Golf Championships-HSBC Champions in China.This will be the first Tiger sighting at a PGA Tour tournament in Asia since his appearance at the CIMB Classic in Malaysia in 2012, and the first time in 13 years that Woods will play in Japan."I'm excited to play in the inaugural Zozo Championship and to return to Japan, one of my favorite countries. It's going to be a fun fall," Woods said in an April tweet that resonated around the world.Timing is everything in golf, and organizers of Japan's first official PGA Tour tournament couldn't be more pleased with Woods' early commitment, coming just 11 days after he produced a Masters victory for the ages at Augusta National.It will also coincide nicely with Asia's continued rise on the PGA Tour following breakthrough victories by Chinese Taipei's CT Pan and South Korea's Sung Kang in recent months.Following years of dealing with debilitating knee and back injuries, Woods' 81st PGA Tour victory, which put him one win shy of matching the record held by Sam Snead, has cemented Tiger's legacy in the sport.With Woods committed to the Zozo Championship, the PGA Tour's newest showpiece in Asia will undoubtedly complement an already all-star lineup of mega events in the region.The new generation of PGA Tour stars have fully embraced the vision of going global as they have made a beeline to Asia.World No 2 Dustin Johnson has become a regular visitor to China after winning his first WGC-HSBC Champions title in 2013, and past winners of the prestigious event include Phil Mickelson, Justin Rose, Bubba Watson, Ian Poulter and Hideki Matsuyama."I've had a lot of success in China," said Johnson, who was also runner-up in 2017. "I've played well there and I always go back. It's a World Golf Championship, and I enjoy playing in it."With the number of Koreans competing on the PGA Tour growing with each passing season, the CJ Cup @Nine Bridges is also creating a legacy, despite its infancy.The tournament's hospitality is first-class, the Korean culture is intriguing and Jeju Island provides a stunning backdrop which the stars of the game enjoy, both on and off the course.Brooks Koepka, triumphant in Jeju by four strokes last year after a final back nine of 29, said: "I enjoy Asia... it's one of my favorite spots to go on vacation. I always feel relaxed, and I like the culture. It's always a fun place to go and everyone is very respectful."I felt it was important to win in Jeju, especially after the year that I had. I had to back it up and the way I did was special. It was a good way to start the 2018-19 season."With October's Asian events counting towards the 2019-20 PGA Tour season, accumulating early FedEx Cup points during the fall schedule is a key motivation for players.Australia's well-traveled Adam Scott expects to see many other top guns joining Woods in the Far East."The Asian tournaments are great events," said Scott. "I have great fan support there, which is always fun. The tournaments have smaller fields and there are a lot of FedEx Cup points up for grabs.'It's important this year as more players will have to play more events toward the back end of the year. It's going to be a good thing in regard to the strength of field for the tournaments in Asia."The author is senior director of communications for the PGA Tour and is based in Kuala Lumpur.

                US knocks host France out to reach semifinal in Women's World Cup
            </a>
            <p>
                PARIS — Megan Rapinoe went from controversy to triumph, scoring twice for the United States in the much-anticipated clash with host France to send the defending champions into the semifinals of the Women's World Cup with a 2-1 victory Friday night.France was vying to become the first nation to simultaneously hold the men's and women's World Cup trophies, but the home-field advantage and the flag-waving crowd that belted out La Marseillaise didn't faze the ever-confident US team."It did live up to expectations, I'm happy to say that," US star Alex Morgan said.Rapinoe, who was called out on social media by President Donald Trump after video surfaced of her saying she wouldn't visit the White House if the United States won in France, now leads the top-ranked Americans to Lyon to face No 3 England on Tuesday in the semifinals.Rapinoe scored on a free kick in the fifth minute that bounced between French players and past goalkeeper Sarah Bouhaddi. After scoring, she went to the corner and raised both arms in celebration toward the US fans in the sold out Parc des Princes stadium.She raised her arms again in the 65th minute after blasting a cross from Tobin Heath that Bouhaddi dove for but couldn't stop. It was her fifth goal of the tournament.Fourth-ranked France pulled back on Wendie Renard's header off Gaetane Thiney's free kick in the 81st. It was the defender's fourth World Cup goal.The US team is used to grabbing attention both on and off the field. Rapinoe was caught up in controversy this week when a video surfaced of her using an expletive while vowing not to visit the White House.While the interview was from January, it attracted the president's attention and he tweeted: "Megan should never disrespect our Country, the White House, or our Flag, especially since so much has been done for her & the team."A day before the match, Rapinoe said she stood by her comments, except the coarse language. She even suggested the uproar might help her team. "I think, if anything, it just fires everybody up a little bit more," she said.It doesn't get any easier for the United States going forward, with England looming in the semifinals after a decisive 3-0 victory over Norway on Thursday night.Rapinoe also had a pair of goals, on a pair of penalty kicks, for a 2-1 victory over Spain to open the knockout stage. Until Jennifer Hermoso scored for Spain, the United States had not conceded a goal in eight straight competitive matches dating to the 2016 Olympics, outscoring opponents 44-0.Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher was stellar in the second half against France, fighting off a flurry of attempts until Renard's header.Les Bleues also reached the quarterfinals at the 2015 World Cup in Canada but fell to Germany on penalties after a 1-1 draw. The team's best finish at the tournament was fourth in 2011 after losing 2-1 in the third-place match to Sweden.France finished atop its group this year and then overcame a determined challenge from Brazil in extra time on Sunday night to reach the quarterfinals.The United States already has three World Cup trophies, most of any nation. The Americans emphatically beat Japan 5-2 to win in Canada four years ago.AP

                Max factor giving F1 a makeover
            </a>
            <p>
                Upstart Verstappen's rise to prominence a much-needed shot in the arm for championshipBUDAPEST, Hungary - As Lewis Hamilton moves ever closer to Michael Schumacher's Formula One record of 91 grand prix wins, a younger and equally ambitious driver is emerging as his main rival.Red Bull's Max Verstappen is showing the kind of daring and panache now seemingly beyond the reach of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, who is enduring a third straight season of frustration.Valtteri Bottas, who is Hamilton's under-pressure teammate at Mercedes, led the championship early on but has drifted back after a eight-race winless streak.Now, Verstappen is poised to overtake Bottas and move second behind Hamilton overall when F1 resumes with the first of nine remaining races at the Belgian Grand Prix on Sept 1.Hamilton speaks in glowing terms about Verstappen, a fearless and mentally strong driver who does not crack under pressure. In fact, the 21-year-old Red Bull driver thrives on it, much like Hamilton.Verstappen drove brilliantly from pole position in Sunday's Hungarian GP, fighting hard until Hamilton overtook him late on following a relentless chase to clinch his 81st F1 win. It was another enthralling scrap, following Hamilton's brilliant defense under intense pressure from Verstappen at the Monaco GP in May.While Hamilton speaks respectfully of Vettel, a four-time F1 champion with 52 wins, he speaks with admiration of Verstappen."There is no better feeling, from a racing driver's point of view, when you have a race (where) you face a really strong competitor and a great driver like Max, obviously at their best," Hamilton said. "It is awesome to see the respect level between us. Really respectful driving and I hope to continue that."Hamilton's processional win at the French GP in June prompted acerbic criticism over the lack of excitement in F1 because of the ultra-dominant Mercedes. But since then, F1 fans have been treated to engrossing battles in Austria and Germany, a decent race in Montreal, and two exciting contests at the British GP and in Hungary.The dramatic spike in the interest level has much to do with Verstappen, who won in Spielberg and Hockenheim and was denied a podium shot at Silverstone following a collision."Everyone was so negative talking about the sport and now all of a sudden we've had this big step up from the Red Bulls," Hamilton said. "Now we've got a really good battle on our hands and it looks like it's here to stay."Ferrari's state of flux - no wins in 12 this season and 0-15 stretching back to last year's US GP - has opened the way for Verstappen.Vettel blew championship leads in the past two seasons, and has not won in 20 races since his victory at the Belgian GP last August.Verstappen is touted as a future multiple champion and genuinely looks capable of challenging Hamilton. He is already ahead on two counts: as the youngest driver to win an F1 race (at 18) and the fourth-youngest to take pole compared with sixth for Hamilton (who was 22).But the 34-year-old Hamilton is still working his way through the record books and his win in Hungary - the eighth this season - extended his championship lead to 62 points as he chases a sixth F1 title to move one behind Schumacher's F1 record."I don't have plans on stopping anytime soon," he said.Hamilton's relatively advanced age was a topic raised by his former teammate Nico Rosberg - who beat Hamilton in a thriller when clinching his only F1 title with Mercedes in 2016. The German driver showed great ability to overcome Hamilton in an acrimonious season which went down to the last race in Abu Dhabi.Then, in a flash, he retired from F1 after a number of tense seasons alongside Hamilton, when their bickering tore apart a friendship dating back to their karting days as teens.Rosberg, who won 23 F1 races with Mercedes, has taken to social networks to berate Hamilton.He questioned the severity of the Englishman's illness at the recent German GP.On July 28, Rosberg tweeted: "I think the man flu was just part of The Lewis Hamilton Show. He likes to make it look more difficult than it is."Hamilton, who said he needed several days of heavy sleeping following that race, scoffed at Rosberg's claim."Believe me it wasn't man flu, like some have said. It was really something that wiped me out," he said.Verstappen's surge in form offered Rosberg another chance to take a swipe.On his YouTube channel blog after Verstappen's superb pole in Hungary on Saturday, Rosberg said that Verstappen - with his "bullet-speed reactions in his mind (and) absolute peak human body reaction times" - is now the No 1 driver in F1.Despite evidence pointing to Hamilton's ongoing dominance, Rosberg insisted the Briton's powers are waning."The best age for racing drivers is 30, 31, 32 and that's because your ability as you're getting older slightly decreases," Rosberg said.Hamilton was unimpressed."Whether he is right or wrong, I don't really care. All you have to do is look at the tally of my results and they speak for themselves," Hamilton said. "Naturally there will be people who have not had the success that I have, and might want to talk it down.""I'm still fit," he added. "Hopefully you can see I've not lost any speed."So far this season, every driver in F1 would agree.Associated Press

                Atletico top as Barca and Real's poor starts continue
            </a>
            <p>
                MADRID -- Atletico Madrid go into the international break as leaders of the La Liga after coming back from 2-0 down at home to clinch a 3-2 victory over Eibar on Sunday.The visitors took a 2-0 lead after just 18 minutes with goals from Charles and Anaitz Arbilla, but Joao Felix got Atletico back into the game before half time.Vitolo's second goal in two games six minutes after halftime made it 2-2 although Eibar continued to make life difficult for Atletico until the last minute when thanks to a mixture of power, fortune and faith Thomas Partey netted the goal which takes Atletico to the top of the table.Gareth Bale scored twice and then got sent off for two yellow cards in injury time as Real Madrid again disappointed with a 2-2 draw away to Villarreal.Villarreal twice took the lead thanks to Gerard Moreno on 11 minutes and Moi Gomez after 73 minutes, but Bale's goals in the 45th and 85th minutes saved Madrid from defeat. It was quite a moment for the Welshman after the club had spent all summer trying to sell him.Barca's early-season crisis also continued on Saturday as Ernesto Valverde's side were held to a 2-2 draw away to recently promoted Osasuna.Roberto Torres put the home side ahead with a left-foot volley after six minutes and after a poor first half, Valverde introduced 16-year-old Ansu Fati into the game.After just five minutes Fati became the youngest player ever to score for Barca when he headed them level and Arthur Melo then put Barca ahead.However, Gerard Pique was penalized for handball and Torres scored his second of the game from the penalty spot to give Barca plenty to think about over the coming fortnight.Two penalties from Dani Parejo gave Valencia their first win of the season as they beat Mallorca 2-0 in a game in which Spain international Rodrigo Moreno played all 90 minutes despite rumors of a move to Atletico Madrid.Espanyol lost again and go into the international break with just one point and without a goal after capitulating 3-0 at home to recently promoted Granada.Joe Antonio Puertas opened the scoring after 12 minutes as Espanyol produced a poor first half and although Espanyol improved after the break Carlos Fernandez doubled Granada's lead after a defensive error in the 67th minute and Ramon Azeez sealed the win six minutes later.Levante's good start to the campaign got better on Saturday when they won 2-0 at home to Valladolid with late goals from Sergio Leon and Jose Luis Morales deciding a close fought game.It was also tight in Getafe where the home side remains without a win this campaign despite Jorge Molina opening the scoring in their 1-1 draw against Alaves, where Joselu scored a scrambled goal to assure a share of the points.Betis got their first points of the campaign as they beat Leganes 2-1. Martin Braithwaite had put the visitors in front in, but Betis came back and took the points thanks to goals from Lopen Moron and Nabil Fekir. The defeat leaves Leganes bottom of the table with no points from their first three games.The round of matches kicked off on Friday night with Sevilla being held 1-1 at home to Celta Vigo in a match where both goals came in the last 10 minutes.Fran Vazquez put Sevilla ahead in the 81st minute and Julen Lopetegui's side looked as if they were going to make it three wins from three games, but a loss of concentration allowed former Sevilla and Barca winger Denis Suarez to assure a point for Celta just a minute later.Athletic Club Bilbao also has two wins and a draw from their opening three games and go into the break second after a convincing 2-0 win over local rivals Real Sociedad in the Basque derby.Inaki Williams and Raul Garcia put Athletic 2-0 up within half an hour and their performance was so dominant that Real Sociedad didn't manage a shot on goal until five minutes from time.
