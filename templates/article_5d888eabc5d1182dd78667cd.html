                Huawei forms alliances in Europe as it pursues its mission to become leader in innovation "This is the guts of the business, this is what we do," our guide says, patting a large green, hardware-filled cabinet sitting in the bowels of Huawei's UK headquarters in Reading. To Britons, Huawei is best-known as a smartphone manufacturer. They may have considered a basic Huawei handset as an alternative to the pricey market leaders, or seen movie stars Scarlett Johansson and Henry Cavill exchanging photo messages using the higher-end P9 in a TV commercial. Most would be unaware that Huawei plays a key role in the "last mile" technology that delivers superfast broadband to some 20 million homes in the United Kingdom.  "This is where it all begins, the kit that weathers rain or shine, that's driven out to some corner of the world. If this doesn't work, nothing else does," we are told. Huawei's nuts-and-bolts reliability is what the company built its reputation on. It remains at the forefront of innovation in the industry as the biggest telecommunications manufacturer in the world. Founded in China in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei with an investment of $3,500, Huawei started as a private reseller of PBX telephone switches. Last year, it generated $60.8 billion in revenue and remains the only Chinese company in the Fortune 500 list to make more money abroad than domestically. The company announced on Oct 28 that it's on track to meet a sales target of 140 million handsets this year. Western and northeastern Europe are the two fastest-growing markets, expanding at 50 percent year-on-year. Huawei is the world's third-largest smartphone vendor, and the gap to second place is closing. Market research firm IDC reported in July that Huawei's global market share soared to 8.2 percent in the first quarter of this year from 5.2 percent last year, while Samsung remained around 24 percent and Apple fell to 15.3 percent from 18.3 percent. Both Apple and Huawei are likely to benefit from Samsung's ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 launch. Its high-end handset has been withdrawn after a series of battery fires. Analysts offer a wide range of reasons behind Huawei's unprecedented success. The company has a unique management and ownership structure. It's a private, 98.6 percent employee-owned entity run by rotating CEOs. Huawei puts huge emphasis on research - it has invested $38 billion over the last 10 years in R&D, and 45 percent of its 176,000 employees worldwide are engaged in it. According to Roland Montagne, head of broadband practice at European telecom think tank IDATE, carving inroads into Europe is at the heart of Huawei's global rise. "Huawei decided to invest quite early in the European market because it's a center of expertise in terms of technology, and it is a dynamic market," he says. "That's why they decided to collaborate quite quickly with the main players in Europe - BT, Orange, Telefonica, to mention a few." Huawei broke new ground with its partnership with British Telecom in 2005. The Chinese company had set up its first UK offices just two years before landing the game-changing deal. "At the time, very little was known about it outside of Asia. It didn't really sell very much in Europe," says Mike Galvin, head of technology, services and operations at BT. The British service provider raised eyebrows when it selected the Chinese company among the suppliers to roll out its 21st Century Network, the so-called 21CN data network program. "We compared Huawei's with others' equipment - yes, you look at the badge on the front and perhaps the heritage of the company it comes from, but you also look at the equipment itself, and we said this equipment meets our needs. It was well-made," Galvin says. "Were there any special conditions? For every tender we give, there are special conditions. With Huawei we looked very much at security of supply. We are very keen to be an ethical buyer. We sent our procurement inspectors out to Huawei factories, we looked for unethical practices. And we were very pleased with what we found with Huawei." Like many others involved with Huawei, Galvin attributes much of the company's success to its customer-centered approach. The unique thing that I would pick out for Huawei that we don't see with any other supplier is how close they are to their customers and how their customers drive what products they produce," he says. Stefano Cantarelli, chief technology officer and network vice-president for UK and Ireland at Huawei, says gaining the trust of BT opened the door to other major deals the company has cut in the UK and Europe, such as carriers Vodafone and EE. Huawei teamed up with the latter to launch the UK's first 4G LTE (long-term evolution) network. "What BT represented was the opening of a traditional, R&D-driven operator to embrace a new Chinese vendor in Europe. They have been fundamental in establishing trust, and we were able to get the second-biggest deal we got with Vodafone," he says. "It has been pivotal in creating a brand reputation." According to Montagne, maintaining trust is imperative for Huawei as the new frontier of the all-cloud transformation and cloud-based strategies offer a fresh set of complex security challenges.

                Chinese companies are investing heavily in research and development in Europe, drawing on the continent's plentiful high-technology and human resources to help them move up the value chain and internationalize their operations.They often establish R&D laboratories through existing subsidiaries in Europe or by buying European companies with existing R&D capabilities that they can add to.One of these Chinese companies is the telecommunications giant Huawei. Renato Lombardi, vice-president of Huawei's European research center, says the company allocates its R&D resources with the aim of making the most of what each country's human resources and social networks offer.Most of the R&D that Precision Technologies does is on advanced machine tools. Photos provided to China DailyIn Europe the company has R&D centers in Belgium, the United Kingdom, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden, and it allocates a portion of its R&D work to each country based on its expertise.The center in Italy focuses on microwave research, which is critical in connecting mobile base stations and networks. Before the center was set up in 2008, Huawei outsourced its microwave business to other companies, Lombardi says. Realizing the importance of developing microwave technology, it decided to set up the Italian center, and Lombardi says that in-house microwave technology has greatly benefited Huawei's global operations.R&D in Europe is particularly important because Huawei has many joint R&D projects with key customers, and through them the company can stay abreast of the latest trends in the industry, he says.In the UK, Huawei has R&D sites in Bristol, Cambridge and Ipswich.Xu Bin, director of Huawei's UK research effort, says: "This long-term R&D investment generates the breakthroughs that are to be the basis for our revenue streams in the future."The center in Ipswich was set up as a result of Huawei's buying the Centre for Integrated Photonics Ltd, a British research laboratory, in 2012."The acquisition was crucial to our UK R&D growth," Xu says. "Since we acquired the center, we have increased investment in its facilities and integrated it closely into the innovation process within Huawei. The center helps our teams around the world design and test the innovations that are vital to our core set of telecommunications products."Chinese medical equipment company Mindray gained an R&D center in Sweden when it bought Datascope, a US company, in 2008.However, the company's R&D activities extend beyond this center, because it is also using its European sales force as a way of gathering information on customer needs, which is then used by its R&D centers in China to further develop products, says Su Lei, country manager for Mindray UK.R&D is at the heart of Mindray's corporate culture because technology in the medical industry advances rapidly, Su says, and the company needs to keep up with the latest trends in the industry to stay ahead of its competitors.Mindray consistently invests 10 percent of its annual sales revenue in R&D, which is high by industry standards. The company's R&D team accounts for about one-third of the total workforce.The R&D center in Sweden has great expertise in anesthesia monitoring devices, Su says. "We greatly value this R&D center from a strategic perspective, and we use it to research pioneering technology in relation to the medical industry because Europe has an advantage in breakthrough technology research."Mindray's R&D centers in China focus more on developing new products and commercializing technology for production. There is strong collaboration between the team in Sweden and the Chinese R&D centers, Su says.As with Mindray's access to R&D capability in anaesthesia through the Datascope acquisition, the 2008 purchase by the Chinese company Zhuzhou CSR Times Electric of the British semiconductor company Dynex Semiconductor Ltd has given it crucial R&D capability in chip technology, which is crucial for the railway industry.That helped it develop its own version of a high-efficiency switch called an insulated-gate bipolar transistor, a key transport industry component.Zhuzhou CSR Times Electric was part of railway equipment manufacturer CSR Corporation, which merged with another manufacturer, CNR Corporation in June, to create CRRC Corporation, and had imported these switches from leading international suppliers in Europe and Japan for many years.CSR wanted the competitive advantage of in-house competence in designing and making such semiconductor technology.Paul Taylor, CEO of Dynex, says the acquisition has greatly helped his team increase its R&D capabilities through financial support, technology sharing and assistance with commercialization.Since the acquisition, Dynex has expanded technologically in two stages. In the first phase, 7.8 million pounds ($12 million; 10.7 million euros) was invested in R&D starting in 2010, of which Zhuzhou CSR Times Electric contributed 80 percent. In the second phase, which began last year, 20 million pounds was invested in R&D, with 80 percent of that again coming from Zhuzhou CSR.The investment has enabled Dynex to build a new R&D center, which opened in 2012. Dynex's R&D staff has grown from 12 before the acquisition to 55.Taylor says the access to skilled engineers from Zhuzhou CSR Times Electric, who are seconded to Dynex, is also valuable for both the development of new technology and technology transfers from Dynex to Zhuzhou CSR."The fact that they have been here and understand the way we work as a team also means they can help to coordinate a lot of the partnership we have with our parent company in the longer term," he says.More recently, Zhuzhou CSR Times Electric has set up a team of about 10 to conduct research and development on the drivetrain sub-assemblies of electric vehicles, which is based at Dynex's R&D center.The new team will look into how the semiconductor switching technology they developed for trains can be applied to electric cars, hoping to develop a technology that can be sold to carmakers.Zhuzhou CSR is doing the work at Dynex because the semiconductor technology is at the heart of the drivetrain system, so working with Dynex's existing capability can better deliver cost-effective and well-tailored products for customers, Taylor says.Another case of synergy is Chongqing Machinery & Electric Co's acquisition of Manchester-based Precision Technologies Group in 2010. Neil Jones, group business development director at Precision Technologies, says the Chongqing company has demonstrated its regard for research and development by allowing it to invest 12 to 15 percent of revenue in R&D."Chongqing Machinery & Electric has realized that R&D is at the heart of what we do today and for the future," he says. "They allow us to invest in R&D to improve our processes, quality and accuracy, which is at the forefront of precision engineering and technology."Most of the R&D that Precision Technologies does is on advanced machine tools such as the Zenith, a precision helical grinding machine that the company developed through an intensive effort.The investment has paid off because the machine is significantly better than similar machines sold by competitors, and as a result, Precision Technologies has taken customers away from rivals, Jones says.Meanwhile, Precision Technologies also works closely with the parent company subsidiary Chongqing Machine Tool Group Co to make compressor rotors for the Chinese market, which involves extensive joint R&D and knowledge sharing.Often, research and development is crucial for a Chinese company to reap all the benefits of an acquisition, as shown by the Chinese automotive manufacturer SAIC Motor Corp Ltd, which bought technology relating to the Rover 75 and Rover 25 models after the British carmaker MG Rover collapsed in 2005.To help SAIC fully integrate MG Rover's intellectual property into its own cars, the British consulting firm Ricardo Group offered to provide an R&D center in Britain to train SAIC's engineers.The center, in the English Midlands, employed about 200 engineers, many of whom were former MG Rover employees. The center was later integrated into SAIC's UK operation.Mark Garrett, chief operating officer of Ricardo Group, says his company's help in setting up the R&D center enabled the intellectual property that SAIC had bought from MG Rover to be applied quickly to create new products, such as the Roewe 550.A new automobile with MG technology, Roewe 550 was fully compliant with European Union crash performance standards and was launched in the China market within three years.In addition, many Chinese companies have set up joint R&D projects with European universities, leveraging the expertise of these universities' researchers. Once new research is developed on campus, the companies take the technology into their own laboratories for product commercialization.One example is the participation of Huawei in the University of Surrey's 5G Innovation Centre, launched in 2013, as a founding member and industry partner. It is investing 5 million pounds in the center and has provided expertise in and equipment for testing by the center.Keith Robson, CEO of the center, says as the R&D work focuses on developing a common standard for 5G technology, having an important telecommunications company like Huawei as a member is important because it means Huawei's 5G standards will fit well with the global standard as it develops.Without a common standard, there is risk of 5G technology fragmentation, meaning that individual industries, such as automotive, financial services, healthcare and telecommunications, wouldn't benefit from the integration of 5G.Robson says the Huawei equipment is of a quality that only a few companies in the world can deliver.The Huawei team is now at the University of Surrey helping with a large-scale installation of advanced 4G equipment as part of the innovation center's unique 5G test facility, which will open at the University's Guildford campus in September. Huawei soon will also provide the center some of its 5G equipment, which represents advanced and newly developed technology.The University of Nottingham is also conducting R&D for electric and hybrid vehicles with Chinese automotive manufacturer FAW Group Corp, focusing on thermal management and improving thermal efficiency.The thermal management research focuses on keeping the temperature of electric car batteries within a range for optimal operation, which will also improve safety and prolong the lifespan of batteries, says Yan Yuying, a professor of thermofluids engineering and head of the HVACR (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) and Heat Transfer Institute at the University of Nottingham.He says the battery is the most important and most expensive part of an electric car, accounting for over half of the car's overall cost. Thermal management of the battery system is directly relevant to the cost of the car."The optimal operating temperature of the battery in an electric car is between 25 C and 40 C. But the battery environment is often as high as 60 C to 70 C in the summer, and in some parts of China where the climate is cold in the winter the battery starting temperature can be much lower than 25 C. Sometimes, for example on motorways, when the car is fully accelerating, the battery can be hotter than 40 C," Yan says.The second aspect of the research, which focuses on energy harvesting or improving thermal efficiency, aims to recover a larger percentage of energy, retrieving it from exhaust gases, for example, and turning it into electric energy.He says with the current engine technology for hybrid vehicles, less than 30 percent of the fossil fuel consumed by the engine is turned into useful energy for the wheels, and a small fraction of this energy is then turned into electric energy.However, because more than 70 percent of the original energy is lost through the exhaust and other heat losses, recovering this energy and turning it into electrical power could be beneficial.Yan says his researchers have finished the first phase of work, which has produced viable technology. They have just started the second stage of collaboration with FAW, which focuses on further development of the technology and commercializing it for testing and mass production in FAW's vehicles.The second phase will take place in both Nottingham and China with much closer collaboration with FAW's R&D center.Lancaster University is pioneering a project that brings together Chinese and UK businesses for joint R&D projects in academia, with support of the university's academics and students. The Lancaster China Catalyst Project started last year. More than 40 UK companies now take part.Mark Beresford, the program's UK-China project manager, says the matchmaking process that brings Chinese and British companies together is important, and his team seeks to give companies support on both sides through facilitating trust, confidence, mutual respect of differences, flexibility in approach, and overcoming language and cultural barriers."For collaborations to be successful and add value long term, UK-China company partnerships need to be grounded in a strong commercial logic and not just set up for the purposes of a short-term project," he says.The project focuses mainly on small and medium-sized businesses that might otherwise lack the resources to invest in cross-border R&D collaboration.But despite booming Chinese R&D investment in Europe, many challenges remain. In terms of acquiring R&D capability through mergers and acquisitions, it is crucial for Chinese firms to understand how much of a target's technology and R&D capability is included in the blueprint of contracts, says Fu Xiaolan, professor of technology and international development at the University of Oxford.In addition to the codified knowledge that can be specified in contracts, it is vital to understand there may be "passive knowledge" - experience and knowledge held by senior managers and key employees of a company - that is worth trying to acquire, too, Fu says.cecily.liu@chinadaily.com.cn( China Daily European Weekly 09/05/2015 page6)

                LONDON -- Chinese company Huawei Monday signed a three-year Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with UK Trade and Investment (UKTI), which aims to enhance the two sides' cooperation on business development.UKTI is the British government department responsible for encouraging investment in the country by overseas businesses.The agreement, signed at Huawei's UK and Ireland Partner Convention held in London, focuses on identifying the best UK technology partners for Huawei's global supply chain and support Huawei's investment and business development in the UK.As a Fortune Global 500 company, Huawei is a leading provider of global information and communications technology (ICT) solutions. The Chinese company has played an active part in rolling out high-speed broadband across the UK, and developing 4G and 5G networks."By working closely with over 200 UK suppliers and partners, we aim to foster a healthy and robust ICT ecosystem, which helps to build a Better Connected UK. Our new agreement with UKTI will help continue this development alongside key partners in the UK, an important market for us," said Chen Lifang, Huawei's group board director.In 2012, Huawei announced its intention to invest $2 billion in the UK over the five years from 2013 to 2017. Huawei said it is on track to meet this spending commitment, making it one of China's largest inward investors in the UK.The company has opened a new R&D center in Bristol, and investing in joint project work with leading British universities, such as the University of Surrey's 5G Innovation Center."Huawei has operated in the UK for fifteen years and in that time we have grown to employ 1,100 people across 15 UK locations," said Chen.

                Damage may be limited or aggravated by the terms of the exit, and Britain's success in trade ties with countries such as China For three days in October, the United Kingdom rolled out the red carpet for a Chinese delegation led by President Xi Jinping. Queen Elizabeth held a lavish state banquet to welcome the Chinese president. Alongside the discussions on increased trade and investment between the two countries, Xi was taken by Prime Minister David Cameron to visit a top football club and a traditional English pub, where the president steeled himself to drink a pint of English beer. Both China and Britain hailed Xi's visit as raising their relationship to a new level. This was marked by China's equity participation in a British nuclear power station, and by Britain's early involvement - contrary to the wishes of its senior partner the United States - as a founder shareholder in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank created and led by China. On June 23, the British shocked the world by voting decisively to leave the European Union after 43 years of membership. Cameron, who had welcomed Xi to London in 2015, had arranged the national referendum to solve the deep split over European membership within his own Conservative Party. His miscalculation on the outcome led to his resignation, which immediately followed the result. Today, several politicians are fighting over the right to succeed Cameron as leader of the British Conservative Party and prime minister, with the final result becoming known in September. A general election will follow toward the end of this year, in which the new prime minister will seek popular support for his or her government. China has not been the only country to be attracted by Britain's openness to foreign investment, its flexible labor market, its strong legal system and English language, and London's global leadership in financial services - enhanced by British membership of the EU, the world's largest market for goods and services. Fast-developing Chinese multinationals like Huawei Technologies Co have followed numerous banks and multinationals from many countries outside Europe in making Britain their European home. But Britain post-Brexit, although still the world's fifth-largest economy, may not present the same compelling case for economic partnership for foreign investors as before. Britain's decision to leave the EU must cause dismay in Beijing. By making the United Kingdom one of its key partners within Europe, has China backed the wrong horse? This must be the question the Chinese leaders are asking themselves. The answer will depend largely on two things: first, the departure terms agreed by Britain with the EU, particularly regarding Britain's post-Brexit access to the single European market and the ease with which London-based financial institutions can continue to operate inside the EU; and second, Britain's longer-term success in creating a global economic footprint, based on developing trade relationships with important countries outside Europe like India and, yes, China. This longer-term development in turn depends on Britain's political leadership. But questions have emerged over Britain's leadership post-Brexit. It was widely expected that Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London and prominent advocate for Brexit in the run-up to the referendum, would succeed his former school and university classmate Cameron as prime minister in order to lead Britain forward into its unknown post-Brexit world. But Johnson's leadership campaign was suddenly derailed by his campaign manager Michael Gove's decision to run for the leadership position. This dark act of political assassination has been attributed to Chancellor George Osborne, a close friend of Gove, a former education minister and Johnson's partner during the campaign to leave the EU. This development has resulted in the current minister for home affairs, Theresa May, becoming the front-runner to become the new prime minister. In her six years as home secretary in Cameron's government, May has developed a reputation as a fierce protector of her own and her department's interests, rather than being a far-sighted and especially competent home affairs minister. Her own support of remaining in the EU before the referendum raises a question mark over her ability to lead Britain successfully out of the EU. The friction and disorder within the government following the referendum is mirrored within the British nation as a whole, with the "We're the 48" movement organizing a march in London to present their case for a rethink (the "48" refers to the 48 percent won by the Remain in Europe vote in the referendum). Many of these are the people in the middle - business people, doctors and farmers, of middle age, with large mortgages on small houses, and children being educated at expensive schools, who cannot afford much higher interest rates or an economic recession. It seems likely that this group will continue to express its shock and horror at the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union. Whoever becomes the new British prime minister, for China, much depends on the architect on the British side of the new Sino-British relationship, Osborne, remaining as an important member of the next government. If Osborne stays on as chancellor or moves to another important position within the government, like foreign secretary, then Britain's continued fostering of the China relationship is highly likely. If not, it's possible that within Britain's political establishment, other views less favorable to China might gain the ascendancy, even though Britain's post-Brexit focus on its global trading relationships surely highlight the significance of the Chinese relationship. The good news for China is that, although nothing is certain in politics (as Johnson's demise has demonstrated), Osborne is likely to remain a significant force within British politics for the foreseeable future. Although Britain will probably work out a post-Brexit solution with the European Commission to preserve some of the benefits of being an EU member, in the field of financial services, both Paris and Frankfurt are casting a greedy eye over London's strength in financial trading, settlement and associated services, particularly in the field of law. Here, it's unlikely that a London outside the EU will be able to maintain its financial dominance. Outside finance, large Japanese and American multinationals like Microsoft, Toyota and General Electric may decide to move their European centers of gravity to countries within the EU like Ireland, Belgium, Germany or France that have financial services infrastructure. But Britain's position both culturally and geographically between the European mainland and North America, with strong historic ties to the Middle and Far East and Australasia, should go far to maintain its continued global importance. As a rule, Chinese prefer to pursue long-term friendships. Now that the ice has been broken between Britain, which remains one of the West's most influential societies, and China, the main Asian power and leader of the newly emerging world, the Sino-British relationship will probably continue to be of real economic and strategic significance to both sides, with or without British membership in the EU. Much depends, however, on how Britain handles its new status, and how the British economy evolves over the next five or so years. The early signs are not particularly promising.

                    Huawei earns Europe's trust with excellence in high-tech

                With sales in the continent growing, telecom titan is set to meet its 2016 target of 140 million handsets "This is the guts of the business, this is what we do," our guide said, patting a large green, hardware-filled street cabinet sitting in the bowels of Huawei Technologies Co's UK headquarters in Reading. To the average Briton, Huawei is best known as a smartphone manufacturer. Its basic models could be an alternative to pricey market leaders. Some are aware of the TV commercial for its higher end P9 featuring movie stars Scarlett Johansson and Henry Cavill. But most would be unaware that Huawei plays a key role in the "last mile" technology that delivers superfast broadband from the pavement to some 20 million homes across the United Kingdom.   A woman tests Huawei Technologies Co's new Matebook at the Mobile World Congress in February in Barcelona. Huawei is the world's third-largest smartphone vendor after Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Apple Inc. AFP / Lluis Gene"This is where it all begins, the kit that weathers rain or shine... If this doesn't work, nothing else does." Reliable equipment and thrust on innovation have helped Huawei to emerge as the world's biggest telecommunication equipment manufacturer, after starting as a private reseller of PBX switches in China in 1987. Founded by Ren Zhengfei with an investment of $3,500, Huawei's revenue reached $60.8 billion in 2015. It's the only Chinese company in the Fortune 500 list to make more money abroad than domestically. The company said it will likely meet its sales target of 140 million handsets this year, driven by over 50 percent year-on-year growth in western and northeastern Europe, two of its fast-growing markets. Huawei is also the world's third-largest smartphone vendor after Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Apple Inc. The gap between Apple and Huawei is narrowing. Huawei's market share was 8.2 percent in the first quarter of this year, up from 5.2 percent last year, while Apple fell to 15.3 percent from 18.3 percent, with Samsung remaining at around 24 percent, market research firm International Data Corporation reported in July. Both Apple and Huawei are likely to benefit from Samsung's ill-fated Galaxy Note 7. Analysts attributed Huawei's success to its unique management and ownership structure. Huawei is a 98.6 percent employee-owned private entity run by rotating CEOs. Emphasis is on research, which received $38 billion over the last 10 years and 45 percent of its 176,000 employees worldwide. According to Roland Montagne, head of broadband practice at European telecoms think tank IDATE, making inroads into Europe is at the heart of Huawei's global rise. "Huawei decided to invest quite early in the European market because it's a center of expertise in terms of technology and it is a dynamic market," he said. "That's why they decided to collaborate quite quickly with the main players in Europe - BT, Orange, Telefonica, to mention a few." After setting up its first UK offices in 2003, Huawei clinched a game-changing supplier deal with British Telecom in 2005, to roll out the latter's 21st Century Network data network program. "At the time, very little was known about (Huawei) outside of Asia, it didn't really sell very much in Europe," said Mike Galvin, head of technology, services and operations at BT. "We compared Huawei's with others' equipment ... and we said this equipment meets our needs. It was well-made." Galvin said Huawei scored in terms of security of supply and ethical practices. He attributed much of its success to customer centricity. "The unique thing ... (about) Huawei ... is how close they are to their customers and how their customers drive what products they produce." Stefano Cantarelli, chief technology officer and network vice-president for UK and Ireland at Huawei, said gaining BT's trust opened the doors to other major deals in the UK and Europe. Carriers Vodafone and EE went on to buy Huawei equipment for their telecom networks. Huawei teamed up with EE later to launch the UK's first 4G LTE (long term evolution) network. The BT deal signified the opening up of the traditional, R&D-driven European operator market to Chinese vendors, Cantarelli said. "They (BT) have been fundamental in establishing trust, and we were able to get the second-biggest deal we got with Vodafone. It has been pivotal in creating a brand reputation." According to Montagne, maintaining such trust is imperative for Huawei as the new frontier of all-cloud transformation and cloud-based strategies offer a fresh set of complex security challenges.

                    Ireland now China's fifth-largest investment destination in Europe

                China pumped $2.9 billion into businesses in the small island nation in 2016Ireland will seize more opportunities brought by the Belt and Road Initiative, said Zhang Zhewei, China director of the Investment and Development Agency of Ireland.He made the remark to echo Premier Li Keqiang's emphasis of the initiative as a strategic move toward building a more open global economy at the close of the fifth plenary session of the 12th National People's Congress on March 15 while addressing the media. In a previous interview, Irish President Michael D. Higgins said that Ireland's medium-term economic plan (2014-20) has many points in common with China's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20).The president was quoted as saying that while the economic scale and the cultural settings are different, the two countries nonetheless share similar development histories. Both China and Ireland experienced the transition from agriculture to modernization, and have established a new mode of economic development in recent years.Ireland will be a strong partner and supporter of Chinese reform.Foreign direct investment from China to Ireland surged in 2016 to $2.9 billion from just $10 million a year earlier. This made Ireland the fifth-largest market in Europe for Chinese investment last year.The massive rise in investment was largely due to HNA Group's purchase of Irish aircraft leasing company Avolon for $2.5 billion.In 2017, Bohai Capital, a subsidiary of HNA Group and Avolon announced the $10 billion purchase of the leasing business of CIT Group, expanding its fleet to 910 aircraft valued at more than $43 billion.Ireland's energy sector also received a boost, with a $400 million investment from China General Nuclear Power's European arm in 14 Irish wind farms owned by Gaelectric.The wind power project will help to meet the electricity demand of 120,000 households and reduce carbon emissions by 250,000 tons annually.Chinese telecommunication giant Huawei has had offices in Ireland since 2004. They set up four research and development centers in Athlone, Cork City and Dublin with more than a hundred employees and have cooperated with O2, BT, ericom and Vodafone — all local mainstream businesses in broadband service and mobile network facilities.Ren Zhengfei, the founder and chief executive officer of Huawei, said in a previous interview that, "(Huawei) will invest more in Ireland in the future. We want to seek good architects looking at twenty or thirty years later to lead the world."Other sectors in Ireland to receive Chinese investment in 2016 include IT at $121 million; financial and business services at $26 million; electronics at $10 million; entertainment at $5 million; and industrial machinery and equipment at $3 million.Tim Gee, a mergers and acquisitions partner with Baker McKenzie, an international law firm based in Chicago, said the surge in investment from China into Ireland was indicative of a trend throughout Europe, as Chinese investors look to the transport, energy, ICT and industrial machinery sectors. "We expect 2017 to be another strong year globally," he said.Zhang said that with a relatively small population of 4.6 million, Ireland can't offer large-scale projects, like a Universal Studios-alike project for Chinese film and entertainment giant Wanda. What they can help with, though, is providing advisory services to promote appropriate investments and good communication between China and Ireland.

                    Huawei will cooperate with Ireland over security concerns
                </p>
            </a>

                Huawei is willing to cooperate fully with the government and security services of the Republic of Ireland, the Chinese telecommunications company has confirmed, following reports that a probe will assess risks linked to Huawei's involvement in Irish mobile networks.This week, British newspaper The Times reported that the Irish government had asked its intelligence agency to gauge whether Huawei's participation in the installation of 5G networks could pose a threat to national security."Huawei will remain fully transparent and cooperative if requested by the Irish government or the Commission for Communications Regulation," a Huawei spokesperson told China Daily. "Huawei is a long-term investor in Ireland and we are proud to be supporting the roll-out of mobile and broadband networks for the benefit of the public, the business community, and the economy as a whole."Huawei has had offices in Ireland since 2004 and has established research and development centers in Athlone, Cork, and Dublin. The company has also partnered in Ireland with network providers O2, BT, Eircom, and Vodafone.James Lawless, the Irish government's spokesman on technology, said some members of the country's business community have expressed concern about the risk of intellectual property violations arising from the use of Huawei equipment."I've been contacted by industry leaders who are deeply concerned about this issue and what is being done about it," Lawless told The Times. "The government may not view this issue as a headache but secure communications and the theft of intellectual property is a major issue for big information technology companies based here."Huawei has repeatedly denied claims that it installs spyware or acts on behalf of any foreign power."Huawei is wholly owned by its employees and is independent from the government of China," the spokesperson said.In February, Huawei Chairman Guo Ping denied allegations made by the United States that the company had assisted the Chinese government in espionage."Huawei has not and will never plant backdoors," Guo said. "And we will never allow anyone else to do so in our equipment."Both Australia and New Zealand have followed the US in effectively barring Huawei from participating in the development of 5G networks.A security review published last week also cast doubt over Huawei's involvement in setting up 5G networks in the United Kingdom.An oversight board that monitors Huawei's activity in Britain said it can only provide "limited assurance" that all national security risks stemming from Huawei's involvement in the UK's critical networks can be "sufficiently mitigated long-term".Responding to the report, a Huawei spokesperson told China Daily the company "understands the oversight board's concerns" and "takes them very seriously". The company said it is moving forward with a program in the UK to address security concerns."In November last year, Huawei's board of directors issued a resolution to carry out a company-wide transformation program aimed at enhancing our software engineering capabilities, with an initial budget of $2 billion," the spokesperson said.Last week, the European Commission called on all European Union member states to share data and address security risks linked to 5G technology, but ignored calls from the US to ban Huawei equipment."5G technology will transform our economy and society and open massive opportunities for people and businesses," said Andrus Ansip, European commissioner for the digital single market."But we cannot accept this happening without full security built-in. It is therefore essential that 5G infrastructures in the EU are resilient and fully secure from technical or legal backdoors."
