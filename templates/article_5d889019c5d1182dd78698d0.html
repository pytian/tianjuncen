                Ebola outbreak in Congo declared a global health emergency
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                GENEVA — The deadly Ebola outbreak in Congo is now an international health emergency, the World Health Organization announced on Wednesday after the virus spread this week to a city of two million people.A WHO expert committee had declined on three previous occasions to advise the United Nations health agency to make the declaration for this outbreak, which other experts say has long met the conditions. More than 1,600 people have died since August in the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history, which is unfolding in a region described as a war zone.This week the first Ebola case was confirmed in Goma, a major regional crossroads in northeastern Congo on the Rwandan border with an international airport. Health experts have feared this scenario for months.A declaration of a global health emergency often brings greater international attention and aid, along with concerns that nervous governments might overreact with border closures.While the risk of regional spread remains high the risk outside the region remains low, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said after the announcement in Geneva. "The (international emergency) should not be used to stigmatize or penalize the very people who are most in need of our help," he said.This is the fifth such declaration in history. Previous emergencies were declared for the devastating 2014-16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people, the emergence of Zika in the Americas, the swine flu pandemic and polio eradication.WHO defines a global emergency as an "extraordinary event" which constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response. Last month this outbreak spilled across the border for the first time when a family brought the virus into Uganda after attending the burial in Congo of an infected relative. Even then, the expert committee advised against a declaration.Alexandra Phelan, a global health expert at Georgetown University Law Center, said Wednesday's declaration was long overdue."This essentially serves as a call to the international community that they have to step up appropriate financial and technical support," she said but warned that countries should be wary of imposing travel or trade restrictions."Those restrictions would actually restrict the flow of goods and health care workers into affected countries so they are counter-productive," she said. Future emergency declarations might be perceived as punishment and "might result in other countries not reporting outbreaks in the future, which puts us all at greater risk."The current outbreak is spreading in a turbulent Congo border region where dozens of rebel groups are active and where Ebola had not been experienced before. Efforts to contain the virus have been hurt by mistrust by wary locals that has prompted deadly attacks on health workers. Some infected people have deliberately evaded health authorities.The pastor who brought Ebola to Goma used several fake names to conceal his identity on his way to the city, Congolese officials said. WHO on Tuesday said the man had died and health workers were scrambling to trace dozens of his contacts, including those who had traveled on the same bus.There was no immediate reaction to WHO's emergency declaration from Congo's health ministry, which had lobbied against it."Calling for a (global emergency) to raise funds while ignoring the negative consequences for (Congo) is reckless," the ministry tweeted following an editorial by Britain's secretary of state for international development in favor of a declaration. Rory Stewart announced earlier this week that Britain would donate up to another $63 million for the Ebola response and called for other countries, especially Francophone ones, to increase their support.At a UN meeting on Ebola in Geneva on Tuesday, Congo's health minister, Dr. Oly Ilunga, said the outbreak was "not a humanitarian crisis" and that the risk of Ebola spreading to other cities or regions in Congo remained the same."Ebola is not rocket science, it's very simple," he said.WHO has long called the regional Ebola risk "very high."Earlier this week, Ugandan health officials said a Congolese fish trader had traveled to Uganda while sick and vomited several times at a local market. The woman returned to Congo last week and died after testing positive for Ebola. Ugandan officials estimate almost 600 people could be targeted for vaccination and follow-up.Those working in the field say the outbreak is clearly taking a turn for the worse despite advances in this outbreak that include the widespread use of an experimental but effective Ebola vaccine.Dr. Maurice Kakule was one of the first people to survive the current outbreak after he fell ill while treating a woman last July before the outbreak had even been declared."What is clear is that Ebola is an emergency because the epidemic persists despite every possible effort to educate people," he told the Geneva meeting. "We have sufficiently informed them about the existence of this disease but there are still people who don't want to believe that it does."AP

                    Ebola vaccinations could start Wednesday in Congo outbreak

                 BENI, Congo— The deadly Ebola virus has killed at least nine people in Congo's latest outbreak in North Kivu province, the country's health ministry said Tuesday, while the World Health Organization said vaccinations could begin as early as Wednesday.The outbreak declared last week in North Kivu in the northeast near Uganda and Rwanda is a new outbreak and not connected to the one in Congo's northwest that was declared over on July 24, WHO's emergency preparedness chief, Peter Salama, said on Twitter.Salama cited new results of genetic analysis that confirm the strain of Ebola in the new outbreak is the Zaire strain, one for which the vaccine can be used.Congo's health ministry has said the new vaccination campaign will target health care providers, contacts of confirmed Ebola cases and their contacts, the same strategy that was used to contain the previous outbreak in Equateur province in which more than 3,300 people were vaccinated. That outbreak more than 2,500 kilometers (1,553 miles) away had 33 confirmed Ebola deaths.WHO has said 3,000 doses of the vaccine are still in Congo's capital, Kinshasa, and it can access up to 300,000 more on short notice.Health experts in the city closest to the new outbreak, Beni, have been setting up "cold chains" to keep the vaccines at the optimal temperature of minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 158 degrees Fahrenheit), a challenge in a region with hot temperatures and unreliable power supplies.WHO has warned that this new outbreak poses a particular challenge as the region is a "war zone" with several active armed groups and tens of thousands of displaced people. Heavily traveled borders nearby with Uganda and Rwanda also complicate efforts to contain the disease, which is spread via contact with the bodily fluids of those infected, including the dead.At least nine Ebola deaths are confirmed in the new outbreak, which was declared Aug. 1, the health minister, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, said in a statement Tuesday. There are 16 confirmed cases of the hemorrhagic fever, 27 probable cases and now 46 suspected ones under investigation.Health experts have identified at least 966 contacts who are now under surveillance.Congo has dealt with Ebola for decades and this is its tenth outbreak of the virus. Ebola, first identified in the country in 1976, jumps to humans from animals including bats and monkeys. There is no specific treatment, and the virus can be fatal in up to 90 percent of cases, depending on the strain.AP

                The World Health Organization and China signed on Friday a new funding agreement to support the response to the current Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), illustrating the strengthening of collaborative efforts between the WHO and China toward the advancement of global public health.As of Sunday, the Ministry of Health of the DRC had reported 83 confirmed cases in North Kivu province and 47 confirmed deaths."China's support will help the WHO save lives and bring this outbreak under control as quickly as possible," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general. "It's a strong statement of solidarity with the people of DRC, and builds on previous joint responses to public health crises in Africa, Syria and Yemen. We are committed to working together to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable."In response to this latest outbreak, the Ministry of Health of the DRC has rapidly initiated response mechanisms in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include the establishment and strengthening of surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, clinical management, community engagement and preparedness activities in neighboring provinces and countries, among others.The support from China will contribute to the WHO's response capacity in North Kivu. China also plans to send staff on temporary assignment from Chinese national health authorities to the WHO response effort.As of Aug 19 this year, the WHO had deployed over 100 technical and logistics specialists to support Ebola response activities. Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partner institutions continue to support the response as well as ongoing readiness and preparedness activities in nonaffected provinces of the DRC and in neighboring countries.

                 JOHANNESBURG－Rebels killed 15 civilians and abducted a dozen children in an attack at the epicenter of the latest deadly Ebola outbreak in eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a military source said on Sunday, as the violence again forced crucial virus-containment efforts to be suspended."It will be very hard to stop the outbreak if this violence continues," said the World Health Organization's emergencies chief, Peter Salama.A regional WHO official said that it was difficult to say how long work would be affected.Confirmed Ebola cases have reached 202 in this outbreak, including 118 deaths.Allied Democratic Forces (or ADF) rebels attacked the country's army positions and several neighborhoods of Beni on Saturday and into Sunday, Captain Mak Hazukay Mongha said. The United Nations peacekeeping mission said its troops exchanged fire with rebels in Beni's Mayangose area.The ADF rebels have killed hundreds of civilians in recent years and are just one of several militias active in DR Congo's far northeast.Another deadly attack last month in Beni forced the suspension of Ebola-containment efforts for days, complicating work to track suspected contacts of infected people. Since then, many of the new confirmed Ebola cases have been reported in Beni, and the rate of new cases overall has more than doubled, alarming aid groups.Health efforts in recent weeks had started to show results, and this new attack "will bring us back", said Michel Yao, WHO's incident manager for Ebola in North Kivu province.The attack came after two medical agents with the DR Congo army were shot dead by another rebel group the first time health workers have been killed in this outbreak.DR Congo's health minister called it a "dark day" for everyone fighting Ebola.Mai Mai rebels surged from the forest and opened fire on the unarmed agents with the army's rapid intervention medical unit outside Butembo city, the health ministry said.Health workers in this outbreak, declared on Aug 1, have described hearing gunshots daily, operating under the armed escort of UN peacekeepers or local security forces and ending work by sundown to lower the risk of attack.AP

                Felix Tshisekedi took the oath of office as the fifth president of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday, marking the first peaceful, democratic transfer of power since independence in 1960 from Belgium.The ceremony took place at the State Palace, in the capital city of Kinshasa. Media reports said that Tshisekedi, 55, was taken ill during his inauguration and briefly halted his speech. He later continued and called for national reconciliation, saying that his government will promote stability, peace and security.Tshisekedi is taking office following a ruling by the Constitutional Court that upheld his victory. He had clinched 38.5 percent of the votes while Martin Fayulu, also from the opposition had 34.8 percent in a presidential election in December.Tshisekedi succeeds Joseph Kabila, who has been on the helm for 18 years. Kabila took over from his father Laurent-Desire Kabila, who was assassinated in 2011. He had led a successful coup that toppled Mobutu Sese Seko's 32-year rule.Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta was the only head of state at the swearing in event. Raila Odinga, Kenya's opposition leader, also was present.

                    WHO urges for int'l support as Ebola cases near 1,000 in D. R. Congo
                </p>

                GENEVA - The World Health Organization (WHO) on Saturday called for urgent global support to deal with the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as the number of infected cases approaches 1,000.Since the Ebola outbreak was declared in the DRC in August 2018, the number of confirmed and probable cases has amounted to 993, resulting in 621 deaths.Though more than 96,000 people have been vaccinated in the country, and more than 44 million border screenings have helped to slow the spread of Ebola, the risk of national and regional spread remains very high, especially when episodes of violence and instability impact the response, the WHO warned in a statement."This outbreak has gone on far too long. We owe it to the people of North Kivu to work with them in solidarity not only to end this outbreak as soon as possible, but to build the health systems that address the many other health threats they face on a daily basis," WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.Currently the UN health agency has more than 700 people in the DRC addressing the concerns of the affected communities. But "their fear of violence is now compounded by fear of Ebola," said Dr. Tedros.The WHO chief vowed that despite the increased attacks by armed groups, the WHO "will stay the course and will work with communities to end this outbreak together with the Ministry of Health and partners"."We need redoubled support from the international community, and a commitment to push together to bring this outbreak to an end," he added, referring to a financial need of at least $148 million for the next six months, though only half, or 74 million dollars, had been received as of March 19.The WHO urged donors to help close the funding gap so as to end the outbreak as soon as possible.

                    Ebola case confirmed in eastern DR Congo city

                KINSHASA, The Democratic Republic of the Congo - The first case of Ebola has been confirmed in Goma, the biggest city to have been affected by the disease since its outbreak in eastern DR Congo in August, the country's Health Ministry said on Sunday.The patient is a pastor who had been preaching in church and would have touched the hands of worshippers "including the sick", the ministry said in a statement.His symptoms first appeared on July 9 in Butembo, one of the main towns touched by Ebola where he had been preaching.He left by bus on Friday to Goma, the capital of North Kivu Province, arriving early Sunday where "the results of the laboratory test confirmed that he was positive for Ebola", the ministry said."Given that the patient was quickly identified, as well as all the passengers on the bus from Butembo, the risk of the disease spreading in the city of Goma is low," the ministry said.The other 18 passengers and the driver will begin getting vaccinations on Monday, it added.Health workers in Goma were vaccinated as early as December when the outbreak first hit Butembo some 300 km further north. The two towns are separated by poor roads under the threat of armed groups.The World Health Organization had initially voiced hope it would be able to contain the highly contagious hemorrhagic fever, thanks in part to the new vaccine.The latest Ebola outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has so far killed 1,655 people and 694 have been cured, according to a Health Ministry bulletin on Saturday.But efforts to tackle the crisis have been hampered both by militia attacks on treatment centers, in which some staff have been killed, and by the hostility of some local people to the medical teams.The disease spreads among humans through close contact with the blood, body fluids, secretions or organs of an infected person, or objects contaminated by such fluids.The current outbreak, which started last August in North Kivu Province, has infected at least 2,300 people, according to the WHO.Agencies
