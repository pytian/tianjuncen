                South Africa's unemployment rate hits highest level
            </p>
            <p>
                South Africa's unemployment rate increased by 1.4 percent to 29 percent in the second quarter of 2019, the highest level since the first quarter of 2008, according to data released by Statistics South Africa.The number of unemployed increased by 455 000 to 6.7 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter, resulting in an increase of 476,000 in the labor force, according to the data released on Tuesday.The employment rate also increased by 21,000 to 16.3 million in the second quarter of 2019. The absorption rate, which is the proportion of the working-age population that is employed, decreased by 0.2 percent to 42.4 percent.According to the Quarterly Labour Force survey, there are few job opportunities and about 71.5 percent of those unemployed have been looking for work for a period of a year or longer.The report comes barely a month after South Africa's National Treasury reported 3.2 percent contraction of the country's gross domestic product in the first quarter of this year, the worst performance in a decade. However, analysts said that they are optimistic that the economy can regain its growth trajectory if some few things are fixed.Sikhumbuzo Zondi, a research assistant at the Institute for Global Dialogue associated with the University of South Africa, said that despite the poor performance in the first quarter, economic growth is likely to pick up by the end of the second quarter, stimulated mostly by exports.He said the government's policy in structural reforms is vital for stimulating economic growth, noting that it remains a risk to investors at the moment."Following the investment and job summits organized by the government, there is confidence in the Ramaphosa administration that it would deliver on its promise of growing the economy and increasing employment rate," he said.To avoid further economic contraction, Zondi said the country should reshape its industrial policy, which is a fundamental driver for growth and industrial development.It should also ensure a stable power supply for investors to regain confidence in the country's manufacturing sector, which is a huge catalyst and contributor to growth.He termed load shedding as the biggest risk for the economy currently. "The Ramaphosa government should hold Eskom (the state power company) firmly accountable in this matter, as to whether it has the ability to produce stable power supplies," he said.In a speech to parliament last month, Pravin Gordhan, minister for Public Enterprises, affirmed that many of the biggest state-owned enterprises are in deep financial difficulties and will be unable to trade their way out of their difficulties.He attributed the challenges to a decade of mismanagement, negligible board and executive fiduciary accountability for poor performance, malfeasance that enabled state capture, and rampant corruption.Zondi believes that the National Treasury should stabilize the debts of the state-owned enterprises."Unless something is done about these enterprises, the South African economy in terms of revenue generation will remain at risk and this in turn will hit hard on taxpayers who have been forced to pay higher personal income tax, value added tax and several fuel charged increases," he said.

                Xi urges BRICS to strengthen strategic partnership, improve global governance
            </a>
            <p>
                OSAKA, Japan - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday called on BRICS countries to enhance their strategic partnership and promote the improvement of global governance.Xi made the remarks at a meeting with other BRICS leaders on the sidelines of a summit of the Group of 20 (G20) major economies in the Japanese city of Osaka.Xi said that the international situation is now in a complicated and severe period, with the world economy maintaining growth on the whole but uncertainty and instability increasing significantly.He urged BRICS countries, which also include Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa, to do their own work well, and enhance their economic resilience and ability to withstand external risks.Meanwhile, he said, BRICS countries need to strengthen solidarity and cooperation, advance the building of a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation, and foster a sound international environment.The Chinese president proposed that BRICS countries strengthen their strategic partnership, noting that in the second decade of BRICS cooperation mechanism, the leaders of the five countries should play a strategic leading role, steer BRICS cooperation in the right direction and continue to make steady progress in this regard.He said that BRICS countries need to strengthen policy coordination within multilateral frameworks such as the United Nations (UN), the G20 and the World Trade Organization (WTO), and to advance "BRICS Plus" cooperation by working with other emerging-market countries and developing countries.Meanwhile, Xi proposed that the five countries promote the improvement of global governance.He called on BRICS members to firmly uphold multilateralism, safeguard the international order based on international law and the international system with the UN at its core, advocate extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, and oppose illegal unilateral sanctions and "long-arm jurisdiction."BRICS countries should take a clear-cut stand against protectionism, protect the core values and basic principles of the WTO, actively promote the international community's implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change, and promote the main theme of international cooperation, he said.In addition, the Chinese president proposed that BRICS countries deepen practical cooperation in various areas.The five countries need to promote cooperation in economy, politics and security, and people-to-people and cultural exchanges in a balanced manner, accelerate the building of practical cooperation projects such as the BRICS partnership for a new industrial revolution, the BRICS Innovation network and the future network research institute, and enhance their competitiveness, he said.They also need to deeply engage themselves with global innovation cooperation, jointly advocate mutual benefit, foster an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment, and allow all countries, including emerging-market countries and developing countries, and their businesses to participate in and benefit from innovation, Xi said.The Chinese president also called on BRICS countries to continue to support and help each other and make unremitting efforts for the better lives of their peoples and the building of a community with a shared future for humanity.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa attended the meeting, which was chaired by Bolsonaro. Brazil holds the rotating presidency of BRICS mechanism.The leaders of other BRICS countries agreed that the world today is full of uncertainties, as the international community faces challenges such as the rise of unilateralism and protectionism, the weakening of and destruction to international trade rules and the WTO, and the urgent need to strengthen the inclusiveness of development.BRICS countries need to strengthen coordination, more actively play a leading role, safeguard multilateralism and rules-based international trading system, promote fair and sustainable patterns of development and trade based on mutual respect, and develop a more balanced international trade negotiations agenda, so as to play an even bigger role in boosting common prosperity and world economic growth, they agreed.BRICS countries should better demonstrate the strategic value of their solidarity and cooperation, firmly uphold the development right of developing countries, and raise the status of emerging economies and developing countries in global affairs, they said.BRICS countries also need to strengthen cooperation in digital economy, energy and finance to better resist external risks, urging the G20 summit to focus on development and implement its commitments on development assistance to Africa.A press communique was issued after the BRICS leaders' meeting.

                Xi's trip to Osaka drives multilateralism, G20 cooperation, global economy
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - Attending the summit of the Group of 20 (G20) major economies and holding meetings with his counterparts, Chinese President Xi Jinping paid a three-day visit to Osaka, Japan, which has proved a success with expanding consensus on the promotion of multilateralism and providing direction for both the G20 cooperation and global growth.Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi made the remarks while noting that the 14th summit happened at a historic moment when chaos and uncertainties have brought the world to a critical crossroads, and that Xi's tight diplomatic agenda marked China's continuous efforts as a reliable and responsible major country to help with broad visions and workable solutions.Envisioning a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind, Xi's efforts were focused on promoting multilateralism, partnerships, mutually beneficial cooperation and joint development, which helped expand consensus, push forward cooperation, and increase confidence in global peace and development.According to Wang, Xi's speech at the G20 summit struck an extensive chord and China's ideas received widespread support. In addition, the world is happy to see that Xi's meetings with other leaders will help shape healthier major-country relations, that new opportunities will come with the new measures Xi announced for China's further opening-up, and that Xi and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed that the two countries will restart trade talks.Wide consensusDuring his trip to Osaka, by upholding multilateralism, the Chinese president guided the dialogue and discussions towards the direction of cooperation and inclusiveness in order to achieve win-win results.Xi made four overseas trips since the beginning of June, setting a record for the history of the diplomacy of The People's Republic of China, Wang said.Xi put forward a four-point proposal in his speech at the summit, including exploring driving force for growth, improving global governance, removing development bottlenecks, and properly addressing differences.Those proposals have outlined the direction to tackle the challenges facing the world economy, which is conducive to creating greater space for the global development and a better environment for international cooperation, Wang said.With joint efforts, the G20 summit in Osaka has voiced support for multilateralism. It has been proven that upholding and practicing multilateralism is not just China's choice, but a consensus and wish of the majority of countries in the world, Wang said.Besides, on the sidelines of the G20 summit, Xi also attended a meeting of BRICS nations, China-Africa leaders' meeting, China-Russia-India leaders' meeting, and held a series of bilateral meetings.During the meetings, Xi urged more efforts to promote global governance based on the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, safeguard the international system with the UN at the core and the international law as the foundation, preserve the multilateral trade regime with the World Trade Organization at the core and the rules as the foundation, promote multilateralism and free trade, push forward the democratization of international relations, and build an open world economy, Wang said.Meanwhile, Xi met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe with the two sides reaching a 10-point consensus to promote the development of bilateral relations.When meeting with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Xi said the more complex and severe the situation is, the more necessary it is to highlight the UN's authority and role.Xi also exchanged views and reached new consensus with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on bilateral relations and the Korean Peninsula situation.

                S. Africans mark Mandela Day with focus on poverty
            </a>
            <p>
                On Thursday, South Africans marked the International Nelson Mandela Day with commitments to fight poverty.Several activities, including donations and visiting the sick, took place across the country under the theme of action against poverty.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa started off his celebrations with a visit to RX Radio, the Red Cross Children's Hospital radio station, staffed by children at the hospital in Rondebosch. Most of the children at the hospital have disabilities or are suffering from chronic diseases.As a studio guest, Ramaphosa was interviewed by the young radio anchors. He said he was touched by the children's hope, evident on their faces and their articulate questions as they interviewed him, despite the many health challenges they are grappling with.Ramaphosa said Mandela, who would be celebrating his 101st birthday, acted like a father to many children across the globe. He admitted to having learned a lot of virtues from Mandela, which he is committed to applying in his leadership.Patricia de Lille, minister for public works and infrastructure, spent Mandela Day at Athlone in Cape Town, where she donated 20 computers to Saartjie Baartman Centre for Women and Children.The minister also participated in various activities together with the women and the children at the center. The activities included gardening, crowning of trees, pruning of branches, weeding, mowing grass, and planting trees.Noxolo Kiviet, the deputy minister, commemorated the day at iKhaya lo Xolo Old Age Home in Gugulethu, Cape Town, where she donated 30 curtains.The department staff who had accompanied the deputy minister, spent the day painting, gardening and cleaning the old age home.Barbara Creecy, the minister for environment, forestry and fisheries, together with volunteers from Bridgetown, Atlhone, and pupils from Cypress Primary School, braved the cold weather to participate in a World Wide Fund for Nature led cleanup.Chinese companies operating in South Africa were also not left out of the donation activities.Huawei South Africa, donated $144,190 in scholarships to ICT and engineering postgraduate students at the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.Graca Machel, the widow of Nelson Mandela, called on South Africans to view Mandela Day as their lifestyle, instead of an event."Mandela Day is a reminder that any one of us has the power to take initiative and drive transformation. Decide on the difference you can make to people throughout the year so that it becomes a lifestyle," she said.Mandela Day was officially declared by the United Nations in 2009, four years before South Africa's first democratically elected president died at the age of 95.
