                To celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a series of scenic spots and parks across the country will cut their ticket prices or even offer free admission.In Beijing, some renowned parks, including Tiantan (Temple of Heaven) Park, the Summer Palace, Beijing Zoo, Taoranting Park, Badachu Park, Ditan Park, Chaoyang Park, Beijing International Sculpture Park and Beijing Garden Expo Park, will open to public for free on Oct 1.But citizens and tourists still need tickets to visit these attractions. Tickets can be reserved through an attraction's official website, WeChat account or official app, and then exchange tickets at designated sites.Other than the capital city, the charge for a number of scenic spots across the country will be reduced, according to local authorities in some popular tourist destinations, such as East China's Zhejiang and Shandong provinces and Central China's Henan and Hunan provinces.In Zhejiang's Grand Buddha Temple scenic spot, a 4A level tourist destination, for example, the ticket price will be cut down from 100 yuan ($14.10) to 80 yuan, starting on Sept 30, a day before National Day.In Henan province, the provincial development and reform department recently asked relevant authorities to step up efforts to launch price reduction programs for some 4A- and 5A-level scenic areas before National Day.In recent years, the National Development and Reform Commission has issued a number of papers urging governments at all levels to lower ticket prices to benefit the public and encourage the boom in the tourism industry, according to China National Radio.
