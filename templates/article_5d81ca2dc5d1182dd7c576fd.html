                Car Crashes Into Lobby of Trump Plaza in NYC Suburb
            </p>
            <p>
                A car crashed into the lobby of Trump Plaza in New Rochelle, New York, late Tuesday, CBS New York reports. Authorities said the crash appeared to be an accident, and left the driver and one other person with minor injuries. Sgt. Chris Castiglia of the New Rochelle Police Department said police are still investigating what caused the accident, but it didn’t appear to be intentional. In videos from the scene, the car could be seen sitting in the middle of the lobby with shattered glass and other debris scattered around it. According to employees, the male driver got out of the vehicle after crashing into the building, took a seat on a sofa and “said nothing.

                Trump defends his creditworthiness following New York Times article saying Deutsche Bank ignored Trump-related suspicious activity reports
            </a>
            <p>
                President Donald Trump on Monday defended his personal financial creditworthiness and his long-standing client relationship with Deutsche Bank.The New York Times reported over the weekend that the German bank ignored red flags raised by its own employees about potentially illegal transactions between Trump and other outside entities.Trump accused the Times of "writing phony stories about how I didn't use many banks because they didn't want to do business with me. WRONG! It is because I didn't need money."WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Monday defended his personal financial creditworthiness and his long-standing relationship with Deutsche Bank, following a New York Times report over the weekend that the German bank had ignored red flags raised by its own employees about potentially illegal transactions between Trump and other outside entities.In a series of tweets Monday, Trump ignored the crux of the story, which was how the bank handled suspicious activity reports filed by bank employees about transactions involving both Trump-controlled entities and companies controlled by his son-in-law and White House advisor Jared Kushner.Instead, one particular line in the story appeared to strike a nerve with the president: Times reporter David Enrich's description of Deutsche Bank as "the only mainstream financial institution consistently willing to do business with the real estate developer."Trump accused the Times of "writing phony stories about how I didn't use many banks because they didn't want to do business with me. WRONG! It is because I didn't need money." TWEET 1The tweets were the latest chapter in the president's decadeslong effort to refute published reports that his previous business bankruptcies, failed ventures and litigious reputation have rendered Trump and his family real estate company an undesirable client for some of Wall Street's biggest banks.These failures have included a string of casino bankruptcies, the bankruptcy of the Plaza Hotel in New York City, and a failed airline, mortgage company and for-profit learning company.According to the Times, Goldman Sachs at one point used Trump as an example for new employees of precisely the kind of prospective client they should avoid.A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment about the tweets. But a Trump Organization spokeswoman told the Times this weekend that the company has no knowledge of any suspicious activity reports, and that it does not have any "operating accounts with Deutsche Bank."Trump does, however owe hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to Deutsche Bank, which has financed several of his most high-profile real estate acquisitions during the past decade, including the Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C., now operating as the Trump International Hotel.According to Trump's latest financial disclosure form, filed last week with the Office of Government Ethics, the president also owes tens of millions of dollars to several smaller banks for loans dating as far back as 2000 and as recently as last year.Starting in 2005, Trump also purchased a string of properties using cash, including five houses, eight golf courses both in the U.S. and overseas, and a winery in Virginia, that The Washington Post estimates cost Trump a total of more than $400 million.The Trumps have so far offered few details about where exactly the cash for these purchases came from, save to say that it was the result of running profitable businesses.In his tweets Monday, Trump alluded to questions surrounding the all-cash purchases, and denied the money came from Russian investors.Trump's personal denial that Russian money helped finance his buying spree is unlikely to satisfy congressional Democrats, who are seeking far more information than that, up to and including the president's tax returns.Earlier this spring, the House Oversight Committee subpoenaed Mazars USA, Trump's longtime accounting firm, for records related to the president's alleged misrepresentation of his assets in previous efforts to get a loan.Earlier this month, the Trump family sued both Deutsche Bank and Mazars, seeking to prevent them from turning records over to congressional investigators.

                UPDATE 4-Trump set to discuss biofuels Thursday with USDA, EPA -sources
            </a>
            <p>
                (Adds paragraph about election; updates biofuel credit market prices)WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Aug 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, faced with mounting anger in the farm belt over policies that allow oil refineries to use less corn-based ethanol, summoned Cabinet members on Thursday to discuss ways to boost biofuel demand, four sources familiar with the matter said.Throughout his 2016 campaign that brought him to power, Trump championed ethanol, but also courted the oil industry. However his latest decision to grant dozens of waivers to oil refineries infuriated farmers, a key constituency he is counting for re-election in 2020.Trump was scheduled to meet with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler at the White House, the sources said. They said the officials will present options to boost ethanol demand, which farmers say has slumped since the EPA exempted dozens of refineries from ethanol requirements.One proposal to be presented, which is advocated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is rescinding seven or eight of the waivers the administration has granted to refineries, according to a memo of five proposals obtained by Reuters. Sources said government agencies have agreed on four of the proposals.The sticking point, however, is the key proposal of redistributing projected volumes that could be exempted through 2020 annual biofuel mandate and thereafter, according to the memo. The USDA and EPA remain divided on the issue.David Fialkov, a lobbyist for NATSO, the national association representing the travel plaza and truckstop industry, said an agreement on that proposal was key for biofuels."As long as EPA continues issuing small refinery exemptions without accounting for waived volumes in establishing the underlying renewable fuel mandate every year, fuel marketers wont be motivated to buy biofuels. End of story," Fialkov said.The remaining proposals agreed upon are for the EPA taking steps to make infrastructure for E15, a higher ethanol blend of gasoline, more accessible, and the USDA and EPA working together to amend the Reset rule, which will be dictating new blending mandates for a slew of biofuels for the next several years and beyond. The last one is for the EPA to take action to encourage flex-fuel vehicles that can use E85, a higher ethanol blend.U.S. regulations require refiners to blend biofuels into their gasoline or buy credits to fund those refiners who can. Small refiners can seek exemptions, but Trump's EPA has granted waivers to refineries owned by the likes of Exxon Mobil Corp , Chevron Corp and billionaire Carl Icahn.U.S. farmers have already been suffering due to crop prices slump and exports shrink due to Trump's trade war with China. On Wednesday, biofuel industry groups and farm-state lawmakers complained to the White House about refinery waivers.'ENOUGH IS ENOUGH'The backlash from agricultural and biofuel trade groups has been particularly strong in Iowa, the largest producer of corn and ethanol, and a swing state won twice by former Democrat President Barack Obama but which voted for Trump in 2016.Democratic presidential hopefuls have spent a lot of time in Iowa because it holds an early nominating contest, and they have used the refinery issue as a cudgel. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said that if elected, she would block pending refinery waiver applications and look to reverse any ones approved. She said, at a maximum, only a few should be approved.Farmers and biofuel producers have complained that Trump is favoring the oil industry at their expense. Over the past month, several biofuel plants announced shutdowns or production cutbacks, including the largest U.S. ethanol producer POET.On Thursday, American GreenFuels, owned by Kolmar Americas, said it was slashing output by 50% in fourth quarter, citing pain from waivers and a biodiesel tax credit that expired and has not been renewed."Enough is enough," Raf Aviner, president of Kolmar Americas said in a statement. "We cannot justify buying more feedstock under these market conditions."Refiners and some academics dispute the contention that waivers have decimated ethanol demand, and the industry and its allies have fought to keep the waivers intact.On Thursday, North America's Building Trades Unions (NABTU) sent a letter to Trump supporting waivers, saying they significantly reduced costs for refineries and alleviated a threat to thousands of jobs.Renewable fuel credits for 2019 traded at 16.5 cents apiece throughout the session on Thursday, up from 14.75 cents each on Wednesday, traders said. The credits have steadily climbed from trading at 11 cents apiece two weeks ago as refiners sought to actively buy in the market.

                US to commemorate 9/11 as its aftermath extends and evolves
            </a>
            <p>
                Americans are commemorating 9/11 with mournful ceremonies, volunteering, appeals to "never forget" and rising attention to the terror attacks' extended toll on responders.A crowd of victims' relatives is expected at ground zero Wednesday, while President Donald Trump is scheduled to join an observance at the Pentagon. Vice President Mike Pence is to speak at the third attack site, near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.Former President George W. Bush, the commander-in-chief at the time of the 2001 attacks, is due at an afternoon wreath-laying at the Pentagon.Eighteen years after the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil, the nation is still grappling with the aftermath at ground zero, in Congress and beyond. The attacks' aftermath is visible from airport security checkpoints to Afghanistan. A rocket exploded at the U.S. embassy as the anniversary began in Afghanistan, where a post-9/11 invasion has become America's longest war."People say, 'Why do you stand here, year after year?'" Chundera Epps, a sister of September 11 victim Christopher Epps, said at last year's ceremony at the World Trade Center. "Because soldiers are still dying for our freedom. First responders are still dying and being ill.""We can't forget. Life won't let us forget," she added.The anniversary ceremonies center on remembering the nearly 3,000 people killed when hijacked planes rammed into the trade center, the Pentagon and a field near Shanksville on September 11, 2001. All those victims' names are read aloud at the ground zero ceremony, where moments of silence and tolling bells mark the moments when the aircraft crashed and the trade center's twin towers fell.But there has been growing awareness in recent years of the suffering of another group of people tied to the tragedy: firefighters, police and others who died or fell ill after exposure to the wreckage and the toxins unleashed in it.While research continues into whether those illnesses are tied to 9/11 toxins, a victims compensation fund for people with potentially September 11-related health problems has awarded more than $5.5 billion so far. Over 51,000 people have applied.After years of legislative gridlock, dwindling money in the fund and fervent activism by ailing first responders and their advocates, Congress this summer made sure the fund won't run dry . Trump, a Republican and a New Yorker who was in the city on 9/11, signed the measure in July.The sick gained new recognition this year at the memorial plaza at ground zero, where the new 9/11 Memorial Glade was dedicated this spring.The tribute features six large stacks of granite inlaid with salvaged trade center steel, with a dedication "to those whose actions in our time of need led to their injury, sickness, and death." No one is named specifically.Some 9/11 memorials elsewhere already included sickened rescue, recovery and cleanup workers, and there is a remembrance wall entirely focused on them in Nesconset, on Long Island. But those who fell ill or were injured, and their families, say having a tribute at ground zero carries special significance.Meanwhile, the Pentagon announced Monday that its 9/11 memorial will close next week for electrical and lighting work. The project, expected to take until late May, includes repairs to lighting glitches in the shallow reflecting pools under the memorial benches.September 11 is known not only as a day for remembrance and patriotism, but also as a day of service. People around the country continue to volunteer at food banks, schools, home-building projects, park cleanups and other charitable endeavors on and near the anniversary.

                Who is behind Trump’s links to Arab princes? A billionaire friend
            </a>
            <p>
                The billionaire financier Tom Barrack was caught in a bind.In April 2016, his close friend Donald J. Trump was about to clinch the Republican presidential nomination. But Mr. Trump's outspoken hostility to Muslims — epitomized by his call for a ban on Muslim immigrants — was offending the Persian Gulf princes Mr. Barrack had depended on for decades as investors and buyers."Confusion about your friend Donald Trump is VERY high," Ambassador Yousef al-Otaiba of the United Arab Emirates emailed back when Mr. Barrack tried to introduce the candidate, in a message not previously reported. Mr. Trump's image, the ambassador warned, "has many people extremely worried."More from the New York Times:Blood will tell, Part 1: Who Killed Mickey Bryan?How Boots Riley infiltrated HollywoodThe evangelical fight to win back CaliforniaNot deterred, Mr. Barrack, a longtime friend who had done business with the ambassador, assured him that Mr. Trump understood the Persian Gulf perspective. "He also has joint ventures in the U.A.E.!" Mr. Barrack wrote in an email on April 26.The emails were the beginning of Mr. Trump's improbable transformation from a candidate who campaigned against Muslims to a president celebrated in the royal courts of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi as perhaps the best friend in the White House that their rulers have ever had. It is a shift that testifies not only to Mr. Trump's special flexibility, but also to Mr. Barrack's unique place in the Trump world, at once a fellow tycoon and a flattering courtier, a confidant and a power broker.During the Trump campaign, Mr. Barrack was a top fund-raiser and trusted gatekeeper who opened communications with the Emiratis and Saudis, recommended that the candidate bring on Paul Manafort as campaign manager — and then tried to arrange a secret meeting between Mr. Manafort and the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Mr. Barrack was later named chairman of Mr. Trump's inaugural committee.But Mr. Manafort has since been indicted by the special prosecutor investigating Russian meddling in the presidential election. The same inquiry is examining whether the Emiratis and Saudis helped sway the election in Mr. Trump's favor — potentially in coordination with the Russians, according to people familiar with the matter. Investigators have also asked witnesses about specific contributions and expenses related to the inauguration, according to people familiar with those interviews.A spokesman for Mr. Barrack said he has been advised he is not a target of the special prosecutor. Investigators interviewed him in December but asked questions almost exclusively about Mr. Manafort and his associate Rick Gates, said a person familiar with the questioning.Mr. Barrack has steered clear of any formal role in the administration; he has said he rebuffed offers to become treasury secretary or ambassador to Mexico. (He sought a role as a special envoy for Middle East economic development, but the idea never gained traction in the White House.)Instead, he has continued making money, as he has for decades, working with the same Persian Gulf contacts he introduced two years ago to Mr. Trump. Mr. Barrack's company, known as Colony NorthStar since a merger last year, has raised more than $7 billion in investments since Mr. Trump won the nomination, and 24 percent of that money has come from the Persian Gulf — all from either the U.A.E. or Saudi Arabia, according to an executive familiar with the figures. Colony NorthStar has not disclosed the investors in its funds.Mr. Barrack's email correspondence with Ambassador Otaiba, which has not previously been reported, was provided to The New York Times by an anonymous group critical of Emirati foreign policy, and it illustrates the formative role Mr. Barrack played as a matchmaker between Mr. Trump and the Persian Gulf princes.Mr. Barrack's representatives did not dispute the authenticity of the emails. His spokesman said in a statement that Mr. Barrack "sees his business in the Middle East as a way to help political dialogue and understanding, not the other way around, and he does so through relationships that span as far back as the reign of even some of the grandfathers of the current regional rulers."But having the ear of the president, say other executives and former diplomats who work in the Gulf, has only enhanced Mr. Barrack's stature in the region."He is the only person I know who the president speaks to as a peer," said Roger Stone, a veteran Republican operative who has known both men for decades. "Barrack is to Trump as Bebe Rebozo was to Nixon, which is the best friend," Mr. Stone added, referring to the wealthy real-estate developer who is best remembered for his closeness to President Richard Nixon during his impeachment process.Mr. Barrack's closeness to Mr. Trump extends to the president's family. By 2010, he had acquired $70 million of the debt owed by Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, on his troubled $1.8 billion purchase of a skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue in New York. After a call from Mr. Trump, Mr. Barrack was among a group of lenders who agreed to reduce Mr. Kushner's obligations to keep him out of bankruptcy.A month after his first outreach to Ambassador Otaiba, Mr. Barrack wrote again on May 26 to introduce Mr. Kushner, who was preparing for a role as a presidential envoy to the Middle East."You will love him and he agrees with our agenda!" Mr. Barrack promised in another email. A billionaire buddy Thomas J. Barrack Jr. and Donald J. Trump first met in the 1980s, and Mr. Barrack got the better of the encounters. He negotiated Mr. Trump into overpaying for two famous assets: a one-fifth stake in the New York department store chain Alexander's in 1985, and the entire Plaza Hotel in 1988. Mr. Trump paid about $410 million for the Plaza and later lost both properties to creditors.But Mr. Barrack nonetheless parlayed the deals into a lasting friendship, in part by flattering Mr. Trump about his skill as a negotiator."He played me like a Steinway piano," Mr. Barrack recounted in a speech at the Republican convention.At 71, Mr. Barrack is the same age as President Trump and shares his fondness for expensive trophies. He owns a 700-acre winery and polo ranch in the Santa Ynez Valley in California, sold a seven-bedroom mansion in Santa Monica last year for $38 million, and snapped up an Aspen ski resort for a reported $18 million just in time for the start of the season.Yet people who know him well say he still tells new acquaintances that he is truly honored to meet them, cheerfully doling out superlatives like "first-class," "amazing" and "brilliant." He invariably tells the story of his own success as a parable about luck and perseverance, never about talent.He grew up speaking Arabic as the son of Lebanese immigrants to Los Angeles; his mother worked as a secretary and his father ran a grocery store in Culver City. By 1972 he had earned a law degree from the University of Southern California and he interviewed for a job with Nixon's personal lawyer, Herbert Kalmbach. As Mr. Barrack tells the story, he returned moments later to drop off a book about football that they had discussed, and his gesture won him a job over candidates with more prestigious degrees.Dispatched to Saudi Arabia because of his Arabic skills, Mr. Barrack was enlisted as a squash partner for "a local Saudi," he often says, and the Saudi turned out to be a son of the king and his first big break in business.In the decades to come, Mr. Barrack cultivated relationships across the region, once befriending an elderly Bedouin on a bus who turned out to be an executive of Aramco, the Saudi oil giant. Mr. Barrack invited his new Bedouin friend to stay with him in Newport Beach, Calif., while seeking a medical treatment, and the favor landed Mr. Barrack an assignment to help Aramco buy 375 Blue Bird school buses, the biggest deal in his life at the time.His friends describe him as a concierge to the Persian Gulf royals, helping them buy American or European homes, looking after their children on visits to the West and vacationing with them at his home in the south of France. After his private equity firm bought a resort built by the Aga Khan on 35 miles of the Sardinian coast, Mr. Barrack, a Catholic, opened a halal restaurant to welcome Gulf royals who came by in their yachts.As a young lawyer, Mr. Barrack once negotiated drilling rights with Ambassador Otaiba's father, who was then the Emirati oil minister. The emails show that Ambassador Otaiba later worked with Mr. Barrack to help seal a 2009 deal in which his private equity firm sold the L'Ermitage Raffles hotel in Beverly Hills to a joint venture half owned by an Abu Dhabi investment fund for $41 million. Three years later, Ambassador Otaiba invested $1 million in a fund that Mr. Barrack had set up to buy homes on the cheap after the real estate crash, according to the emails.When Ambassador Otaiba worried about Mr. Trump's proposed Muslim ban — "even someone as nonjudgmental as I am, had a problem with that statement" — Mr. Barrack wrote back that Mr. Trump was "the king of hyperbole.""We can turn him to prudence," Mr. Barrack wrote in an email. "He needs a few really smart Arab minds to whom he can confer — u r at the top of that list!"A shift in policyMr. Barrack's efforts began to pay off. Mr. Kushner met Ambassador Otaiba in May 2016. Soon after, Mr. Barrack and Ambassador Otaiba began working to arrange a secret meeting between Mr. Manafort, who became Mr. Trump's campaign manager that June, and Deputy Crown Prince  of Saudi Arabia, the dominant adviser to his father, King Salman.Mr. Barrack had befriended Mr. Manafort in the 1970s, when they were both living in Beirut and working for Saudi interests. Early in 2016, when Mr. Trump faced the prospect of a contested nomination fight at the Republican convention, Mr. Barrack had recommended Mr. Manafort for the job of campaign manager. "The most experienced and lethal of managers" and "a killer," Mr. Barrack called him in a letter to Mr. Trump.Prince Mohammed was widely seen as an ambitious protégé of the Emirati rulers, and in an email to the Emirati ambassador, Mr. Barrack presented a Manafort meeting as a prelude to a meeting with Mr. Trump."I would like to align in Donald's mind the connection between the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia which we have already started with Jared," Mr. Barrack wrote to Ambassador Otaiba on June 21, 2016. "I think it is important that you be the center pin!!"Mr. Barrack had competition. The Saudi prince had tried to reach the Trump campaign through "a midlevel person" at the rival private equity giant Blackstone, Mr. Barrack wrote in a follow-up email. "Obviously I would like the meeting to be arranged by you and me rather than Blackstone," Mr. Barrack told the ambassador.Mr. Barrack also pitched Mr. Manafort on the value of the Emirati connection."Paul is totally programmed on the closeness and alignment of the U.A.E." and agreed to meet Prince Mohammed "because he is a friend of your boss and the U.A.E.," Mr. Barrack wrote.The emails show that the meeting was scheduled for June 24, and that Mr. Manafort sought to meet at the prince's hotel to avoid the news media. But a spokesman for Mr. Barrack said that Mr. Manafort had canceled at the last minute for scheduling reasons.Regardless, Mr. Barrack's advocacy apparently proved effective. The day after the meeting was scheduled, Mr. Barrack forwarded to the ambassador a message from Mr. Manafort with a "clarification" that modulated Mr. Trump's call for a Muslim ban.A few weeks later, on July 13, Mr. Barrack informed Ambassador Otaiba that the Trump team had also removed a proposed Republican platform provision inserted to "embarrass" Saudi Arabia. The provision had called for the release of redacted pages about the kingdom in a report on the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.When Mr. Trump won in November, Ambassador Otaiba was eager to pull Mr. Barrack even closer. "We have a lot of things that we will have to do together. Together being the operative word," he wrote in a note congratulating Mr. Barrack on Mr. Trump's upset victory."Let's do them together," Mr. Barrack responded.Later, Mr. Barrack attended a dinner party at Ambassador Otaiba's home with other Arab ambassadors and former American officials (the chef was from the world-renowned Inn at Little Washington). Mr. Barrack offered to make introductions in the new administration. "Tell me who is high on your hit list.""Thanks to you, I'm in consistent contact with Jared and that has been extremely helpful, for both sides I think," Ambassador Otaiba wrote Mr. Barrack.They celebrated again in May 2017, when Mr. Trump made his first foreign trip as president, to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia for an Arab summit meeting."It all started with you and JK and I so congratulations on a great beginning," Mr. Barrack wrote to Ambassador Otaiba, referring to Mr. Kushner by his initials. Things go sour — but not for Barrack Two weeks after the Riyadh meeting, Mr. Trump began to align himself firmly with the Saudis and Emiratis against their rivals around the region. When those two states imposed an embargo on their neighbor Qatar — home to a major United States air base — Mr. Trump broke with his own administration to throw his weight squarely behind the Saudis and Emiratis.He quickly congratulated Prince Mohammed when he assumed the title of crown prince — and commended him again when he summarily detained about 200 businessmen and rivals in a consolidation of his power. This spring, Mr. Trump handed the Saudis and Emiratis an even greater victory by pulling out of the nuclear deal with their nemesis, Iran. In turn, the Gulf monarchs have made only pro forma protests against Mr. Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.Yet many of the connections facilitated by Mr. Barrack have brought liabilities, too.The linkages between Mr. Trump and the Saudis and Emiratis have come under new scrutiny. A few months after Mr. Barrack arranged the initial introductions, George Nader, a Lebanese American businessman and a top adviser to the de facto ruler of the U.A.E., met with the candidate's son Donald Trump Jr. at the Trump headquarters in New York. In that Aug. 3, 2016, meeting, Mr. Nader reported that the rulers of both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates supported the Trump campaign and offered their assistance, according to people familiar with the discussion.Such help would have violated campaign laws, and Mr. Nader is now cooperating with the special prosecutor, who is examining that meeting as well as a string of others that followed, according to people familiar the matter.Mr. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to charges of financial fraud and lying to federal investigators in connection with his work for Russian-backed interests in Ukraine. Mr. Gates, whom Mr. Barrack hired to help run the inauguration and then as a Washington consultant, has pleaded guilty to making false statements to investigators and agreed to cooperate with the special prosecutor.Mr. Kushner has also given testimony to the special prosecutor.But Mr. Barrack's business is still going strong, in part as a result of his continuing relations with the Saudis and Emiratis. When his company was looking for partners in its $400 million purchase last year of a landmark Los Angeles office tower, One California Plaza, it sold a $70 million stake to an Israeli insurance company. Another $70 million stake went to a state investment company controlled by the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, according to a person familiar with the deal.What is more, Mr. Barrack may profit more directly than ordinary shareholders or executives from the investments he helps bring in, because in some cases, according to Colony NorthStar filings, he earns the extra fees known as carried interest on profits from funds he raised — as if he were a partner in a private equity firm rather than merely a chairman of a publicly traded company.Friends of Mr. Barrack argue that his long history of business in the Persian Gulf shows that the investments are unrelated to any White House connections.Yet one thing has shifted.Until recently, Mr. Barrack's most prominent Gulf customers were neither the Emiratis nor the Saudis — but their bitter rivals the Qataris, who bought the film studio Miramax and a Paris soccer team from him, among other marquee properties. During the campaign, Mr. Barrack reached out to the Qataris as well, helping set up a meeting between Mr. Trump and the emir of Qatar in Trump Tower in September 2016."Tom wanted Qatar to know he arranged it," said a person involved in meeting, "and he wanted Trump to know he arranged it."But Mr. Trump's stance on the dispute with Qatar appears to have cast a shadow over Mr. Barrack's business there: None of the Gulf investments that Mr. Barrack's company has brought in since Mr. Trump's nomination have come from Qatar."We still consider Tom a friend and partner," said a senior Qatari official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering the White House. "But with all the recent things that have happened we have suspicions about the level of his involvement in this crisis."

                Trump has stayed out of government shutdown talks. That might be helping
            </a>
            <p>
                As president, Donald Trump sees himself as a central character in every high-stakes negotiation his administration undertakes, including the deal to avoid a government shutdown.But people close to Trump have long known that his active participation in sensitive talks is more likely to endanger them than to advance them."The president tweets and talks aggressively about topics that he thinks are winning issues." But "some issues are better without a lot of heat," said a former Trump trade official.WASHINGTON --- On Wednesday morning, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said a spending bill to keep the government open through Feb. 8 had been finalized overnight and would be introduced in the Senate within hours. Democrats also signaled they were on board with the deal, which would fund the government for six weeks, but provide no additional money for President Donald Trump's border wall.The only person who had not yet weighed in on the deal was Trump himself. While congressional leaders were busy negotiating, the president was still sounding a defiant note. "One way or the other, we will win on the Wall!" he tweeted early Wednesday.As the window for reaching a deal grew narrower this week, members of Congress anxiously waited for guidance from the White House on what kind of deal the president would accept.But none came.Instead, there was a barrage of tweets from Trump about the border wall he has long promised to build, and hints from press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders that the administration might try to fund the wall by siphoning funds away from other government agencies.On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, the rough outlines of a short-term spending bill to keep the government open began to take shape on Tuesday evening. At the White House, Trump was attending two previously scheduled holiday receptions.If Trump signs this continuing resolution before departing for his private club in Florida on Friday, as lawmakers in both parties hope he will, it would avert a partial government shutdown that would have hurt Republicans politically.But it would also mark a stunning retreat from the president's negotiating position just a week ago, when he told Democratic congressional leaders in a contentious Oval Office meeting that he would be "proud to shut down the government for border security."There has arguably never been a time in Trump's life when he viewed himself as more of a central character in high-stakes negotiations than he does now, in his current role as president of the United States.But in reality, people close to Trump have long since realized that his active participation in sensitive negotiations is often more likely to endanger a good outcome than to advance it."The president tweets and talks aggressively about topics that he thinks are winning issues, and that can translate into a lot of pressure on negotiators at the working level, both the politicals and the career" bureaucrats, said a former Trump administration official who has participated in high-level trade talks led by the president. "Some issues are better without a lot of heat."Not everyone is as measured in their critiques."Trump is an anarchist. It was his approach in business, it is his approach as president," said Jack O'Donnell, a former president of the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in a June interview with The New York Times."It does not take good negotiating skills to cause chaos. Will this ever lead to concessions? Maybe, but concessions to what? Not anything that resembles a deal," O'Donnell added. "I just do not see him getting much done."That Trump could prove to be a net negative for sensitive negotiations is a tough pill to swallow for a president who ran as the world's greatest dealmaker. On the campaign trail, Trump pledged to strike "beautiful" deals with America's allies, and to extract painful concessions from his adversaries.But two years into his first term, many of the deals that Trump has directed the most attention toward have yet to materialize. There is no trade deal with China, no immigration deal with Congress, no nuclear deal with North Korea, and no deal to repeal and replace Obamacare.This is not to say that there have not been any big deals signed on Trump's watch. This fall, there was a major agreement reached to update NAFTA for the 21st century. The talks that led to this deal were overseen by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. But Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, also played a key role in resolving tensions that Trump had aggravated.There was also a deal reached last weekend to keep the Paris climate agreement alive. This time, the deal came together with the help of U.S. negotiators despite Trump's announcement last year that the U.S. would withdraw from the pact at the earliest date allowed under the rules, which is late 2020.This past summer, a long-term deal was reached between Congress and the White House to save the Overseas Private Investment Corp., which provides financing for American companies seeking to do business in the developing world. Trump's first ever presidential budget in 2017 called for OPIC's elimination.The OPIC deal followed two agreements negotiated with Congress at the beginning of the year which ended partial government shutdowns.Still, these successful agreements all seem to have at least one thing in common that differentiates them from deals that have collapsed: At their most critical moments, Trump was largely absent.In several cases, Trump had even loudly opposed the deals before his administration later quietly agreed to them.Despite appearances, a former Trump campaign aide, who declined to be named, cautioned against viewing these negotiations as staffers defying the president. What's really going on, he said, is that Trump is choosing what to focus on and what to ignore."He sees what he wants to see, and he doesn't focus on what he doesn't want to think about. So he knows what's going on, he's just looking in another direction," said the former aide.The White House did not immediately respond to the characterizations of Trump's negotiating style made by his former staffers.But with no viable options in sight except the CR to avert a government shutdown, the rest of this week is already showing signs of being another time when Trump chooses to ignore a deal that no longer interests him.But that may not necessarily be a bad thing. On the contrary, a little less heat might be just what this deal needs.

                Trump Foundation agrees to dissolve and donate its remaining funds to charity
            </a>
            <p>
                The Donald J. Trump Foundation has agreed to dissolve under judicial supervision and give away its remaining funds while an investigation by the New York attorney general's office into its operations moves ahead.Following the announcement, Trump lawyer Alan Futerfas tells NBC the foundation, and not the state, had initially sought the dissolution.Bankrolled by donations from Trump's friends and business associates, the foundation gave away money in Trump's name so that Trump could publicly claim credit even though he essentially was giving away other people's money.The Donald J. Trump Foundation has agreed to dissolve under judicial supervision and to give away its remaining funds while New York state conducts an investigation into whether the president's namesake charity misspent donations."Our petition detailed a shocking pattern of illegality involving the Trump Foundation — including unlawful coordination with the Trump presidential campaign, repeated and willful self-dealing, and much more," New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood said Tuesday. She said the foundation had functioned "as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests."Following the announcement, Trump lawyer Alan Futerfas told CNBC, "Contrary to the NYAG's misleading statement issued earlier today, the Foundation has been seeking to dissolve and distribute its remaining assets to worthwhile charitable causes since Donald J. Trump's victory in the 2016 Presidential election. Unfortunately, the NYAG sought to prevent dissolution for almost two years, thereby depriving those most in need of nearly $1.7 million."The White House referred questions about the foundation to the Trump Organization.Under the dissolution agreement, after the judge approves the deal, the Trump Foundation will have 30 days during which to give away the balance of its funds, $1.75 million, to charities.The list of charities set to receive funds from the foundation will need to be approved by the court and the attorney general's office.Underwood also said her office will continue to pursue its lawsuit against the charity, the president and his three eldest children "to ensure that the Trump Foundation and its directors are held accountable for their clear and repeated violations of state and federal law."The dissolution announced Tuesday marked the culmination of nearly two years of investigative reporting by national news organizations, led by The Washington Post's David Fahrenthold, into how the Trump Foundation operated.While the charity never represented more than a small portion of Trump's financial portfolio, it was emblematic of how the Trump family approached many of its financial arrangements. Bankrolled by donations from Trump's friends and business associates, the foundation gave away money in Trump's name so that Trump could publicly claim credit even though he essentially was giving away other people's money.To this day, the motives of many of the donors to the Trump foundation remain unknown, including those of pro-wrestling moguls Vince and Linda McMahon, who gave millions of dollars to the foundation. Linda McMahon currently serves in Trump's Cabinet as administrator of the Small Business Administration.Questions about where the foundation's money came from are dwarfed, however, by questions about where it went. IRS records show that Trump used the foundation's money to pay legal settlements for his for-profit company, to bolster his political career, and to grease the wheels within his business, political and social circles.The Post's David Fahrenthold writes:The largest donation in the foundation's history — a $264,231 gift to the Central Park Conservancy in 1989 — appeared to benefit Trump's business: It paid to restore a fountain outside Trump's Plaza Hotel. The smallest, a $7 foundation gift to the Boy Scouts that same year, appeared to benefit Trump's family. It matched the amount required to enroll a boy in the Scouts the year that his son Donald Trump Jr. was 11.Trump's three eldest children, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump, all served as directors of the foundation, although it was later revealed that they had never actually held a board meeting.
