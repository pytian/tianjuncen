                Boris Johnson heads to UN, urging world to see beyond Brexit
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson headed for the United Nations in New York on Sunday to argue that post-Brexit Britain will be a dynamic world power taking the lead on tackling climate change and an unstable Middle East. But he and his country face some big hurdles.He is struggling to strike a withdrawal agreement with a skeptical European Union, and a looming verdict from Britain's Supreme Court could derail his Brexit plans.Johnson is likely to be dogged by Brexit throughout his three-day trip to the General Assembly, the UN's annual gathering of world leaders.More than three years after Britain voted to leave the EU, the departure date has been postponed twice, and the UK Parliament has repeatedly rejected the only divorce deal offered. The country is facing a chaotic exit on Oct 31 unless Johnson's government can, against the odds, secure a new agreement.In search of a deal, Johnson is scheduled to hold talks at the UN with EU leaders, including European Council President Donald Tusk, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.But many leaders of the 28-nation bloc mistrust Johnson, a brash Brexit champion who played a big role in persuading British voters in 2016 to opt to leave the EU. And they say Britain has not come up with workable ways to maintain an open border between EU member Ireland and the UK's Northern Ireland — the key sticking point in the dispute.A senior British government spokesman said talks with the EU so far have been positive, but "there is an awful lot of work still to do"."What is obviously encouraging is that all sides do want to try and achieve a deal," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the government's thinking.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said a no-deal Brexit "would have catastrophic consequences," including customs posts and other barriers between Ireland and Northern Ireland. But he said it would be Britain's fault."We did not invent the Brexit," Juncker told Sky News in an interview broadcast Sunday. "We were never pleading in favor of any kind of Brexit. That's a British decision, and so it has to be dealt with in that way."Johnson also has a meeting scheduled with President Donald Trump, who has called the British leader "a really good man" and claimed that some refer to Johnson as "Britain Trump".AP

                Xi extends greetings on farmers' harvest festival
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - Chinese President Xi Jinping extended greetings to farmers and people working in agriculture and rural areas as Monday marked the second Chinese farmers' harvest festival.Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, sent his greetings via the China Central Television's newly-launched channel dedicated to agriculture and rural affairs."With a solid foundation laid by agriculture, we have full confidence in development," Xi said.The achievements that China has made in the fields related to agriculture, rural areas and farmers are not only the outcomes of concerted efforts of the whole CPC and the country but also the results of hard work of all farmers and people working in agriculture and rural areas, he said.Xi also congratulated on the launch of the new channel, expecting the channel to publicize agricultural policies, plans as well as new looks of farmers and rural areas in-depth.Xi also expected the channel to lead the audience to pay attention to agriculture, care for the countryside and farmers, and contribute to poverty alleviation, reform and development in agriculture and the countryside, and the realization of rural revitalization.The Chinese farmers' harvest festival is the first national festival created specifically for the country's farmers. Starting in 2018, the festival coincides with the Autumnal Equinox each year, which is one of the 24 solar terms of the Chinese lunisolar calendar and usually falls between Sept. 22 and 24 during the country's agricultural harvest season.The new channel is the first national all-media channel dedicated to agriculture and rural affairs. With daily 18-hour programs, the channel officially began broadcasting on Monday.

                Chinese customers more savvy when buying vehicles
            </a>
            <p>
                The competition for car sales in China is heating up with more than one in four potential buyers disqualifying a brand before even visiting its dealers, according to a survey by JD Power released last week.Customers who remove a brand from their wish list without visiting its dealerships has increased to 26 percent from 10 percent in 2017, according to the China Sales Satisfaction Index Study.The results are based on a survey of 23,197 customers who bought cars from July 2018 to May 2019 across 75 Chinese cities.The study, now in its 20th year, measures satisfaction with the sales experience among new vehicle buyers and "rejecters", who are defined as those who visit a dealership but purchase elsewhere.Both groups are surveyed on six aspects: online experience, salespeople, dealer facilities, deals, paperwork and deliveries.According to the study, for potential customers who do not have a clear idea of what vehicle to purchase, their decisions are easily swayed by their impressions, prices and others' opinions, all of which are available online."Consumers' purchase decision is formed in the very beginning of their purchase behavior," said Eileen Ren, vice-president of digital customer experience at JD Power China.She said offering customers opportunities, such as test drives, in their initial decision-making phase can help enhance their understanding and experience of the vehicle, improve their impression of the brand, and reduce the possibility of losing customers to other brands as a result of prices or negative comments.The study found that inefficient pre-visit communication is another reason for customer loss, including the salesperson not understanding the potential buyers' needs, making them feel uncomfortable, or not offering transparent prices."Improving the response speed and shopper experience in pre-visit communications could not only help avoid customer loss, but also offer a good opportunity to identify customer demands and then ease the pressure of in-store sales service, improving sales," said Ren.The study found that premium brands including Audi and Porsche perform better than volume brands. On a 1,000-point scale, premium brands scored 701, while volume brands stood at 672.Another finding is that customers are more satisfied with information provided on carmakers' own websites, especially in terms of vehicle information.The satisfaction index of customers who buy vehicles through third-party platforms is 23 points higher than for those who purchase vehicles at dealerships, according to the study.

                Legal profession should make better use of technology
            </a>
            <p>
                China's law professionals should make better use of technologies, including artificial intelligence and big data, to modernize the justice system, according to industry insiders.Zhou Youyong, vice-president of Southeast University, said more efforts are needed to integrate forefront technology into the law system to promote justice and transparency in the country."Applying new techs in promoting justice is no doubt a critical way to facilitate litigation. It is also an important method to make the law really serve people," Zhou said.Big data has already played a role in the judiciary process in some provinces in intelligent judgment, said Li Yusheng, vice-president of the Jiangsu High People's Court.The local case management system, for instance, can offer judges a well-rounded judicial process and standards throughout the history of a case, he added.Zhou and Li made their remarks during a symposium on big data and the law held by Chinese artificial intelligence company iFlytek and the School of Law at Southeast University."As a leading AI company, iFlytek will continue to beef up its presence in the law system. We will combine some real needs from the justice process with our technologies to make innovations," said Zhao Zhiwei, co-founder and senior vice president of iFlytek.For the time being, though AI cannot fully understand legal instruments, it is already qualified for some routine procedures, according to Wang Lusheng, deputy dean of the School of Law at Southeast University."One of our practices is to form a large data base, in which several hundreds of judges summed up their risks points during their judiciary process. It can recognize easily some systematic mistakes during a trial," Wang said.

                China to host Int'l Dairy Federation meetings by 2023
            </a>
            <p>
                ISTANBUL, Sept. 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Dairy Federation (IDF) on Sunday accepted a Chinese executive into its board of directors and agreed on China hosting federation conferences in the next four years.Lu Minfang, the global chief executive officer of China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited, is the first Chinese to join the IDF board of directors since its inception in 1903.Speaking to Xinhua, he said as the Chinese and global dairy industries are highly integrated now, he would like to take advantage of his new status to promote better integration of their structural changes so as to "more efficiently reset the supply chain, utilize the technologies and promote global trade, in particular multilateral trade."At the IDF general assembly in Istanbul, the federation also signed an agreement with China Dairy Industry Association for its annual summit and other meetings to be held in China by 2023.IDF President Judith Bryans has seen "huge striving and advancement" in the Chinese dairy industry since she visited China 10 years ago."Since then I have seen huge innovation in terms of product development and sustainability and technology," she told Xinhua."We are absolutely delighted to welcome Lu into the IDF board of directors. The connection between IDF and IDF China is extremely important. I was delighted to have China's voice much stronger, which has developed over the years much stronger now within the IDF," she added.The Chinese dairy sector should work toward technological innovation and international cooperation while maintaining products quality, Liu Meiju, vice chairwoman and secretary general of China Dairy Industry Association and vice chairwoman of IDF National Committee of China, told Xinhua.The Brussels-based IDF, the only organization representing the entire dairy value chain at a global level, is scheduled to open its four-day 2019 World Dairy Summit in Istanbul on Monday.
