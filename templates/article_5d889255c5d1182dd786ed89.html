                Legions of volunteers lend a hand at Beijing expo
            </p>
            <p>
                Around 4,000 university students have provided or will provide professional services to visitors on a volunteer basis at the ongoing International Horticultural Exhibition in Beijing’s Yanqing district during their summer break, Beijing Youth Daily reported.These students from Beijing and Zhangjiakou, North China’s Hebei province, do their work in groups at the Beijing expo, where temperatures can easily exceed 30 C during the summer.Volunteers have little time to spend under the umbrellas, and keep busy giving directions to visitors under the sun. When it rains, they line up on both sides of the road to lead tourists to the nearest cover.Zhao Yihan worked as a hostess. She and her partner held a 10-hour post split into two shifts every day. Standing in the scorching sun, volunteers need to make sure their posture and manner of speaking present the image of volunteers in the best possible way."The happiest moment for me every day is to give answers to tourists' questions." Zhao said. It makes her feel her hard work is worth it, she added.For indoor volunteers who work in pavilions, walking 30,000 steps a day is not unheard of. Many have become excellent "tour guides" — they always give visitors recommendations on the best activities and places to go.Xu Bizeng, a college student from the Beijing Institute of Technology who works at the Uganda Pavilion, has established himself as an outstanding interpreter. After several days of practice, he is able to tell the background stories of each traditional Ugandan handicraft accurately and skillfully.

                Uganda looks to China for tourism and investment boost
            </a>
            <p>
                Uganda recently held an event to promote tourism and investment opportunities at the ongoing International Horticultural Exhibition in Yanqing district, Beijing.Attendees enjoyed traditional dancing by Ugandan performers and visited stalls selling coffee, nuts and tourism souvenirs produced by the country.Official data shows that China's outbound tourist visits last year reached around 150 million, making it the world's biggest market for outbound travelers and a priority for many overseas destinations looking to attract tourists.The United Kingdom's former prime minister Winston Churchill once called Uganda "The Pearl of Africa" in response to its unique landscape and natural beauty.Uganda is home to lakes, mountains, valleys and a great diversity of wildlife. The source of the 6,650-kilometer-long Nile River, the longest waterway in Africa with a basin spread across 11 countries, is Lake Victoria in Uganda.Tourists to the African nation can indulge in local cultural events, embrace nature, and go on safari to observe elephants, chimpanzees and numerous bird species in the wild.There are also organized treks into the ominously-named Bwindi Impenetrable National Park to get up close and personal with the majestic mountain gorillas in one of the few remaining natural habitats of the critically endangered primate.Uganda offers accommodation to satisfy the requirements of all kinds of tourist, from luxury hotels and campsites to homestays, and it welcomes more than 1.3 million global tourists every year.Meanwhile, the country is striving to attract Chinese investors with preferential policies in the fields of agriculture, infrastructure, tourism, minerals, energy and health.

                Saudi Arabia prepares for hajj as Gulf tensions simmer
            </a>
            <p>
                MECCA, Saudi Arabia - More than 2.5 million Muslims on Friday will begin the hajj pilgrimage to the Islamic holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, against a backdrop of tensions in the Gulf.Crowds of worshippers have already begun to gather in Mecca in the days ahead of the hajj, the annual focal point of the Islamic calendar."It's the first time I've felt something so strongly - It's striking," said 40-year-old Indonesian pilgrim Sobar in rudimentary Arabic.More than 1.8 million visitors had arrived by midday local time on Tuesday, authorities said.The faithful from across the world wore flowing white robes as they descended on the holy city located in the west of Saudi Arabia.The pilgrims will undertake religious rites that have remained unchanged since the founding of Islam 14 centuries ago."Islam united us. We are all together, ... so that's why I'm very happy," said Leku Abibu, 46, a Ugandan mechanic who wore a beige salwar kameez, an outfit of loosefitting pants and tunic."I'm enjoying it here."This year's hajj takes place amid strains in the Gulf region exacerbated by a series of attacks on oil tankers, drone strikes and interceptions of maritime traffic on the high seas.Saudi, the Gulf's leading power, and its ally Washington accuse Iran of being behind the attacks and sabotage operations against commercial shipping. Teheran has repeatedly denied those accusations.Despite the tensions in the region, around 88,550 Iranian pilgrims are due to take part in the hajj this year, according to Iran's Tasnim News Agency.The hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and Muslims must perform it at least once in their lives if they can afford to."There are all nations of the world, all languages. There are no differences between us," said Nurul Jamal, a 61-year-old pilgrim from India.While waiting for the beginning of the hajj, worshippers roam the esplanade or pray in the mosque in stifling heat.Temperatures can surpass 40 C and some pilgrims carry sun shades.Large misting machines installed at the holy sites help to make the heat more bearable.Guards in khaki fastidiously lead worshippers to their five daily prayers.Traffic in the city is extremely heavy and the air quality is poor.The odor of exhaust fumes mixes with the smell of bitumen emitted by the heated road surface. Many pilgrims wear face masks.Away from prayers, many of the faithful visit the innumerable shops that speckle the holy city. Even though the hajj lasts only five days, many pilgrims arrive weeks before and linger in the city.Religious tourism brings in revenues worth billions of dollars.But the vast gathering also presents major logistical and safety challenges.In 2015, about 2,300 worshippers were killed in the worst stampede in the history of the hajj.Since then, Saudi Arabia has sought to reassure pilgrims, deploying tens of thousands of security officers and installing cameras to oversee every corner of the holy sites.The total number of arrivals is limited, however, as each Muslim country receives a pilgrim quota.Some worshippers have spent years on waiting lists - sometimes as long as a decade - just to perform their religious duty.Agence France-Presse
