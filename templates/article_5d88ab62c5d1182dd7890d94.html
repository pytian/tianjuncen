                OAKLAND, Calif. - Kawhi Leonard and the Toronto Raptors captured Canada's first NBA championship with their most remarkable road win yet in the franchise's NBA Finals debut, outlasting the battered and depleted two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors 114-110 on Thursday night in a Game 6 for the ages that spoiled a sensational send-off at Oracle Arena.Stephen Curry missed a contested 3-pointer in the waning moments before Golden State called a timeout it didn't have, giving Leonard a technical free throw with 0.9 seconds left to seal it. Leonard then got behind Andre Iguodala for a layup as the buzzer sounded, but it went to review and the basket was called off before Leonard's two free throws. That only delayed the celebration for a moment.Curry walked away slowly, hands on his head on a night Splash Brother Klay Thompson suffered a left knee injury and departed with 30 points.Leonard scored 22 and Kyle Lowry had 26 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds.

                    Gary Woodland wins US Open at Pebble Beach
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. - Gary Woodland denied Brooks Koepka's bold bid at history with two clutch shots and made US Open memories of his own, starting with that silver trophy in his hands at Pebble Beach.Woodland finished in style Sunday. He holed a 30-foot birdie putt for a 2-under 69, giving him the lowest 72-hole score in six US Opens at Pebble Beach and a three-shot victory over Koepka, who was going for a third straight US Open.Koepka had to settle for a footnote in history as the first player with all four rounds in the 60s at the US Open without winning. But he made Woodland earn every bit of his first major championship.Clinging to a one-shot lead with more pressure than he has ever felt, Woodland seized control by going for the green on the par-5 14th hole with a 3-wood from 263 yards, narrowly clearing a cavernous bunker and setting up a simple up-and-down for a two-shot lead.Even more significant was a shot from 90 feet.Woodland hit the edge of the green on the par-3 17th all the way to the right, with the pin on the hourglass green on the other side.Ahead on the 18th, Koepka's 3-iron went just over the back of the green, leaving him a chip for eagle to tie, with a birdie likely to do the trick considering what Woodland faced. Koepka chipped to just inside 10 feet and missed the putt.Woodland delivered again. Unable to use putter to get it close, he perfectly clipped a pitch over the mound, and it checked about 12 feet short of the hole and trickled down to tap-in range.That effectively ended the US Open. Woodland played conservatively down the 18th and made one last birdie that only mattered in the record book. He finished at 13-under 271, one shot better than Tiger Woods' historic rout in 2000.The difference was Woods won by 15 shots and was the only player under par. With a marine layer blocking the sunshine, and no significant wind at Pebble Beach all week, 31 players finished under par.Koepka closed with a 68 for his second runner-up in the majors this year, along with his second straight PGA Championship title.Justin Rose was the only one who caught Woodland, with a birdie on the opening hole. Rose bogeyed from the bunker on No 2, and fell out of the race with three bogeys in a four-hole stretch on the back nine. He shot 74 and shared third with Xander Schauffele (67), Jon Rahm (68) and Chez Reavie (71).AP

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                SANTA MONICA, Calif — The Milwaukee Bucks fell two games short of the NBA Finals.They won big at the NBA Awards.A tearful Giannis Antetokounmpo earned Most Valuable Player honors, Mike Budenholzer won Coach of the Year, and Jon Horst took Executive of the Year on Monday night in Santa Monica.Antetokounmpo, a 24-year-old forward from Greece, beat out Paul George of Oklahoma City and James Harden of Houston, who won last year.Antetokounmpo was a resounding winner. He received 941 points and 78 first-place votes in the balloting — 165 points more than Harden.Harden finished second with 776 points and 23 first-place votes."MVP is not about stats and numbers, and obviously James Harden had unbelievable numbers and Paul George also, but obviously it's about winning," Antetokounmpo said backstage. "We created great habits throughout the season and were able to stick by them, and that's why we were able to have a chance in every single game we played and were able to win 60 games."The show had an international flair, with three international players besides Antetokounmpo winning.Antetokounmpo averaged 27.7 points and 12.5 rebounds while earning All-NBA first-team honors this season, his sixth with the Bucks. He led the franchise to the best record in the regular season and the Bucks reached the Eastern Conference finals.Tears rolled down his cheeks as Antetokounmpo thanked his mother Veronica and brothers in the audience at Barker Hanger. He credited his late father for pushing him toward his goals and his teammates and coaching staff for their help.

                    Strong aftershock jolts same California desert region day after major quake
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                RIDGECREST, Calif. - A strong aftershock shook Southern California early on Friday as residents were still assessing the damage from the strongest earthquake in the region in 25 years on July 4, which was felt by more than 20 million people.The 5.4 magnitude aftershock, the biggest so far, struck the same desert region as Thursday's earthquake. Its epicenter was about 11 miles (18 km) west of Searles Valley at 4:07 a.m., the US Geological Survey said.The aftershock was felt in Los Angeles, about 150 miles (240 km) to the south, and the surrounding area, with many residents posting on Twitter that they were awakened by it.By midday local time on Friday, the USGS had registered more than 200 smaller aftershocks following Thursday's 6.4 magnitude quake near the city of Ridgecrest, which was felt from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. Seismologists said they were expecting more in the next few days.California's new ShakeAlert system detected Thursday's quake, but did not alert residents who had subscribed to the cell phone app because the shaking in Los Angeles County was below the threshold for a warning.That did not stop some residents from complaining that they should have been warned anyway."We hear you and will lower the alert threshold," the city of Los Angeles said in a message on Twitter on Thursday, adding that it would make that change in conjunction with the USGS, which developed the alert system.

            <p class="style-content">
                RIDGECREST, Calif. — Officials in Southern California expressed relief Saturday that damage and injuries weren't worse after the largest earthquake the region has seen in nearly 20 years, while voicing concerns about the possibility of major aftershocks in the days and even months to come.No fatalities or major injuries were reported after Friday night's 7.1-magnitude earthquake, which jolted an area from Sacramento to Mexico and prompted the evacuation of the Navy's largest single landholding, Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in the Mojave Desert.The quake struck at 8:19 pm Friday and was centered 11 miles (18 kilometers) from Ridgecrest, the same area of the desert where a 6.4-magnitude temblor hit just a day earlier. It left behind cracked and burning buildings, broken roads, obstructed railroad tracks and leaking water and gas lines.The light damage was largely due to the remoteness of the area where the tremble occurred. Only 28,000 people live in the Ridgecrest area, which is sandwiched between more populated areas of Southern California and Las Vegas' Clark County. But seismologists warned that the area could see up to 30,000 aftershocks over the next six months.April Hamlin said she was "already on edge" when the second quake rattled her Ridgecrest home. She and her three kids initially thought it was another aftershock."But it just kept on intensifying," she said. "The TV went over, hanging by the cord. We heard it break. We heard glass breakage in the other rooms, but all we could do was stay where we were until it stopped."

                    HBO chief: Sorry, fans, no Game of Thrones do-over
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — The clamor from Game of Thrones fans for a do-over of the drama's final season has been in vain.HBO programming chief Casey Bloys said Wednesday there was no serious consideration to remaking the story that some viewers and critics called disappointing.There are few downsides to having a hugely popular show like Game of Thrones, Bloys said, but one is that fans have strong opinions on what would be a satisfying conclusion.Bloys said during a TV critics' meeting that it comes with the territory, adding that he appreciates fans' passion for the saga based on George R.R. Martin's novels.Emmy voters proved unswayed by petitioners demanding a remake: They gave Game of Thrones a record-breaking 32 nominations earlier this month. The series also hit record highs for HBO.HBO will want to keep the fan fervor alive for the prequel to Game of Thrones that's in the works. The first episode completed taping in Ireland and looks "really good," Bloys said. The new series stars Naomi Watts and is set thousands of years before the original.Asked whether negative reaction to the Game of Thrones conclusion will shape the prequel, Bloys replied, "Not at all."AP

                    Official names shooter who killed 3 at California festival
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                GILROY, Calif. — A shooter cut through a fence and opened fire on a crowd eating and listening to music at a popular food festival in California, killing three people, including a 6-year-old boy, and wounding about 15 others before police quickly shot him dead, authorities said.A law enforcement official said the gunman was identified as Santino William Legan and believed he was 19. The official wasn't authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Monday.Police searched the Legan family's two-story Gilroy home and a dusty car parked outside before leaving the house Monday with paper bags and what appeared to be other evidence.The shooter appeared to randomly target people when fired with a rifle Sunday afternoon, the end of the three-day Gilroy Garlic Festival that attracts more than 100,000 people to the city known as the "Garlic Capital of the World," Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee said.The shooter sneaked in through a fence that borders a parking lot next to a creek. Police responded within a minute and killed the suspect, Smithee said.Some witnesses reported a second suspect, Smithee said, but it was unclear whether that person was armed or just helped in some way. A manhunt continued Monday.Six-year-old Stephen Romero was among those killed, his father said."My son had his whole life to live and he was only 6," Alberto Romero told San Francisco Bay Area news station KNTV. "That's all I can say."The boy's grandmother, Maribel Romero, told Los Angeles station KABC-TV that she searched several hospitals before learning he had died. She said he was "always kind, happy and, you know, playful."The wounded were taken to multiple hospitals, and their conditions ranged from fair to critical, with some undergoing surgery. At least five were treated and released.The Gilroy Garlic Festival features food, cooking contests and music. It's a decades-old staple in the agricultural city of 50,000 about 80 miles (176 kilometers) southeast of San Francisco. Festivalgoers pass through metal detectors and their bags are searched at the event.The band TinMan was starting an encore Sunday when the shooting started. Singer Jack van Breen said he saw a man wearing a green shirt and grayish handkerchief around his neck fire into the food area with what looked like an assault rifle. He and other members of the band dove under the stage.Van Breen, from nearby Santa Clara, said he heard someone shout: "Why are you doing this?" The reply: "Because I'm really angry."The audience began screaming and running, and the five members of the band and others dove under the stage.Bandmate Vlad Malinovsky said he heard a lot of shots and then it stopped. Later, law enforcement told those hiding to come out with their hands up.Taylor Jackson was working at a booth drawing caricatures when she heard gunfire, saw people running and "ran for the hills." She said her boss ran in the opposite direction. Several hours later, Jackson was at a reunification center trying to get information on her whereabouts.Donna Carlson of Reno, Nevada, was helping a friend at a jewelry booth when "all of a sudden it was pop, pop, pop. And I said, 'I sure hope that's fireworks.'" She got on her hands and knees and hid behind a table until police told her it was safe to leave.President Donald Trump condemned the "wicked murderer.""We express our deepest sadness and sorrow for the families who lost a precious loved one in the horrific shooting last night in Gilroy, California," Trump said before an event at the White House.In a tweet, California Gov. Gavin Newsom called the bloodshed "nothing short of horrific" and said he was grateful for the police response.Video posted to social media showed people running in terror as shots rang out.Evenny Reyes of Gilroy, 13, told the Mercury News in San Jose that she spent the day at the festival with her friends and relatives."We were just leaving and we saw a guy with a bandanna wrapped around his leg because he got shot. And there were people on the ground, crying," Reyes said. "There was a little kid hurt on the ground. People were throwing tables and cutting fences to get out."Reyes said that she didn't run at first because the gunshots sounded like fireworks."It started going for five minutes, maybe three. It was like the movies — everyone was crying, people were screaming," she said.AP

                    25 bodies found after California boat fire
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                SANTA BARBARA, Calif — A middle-of-the-night fire swept a boat carrying recreational scuba divers anchored near an island off the Southern California coast early Monday, leaving at least 25 dead and nine others missing.Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr Matthew Kroll said Monday night that 25 people had died. Five of six crew members on the Conception escaped by jumping into an inflatable boat they steered to a nearby vessel.Rescuers initially recovered four bodies about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles just off Santa Cruz Island, and 16 others were pulled from the water later in the day. The Coast Guard says five others have been found but not recovered due to unsafe conditions under the boat, which sank about 20 yards (18 meters) from shore.Authorities will search for the nine people still unaccounted for through the night."We should all be prepared to move into the worst outcome," Coast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester said at a news conference.The four bodies recovered initially had injuries consistent with drowning, Kroll said.It wasn't immediately clear when the bodies on the ocean floor might be retrieved or when divers could search the boat for others.AP

                    Search called off in deadly Calif. dive-boat fire

                Authorities in California suspended search efforts Tuesday as it became increasingly clear that there were no additional survivors on a commercial dive boat that erupted in flames Monday.The 75-foot commercial diving vessel, named Conception, was on a three-day scuba diving excursion to the Channel Islands when it caught fire and sank near Santa Cruz Island. It had 39 people on board — six crew members and 33 passengers."Sadly, no additional survivors have been found, and an additional 16 victims were located in yesterday afternoon's efforts and were brought back to our coroner's bureau," Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said at a news conference Tuesday morning."This made in total 20 victims who have been recovered and transported to our coroner's bureau. Thus far, the victims have only been identified as 11 females and nine males' remains," the sheriff added.There were four to six other victims who were still inside the sunken wreckage. The divers have spotted them, but the positioning of the boat made it difficult to recover their bodies before nightfall, Brown said.Fourteen people remain unaccounted for.The Chinese Consulate General in Los Angeles told the media that there was no report of Chinese citizens on the boat.Coast Guard Sector Los Angeles-Long Beach watch standers received a mayday call around 3:30 am Monday about a commercial diving vessel engulfed in flames. The vessel sank in 64 feet of water at around 7:20 am, 20 yards offshore.Five crew members, who were on the top deck, jumped off the boat and were rescued by a good Samaritan pleasure craft, but the 33 passengers and one crew member sleeping below deck when the fire broke out were presumed dead.Coast Guard Captain Monica Rochester said the Coast Guard suspended search efforts at 9:40 am Tuesday, pending further developments."It is never an easy decision to suspend search efforts. We know that this is a very difficult time for families and friends of the victims," she said.The search effort was halted because no additional individuals had been witnessed entering the water, and there was also no additional sign of distress or debris, Rochester said.Rochester said the vessel is required to undergo an inspection by the US Coast Guard annually, and it has been in compliance with all federal regulations.The investigation is still ongoing.The call center has received more than 100 phone calls from families and friends who believe their loved ones were on board Conception, Brown said, adding that only four families of the 34 passengers have not been connected with the investigators.Authorities have not conducted autopsies at this point, but the bodies have been visually examined, Brown said.Most of those on board were from the Santa Cruz and San Jose areas.
