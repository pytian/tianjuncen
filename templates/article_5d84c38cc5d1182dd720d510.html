                US Fed cuts interest rates for second time this year in divided vote
            </p>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON -- US Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered interest rates by 25 basis points amid growing risks and uncertainties stemming from trade tensions and a global economic slowdown, following a rate cut in July that was its first in more than a decade.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed's rate-setting body, trimmed the target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent after concluding its two-day policy meeting, largely in line with market expectation.Despite strong labor market and robust growth in household spending, "business fixed investment and exports have weakened," the FOMC said in a statement."On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent," the central bank's inflation objective, the FOMC said.Noting that trade policy is weighing on the growth outlook, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a press conference Wednesday afternoon that monetary policy can counteract weakness to some extent, but "there's a piece of this that we really can't address.""We need to look through what's a pretty volatile situation," said Powell. "That means, not overreacting quickly, it means not underreacting too. That's what we're trying to do."Three of the 10 members of the committee voted against the quarter-point rate cut decision, highlighting growing split among monetary policymakers. As in July, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren, and Kansas City Fed President Esther George "preferred" to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at the previous level. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, meanwhile, demanded a larger cut, by 50 basis points.When asked about how he viewed the divided opinions, Powell said at the press conference that this is difficult judgement, and such division is "nothing but healthy."US President Donald Trump again lashed out at the central bank shortly after the rate cut announcement, saying in a tweet that "Jay (Jerome) Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No 'guts,' no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!" The president had repeatedly demanded a larger cut.In response to a question regarding Trump's comment, Powell reaffirmed the central bank's independence. "I assure you that my colleagues and I will continue to conduct monetary policy without regard to political considerations. We're going to use our best judgment based on facts, evidence and objective analysis in pursuing our goals," he said.Seven out of the 17 Fed officials expect one more rate cut this year, and the central bank's median forecasts for rates suggested no more cut this year, according to the latest FOMC participants' assessments of appropriate monetary policy, which was also released on Wednesday."Our eyes are open, we're watching the situation," Powell said, without specifying the Fed's next move. "I'd love to be able to articulate a simple, straightforward, stopping rule, but it'll be when we think we've done enough."

                Trump wants Fed to cut interest rates to zero
            </a>
            <p>
                US President Trump called for "boneheads" at the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to "ZERO or less", an unprecedented move that analysts said would disrupt markets and leave the nation's central bank with no means to counter a future economic downturn."We should then start to refinance our debt," Trump tweeted Wednesday. "INTEREST COST COULD BE BROUGHT WAY DOWN, while at the same time substantially lengthening the term…The USA should always be paying the lowest rate. No Inflation! It is only the naivete of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn't allow us to do what other countries are already doing. A once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of 'Boneheads.'"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cut interest rates by a quarter-point in July — the first time the central bank had lowered rates since 2008 — and many analysts believe officials will cut another quarter-point at the Fed's Sept 17-18 meeting. The current benchmark rate is 2-2.25 percent."Fed Chairman Powell is trying to give the president what he wants," Kamal Khan, chief US editor of Investing.com in New York, told China Daily. "But Trump keeps upping the ante. There's no way the Fed is going to negative rates unless Trump manages to replace every FOMC member with loyalists."He's searching for an economic win given China negotiations aren't going anywhere. It would seem more cuts would boost the stock market, but Wall Street has also put a lot of belief in an independent Fed. Without a trade agreement, it's likely growth will continue to contract into next year," Khan said.Trump's comments mark a ratcheting up in his criticism of the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Jerome Powell, named to the post by the president in 2017.The Fed is an independent agency charged with keeping the economy strong and inflation low. Its actions are not subject to presidential approval. Some fear Trump's comments may undercut the Fed's independence.Previously, Trump called for as much as a full-point cut to boost the economy, but has never previously said interest rates should be slashed to zero or below.The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have negative interest rates to increase demand for loans and boost sluggish economies. Negative interest rates encourage people to spend, but punish savers for their thrift. As a result, many overseas investors seek returns in US bonds, driving prices up and yields down.In the past, the Federal Reserve has kept rates between 2 percent and 5 percent to maintain a strong economy. In this range, the US gross domestic product generally grows 2-3 percent a year while employment is strong and inflation is low.In the current economy, unemployment is close to record lows, consumer confidence remains strong and inflation is low, but growth is slowing as the world economy stagnates, and the stock market reflects the jitters created by the US-China trade dispute.US debt now totals $22.5 trillion, including $16.7 trillion held by investors. There is no precedent for the US to refinance its debt."It's not viable and could be a significant problem for investors, financial markets and ultimately the economy, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics in New York, told CNBC. "The debt is not pre-payable. There's a contractual relationship the Treasury has with investors. This isn't a mortgage, this is US Treasury debt. I think it would be incredibly disruptive to financial markets, and interest rates would ultimately rise, not fall. If (interest rates) go down to zero and we actually experienced a recession, then what?"In December 2008, as the economy sank, the Fed cut rates to 0.25 percent, the 10th cut is just over a year, and didn't begin raising rates until December 2015. Prior to 2008, the lowest fed funds rate was 1 percent in 2003, to combat the recession that began in 2001.

                Synthetic meat fills mooncake gap
            </a>
            <p>
                Customers fed up with the traditional ingredients of mooncakes, such as mixed nuts and bean paste, now have a new choice - synthetic meat. It is a Chinese tradition to eat mooncakes over Mid-Autumn Festival. A week before the festival, mooncakes stuffed with mock meat made from plant protein went on sale on e-commerce platform Taobao. In less than three days, over half of the limited 3,000 boxes had been sold. The mooncakes came in a box of six, with each weighing 60 grams and having the Chinese character "zhen", or "precious", printed on top, and giving off a special fragrance after being baked.

                World awaits next economic move by China
            </a>
            <p>
                Beijing policymakers expected to follow suit as other global leaders opt for cycle of easing Whether or not China will enact further accommodative monetary policies to maintain growth momentum is a question that has drawn the market's attention, as other major economies have stepped back into a policy-easing cycle in response to negative factors clouding the global outlook. Choosing policies that support growth has become the priority for global leaders, and Chinese policymakers are expected to follow suit in their own way, providing assurances that the economy is on firm footing while striking a macroeconomic balance for long-term stability, analysts said. The aim of supportive policies in China is to prevent a slowdown in growth, rather than boosting growth to a strong level, according to the latest research from Goldman Sachs, which added that policymakers are "highly flexible" in reacting to global conditions. Its research was released before the economic data for August, which will be posted on Monday. Economists had predicted a rebound of growth in August from July's moderate performance. They foresaw strengthened industrial output growth, stabilized fixed-asset investment and accelerated retail sales, as some earlier supportive measures had begun to take effect. "China's macroeconomic policy tools are adequate," Sheng Songcheng, former head of the statistics and analysis department at the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, told China Daily on Sunday. "Proactive fiscal policy will play a major role, while prudent monetary policy will be used to coordinate the fiscal policy." After the market-oriented reform of the loan prime rate mechanism, or LPR, the central bank has more tools to guide the real lending rate, including adjusting the medium-term lending facility interest rate, which is still at a relatively high level. The monetary easing measures by other major central banks have provided more room for China's monetary policy adjustments, Sheng said. "However, the adjustments of interest rates should also take into account both internal and external balances, such as the impacts on domestic asset prices," he said. The European Central Bank launched an aggressive stimulus package on Thursday - the first cut of its deposit rate in more than three years to a record low of - 0.5 percent, from - 0.4 percent, plus a restart of a bond-buying plan, or quantitative easing program. The bank said the moves were a response to the slower global growth and the continued shortfall of inflation domestically. This stimulus provoked criticism by investors, who worry it could trigger more market volatility. All eyes will be on the United States and the Federal Reserve's policymaking meeting on Wednesday. There is broad consensus among economists that the Fed may announce another rate cut. For China, one of the most important challenges ahead is the trade dispute with the United States. Rising risk aversion globally and a reshuffling of supply chains may also affect foreign investment in China, said Alicia Garcia Herrero, Asia-Pacific chief economist for Paris-based Natixis Bank. "China's growth model, despite foreseeable headwinds, has been evolving constantly, including further opening up in attracting international capital and deepening financial market reforms," she said. "We expect China to adapt to current challenges and stabilize growth with corresponding policy supports." Stephen Schwartz, senior director of sovereign ratings at Fitch (Hong Kong), said, "In the face of the external headwinds, we believe the Chinese authorities will stop short of the type of credit-led stimulus policies that could exacerbate medium-term financial and economic imbalances." chenjia@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 09/16/2019 page1)

                Sanctions put human rights in crosshairs
            </a>
            <p>
                Anelise Borges, a Euronews international correspondent, told a tragic story from Teheran on Sept 11 about a 7-year-old Iranian boy who needs a bone marrow transplant to cure a deadly genetic disease known as adrenoleukodystrophy.ALD is a result of fatty acid buildup caused by enzymes not functioning properly, which damages the sleeves of fatty tissue protecting nerve cells, resulting in seizures and hyperactivity.Due to renewed US economic sanctions imposed after US President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal, treatment was not possible, because of shortages of medicine and medical equipment in Iran.In the Euronews interview, an Iranian doctor talked about the shortages of medicine and equipment, which are spared from sanctions. Nonetheless, many global companies, fearing potential US reprisal, have suspended business in the country.The boy's health has been deteriorating quickly. He has become nearly blind and deaf, can no longer walk and has to be fed a liquid diet.The family can do nothing but give the boy all their love. It was heartbreaking to watch the boy's father, with tears in his eyes, describing his son's helpless situation.Covering the 42nd session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva early last week, I did not hear any condemnation of economic sanctions as a serious human rights violation. But it is time to call them what they are.The good news is that on Thursday, the council convened a biennial panel discussion on unilateral coercive measures and human rights, where officials and experts discussed the negative impact of such coercive measures on human rights.United States leaders, past and present, like to tout the effects of their sanctions on countries such as Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Syria. They claim that economic sanctions deprive some governments of the money to develop nuclear weapons, pressure their leaders to change course and defend human rights, freedom and democracy.I am not defending every policy of these governments. But the US and many other Western countries are indeed good at hijacking the moral high ground.What is true is that none of these sanctioned countries has surrendered to Washington after decades living under maximum pressure. In the case of Cuba, the US economic embargo has been imposed for nearly 60 years and is now widely regarded as a debacle.When US sanctions cause skyrocketing inflation and unemployment in Iran and other countries, it is ordinary people who are collectively punished by the US administration.Iran's GDP grew 13.4 percent in 2016 after easing of sanctions as a result of the nuclear deal, but the World Bank forecast Iran's economy will contract 4.5 percent this year, largely as a result of renewed US sanctions.The sanctions have impoverished people and denied them food, medicine and education.The boy whom Borges discussed is just one of the heartbreaking stories resulting from US sanctions.In May, Idriss Jazairy, a special rapporteur appointed by the Human Rights Council, expressed deep concern at unilateral coercive measures by the US on Cuba, Venezuela and Iran, saying the use of economic sanctions for political purposes violates human rights.So when US officials, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, say the US stands with the Iranian people, I doubt they dare look into the eyes of that boy's father.Sanctions, though there are no bombs dropped or shots fired, constitute an act of war. And though it isn't a true shooting war, the damage done to innocent people is no different.When the 74th session of the UN General Assembly opens in New York on Tuesday, there is no better time to look into the devastating effect on ordinary people caused by economic sanctions.The author is chief of China Daily's EU Bureau in Brussels.

                Economists: US dollar as top currency set to weaken
            </a>
            <p>
                The US dollar's status as the top global reserve currency is set to weaken, although no currencies will substantially challenge its supremacy in the short term, said economists on Monday."The United States is now facing quite a revolt against its financial hegemony," said Gal Luft, co-director of the Washington, DC-based Institute for the Analysis of Global Security.The hegemony, centered on the dominant role the dollar plays in the global economic and financial system, has affected the interests of other countries and triggered increasing opposition from those countries, said Ding Yifan, deputy head of the China Society of World Economics."The momentum of de-dollarization has been building up for quite a long time and has recently accelerated," he said.They made the remarks at an event to launch the new book De-dollarization: The Revolt Against the Dollar and the Rise of a New Financial World Order, authored by Luft and Anne Korin, who is also a co-director of IAGS. The event was hosted by the International Monetary Institute of the Renmin University of China.Now the dollar accounts for about 80 percent of international payments. But as Luft and Korin have pointed out in their book, "the dollar is facing a challenge by a growing coalition of states and nonstate actors who are fed up with what they believe to be America's overuse of sanctions and other coercive economic measures, its extraterritorial legal outreach and its treatment of the global financial system as its fiefdom".As a result, more and more countries have sought to carry out trade using nondollar currencies and build mechanisms to circumvent the dollar-dominated financial system, leading to the weakening role of the paramount currency."We believe the dollar could lose its status as the world's dominant currency (which could see it depreciate over the medium term) due to structural reasons as well as cyclical impediments," wrote JP Morgan strategist Craig Cohen in a note on July 10.Reflective of that declining importance, the dollar's share in the global currency basket and in international trade has been on the decline, according to the book.According to the US Department of Treasury's Borrowing Advisory Committee, the dollar share of global foreign exchange reserves has steadily come down from 72 percent in 2000 to 62 percent now, according to the book.But the de-dollarization process will be a long-term evolution, Luft said. "We do not believe the yuan or any other single currency will replace the dollar (any time soon)."
