                Editor's note: As Teachers' Day approaches, China Daily readers express their gratitude for their beloved teachers. Feel free to leave your comments.numero_uno (UK) Teaching is a noble profession and Confucius was one of China's greatest teachers. We should honor these great intellectuals for their contributions to society and to mankind in general. They painstakingly educate students year after year, in cities, towns or villages. I personally congratulate my teachers for their commendable hard work and dedication.

                Culture Insider: Teachers' Day in ancient China
            </a>
            <p>
                Today is the 35th Chinese Teachers' Day – a festival celebrating the 2,300-year tradition of respecting teachers and education in China. It's similar to the birthday of Confucius or the birthday of private school tutor in ancient China.The history of Teacher's Day traces back to the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220). According to record, during the Han (202 BC–AD 220) and Jin (1115-1234) dynasties, on August 27 each year, the birthday of Confucius, the emperor would go to Confucius' temple and pay tribute to the ancient philosopher followed by court officials, and would also invite royal teachers to the imperial court for a banquet.Local officials followed the court, and on this day, teachers around the nation enjoyed a day's vacation and were given dried meat as gifts.The capital, all states and counties would also stage sacrificial ceremonies to worship Confucius, with local chiefs or the emperor leading rituals. Excellent-performed teachers would be chosen from academies and learning institutions nationwide, reporting to the royal court and given 500 liang (两) silver coins as awards.Until the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the sacrificial ceremony, on August 27, was of a larger scale. The teachers' salaries in schools and academies around the nation were raised, and well-performing teachers would be conferred official titles or promoted to higher positions.

                Happy Teachers' Day from a career teacher in China
            </a>
            <p>
                I often tell people that if you had told me as a teenager I would be the one in my high school class to leave Canada and live in China as a teacher for almost two decades, you’d be absolutely crazy. Why would I – a bright, but a bit eccentric upper-middle class kid from Canada, ever leave my country? And for how long, you say? China? Get real. Are you sure you’ve got the right guy?As a teenager, I wasn’t the best student in my class by any means. I always considered myself astute when it came to things like books and writing, music and movies, but I was terrible at math, and even worse at science. I was a comedian in high school – doing impressions of famous people, friends and being the life of the party. By the time I was nearing the end of my teens, I eventually switched high schools (I had a ‘reputation’ among teachers at my previous one) and actually applied myself to gain admittance to one of the top universities in Canada. I was accepted to other universities for drama, but I eventually pursued a double major in English and history. By the end of my second year, I knew that I wanted out of my hometown and went to study in York, UK to expand my horizons. After returning to Canada to finish my degree the following year, I knew that I wasn’t done seeing the world and was interested in a career in education.Fortuitously, a college near my home had just recently announced a partnership with a university in Wuxi, East China’s Jiangsu province, and I figured I would give China a try as a means to start my career as a teacher. That was in 2002. I was 23 years -old.While I have lived mostly in Beijing during the past 15 years, I taught all over the country when I was in my 20s and have welcomed students of all ages into my classroom. I have taught at elite international schools, public schools, universities and training centers, and now find myself as a lead teacher at an international school in its sophomore year in Beijing. Now a man of 40 with a wife and 2 kids of my own (who both attend my school), I have seen changes in the climate of education in China, but also some things that I don’t think will ever change.When I first moved to Beijing in 2004, there were literally only a handful of international schools that were available for us expats to teach at. Compare that to now and the wellspring of schools that have popped up, the change is staggering. There is palpably an unquenching thirst for international education in China that I have literally seen and lived with my own eyes. When I speak with administrators at schools these days, their eyes often widen when I tell them how long I’ve been in China. I know 40 may not seem that old to some people, but I’ve spent my most of my adult life as a teacher in China. I often jokingly reply, “Yeah, I know – long time, eh? What took you so long?”Another change that I’ve seen is the standard of teachers that are now entering China and the qualifications they currently need to teach. When I first arrived here, almost any foreigner could get a teaching job based on their country of birth. Later, foreigners needed degrees and eventually TESOL certifications. A few years ago, two years of teaching experience was added to the list. With that said, I have had to adapt and update my qualifications that now include an international teaching certification and an MA in education that I am currently pursuing. With the development of China, the standards for teachers interested in pursuing a career here have also risen. This has been a win-win for not only schools and students, but also the country’s overall reputation and prestige.With all this sea change though, there are some things that really haven’t changed that much. The Chinese colleagues and students I’ve taught with and taught have pretty much always been welcoming to foreigners; they’ve consistently been friendly, hard-working and interested in learning about where I’m from and my experiences in their country. It’s funny that the first question a Chinese will often ask me is where I’m from; after so much time spent in China, and having my children born here, I have just as much of an attachment to Beijing and the pulse of China, as I do Canada (maybe more).I should also, and importantly, note that teachers are very well-respected in China. I’ve always enjoyed my profession and pursuit of it as a passion for doing something good in the world. Not every country has a Teacher’s Day, but China does. The importance of teaching and education is ingrained into Chinese people and can go back more than 2,000 years to the days of Confucius (551BC). It is in many ways the lifeblood of Chinese culture, with a reverence rarely seen in other countries. Perhaps that’s why I’m still here all these years.This Teacher’s Day I would like any teachers reading this to know that we are lucky to have the jobs we do. Teaching is not an easy profession, but it can be one of the most rewarding if you truly love working with children and seeing young people grow and become individuals. Next to immediate family members, teachers can leave an indelible mark on a child and, in some ways, even make an impact that a parent or grandparent cannot. I don’t know if I’ll live in China forever, but I’ll always know that I have given the formative years of my life to this country. I’ve taught thousands of children over the years; I just hope that they’ve grown up with a memory of me and what they could eventually be if they too open their hearts and minds to the world and its possibilities.Happy Teachers’ Day!The author is the lead teacher at Beijing Ming Cheng Academy.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                Old music's new appeal

                A guqin concert serves as a highlight of a recent culture festival, Zhang Kun reports in Suzhou.The Suzhou Culture and Tourism Festival, which started on Aug 24, is showcasing 22 performances of 18 theater productions, arts-and-crafts exhibitions that reflect the cultural characteristics of the city, and public and educational events through September.A guqin (traditional zither) concert will be held at the Jinji Lake Concert Hall on Sept 24. Masters of the intangible heritage will present repertoires developed over centuries.While the Yangtze Delta region in general is recognized as a center of guqin culture in China, Changshu, a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Suzhou, Jiangsu province, is the official hometown of this music. The art was inscribed by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008. Changshu was named by the Ministry of Culture as the hometown of guqin the same year.Today, guqin is widely taught and played in Changshu, and programs are held in such local schools as the Shimei Primary School. It is popular at educational centers for the elderly, too.Wang Feng, a veteran guqin educator, performed alongside her students at a summer roundup recital in Changshu on Aug 29. Among her students are children as well as grown-ups."Some have come from Yunnan province in southwestern China, and there used to be students from Japan and the United States," she says at the Museum of the Yushan School of Guqin Art in downtown Changshu.Children usually start at the age of 6 or 7, when their fingers are firm enough to pluck the strings, which are traditionally made of silk and now steel, she says. The strings were changed to steel in the 1960s and helped guqin to produce louder sounds and stronger expressions.Learning to play helps children to concentrate, and improve patience and discipline. Also, the practice helps to introduce classical Chinese art and literature to children at a young age. Wang says she has found that the number of adult learners is also growing.Over the past few years, culture clubs have mushroomed all over the country, where tai chi, calligraphy, ink painting, tea ceremonies and other traditional arts and crafts are practiced. Guqin is a popular subject. However, it is difficult for adults to master the techniques."They have too many errands to run. They're too busy with work and have too many distractions. They often give up after awhile," Wang says.The process of creating a guqin is shown at the Yushan museum. The instrument consists of a sound box made using two pieces of wood-usually cedar on the top and catalpa on the bottom. Simple as it sounds, the characteristics of the sound are achieved through the quality of the wood and interior structure.That is why "you can buy a basic-level instrument mass produced in factories, but instruments handmade by master artisans can cost more than 100,000 yuan," Wang says.

                Austrian Sinologist lauds old wisdom as good for the world
            </a>
            <p>
                VIENNA - A senior Austrian Sinologist believes that Chinese wisdom can contribute to the world's harmonious development and calls for solidarity in the face of the numerous problems facing the world. He also points out that young people are a great force in the cause. "China has thousands of years of history which includes miscellaneous schools of thought, such as Confucianism, Taoism and Mohism," says Richard Trappl, director of the Confucius Institute at the University of Vienna. "The rich wisdom and lessons found among them can make important contributions to the future of China and the whole world." Educational exchanges involving more Chinese students "coming out" and more international students "going in", he says, are contributing a lot in cultivating an international spirit among the younger generation, and a keener sense of global responsibility.
