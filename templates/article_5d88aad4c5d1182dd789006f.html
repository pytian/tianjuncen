                Northern province takes steps to reduce reliance on energy-intensive resourcesShanxi province has embarked on a path of economic transformation and high-quality development in accelerating its structural adjustment to boost productivity by fostering policies of green and sustainable development, the province's leaders said."The major goal of Shanxi's new transformation is to build a national demonstration area in the transformation of a resource-based economy, become a pioneer of China's energy revolution, and explore new horizons for opening up as an inland province," said Luo Huining, secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China."We strive to promote transformation with reforms and innovation, aiming to restructure the economy into one that depends less on resources. We will continue to accelerate the development of advanced manufacturing and other emerging industries and build a modern industrial system in Shanxi," the official said.Luo made the remarks on Thursday at a State Council Information Office news conference held in Beijing.Located in North China, Shanxi has seen a significant increase in its economic growth. The province's GDP rose by 7.2 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2019, marking a six-year high. It is a key coal producing region.Major industrial companies in Shanxi reported a total profit of 135.6 billion yuan ($19 billion) in 2018, compared with a loss of 6.8 billion yuan in 2015.The service industry is leading the province's economic development, becoming the main force of growth in the area. In 2018, the added value of the tertiary industry in Shanxi hit 898.8 billion yuan, up 9.1 percent year-on year. Its share of GDP stood at more than 70 percent last year.In the past two years, the research and development investment of large State-owned enterprises in Shanxi has increased by 18.5 percent annually.Shanxi Governor Lou Yangsheng said the province will deepen reforms and open wider to the outside world to foster a business-friendly environment governed by a sound legal framework.To lighten the burden on businesses, the province cut 57.3 billion yuan in taxes and administrative fees in 2018.More efforts will be needed to better join the Belt and Road Initiative and actively take part in the transfer of industries from the costal China region, Luo added.In 2018, the actual utilized foreign investment increased by 39.7 percent, official data showed. In the first seven months of the year, the province signed 1,476 investment projects with a total planned investment of 911 billion yuan."In recent years, the government has guided the orderly relocation of industries from the east to the west,"Cai Fang, deputy head of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told a macroeconomic seminar in Beijing."Buoyed by the government's regional development strategy, major obstacles to economic growth have been removed, offering favorable conditions for inland provinces to undertake industrial transfers," Cai added.The Blue Book of China's Provincial Competitiveness (2016-17) released in April by the Fujian Normal University and Social Sciences Academic Press calculated a competitiveness score and found China has achieved a more balanced regional development. Among all regions, Shanxi has witnessed the biggest jump in its score as it rose four spots on the list.

                WASHINGTON — The House has overwhelmingly approved a bill ensuring that a victims compensation fund for the Sept 11 attacks never runs out of money.The 402-12 vote Friday sends the bill to the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has agreed to call it up before the August recess.Lawmakers from both parties hailed the House vote, which comes a month after comedian Jon Stewart sharply criticized Congress for failing to act. Stewart, a longtime advocate for 9/11 responders, told lawmakers they were showing "disrespect" to first responders now suffering from respiratory ailments and other illnesses as a result of their recovery work at the former World Trade Center site in New York City.Stewart said Friday that replenishing the victims fund was "necessary, urgent and morally right."AP

                    Joint Letter to Mike Pompeo Secretary of State, the United States of America From Scholars and Religious Personnel in Xinjiang
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Editor's Note:Nearly 100 Xinjiang scholars and representatives from religious groups in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region released a signed letter on Friday to express their anger over US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's recent criticism of China's policies in the region.Scholars who signed in the letter include writers, professors and representatives of religious groups. Among them was Abudurekfu Tumunyzi, head of the Xinjiang Islamic Association.They signed the letter in standard Chinese and the language of their ethnic groups. Mr. Mike Pompeo,Recently, we have noted that you have made a number of remarks about China, including false accusations against the ethnic, religious and human rights situations in Xinjiang. As scholars and religious personnel in Xinjiang, we deeply deplore your irresponsible and erroneous remarks.For a period of time in the past, the rampant spread of extremism and frequent outbreak of terrorist attacks in Xinjiang had caused severe damages to the safety and property of people of all ethnic groups there. At the time, just like what happened after the 911 terrorist attacks in 2001 in Manhattan, New York, people in Xinjiang were living in stress and terror everyday. In response to the strong calls of people of all ethnic groups for combating violent terrorist crimes, Xinjiang has combined crackdown on terrorism with preventive measures. Vigorous efforts have been made to fight violent terrorist crimes in accordance with the law. At the same time, to address the problem at its source, vocational education and training centers have been established in accordance with the law to educate and rehabilitate law-breakers and those who have committed minor crimes, so as to eliminate the influence of terrorism and extremism on them and nip terrorist activities in the bud. Now, Xinjiang enjoys social stability. No violent terrorist attacks have occurred in the past three years, and people have a much greater sense of security, fulfillment and happiness. In 2018 alone, the number of tourists to Xinjiang exceeded 150 million, among which 2.4 million were inbound tourists. Tourists from home and abroad speak highly of Xinjiang's economic and social achievements, saying that Xinjiang is not only beautiful but also safe and secure.Your claim that the persecution camps in Xinjiang detain more than one million Muslim minorities is incomprehensible. We have made multiple visits to several centers. We saw with our own eyes the trainees learning the country's common language and legal knowledge and taking various vocational training courses on skills such as clothes processing, food processing and hairdressing in bright and spacious teaching building. Besides, they are served with rich dishes in clean and tidy canteens, living in dormitory quarters equipped with TV, air conditioning and shower facilities, and enjoying colorful cultural lives on the sport courts or in the libraries. The trainees can have home visits each week and also can ask for leave to attend to private affairs. Their personal freedom is fully guaranteed. Many of them are now aware of the true nature and harm of the extremist religious thoughts. They hate the atrocities committed by the "three forces", appreciate the education and redemption measures taken by the Party and government and feel fortunate for not falling victim to the violent terrorist activities. Many of them have found suitable jobs, putting the vocational skills they acquired in the training centers into good use. They get paid and can provide a good life for their family.You said that Xinjiang is butchering systematically the Uyghur culture, but where is your evidence? The constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates that the state protects the lawful rights and interests of every ethnic group, and helps ethnic minority regions achieve a faster pace of economic and cultural development. Xinjiang has put a lot of efforts into the protection, inheritance and promotion of each ethnic minority's culture. Courses on ethnic minority languages are provided by all the schools under the compulsory education system. Roza and Qurban are designated as statutory festivals, and Meshrep, Twelve Muqams, and Qumuz Sing & Instrumental play have been widely disseminated. Xinjiang Radio and Television Station broadcasts in five languages, namely Mandarin, Uyghur, Kazak, Qirghiz and Mongolian, Xinjiang Daily is published in four languages of Mandarin, Uyghur, Kazak and Mongolian, and the numbers of newspapers and journals published in ethnic minority languages across Xinjiang have reached 51 and 116 respectively. The ever increasing cultural needs of people of all ethnic groups have been met.Your claims that Xinjiang is terminating Islamic beliefs and that Chinese government severely persecutes believers of various religions are not based on facts at all. It is a longstanding basic policy of the Chinese government to respect and protect the freedom of religious belief. Xinjiang has never associated the crackdown on terrorism and extremism with any specific ethnic group or religion. The local government of Xinjiang protects the normal religious activities and fulfills the reasonable religious demands of believers in accordance with the law. In Xinjiang, there are 24,400 mosques and 29,000 religious clerics. There are 10 religious colleges including the Xinjiang Islamic Institute, enrolling more than 1,300 students annually. In Xinjiang, for every 530 Muslims there is one mosque, a figure that exceeds many Muslim countries. In recent years, the local government in Xinjiang has greatly improved the basic conditions of the mosques, which now come with water, electricity, access to roads, natural gas, telecommunications, radio, television, library and pre-worship cleansing facilities. Those efforts have been praised by religious personnel and Muslims.Your claim that China has stepped up mass surveillance in Xinjiang is even more absurd. Installing surveillance facilities in public areas is a common practice adopted by countries around the world to maintain public security. In the US, surveillance cameras are installed in both big and small cities, and in its 20 big airports, travelers are even asked to pass through facial recognition scanners. So why are the surveillance devices in Xinjiang regarded as "surveillance"? This is utterly double standards!We urge the US to view the ethnic, religious and human rights situations in Xinjiang in an unbiased and objective way, immediately stop fabricating lies and slanders about Xinjiang, and immediately stop using Xinjiang-related issues to interfere in China's internal affairs.

                Scholars and religious personnel in Xinjiang deplored US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's recent accusations and attacks against China's Xinjiang policy by signing a joint statement.In the joint letter, the scholars and religious personnel from China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region refuted Pompeo's recent remarks about China, "including false accusations against the ethnic, religious and human rights situations in Xinjiang",are "irresponsible and erroneous remarks."The letter was published on Friday on Tianshannet, the only major news website in Xinjiang in six languages including Chinese, Russian, Uygur, English, Kazakh and Turkish.Pompeo once again pointed an accusing finger at China's policies in the Xinjiang during an international conference on religious freedom hosted by himself in Washington from Tuesday to Thursday,Pompeo said China is "home to one of the worst human rights crises of our time," and described China's policies in the Xinjiang as "the stain of the century."Sticking to the facts, the letter refuted Pompeo's remarks."For a period of time in the past, the rampant spread of extremism and frequent outbreak of terrorist attacks in Xinjiang had caused severe damages to the safety and property of people of all ethnic groups there," the letter wrote"At the time, just like what happened after the 911 terrorist attacks in 2001 in Manhattan, New York, people in Xinjiang were living in stress and terror every day," the letter added.The letter said in response to the strong calls of people of all ethnic groups for combating violent terrorist crimes, Xinjiang has combined crackdown on terrorism with preventive measures."…To address the problem at its source, vocational education and training centers have been established in accordance with the law to educate and rehabilitate law-breakers and those who have committed minor crimes, so as to eliminate the influence of terrorism and extremism on them and nip terrorist activities in the bud," it wrote.The efforts have paid off.

                    Missing Canada teens now suspects in murder of tourists
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                 Two teenagers, first categorized as missing in Canada, are now suspects in the murder of an Australian tourist, his American girlfriend and an unidentified man whose body was found near the teens' abandoned, flaming car, police said on Tuesday.Lucas Fowler, 23, an Australian citizen, and Chynna Deese, 24, from Charlotte, North Carolina, were found shot dead on July 15 on a highway in northern British Columbia, 20 km from Liard Hot Springs.Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, have been missing since July 19. Their car was found in flames about 500 km away from where Fowler and Deese were found dead, near Dease Lake, British Columbia.The body of a man the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) are still trying to identify was found 2 km from the abandoned car. It was not immediately clear to police whether the body was connected to the car and the missing teenagers, but the RCMP said they are now also considering McLeod and Schmegelsky as suspects in the man's murder.McLeod and Schmegelsky were last seen in northern Saskatchewan, driving a grey 2011 Toyota RAV4, the RCMP said.The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) was interviewing Deese's mother, Sheila, when police announced that the teenagers were suspects and warned the public not to approach them, instead saying to call 911."I need for anyone with information to share that, because this can't happen to another family," the mother was quoted as saying."It shouldn't have happened to ours."Police have cited the vastness of the area in question, as well as its remoteness, as factors complicating their investigation.It is not known if McLeod and Schmegelsky are armed, or what their motives may be. The ABC said Deese was due home on July 31, with the day marked "Chynna returns" in the calendar by the kitchen at the family's North Carolina home."I don't know what I'm going to do on July 31," Sheila told the network. "Chynna was a sunflower. Strong and tall and beautiful."Reuters

                    Files in rape accusation vs. JD founder released
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The Minneapolis Police Department on Wednesday made public the videos, photos and reports from its investigation into a rape allegation against Chinese billionaire Liu Qiangdong.Liu, the founder and CEO of Chinese e-commerce giant JD, was not criminally charged. Authorities in Hennepin County, Minnesota, said they would not file sexual assault charges against Liu because of "profound evidentiary problems" that would have made it tough to build a criminal case last December.But the accuser, a female student at the University of Minnesota, filed a civil lawsuit against Liu and JD in April, accusing Liu of false imprisonment, civil assault and battery, as well as sexual assault or battery.The information released on Tuesday included 911 call transcripts, a 149-page case report with narratives, text messages sent from the woman after the alleged rape, surveillance footage and pictures showing the pair together on the night of the incident, and audio of Liu's interview with police."Upon completion of the on-scene investigation, it was unclear if a crime had actually taken place, based on statements provided by other officers, as well as the overall environment of the scene," stated a police officer in a report."Qiangdong did not understand what was going on, and did not think that he had done anything wrong," an arresting officer wrote.Liu, who also goes by the first name Richard, said in the audio interview with police that during the entire contact, the female student did not say that she didn't want to have sex with him.He added that the accuser was sitting to his left at the restaurant, poured wine for him and invited him to her apartment."I had no idea (what's going on). Later she talked to the policeman," Liu said. "It's a horrible misunderstanding."However, in text messages sent from the student after the alleged rape, she wrote that "I was forced. He started to molest me in his vehicle. Then I begged him not to."She also wrote: "Yesterday I was held down by him. I was not able to set myself free."A chauffeur of the SUV they were riding in said Liu was "all over this girl". But the woman, who was 21 at the time, told police officers who interviewed her after a friend called them about a possible rape, said that it was "spontaneous sex" and "consensual".Shortly thereafter, the woman changed her position, and told police she wanted Liu charged with rape. The messages also suggested that she was reluctant to call police because she feared repercussions."I asked her (the female student) if she wished to pursue this investigation. She immediately and spontaneously said, 'No, I just want it to go away. I want apology ... and money.""The evidence released today again reaffirms our strong belief from the very beginning that Mr. Liu is innocent," Jill Brisbois, an attorney for Liu, said in a statement.Contact the writers at ruinanzhang@chinadailyusa.com

                    5 dead, 2 injured in residential shootings in Wisconsin

                CHIPPEWA FALLS, Wis. — A shooter killed three family members at a home in a small Wisconsin town, then went to a residence in a nearby community and opened fire on more people, sheriff's officials said Monday.The shootings some 9 miles (14.5 kilometers) apart in northwestern Wisconsin left a total of five people dead, including the suspect, and two others wounded, authorities said.Authorities found the shooter and another person dead while responding to a 911 call in Lake Hallie in about 10:30 pm Sunday, Sheriff James Kowalczyk told WQOW-TV. Authorities said the dead were a man and a woman, but Kowalczyk didn't say which one was the shooter or how authorities were able to determine who the shooter was.Two other adults at the home in Lake Hallie were rushed to the hospital with gunshot wounds. There was no immediate word on their conditions.Authorities looking to notify the shooter's relatives then went to a home in the Town of Lafayette around 2:30 am Monday and discovered three more bodies, Kowalczyk said."We went to the door, received no answer, attempted to make a call, again no answer. We finally forced our way in and found three other victims of a homicide," Kowalczyk said.The dead there were a man, a woman and a boy.The names of the victims and the shooter have not been released. Kowalczyk told WQOW that authorities were still trying to determine a motive. The sheriff didn't immediately return a phone message left by The Associated Press.AP

A teenager cut down on his porch on a warm day in Washington state.During the week bookended by mass shootings in Gilroy, California; El Paso, Texas; and Dayton, Ohio, in which gunmen killed 34 people, hundreds of others were shot to death across 47 US states, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit group that uses local news and police reports to track gun incidents.The deaths were the sort of everyday murders, suicides and accidents that may not grab the headlines of mass shootings, but in many ways show the true toll of the gun violence endemic to the United States.More than 36,000 people are shot to death every year on average in the US, according to US government data compiled by the gun-control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. That works out to about 100 a day. Suicides account for more than 60 percent of those deaths. Slightly more than a third are homicides.Here are three of the victims of deadly shootings during the week between the attack in Gilroy and the attack in Dayton:Sunday, July 28Soon after a gunman opened fire at the Gilroy Garlic Festival, Steven Parsons was sitting in a parked car with two other people 1,500 miles (2414 kilometers) away in an alley in Kansas City, Missouri.The 27-year-old died there along with another man, Montae Robinson, shot by a gunman who is still at large, police said. The third person in the car is being sought by police for questioning but is not a suspect."I have a wedding dress in my closet that I will never wear," Marissa Tantillo said during Parsons' funeral service on Wednesday evening at a chapel in Blue Springs.They had two daughters together and planned to marry in a few months. She urged mourners never to take their loved ones for granted. "All I want you to do is hold your husband a little closer, hold your wife a little tighter," she said.Monday, July 29Guests at the Hotel ZaZa in Dallas heard a commotion and screams from the room where Jacqueline Rose Parguian and her husband, Peter Nicholas, were staying on Monday night.When hotel security staff knocked on the door, no one answered. Paramedics, responding to a 911 call about a woman loudly in distress and a report of a possible drug overdose, listened to the commotion outside as they waited for police to arrive, per department rules. A noisy hour passed. A gunshot rang out. The arguing stopped. Parguian was dead."Jackie had a passion for beauty," an obituary published by Parguian's family said. She pursued a degree in cosmetology and graduated from a Dallas beauty school in 2016.She loved 1990s pop music and collected concert tickets in a box of memories. One of six children, she was known for checking in frequently with her younger siblings.She was 32. Her sons are ages 2 and 8.Nicholas, 30, was arrested and charged with his wife's murder. He was later released on a $250,000 bond. An attorney for Nicholas did not respond to a request for comment.Tuesday, July 30It was a warm day in Tacoma, Washington, and Jamone Pratt was out on a friend's front porch when he was shot in the head. Witnesses told police they saw at least two cars speeding away. Pratt was 16 years old.Police have made no arrests. Jamone's mother, Kyndal Pierce, has filled her Facebook page with anguished posts, saying she's finding it hard to go on without her eldest son, a "tall and skinny" kid the family called Junior and who was inseparable from his sister.A schoolmate of Jamone's who makes music under the name Kiing-Calebb recorded a rap tribute to his friend called MonesWrld. The lyrics include oblique references to gang rivalries."Thought you were going to make it to 18," the lyrics went. "All you wanted were your dreams/but now you fly high."Reuters

                WASHINGTON — A military judge on Friday set a date in early 2021 for the start of the long-stalled war crimes trial of five men being held at the Guantanamo Bay prison on charges of planning and aiding the Sept 11 terrorist attacks.Air Force Col. W. Shane Cohen set the start date in an order setting motion and evidentiary deadlines in a case that has been bogged down in pretrial litigation. The five defendants were arraigned in May 2012.In setting the Jan 11, 2021, start, Cohen noted that the trial at the US base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, "will face a host of administrative and logistics challenges."The US has charged the five with war crimes that include terrorism, hijacking and nearly 3,000 counts of murder for their alleged roles planning and providing logistical support to the Sept 11 plot. They could get the death penalty if convicted at the military commission, which combines elements of civilian and military law.The five defendants include Khalid Shaikh Mohammad, a senior al-Qaida figure who has portrayed himself as the mastermind of the Sept 11 attacks and other terrorist plots.Mohammad and his four co-defendants have been held at Guantanamo since September 2006 after several years in clandestine CIA detention facilities following their capture.AP

                    Gunman called 911, FBI in Texas shooting
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                ODESSA, Texas — The gunman in a West Texas rampage had been "on a long spiral down" and was fired from his oil services job the morning he killed seven people, calling 911 both before and after the shooting began, authorities said Monday.Officers killed 36-year-old Seth Aaron Ator on Saturday outside a busy Odessa movie theater after a spate of violence that spanned 10 miles (16 kilometers), injuring at least 25 people in addition to the dead, authorities said.FBI special agent Christopher Combs said Ator called the agency's tip line as well as local police dispatch Saturday after being fired from Journey Oilfield Services, making "rambling statements about some of the atrocities that he felt that he had gone through"."He was on a long spiral of going down," Combs said. "He didn't wake up Saturday morning and walk into his company and then it happened. He went to that company in trouble."Fifteen minutes later, Combs said, a Texas state trooper unaware of those calls tried pulling over Ator for failing to signal a lane change. That was when Ator pointed an AR-style rifle toward the rear window of his car and fired on the trooper, starting a terrifying police chase as Ator sprayed bullets into passing cars, shopping plazas and killed a US Postal Service employee while hijacking her mail truck.Combs said Ator "showed up to work enraged": but did not point to any specific source of his anger. But Combs described Ator's home on the outskirts of Odessa as a "strange residence" that reflected "what his mental state was going into this". Combs said he did not know whether Ator had been diagnosed with any prior mental health problems.More than 20 people were injured in the daylight attack over the Labor Day holiday weekend, which came just weeks after another mass shooting killed 22 people in the Texas border city of El Paso. Authorities have not said how Ator obtained the gun used in the shooting, but Ator had previously failed a federal background check for a firearm, said John Wester, an agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.Online court records show Ator was arrested in 2001 for a misdemeanor offense that would not have prevented him from legally purchasing firearms in Texas.Texas Governor Greg Abbott tweeted that Ator didn't go through a background check for the weapon he used in Odessa. A spokesman referred questions to the Texas Department of Public Safety, which didn't immediately respond.Odessa Police Chief Michael Gerke said Ator's company also called 911 on Saturday after Ator was fired, but that Ator had already taken off by the time police showed up.Authorities said those killed were between 15 and 57 years old but did not immediately provide a list of names. Family and employers, however, said that among the dead were Edwin Peregrino, 25, who ran out of his parents' home to see what the commotion was; mail carrier Mary Granados, 29, slain in her US Postal Service truck; and 15-year-old high school student Leilah Hernandez, who was walking out of an auto dealership.Ator fired at random as he drove in the area of Odessa and Midland, two cities more than 300 miles (482 kilometers) west of Dallas. Police used a marked SUV to ram the mail truck outside the Cinergy Movie Theater in Odessa, disabling the vehicle. The gunman then fired at police, wounding two officers before he was killed.AP
