                Two sides have great potential for win-win cooperation in infrastructure constructionVADO LIGURE, Italy - Not far from an abandoned industrial site where rusted metal reveals its manufacturing past, the port of Vado Ligure carries the promise of the Italian city's future.Neighboring an old reefer terminal that has so far handled mostly bananas and pineapples, the new Vado Gateway terminal, under a partnership between European and Chinese businesses, will be opened in December and become one of the most capable terminals in Europe.COSCO Shipping Ports, under the world's largest integrated shipping enterprise China Ocean Shipping Corp, or COSCO, bought a 40-percent stake in the terminal, second to the Netherlands-based APM Terminals, part of the Danish conglomerate Maersk."The arrival of COSCO in APM was welcomed as an important turning point, (as) it has strengthened this group and it has provided an exceptional chance that we would not have had in an Italian investment scenario," said Monica Giuliano, mayor of Vado Ligure.Unemployment is high in Italy, one of the most indebted economies in the European Union.In Liguria region, where Vado Ligure is located, the unemployment rate of 37.9 percent among young people aged 15-24 is the highest among all age groups, according to EU statistics.The city used to boast factories and industries, but many of them have closed in recent years. However, Chinese businesses have confidence in the port, bringing confidence to locals."I see the Chinese investments in Vado in a positive way, because we are undergoing a period of crisis," said Danilo Causa, who is in charge of the local transport federation under the Italian Confederation of Trade Unions.APM Terminals expects its number of employees to grow from 240 in December 2019 to 300 by the end of 2020 and about 400 at full operation, in the city of 8,500 people, said Paolo Cornetto, managing director of APM Terminals at Vado Ligure.A vibrant port could also create other jobs, as studies show each direct job can generate two indirect jobs, Cornetto said.Beyond jobs, the ongoing upgrading will enable Vado Ligure to have the only terminal in the region at the moment that can handle ultra large container vessels, according to Cornetto.Chinese partners add value to our presence in Vado Ligure, both commercially and technically, he added.The new terminal will have an annual capacity of 900,000 TEUs (20-foot equivalent unit), three times more than the old terminal, and enable Vado Ligure to compete with better known European ports.Huge, blue cranes bearing their manufacturers' acronym ZPMC - Zhenhua Port Machinery Co, another Chinese company - will create the most automated stacking yard in Italy.A new off-dock four-lane rail facility with a capacity for 14 trains per day will also provide rapid access to central and northern European countries such as Switzerland, Germany and France.

                    Shanghai tops 2019 ranking of world's best-connected ports: UNCTAD

                GENEVA -- The Shanghai port in China has topped the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) 2019 ranking of the world's best-connected ports in 2019.The Chinese port gained a connectivity score of 134 points, followed by the ports of Singapore (124.63 points), Busan (114.45 points) in South Korea and Ningbo (114.35 points), also in China."A container port's performance is a critical factor that can determine transport costs and, by extension, trade competitiveness," said UNCTAD's director of technology and logistics, Shamika N. Sirimanne in a statement released on Wednesday.Efficient and well-connected container ports enabled by frequent and direct shipping services are vital in minimizing trade costs and fostering sustainable development, she said.Besides the Asian ports, the other ports on the top list are those of Antwerp (94 points) in Belgium and Rotterdam (93 points) in the Netherlands, said the statement.The data also reveals that investments by shipping lines can attract additional services, Piraeus (Greece), operated by COSCO from China, for example, has become the best-connected port in the Mediterranean in 2019, said the statement.None of the ports in the top 20 list are from Africa, Latin America, North America or Australasia.In Africa, both geography and port reforms emerged as critical factors. The best-connected countries in Africa are those at its corners - Morocco, in the northwest, Egypt in the northeast and South Africa in the south, it added.The index, which measures liner shipping connectivity, port calls and turnaround time in the world's container ports, is set at 100 for the best-connected port in 2006, which was Hong Kong, China.UNCTAD's port Liner Shipping Connectivity Index dataset enables businesses and governments to determine maritime transport trends and their ports' positions compared to others. It now provides data on more than 900 ports.These latest datasets complement other maritime statistics and indicators provided by UNCTAD to measure the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.

                    'Fuse with' -- not fear of -- Chinese investments, Italians say

                VADO LIGURE, Italy -- The Mediterranean port city of Vado Ligure, with a population of some 8,500, might be small in size, but it has an ongoing big construction project on its shore.The Vado Gateway terminal, scheduled to open in December, will be able to service the world's largest container ships which are so huge that they can only dock at select ports across the globe.Making that possible was the Netherlands-based APM Terminals, part of the Danish conglomerate Maersk, together with two Chinese companies including COSCO SHIPPING Ports.Ports are among the most traditional and strategic infrastructures in the world, and Chinese investment here -- thousands of miles from homeland -- are not feared but welcomed, local officials and industry insiders say.FUSING WITH CHINA"Our local community is well aware that a foreign investor is not in Vado to conquer but to collaborate, this is the message that I gave to my citizens," Monica Giuliano, mayor of Vado Ligure, told Xinhua.In the view of Gian Enzo Duci, a professor at the University of Genoa and president of Federagenti (Italian National Federation of Ship Brokers & Agents), Chinese companies that are involved with ports are doing just what their international counterparts do year after year."What COSCO is doing in Italy is not different from what MSC -- that is a Swiss company -- is doing; or Maersk, that is a Danish company; or that in the past was done by American or Japanese companies. So in this respect, I don't see why we should have such a scare of (Chinese) presence here," Duci told Xinhua.The city of Genoa is known for its central role in maritime trade over many centuries and is currently Italy's busiest sea port. The city's deputy mayor, Giancarlo Vinacci, said he believes "in this case there is a need in the western world to fuse 'old' Europe together with 'young' China."SPEEDING UPChinese investments are welcomed as they bring exactly what Italy need the most -- infrastructure.Italy hasn't developed infrastructures in its ports or inland areas in the past few years, Paolo Cornetto, managing director of APM Terminals at Vado Ligure, told Xinhua."In Italy, the period required to create an infrastructure is very long. In this context, the arrival of COSCO has accelerated the conclusion ... of the project," Giuliano said.The Vado Gateway is set to be the first semi-automated port in Italy with a fully-automated gate and stacking yard after the construction of the terminal is completed.Anticipating booming transportation of goods at the terminal, logistic companies have rented or bought warehouses nearby in the hope of taking a slice of the cargo in the future."It is good that all these firms want to enter into Vado (Ligure) port. Now we have to develop the infrastructure to speed up the transportation process," said Danilo Causa, who is in charge of the local transport federation of the Italian Confederation of Trade Unions."It would be useful if part of the investment in infrastructure could come from China. This would speed up the process, as in Italy it is quite slow," he added.GAINING GROUNDThe China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) provides "an extraordinary opportunity" for Italy and its ports in particular, Duci said.The initiative refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, which is aimed at building trade and infrastructure networks connecting Asia with Europe, Africa and beyond.If fully implemented, the initiative could boost global trade by 6.2 percent and by up to 9.7 percent for BRI corridor economies, according to a study published on June 18 by the World Bank.Compared with established ports up north in Europe such as Rotterdam, Antwerp or Hamburg, Italian ports could save around five days' sailing time for ships passing the Mediterranean, Duci said.If the cost and time of land transfer of goods after their arrival by sea can be slashed, "we can be the real kingmaker of the European logistics," Duci added.Upbeat about business prospects of the terminal, locals have been looking forward to a brighter future, as they believe the project will boost employment.Jobs will be created in "port labor, workshops, restaurant, everything that is developing around the terminal," said Cornetto.

                    First batch of Italian goods heading for 2nd CIIE set off

            <p class="style-content">
                GENOA, Italy - The first batch of Italian products to participate in the 2019 China International Import Expo (CIIE) was loaded on Monday at Italy's northern port of Genoa and heading for Shanghai, where the CIIE will be held.Transported by COSCO SHIPPING Lines (Italy), this batch of goods is due to arrive in Shanghai on Oct 10. These products come from Pharsmart, an Italian science & health company which is mainly engaged in the research and development of medicine, cosmetics, food and medical equipment.Cotticelli Giovanni, managing director of Pharsmart, said the large population base of the Chinese market and the fast development of the Chinese economy are the two main factors that have led Pharsmart to participate in the second CIIE slated for November."We didn't participate as an exhibitor last year, and CIIE is a stage we are really looking forward to this year," he told Xinhua. "Our goal is to bring more targeted high quality products to the Chinese market."According to Li Bin, the economic and commercial counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Italy, more than 120 Italian companies have indicated willingness to participate in the second CIIE so far, with the scale of exhibition area reaching over 6,500 square meters this year."Covering almost all categories, this year the Italian goods will feature high-quality lifestyle products, high-end manufacturing products as well as many special local foods," said Li.
