                    Reform plan to make land use approval easier
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The Ministry of Natural Resources has recently issued a notice aiming to conduct nationwide reform to integrate certifications and regulations related to the planning of land use."The reform is expected to provide conveniences and benefit the people, optimize the business environment, enhance market vitality and promote stable economic operation and sustainable social development," Zhao Long, deputy head of the ministry, said on Friday.According to the notice, the approval of a construction project's site selection and the approval of the project's land use pre-examination will be integrated into one approval of land use pre-examination and site selection.Furthermore, the previous planning license for construction land and the approval for construction land will be merged into one planning license.The acceptance procedure, which includes the mapping and planning verification that should be conducted after a construction project is finished, will also be simplified according to the notice."Before the reform, a construction project's approval and acceptance were handled by different departments, which resulted in a waste of human resources and increased the burden on the applicants," said Yan Qin, director of the ministry's state territorial use management department.She said Zhejiang province has conducted a pilot program to simplify the acceptance process for construction projects.In Yiwu city, the time for a real estate project's acceptance mapping has been reduced from about two months to 15 working days.According to Yan, the reform will simplify the materials that are required to be submitted for those construction projects.Local natural resources departments will also be asked to remove unnecessary or repetitive notices and regulations related to land use."We will speed up the construction of the shared-information platform between different departments," she said."Applicants will no longer be asked to provide certificates or documents that can be found on the platform."Thanks to the reform, Yan said more services will also be available online or through mobile phone apps in the near future.According to the ministry, the reform notice was made based on public requests for advice from local natural resources departments, enterprises and industrial organizations."We encourage local natural resources departments to conduct the reform creatively and bravely to significantly improve efficiency and benefit people," Zhao said. "The ministry would like to promote those successful experiences nationwide."Also, the reform should be conducted under the principle of transparency. We welcome public participation and supervision and will treat problems during the reform seriously."

                    Curry anxious to add Olympic gold medal to his trophy case

                 SAN FRANCISCO - Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry expects to play for the United States at next year's Tokyo Olympics, telling ESPN this week: "That is the plan, for sure."The 31-year-old, a three-time NBA champion and two-time league MVP, has never played for a US Olympic squad, although he did help American teams win the FIBA World Cup in 2010 and 2014."I definitely want to go," Curry said of the Olympics. "I've never been on the Olympic team. I've been on two World Cup championship teams, but the Olympics is the experience that I want. And next year hopefully will be it."The Americans, with a squad of mostly younger and lesser-known NBA players, finished seventh at this year's World Cup in China, with Spain taking the title and raising concern about whether or not a US team of NBA stars can win a fourth consecutive Olympic title next year in Japan."We're still the best," Curry said. "If we get the guys that are supposed to be there, in terms of, you know, representing us in the Olympic stage and commitment has been there, and I think it will come together next year."Curry and other big-name players are expected to fill out next year's Olympic roster. The squad could potentially include James Harden, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis and Paul George."Obviously, knock on wood, you don't want any injuries or things like that to interfere," Curry said.Among the assistants to US national team coach Gregg Popovich is Warriors coach Steve Kerr.Curry and the Warriors will attempt to reach the NBA Finals for a sixth straight season when the 2019-20 campaign begins next month.The only team to manage such a feat was the Boston Celtics dynasty squad that went to the Finals 10 times in a row from 1957-66 and won nine titles in that span.Golden State will move into a new $1 billion arena in San Francisco but will be without Kevin Durant, who left after last season to join the Brooklyn Nets. A torn Achilles tendon figures to sideline Durant for all of the upcoming campaign."At the end of the day, we live in an age where choice is at the forefront and KD made a decision for himself and you can't argue that," Curry told ESPN."He's an unbelievable talent, unbelievable person. We accomplished a lot together. But things have changed a little bit. So you obviously wish him the best, obviously with his recovery first and foremost and things on and off the court."We're going to have to battle down the road, but this should be a fun, new experience."The Warriors must also wait for guard Klay Thompson to recover from a knee injury but they will welcome D'Angelo Russell, obtained from Brooklyn in the sign-and-trade deal for Durant, as they revamp their roster.Agence France-Presse

                Playing Mahjong underwater goes viralAn underwater Mahjong competition played by scuba divers in a swimming pool on Saturday attracted a lot of attention on social media. A video posted by Beijing News shows at least 16 divers sitting around four tables at the bottom of a pool and moving Mahjong tiles in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. "We are a diving-training company. Chinese people are crazy about Mahjong, so why not combine the two," said Zhang Yang, an employee of the company, which has held four such competitions. A game can take up to two hours to complete, not including poolside breaks and strapping on full tanks of oxygen.Scan your face for boarding at Daxing airport
