                A panel discussion on how technology in education will affect the future of education is held in Wuxi on September 21. [Photo by Pan Qi/chinadaily.com.cn]A Rewiring: Education seminar discussing how technology is changing education was held at Hyatt Regency hotel in Wuxi on Sept 21.The seminar invited guest-speakers to discuss topics related to technology in education, including artificial intelligence, and how it will impact the future of education.The guests believe that technology will greatly improve efficiency in education and that access to online resources and AI technologies will help students to achieve personalized learning.Wu Xiaoxin, co-founder and CEO of Zhongyu Science & Technology Company in Wuxi, described his company's dedication to providing better hardware and software to improve interactions between students and teachers.Wu said teachers using the company's online platform can quickly find students' weaknesses based on their assignments and make a short video to help students correct their mistakes.Mo Huangjing, a computer engineer and AI researcher, said that in some cases AI technologies are better than teachers when it comes to detecting mistakes.Mo also noted that AI's application in education needs a huge amount of data collection, the support of talents, and application scenarios.Trevor George King, a college admissions consultant, said that through adaptive learning powered by AI technologies, students can receive their own customized learning paths and tailored instruction according to their way of processing information, preferences, and goals.When asked about the challenges faced when bringing technology to education, Zhou Wanrun, founder of Olean Children's Education, said that many teachers are reluctant to transform their daily routine and also worry that they will be replaced by AI technologies which enable one-on-one mentorship.Zhou said that instead of replacing teachers, she believes AI will create new work for them, such as paying attention to children's personal development.

                    Hong Kong youths vow to help restore peace, order
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Hong Kong members of the nation's leading youth association on Sunday vowed to play their roles in helping the special administrative region recover from the ongoing social unrest that has plagued the city for more than three months.They made the pledge at a sharing session in Shenzhen attended by about 120 Hong Kong and Macao members of the All­China Youth Federation and from its provincial committees across the country.Eric Yeung, a Hong Kong member of the federation's standing committee, told the session the first priority now is to fully support the HKSAR government and the police in halting the violence.Yeung, who is also chairman of Hong Kong United Youth Association, pledged to ramp up efforts in mobilizing his peers to reject violence, which he said will only harm Hong Kong.Other members are worried about the aftermath. Kevin So, another Hong Kong participant, who's secretary ­general of Hua Jing Society, said the protracted turbulence has caused deep social rifts, which could leave permanent scars."If the 2014 'Occupy Central' movement has left a wound in society, the current unrest is a fresh cut on the wound," he said.He urged young people not to tag others with political labels to prevent the situation from deteriorating. "Whatever political views we may have, we live in the same society and share the same core values."Another Hong Kong attendee John Wong, said the SAR is facing its worst social crisis. "It's time for us young people to play our role in helping to restore peace and order in society."He said the unrest has shown that many Hong Kong youngsters still have a poor understanding of the Chinese mainland.Wong is also director­ general of local charity group, the New Home Association, which has organized various cross­boundary youth exchange events. He pledged to double efforts to make Hong Kong youngsters realize the great opportunities created by major national development strategies, such as the Guangdong­-Hong Kong-­Macao Greater Bay Area development.So also stressed the importance of increasing Hong Kong youths' understanding of the mainland, and urged the SAR government to attach greater importance in this area by introducing more measures to meet that objective.

                    From Bangladesh to Chongqing, learning from China
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The day was September 5, 2015, when for the first time I left my country Bangladesh for China to pursue Master of Environmental Engineering at Chongqing University, thanks to the Chinese Government Scholarship (CSC). I always wanted to know and learn new language, culture and tradition.Initially, due to the language barrier, going to canteen or restaurant or visiting places or buying things were a challenge. Later, when I began learning Chinese, considered one of the most difficult languages in the world, life became much smoother. In addition, I involved myself in extracurricular activities arranged by the university or by Chinese friends. In the past four years I have visited many places in China such as Yichang, Beijing, Kunming and Sichuan province. I enjoy Chongqing's delicious hotpot, tofu, traditional Chinese tea. China covers a vast territory and has many ethnicities, hence there's a variety of Chinese food with different but fantastic and mouthwatering favor. China is a country with a time-honored civilization and a land of ceremony and decorum. Whenever guests visit, it is necessary to serve tea to them. Before serving tea, you may ask them for their preferences as to what kind of tea they fancy and serve them the tea in the most appropriate teacups.I have a dream to be a good researcher and would like to contribute to make a world pollution free and sustainable place for everybody. Thus, at master's level, I have published four scientific research articles and attended an internal conference as oral presenter. In recognition of my study, I was awarded an outstanding international graduate of CQU-2017 for excellent academic contribution. Furthermore, I would like to do carry out more research at doctorate level, so that I can fulfill my dream. In China, I discovered myself: I learned how to cook, adopt with multiculture, scientific research, discover new places.I also learned how to make Chinese delicious foods, like jiaozi, dumpling, Chinese tea and common noodles. Studying in a foreign country benefits many such as learning new language, culture, tradition, making new international friends, broadening of mind and horizon.I would definitely say that not only is China the world's largest manufacturing economy and exporter of goods, but also that we can learn a lot from it. Over the past two decades, China has evolved as an emerging and first growing economic country in the world and now is the second-largest economic hub of the world production and manufacturing of goods. The GDP of Chinese economy is about $14.2 trillion with a GDP growth rate of 6.2. Despite having a huge population of about 1.43 billion, China has made remarkable progress in agriculture, transportation, research and development, tourism and culture, etc. These achievements were partly possible due to sustainable land management policy, population control policy and human resource development policy.In the last decade, Chinese scientist have invented super hybrid rice varieties which dozens of countries in the world have introduced to ease the food shortage. Currently, China has one of the world's advanced high-speed rail integration technology, construction technology, equipment manufacturing technology and operation management technology. The number of high-speed trains in China is more than 1300, the most in the world. The trains run at 200 kilometers to 380 kilometers per hour.China is investing in research and development at an unprecedented level. In 2016, the national investment in R&D was 1.56 trillion yuan, 2.08 percent higher than the average of the 15 countries in the European Union. It provides a strong support for economic development, social progress, improvement of the people's livelihood and national security. Scientific papers and patents have entered a period of successive rapid growth. The international papers published by Chinese scientists from 2007 to 2017 were quoted 193 million times, an increase of 29.9 percent compared with 2016. China is number two in the world just behind the US. As of October 2017, 20,131 papers from China were cited, accounting for 14.7 percent of the world's share, an increase of 18.7 percent over 2016, and ranking number three in the world. These tremendous achievements are the result of hundred and thousand talent program and lots of scholarship program provided by Chinese government that attract outstanding international students in China to do world class research.China is one of the few countries in the world which depend on coal as the main energy source. At present, coal accounts for about 70 percent of the energy structure in China, which produces serious environmental pollution and ecological damage. After years of efforts, China has made achievements in coal combustion, power generation, transformation, emission control and other key technical equipment and systems, making the use of coal more fully and cleanly through liquefaction and gasification. Related technologies have been used in large enterprises in China.I'm lucky to here working as a doctoral researcher at the department of environmental science and engineering. I should have the opportunity to develop the knowledge and skills that I need to build a sustainable future planet. By gathering scientific knowledge in this field, I have plans to create new opportunities for policymakers of my country Bangladesh.The writer is a Doctoral researcher at the School of Environment and Ecology at Chongqing University, China. The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

            <p class="style-content">
                Marathon lovers from home and abroad ran in a world-renowned geological park and one of China's most popular scenic spots to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on Saturday.The Lushan Mountain Half Marathon, the first marathon event taking place in the Lushan Mountain scenic area in Jiujiang city of East China's Jiangxi province, attracted more than 7,000 runners from 10 countries and regions.Ethiopia bagged both of the two titles, with Debebe Teka Tereda taking the men's with 1h11m38s and Ethlemahu Sintayehu Dessi winning the women's side with 1h19m3s. Chinese finished as runners-up as Wang Tao clocked in at 1h12m27s and Zhang Deshun finished at 1h20m16s.Manual timing, electric timing and video were all introduced at the start line, turning points and finishing line to protect against fouls such as cheating and taking short-cuts.The high-altitude route ridden with slopes and turns was regarded by runners as one of the toughest in the season. Runners will receive free entry to the scenic area to enjoy the local natural wonder.Running is emerging as one of the most popular sports in the nation, and more Chinese cities are supporting the fitness campaign by hosting marathon events.CCTV Sport broadcast the run live.

                    China becomes world leader in industrial economy scale
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China became the world leader on the industrial economy scale, with the digital economy scale reaching 31 trillion yuan ($4.36 trillion) in 2018, accounting for one-third of the country's GDP, Sina Finance reported on Monday.China has become the only country in the world to obtain all the industrial categories listed in the United Nations industrial classification, said Miao Wei, minister of industry and information technology, at a news conference on Friday.The industrial added value of the country saw an average annual growth of 11 percent from 12 billion yuan in 1952, to over 30 trillion yuan in 2018, Miao said.The country's added value of the manufacturing industry accounted for over 28 percent of the world's total in 2018, becoming an important engine driving world industrial growth. Among the world's more than 500 major industrial products, China ranks first in output at over 220.Statistics from the World Bank indicate the added value of China's manufacturing industry surpassed that of the United States to become the world's number one manufacturing country in 2010.Meanwhile, the technological innovation capacity of China's industrial communications industry has greatly improved and the country has the largest number of necessary patents for 5G standards.In the past 70 years, China's small and medium companies and private companies played an important role in increasing employment, keeping stable growth and stimulating innovation, according to Miao.By the end of 2018, the number of small and middle-sized companies surpassed 30 million and the number of self-employed industrial and commercial households exceeded 70 million. These contributed over 50 percent of the country's tax revenue, over 60 percent of the GDP, over 70 percent of technological innovations and more than 80 percent of labor force employment.Miao also emphasized the importance of promoting high-quality development of major technical equipment, including the homegrown large passenger plane the C919, which effectively promoted the upgrading of China's industrial technology and enhanced basic industrial capacity and the industrial chain on the one hand.On the other hand, major technical equipment could also provide basic support to key areas in the national economic development, including energy, petrochemicals and transportation, Miao added.China will continue to take supply-side structural reform as its main task, and work to address major weaknesses in research and development, engineering, and industrialization to enhance our innovation capabilities and promote the high-quality development of major technical equipment, according to Miao.
