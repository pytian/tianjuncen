                Chinese company buys UK school network
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Acquisition is latest example of growing trendGuangdong-based education company Bright Scholar has purchased United Kingdom-headquartered international school network CATS Colleges for 150 million pounds ($187.6 million), in the latest of a string of UK education acquisitions by Chinese buyers.Bright Scholar, a major operator of international and bilingual K-12 schools in China, called the deal a significant acceleration in the expansion of its overseas portfolio. Bright Scholar has already bought three other UK schools over the last year.CATS Colleges is a global school network that focuses on international students. The company has seven campuses and 10 international language schools across the UK, the United States and China."The acquisition of CATS expands Bright Scholar's significant presence outside of China as we continue to build a global network of premium schools," said Bright Scholar Executive Vice Chairman Jerry He."CATS has grown into one of the most innovative and successful independent education providers in the United Kingdom and the United States."Bright Scholar operates 69 schools in China for more than 42,000 students. He said that his company and CATS"share the same beliefs "in combining" traditional values and forward-thinking ideas"to help students realize their potential."The addition of CATS' international network of schools will help Bright Scholar share best practices and innovations to raise the standards of teaching and improve the learning experience of our students," He said."The acquisition will also set the stage for the accelerating expansion of our overseas school portfolio, distinguishing us as a global premium education service provider."CATS has campuses in Boston in the US, Cambridge, London, and Canterbury in the UK, and in Shanghai, China. Together with the language schools, these institutions serve more than 2,000 students from around 80 nations.Chinese companies have increased their interest in British education properties in recent years. The demand stems in part from a rising middle class that is willing to pay for bilingual learning in order to gain entry into elite English-speaking universities.Last month, Bright Scholar announced it had spent a total of 38 million pounds on the purchase of St Michael's School in Wales and Bosworth Independent College in England. Last year the company bought another British school, Bournemouth Collegiate, and in 2015, Shanghai-based education provider Dipont agreed a partnership with King's College School in London to set up three British-style schools in China.Chinese groups have also paid particular attention to the UK's early years education sector.Last year, Chinese Oriental Cambridge Education Group and British nursery chain Busy Bees signed an agreement to open 20 nurseries across China in a deal thought to be worth 75 million pounds.Chinese company JiaYi Education purchased Devon-based nursery group Bambinos in 2018, and announced plans to open British-style preschools in China and acquire further childcare centers in the UK.In 2017, Chinese investors Largreen Education partnered with UK company British Early Education to open an international kindergarten in Yixing, Jiangsu province.Beyond acquisitions, China has stepped up exchange agreements with British schools to boost bilingual learning. The Shenzhen Education Bureau recently selected East Anglian state-funded academy Reepham High School and College as a partner for an educational exchange.

                MOSCOW -- President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on Friday, ordering Russian airlines to indefinitely suspend passenger flights from Russia to Georgia starting July 8 as tensions flared up between the two countries.The decree on Certain Measures to Ensure the National Security of Russia and to Protect the Citizens of Russia from Criminal and Other Illegal Actions advises Russian travel agencies not to sell tours to Georgia until the ban is lifted.The decree, published on the Kremlin website, demands the Russian government take measures to ensure the return of Russian citizens temporarily staying in Georgia, together with their luggage.The document, which entered into force immediately, orders the Russian Foreign Ministry and other relevant departments to establish coordination with the Georgian authorities in resolving issues related to the safety of Russian citizens and their return home.Moscow was forced to impose the travel ban to protect Russians from extremist actions ongoing in Georgia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.The tensions between Russia and Georgia escalated sharply on Thursday and Friday after thousands of Georgian people gathered in front of the parliament building in downtown Tbilisi in protest against a Russian lawmaker's visit.Georgian Parliament Speaker Irakli Kobakhidze resigned earlier on Friday amid the mass protests. At least 240 people, including 80 policemen, were injured in the riots and 305 participants in the rally were detained for various offenses.Russia-Georgia relations have been tense for years over Abkhazia and South Ossetia as well as a brief armed conflict in August 2008.

            <p class="style-content">
                MOSCOW -- Flights of Georgian airlines to Russia will be suspended from July 8, Russian Transport Ministry said Saturday, amid rising unrest in the Caucasus country.The Georgian aviation authorities have been informed about the flights suspension by Russian aviation authorities, according to a statement by the ministry.The reason for the suspension of flights is "the need to ensure a sufficient level of aviation security", as well as Georgia's overdue debts for air navigation activities, it said.The suspension of flights will continue until the provision of aviation safety programs by Georgian Airways and MyWay Airlines to the Russian side and their audit and approval by the Russian side, and until the full settlement of Georgia's air navigation service debt, according to the statement.The Russian aviation authorities also expressed their readiness to hold consultations with Georgia, it added.On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree ordering Russian airlines to indefinitely suspend passenger flights from Russia to Georgia starting July 8.Moscow was forced to impose the travel ban to protect Russians from extremist actions ongoing in Georgia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Tensions between Russia and Georgia escalated sharply on Thursday and Friday after thousands of Georgian people gathered in front of the parliament building in downtown Tbilisi in protest against a Russian lawmaker's visit.As a result, at least 240 people were injured in the riots and over 300 participants in the rally were detained.Currently, about 5,000 to 7,000 Russian tourists who bought tours via travel agencies are currently staying in Georgia, and the number of those who organized a trip on their own is two or three times higher, TASS reported, quoting the head of the Russian Association of Tour Operators (RATO).Earlier, the Russian Foreign Ministry recommended Russians to avoid visiting Georgia and demanded that the Georgian authorities ensure "unconditional safety" of Russian citizens staying in the country.

                China works with World Economic Forum, known as Summer Davos, held in DalianPremier Li Keqiang called for efforts to jointly safeguard multilateralism, free trade and an open, inclusive world economic system during a meeting with Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, on Monday.Li, who is in Dalian to attend the WEF's Annual Meeting of the New Champions 2019, also known as Summer Davos, highlighted the importance of seizing opportunities from the new round of industrial revolution and creating new opportunities for the world's new champions.China began its cooperation with the WEF as it started its reform and opening-up, and they have worked together fruitfully, providing impetus to reform and opening-up, the premier said."In the course of past decades, our two sides have forged close cooperative relations, and we look forward with great interest to future cooperation with the WEF," he said.Bilateral cooperation has provided an important platform for discussions on global economic governance, Li said, adding that China stands ready to extend that cooperation to multiple platforms.Schwab also hailed the quality cooperation between the forum and China over the past 40 years.The forum will remain committed to achieving sustainable development goals and considers working with China to be of great importance, he said.He also expressed willingness to work with China to move bilateral cooperation to a higher level and better serve China's development.The 13th Summer Davos, on the theme "Leadership 4.0: Succeeding in a New Era of Globalization", started in Dalian on Monday.

                    'Chinese wisdom' to benefit economic globalization
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Economic globalization is rooted in the development of a social productivity force, while technology innovation is the dynamic force driving social productivity. Today economic globalization has reached a stage of stagnation. Therefore, technology innovation is urgently needed to boost social productivity and revive the world economy.At the recent Summer Davos Forum in Dalian, Liaoning province, Premier Li Keqiang said China's reform and opening-up, as well as technology innovation, are significant to the world economy. He also said China is determined to deepen reform and opening-up.Georgian Prime Minister Mamuka Bakhtadze and other leaders and experts also highlighted the importance of technological innovation. The rapid technological development of China was the focal point of multiple panel discussions at the forum.In recent years, considerable progress has been made in China in the area of advanced technologies, such as 5G network, cloud computing and artificial intelligence.Meanwhile, concerns about climate change and environmental issues are growing. As a result, technological innovation is needed to balance economic development and environmental protection in order to achieve sustainable development.During a panel discussion on "Strengthening Chinese-Indian Ties", China's efforts in resolving climate issues were recognized by the international community. For instance, China has been protecting the natural environment in the Himalayan region in cooperation with India. Through such cooperation, China and India can not only develop mutual trust, but also contribute to the United Nations' 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.Economic globalization has created a multicultural and open society, which will, in turn, enhance economic globalization. Today, with anti-globalization, including populism, unilateralism and trade protectionism, on the rise, it is important for all countries to exchange ideas and thoughts, for only communication can strengthen multilateral cooperation to meet challenges.China can make more efforts in several areas to promote economic globalization.First, it should cultivate and attract international talent. Talent is the key to innovation. Taking the United States as an example, Stephen Moore from the Cato Institute, a think tank, said each foreign talent can bring in about $110,000 of human capital into the US. This shows the significance of talent to economic development.China has been attracting international talent since its reform and opening-up. With the help of international talent and technological innovation, China has made several scientific and technological achievements in the areas of artificial intelligence and biotechnology.At the crucial moment of economic globalization, China should give more importance to international talent. For instance, visa policies should be made flexible in order to make it convenient for foreign talent to work in China.Second, China should engage in more multilateral cooperation in various fields with the United States, Japan, India, the European Union and other countries and regions. To develop a high-level open economy, China not only needs to actively participate in international and multilateral economic and trade cooperation, but also needs multilateral cooperation in such areas as scientific and technological innovation.China can seize the opportunities provided by the Belt and Road Initiative and multilateral institutions to promote international cooperation. China could also propose more multilateral cooperation programs to connect with the world.Third, China could improve laws and regulations on foreign investment and intellectual property rights. The Foreign Investment Law that the country passed this year will take effect on Jan 1. Once the law is implemented, the investment environment in China will be more healthy and friendly.Premier Li said in his opening remarks at the Summer Davos Forum that China's investment environment will become more open, transparent and predictable.As China deepens its engagement with the world's economies, it is more important for it to follow international standards in terms of industry internationalization. Domestic industry associations and organizations should work with the government to promote China's industry internationalization and sustainable development.In addition, China can participate in setting international standards to encourage more engagement of Chinese companies in economic globalization.Economic globalization has tied all countries together with more opportunities and challenges. In this crucial period of economic globalization, China will deepen reforms with an open and more innovative attitude, bringing more "Chinese wisdom" to economic globalization.The author is president of the Center for China and Globalization.
