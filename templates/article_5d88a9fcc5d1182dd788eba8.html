                A golden opportunity for China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to synergize their development outlooks and deepen cooperation, that is what the 16th China-ASEAN Expo provides.No wonder Vice-Premier Han Zheng sounded upbeat while delivering a speech at the expo, which opened in Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, on Saturday. He emphasized that relations between China and ASEAN member states have entered a new stage of all-round development.Indeed, as regional partners that have been steadily strengthening mutually beneficial cooperation, China and ASEAN have seen their trade and economic partnership prosper at an increasing pace over the years. They will reap even more mutual benefits by dovetailing the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative with the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025.Since China's initiative and ASEAN's master plan are complementary in nature in many areas including connectivity, commodity flow and trade facilitation, the two sides reached a consensus in July for upgrading cooperation under the framework of the China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership Vision 2030. This new blueprint will not only contribute to the common development of China and ASEAN members but also boost overall development in the Asia-Pacific region.China has been the largest trading partner of ASEAN for 10 consecutive years, with two-way trade increasing 10-fold in 16 years to $587.8 billion in 2018. Trade with ASEAN member states has become increasingly important for China, especially because ASEAN overtook the United States to become China's second-largest trading partner in the first half of this year.Moreover, China has pledged to collaborate with ASEAN in building economic and trade cooperation zones and the China-Indochina Peninsula Economic Corridor, as well as to make greater efforts to improve connectivity by building infrastructure facilities, and deepen cooperation in such spheres as e-commerce, digital trade and 5G technology.In this regard, the China-ASEAN Expo, by consolidating the relations between the two sides, will play a vital role. For example, the expo could inject new vitality into the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area and help deepen cooperation between the two sides in various fields.With the global economy facing challenges due to rising trade protectionism and unilateralism, the commitment China and ASEAN have made to further deepen cooperation in trade and other fields will have a far-reaching impact on the region and beyond.And we have every reason to believe the China-ASEAN Expo will continue to serve as an important platform promoting free trade, and China-ASEAN cooperation will continue to yield more fruitful results.

                Thousands of Australians protest against govt inaction on climate change
            </a>
            <p>
                CANBERRA - Thousands of Australian students abandoned classes to attend global climate strikes across the country on Friday.School and university students at more than 100 protests will be joined by trade unionists and employees from more than 2,000 companies and university academics.Protesters are calling on the federal government to commit to no new coal, gas or oil projects, 100-percent renewable energy generation and exports by 2030 and funding for a just transition and job creation for all fossil-fuel industry workers and communities.Australian Education Minister Dan Tehan has repeatedly declared that "politics should be kept out of the classroom.""Students should be active citizens but their education shouldn't suffer as a result ... The true test of the protesters' commitment would be how many turned up for a protest held on a Saturday afternoon," he said in a statement earlier in September.Despite similar government warnings, earlier protests in March attracted more than 150,000 people around the country.Siobhan, 15, from Western Australia (WA), chose to attend the protest despite being told that she would automatically fail a maths test worth 25 percent of her overall grade if she missed school."I have basically been told that because it is not a valid reason to be missing school, it is not a medical reason or anything, I am going to get a zero on the test if I don't actually sit it," she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)."Even though we ourselves aren't sick, the planet which we live on is, and we are protesting and fighting for it," Siobhan said."We are in the midst of a climate crisis, and Australia is in the thick of it," she said.Figures released in August showed Australia's carbon emissions were continuing to climb.Prior to the strikes more than 250 academics from Australian universities published an open letter saying that the government's inaction on climate change required civil disobedience."Australia's current climate policies and practices are dire," the letter said."When a government wilfully abrogates its responsibility to protect its citizens from harm and secure the future for generations to come, it has failed in its most essential duty of stewardship," the letter said.Thousands of companies have signed an online registry pledging to either close their doors, extend lunch hours or give employees the day off to attend the protests.The campaign was launched by superannuation fund Future Super with the aim of getting 50 employers to sign up but the number has soared past 2,200.The founder of Future Super Simon Sheikh said that most of the companies who have signed up have never previously taken a stand on climate change."These are mainstream businesses, they're tech businesses, design companies, start-ups, there's a furniture store involved, retailers are involved, a lot of tradespeople, there are a number of doctors surgeries who are closing for the day or having long lunch breaks," he told The Sydney Morning Herald."Usually it's employees mobilizing collectively against and lobbying an employer, but now it's all of us standing together," he said.

                HK vows swift action against violence
            </a>
            <p>
                Hong Kong police on Friday called for calm and pledged to take swift action against any street violence or other illegal activities, irrespective of offenders' backgrounds or views.The vow came as some protesters engaged in violent confrontations last weekend, resulting in eight injuries.The expected rally on Saturday-Clean Hong Kong Day－organized by Legislator Junius Ho Kwan-yiu, is in an attempt to remove memos and notes containing political opinions on over 70"Lennon Walls" in places such as underpasses and footbridges across the city.The police will deploy manpower across various districts on Saturday in an attempt to prevent conflicts from escalating out of control, said Fang Chi-kin, superintendent of the Hong Kong Police operations wing, on Friday.The Lennon Walls, more often than not, have been sites of violence over the past three months, Fang said. Since June, police launched 40 criminal investigations into physical confrontations taking place near the walls, and arrested 57 people on charges including assault and possession of offensive weapons.While police have always respected the citizens' freedom of speech rights, they have to be carried out in a peaceful and orderly manner and no one should resort to violence, he added.Later on Friday, a top Hong Kong police officer said that law enforcement officers were getting more and more united and determined as the protests and escalated violence mounted.The top officer made the remarks during a closed-door media session at police headquarters in Wan Chai district on condition of anonymity. The city has endured 15 consecutive weeks of street protests which went from peaceful rallies to illegal protests with masked radicals resorting to escalating violence and extreme acts of vandalism.The police unity and determination could be witnessed through resignation rates. He said the nonscheduled resignation rate for police so far this year is around 1.1 percent. The rate in 2018 was around 1.6 percent."We, the police force, won't be intimidated by any acts of violence," he said.When asked about accusations of police officers allegedly using excessive force, the top official said it is fair to say Hong Kong's police force is one of the most restrained in the world, but some media just show a partial picture.He said he went to New York in June and met with police officers. When he played video clips showing radicals' vandalism and then showed them what the media was saying, they were shocked at the huge differences between what's been written and what's been documented on camera.He called for media to give accurate, fair and balanced media coverage on police actions.It has been more than 100 days since the violent protests started in June. So far, 1,474 people have been arrested at illegal protests and 207 have since been charged.He said he agreed in theory that if there were fast-track of court procedures, it would change the current situation as people, especially the young, would know that there is a price to pay for illegal acts.

                Foreign companies still eye China for business growth
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - Foreign-invested companies voice optimism about the Chinese market, stressing its irreplaceable role in their businesses and pledging further investment in the world's second-largest economy.In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Rachel Duan, president and CEO of General Electric's Global Growth Organization, said China has always been the company's key strategic market since it started doing business here as early as 1906."No matter in the early 20th century or now, the Chinese market has long been an important part of the global economy and will become a key engine for GE's future development," Duan said."For any company, China is a strategic market that cannot be ignored," she declared, noting that "it is a privilege that GE is a participator, witness and beneficiary of China's social and economic development."Despite US-China trade tensions, the value of orders that GE received in China exceeded $8 billion last year. The company has also announced it will open a new offshore wind factory in the city of Jieyang and establish a new operation and development center in Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong province, in a bid to meet China's growing demand for offshore wind energy.GE is just one of the many foreign companies that remain bullish about the Chinese market. Vanguard Group, the world's biggest provider of mutual funds, considers China as one of the most crucial and indispensable markets worldwide."Vanguard has firm confidence and determination about taking root in China in the long run, and the company is committed to participating in the opening-up of China's financial markets," said Charles Lin, CEO of Vanguard Asia and chairman of Vanguard Investment Management (Shanghai) Ltd.Despite a short history of a little more than 30 years, China's capital market has developed rapidly and demonstrated great potential. "China is currently the world's third-largest stock and bond market, so we are very optimistic about China's capital market and we will grow alongside its development," Lin told Xinhua.He said he believes that China's financial markets will become more and more open and the current pace of opening-up is much faster than expected."China's financial and asset management markets are full of vitality and opportunity. As individual investors' demand for wealth management keeps growing and regulatory authorities continue to introduce proactive and open policies, the markets will be provided even bigger boosts," Lin noted.The latest statistics reinforced the view that China remains a magnet for foreign direct investment (FDI). FDI expanded 6.9 percent year on year to 604 billion yuan in the first eight months. In US dollar terms, FDI inflow grew 3.2 percent year on year to 89.26 billion dollars.These gains were hard-earned given the global FDI flows had declined for three consecutive years. In 2018, global FDI went down 13 percent, and developed countries saw the lowest FDI inflow since 2004, according to the World Investment Report 2019 published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai said in its recently-released 2019 China Business Report that more than 47 percent of the respondents to a survey expect to increase their investment in China this year.The respondents also reported an improving regulatory environment and significant signs of progress in the country's operational environment for foreign companies.
