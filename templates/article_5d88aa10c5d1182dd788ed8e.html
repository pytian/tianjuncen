                Beijing welcomes relationship with Solomon Islands after Taiwan split
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Beijing said on Tuesday that it is willing to work with the Solomon Islands to develop a relationship after the Pacific island nation decided to establish diplomatic ties with China."We believe that to establish and develop diplomatic relations with China, the world's second largest economy with 1.4 billion people and bright prospects, will bring the Solomon Islands unprecedented opportunities for development," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a news conference in Beijing.On Monday, lawmakers voted 27-0 in favor of the Solomon Islands government's decision to sever its "diplomatic ties" with Taiwan authorities and establish a diplomatic relationship with China.This once again "fully testifies to the fact that the one-China principle meets the shared aspiration of the people and constitutes an irresistible trend of the times," Hua said.When asked about the exact date to formally establish ties with the Solomon Islands, the spokeswoman cited a pair of old Chinese sayings: "When a melon is ripe, it falls off its stem; and when water flows, a channel is formed."The Solomon Islands was the sixth country to break official ties with Taiwan authorities and establish diplomatic ties with China since Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen became the island's leader in 2016.Hua also rebuked comments made by some people in Taiwan about "dollar diplomacy"."People who have been accustomed to 'dollar diplomacy' maybe cannot understand that neither principle nor trust can be bought with money," Hua said.In a statement released on Monday night, Hua said China highly commends and supports the decision that the Solomon Islands made "as a sovereign and independent country" to recognize the one-China principle.According to Hua, President Xi Jinping's meeting last year with leaders of Pacific island countries with diplomatic ties to China opened up a new chapter in their relationship.Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman of the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said the Solomon Islands made the right decision and that it will benefit the country and its people.He condemned the Democratic Progressive Party, the ruling party of Taiwan, who accused the mainland of "dollar diplomacy" and "political suppression"."It is a lie of self-deception that aims to divert attention. The DPP is attempting to drive a wedge between the mainland and the rest of the world," he said.Ma said the DPP is responsible for undermining the common political ground established by the 1992 Consensus and the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations.He urged the island to return to the consensus, saying that it is the only choice to safeguard the interests and well-being of compatriots in Taiwan and the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations.

                China's Taiwan affairs authority on Tuesday highly praised the Solomon Islands' decision to end diplomatic ties with Taiwan, saying that adhering to the one-China principle is the will of people and an irresistible trend.Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson of the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said that it is a right decision that will benefit the country and its people after the Solomon Islands established diplomatic relations with the Chinese mainland on Monday.Ma stressed that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of it.

                    Washington slammed over Solomons remark
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Beijing urged Washington on Wednesday to not interfere in the Solomon Islands' domestic affairs and respect its right to make its own decisions.Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said that the United States is in no position to make irresponsible remarks on the Pacific islands country's decision to establish diplomatic ties with China based on the one-China principle, given that Washington itself established diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979."If the US is really concerned about the Pacific islands countries, it should do more practical things that help to develop the island nations' economies and improve the livelihoods of their people, instead of wielding the stick of sanctions and flagrantly interrupting their domestic affairs," Geng said at a regular news conference in Beijing.Geng's remarks came after a spokesperson for the US State Department told Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao newspaper on Monday in an email that Washington was disappointed by the Solomon Islands' decision to establish diplomatic ties with Beijing.It was also reported that US Vice-President Mike Pence canceled his plans to meet with Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare to discuss development partnerships after the Pacific islands nation severed official ties with Taiwan authorities.The meeting was set to take place this month on the sidelines of the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, or later in Washington."We urge the US side to respect other countries' sovereign right to decide their own internal and foreign affairs independently," he said.In response to the latest Vietnamese claim that the Chinese scientific research ship Haiyang Dizhi 8 had "invaded" its exclusive economic zone and continental shelf, the spokesman reiterated China's sovereignty over the Nansha Islands as well as its sovereign rights and jurisdiction over surrounding waters at the news conference on Wednesday."The Chinese side's operations in the South China Sea waters under China's jurisdiction is lawful and there is nothing wrong with them," Geng said.He added that Vietnam has been unilaterally carrying out oil and gas drilling since May, and this "seriously violates China's rights and interests".

                    China appreciates Kiribati's decision to sever 'diplomatic ties' with Taiwan
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                BEIJING - China highly appreciates the decision of the Kiribati government to recognize the one-China principle and break off so-called "diplomatic relations" with the Taiwan authorities, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang said Friday.The government of Kiribati announced earlier Friday its decision to recognize the one-China principle, sever "ties" with Taiwan and resume diplomatic relations with China, according to media reports."We support this important decision which Kiribati government has made on its own as an independent sovereign state," Geng said at a press briefing.Geng stressed that there is but one China in the world, that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government that represents the whole of China and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. "This is approved by United Nations resolutions and the universal consensus of the international community," Geng said."On the basis of the one-China principle, China has established official diplomatic relations with 178 countries around the world," Geng noted.The decisions of the Solomon Islands and Kiribati to recognize the one-China principle, cut "ties" with Taiwan and to establish or resume diplomatic relations with China in the last few days have again fully demonstrated that the one-China principle meets the shared aspiration of the people and constitutes an irresistible trend of the times, Geng added.Relations between China and Pacific island nations are maintaining rapid growth, he said. "Despite the twists and turns of China-Kiribati ties, people of the two countries hold amicable feelings towards each other all the time."China stands ready to work with Kiribati to open a new chapter of bilateral relations, said the spokesperson.

                    China, Solomon Islands establish diplomatic relations
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China and the Solomon Islands established diplomatic relations on Saturday, after the Pacific island country severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan.State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Minister of Foreign Affairs and External Trade of the Solomon Islands Jeremiah Manele signed the joint communique on the establishment of diplomatic ties in Beijing.According to the communique, the government of the Solomon Island recognizes that there is but one China in the world, the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing the whole of China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory.The government of the Solomon Islands commits not to have any official relations or exchanges with Taiwan, it said.The Solomon Islands was the sixth country to break ties with Taiwan and establish diplomatic ties with China since Tsai Ing-wen became the island's leader in 2016. 179 countries have formed diplomatic ties with China.On Friday, Kiribati cut "diplomatic ties" with Taiwan, leaving the island with official relations to 15 nations.Noting China has become the largest trade partner of the Solomon Islands, Wang told reporters after the signing that it is neither reasonable nor sustainable for the two countries not to have diplomatic relations.In a few days, China will be marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Wang noted that "as we mark this important occasion, China and the Solomon Islands established diplomatic relations, the timing brings a special significance and promises bright prospects in bilateral relations."China will never impose its willingness to others in foreign exchanges, nor will it pursue unilateral interests when cooperating with others, the cooperation between China and the Solomon Islands will be based on equality, openness, mutual benefits and inclusiveness, Wang said."China welcomes the Solomon Islands to join the big family of Cooperation between China and South Pacific islands nations", he added."China must and will eventually achieve national reunification," Wang said, adding that Taiwan was, is and will continue to be an inalienable part of China's territory, both de facto and de jure. This status will not and cannot be changed."Now there are only a handful of countries that have not established diplomatic relations with China," Wang said, adding that he believes more and more visionary people in these countries will speak up for justice in keeping with the trend of the times.Manele said that the decision to form ties with China is based on national interests, and conforms to the international law and is in compliance with United Nations resolution 2758, which stated that the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government of China.The establishment of diplomatic relations with China opens a dialogue for cooperation in all areas, he said.According to a statement made by prime minister of the Solomon Islands on Friday, the country's decision to break ties with Taiwan and form relations with China was made in a transparent manner.He said that formal recognition of the sovereignty of the Peoples Republic of China under the UN Resolution 2758 is supported by all UN countries except 16 underdeveloped nations, which raises questions over whose interests does this minority support of small nations serve to represent against the vast majority of the global democracy?The Solomon Islands cannot answer for other nations but to determine the most appropriate way forward for the good of the country and people, he said.The Solomon Islands will greatly benefit from the Belt and Road Initiative and will pump in a lot of infrastructure development that are directly linked to spur its economic development, he added.Su Xiaohui, an international strategy researcher at the China Institute of International Studies, said it is not unexpected that countries ditched ties with Taiwan in recent years as more of them would choose partner for cooperation on the basis of long-term development and benefits."As the international consensus and international law has laid the foundation, and China's development has brought opportunities, it has become an inevitable choice for these countries to independently and unconditionally establish diplomatic ties with China," she said.
