                Neymar set to stay at PSG
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Neymar looks set to stay at Paris Saint-Germain as the clock ticks down on the French league's transfer window, which closes at midnight local time on Monday.Much publicized talks with Barcelona have seemingly led to very little, in what appears to be much ado about nothing.Two years after joining PSG for a world record $242 million, Neymar clearly wanted to leave. But the summer transfer saga between prospective buyer Barcelona and hard-nosed seller PSG turned into a "Will he or won't he?" soap opera in which Barca did most of the talking-with little effect.It was not until Friday night, after PSG won 2-0 at Metz without Neymar, that PSG sporting director Leonardo effectively said a deal would almost certainly not be reached unless a dramatic turnaround happens in the few hours before the window closes."We always said that, if we were happy with an offer, we were ready to let him leave," Leonardo said. "That offer never arrived."There were several reported offers for the Brazil star, including Barcelona sending winger Ousmane Dembele to PSG on loan as part of a cash-plus-players deal with Croatia midfielder Ivan Rakitic also joining PSG along with $143 million).But Leonardo said Barcelona's Dembele offer came far too late on Aug 27, and by Saturday night speculation was winding down amid reports Neymar was resigned to staying.Losing Neymar would have given PSG coach Thomas Tuchel precious little time to recruit a top-level replacement. It has understandably been a frustrating season so far for Tuchel, with Neymar seemingly physically ready to play after two injury-hit seasons yet apparently sidelined in case a move happened."Things in the world of football are crazy, anything can happen," Tuchel said recently with an air of resignation. "The coach doesn't decide everything in a big club with a big-name player like that."It promises to be a difficult month for PSG, which will likely face Real Madrid in the first group game of the Champions League on Sept 18 before traveling to seven-time French champion Lyon four days later.Neymar is available to face Lyon-if he stays-but is suspended for the first three games of the Champions League.Edinson Cavani (hip) and Kylian Mbappe (thigh) are expected to be out for a few weeks and will probably miss both key matches.PSG could find itself facing 13-time champion Madrid with an underwhelming strike force of Eric Maxim Choupou-Moting-who joined last season from Stoke Cityand Jese, who is back at PSG after loans to Las Palmas, Stoke and Real Betis produced just six goals in 43 matches.Jese's appearance as a 90th-minute substitute on Friday against Metz was his first PSG appearance since scoring in a French Cup game in December 2016.The 26-year-old Spaniard arrived from Madrid four years ago amid high expectations, but is effectively now PSG's fifth-choice forward.PSG's injury list also includes defender Thilo Kehrer and midfielder Ander Herrera."I think it will be a difficult season, we have a lot of things to sort out," Leonardo said on Friday. "We're not going to say we're going to win the Champions League. Our ambitions haven't lessened, but we have problems to deal with first."Associated Press

                    Nations move to aid cyclone victims
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Death toll from disaster in three southern African countries has surpassed 550 The international community has moved to provide humanitarian aid to the victims of Cyclone Idai that hit Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe on March 15, killing more than 550 and leaving thousands of others homeless. The United Nations said Cyclone Idai has killed 242 people in Mozambique and 56 people in Malawi, according to government reports. Another 259 deaths have been cited in Zimbabwe by the country's defense minister. China, the European Union, the African Union, and the United Kingdom, among others, have offered help for the victims. The China International Development Cooperation Agency said on Thursday that China will provide humanitarian assistance to Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, Xinhua News Agency reported. Without unveiling the details of the assistance, CIDCA spokesman Tian Lin said China expresses condolences to the affected people and is ready to offer a hand for the reconstruction work in the cyclone-stricken countries according to the needs of the affected areas. On Wednesday, the Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe and the local Chinese community donated food, purified water and equipment worth $200,000. Chinese Ambassador Guo Shaochun expressed deep condolences and sympathy over the lost lives and to the bereaved families. "As a true brother, friend and partner to Zimbabwe, China feels what the Zimbabwean people are feeling and will always stand with you," Guo said. In addition to the humanitarian aid, Guo said China was willing to share experiences with Zimbabwe, noting that the Asian country is prone to natural disasters and hence possessed massive experience in disaster preparedness and relief. In Malawi's capital Lilongwe, the Chinese embassy on Wednesday donated $50,000 to help the southern African country. Wang Xiusheng, Chinese charge d'affairs in Malawi, said China will also donate 2,000 bags of rice, adding that Chinese businessmen in the country will contribute $41,000 to the victims. On Monday, the UK announced that it will provide up to $7.9 million of humanitarian relief to Mozambique and Malawi. This will be followed by an extra $15.8 million of support, including food, water and shelter to the survivors. The EU on Tuesday released $4 million in emergency aid to the three countries. Christos Stylianides, the EU's commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis management, said in a statement that the funds will be used to provide logistical support to reach affected people, emergency shelter, hygiene, sanitation and healthcare. "In addition, we are sending our technical experts on the ground and our Copernicus satellite system has been activated to identify needs and help our humanitarian partners and the local authorities in their response," Stylianides said. On Tuesday, Tom Babington, acting spokesman of the United States Agency for International Development, announced that the agency had mobilized $700,000 in total assistance to the three countries. "Of this, $200,000 was for relief efforts in Mozambique in response to the damage caused by Cyclone Idai, and $500,000 was provided in response to the flooding in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi earlier this month," Babington said. The Tanzanian government on Tuesday donated a consignment of drugs and medical sundries to assist the victims. The relief included 200 tons of maize to be delivered to Malawi, and 24 tons of medicine, with each of the three countries receiving eight tons. On Wednesday, Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairman of the African Union Commission, announced immediate support of $350,000 to the three countries, with Mozambique, the hardest hit of the three, to receive $150,000 from emergency AU funds. The UN's Central Emergency Response Fund allocated $20 million on Wednesday to ensure aid reaches those most affected. The cyclone made landfall on Thursday night near Beira in central Mozambique, bringing heavy rain and flooding to the three countries. Mozambique was the most affected with 90 percent damage of Beira. edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily 03/23/2019 page7)

                    Security Council members regret US decision on Golan Heights
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                UNITED NATIONS - Most United Nations (UN) Security Council members expressed regret on Wednesday over the decision by the United States to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights.The 15-member council held a meeting and heard briefings on the situation in the occupied territory in the afternoon at the request of Syria.UN Under Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo recalled that during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, the Syrian Arab Army crossed the 1967 ceasefire line on Golan, known as the Purple Line, initially gaining territory.In a swift counter-attack, however, the Israeli Defense Forces re-captured the lost ground and advanced further, crossing the ceasefire line and occupying a salient portion of Syrian territory, she added.After US President Donald Trump's proclamation on Monday to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, the UN Secretary-General has taken note of member states' reactions to the decision, she said.The UN position on Golan is clear in the relevant Council and General Assembly resolutions, notably in Council resolutions 242 and 497, she said."We hope that the recent developments will not be used as an excuse by anyone to pursue actions that could undermine the relative stability of the situation on the Golan and beyond," she added.Except the United States, all the other 14 members in the meeting expressed regret on the decision.France's deputy permanent representative to the UN Anne Gueguen said any attempt to move away from international law and Council resolutions through unilateral decisions "is doomed to failure," expressing regret that the move by the United States undermines collective Council action.The European Union's position on Golan is that Israel's forcible annexation of the territory is illegal under international law, including the UN Charter and Council resolution 497, said Joanna Wronecka, Polish ambassador to the UN.British Ambassador to the UN Karen Pierce affirmed her country's belief in the rules-based international order.Wu Haitao, the deputy permanent representative of the Chinese mission to the UN, said China is opposed to the alteration of the fact through unilateral action, and that China does not wish to see the further escalation of tensions in the region.The parties concerned should implement relevant Security Council resolutions and agreements on disengagement, exercise restraint and desist from any action that may exacerbate tensions along the ceasefire line, said Wu.However, Political Coordinator of the US Mission to the UN Rodney Hunter insisted that the decision by his country's government neither affects the 1974 Disengagement Agreement between Israel and Syria, nor undermines the UN Disengagement Observer Force's mandate.Rather, it is of critical security and strategic importance to Israel, he added. Expressing alarm at the presence of Hizbullah there, he said there can be no chance for peace between Syria and Israel with the Lebanese group present.Among the participants in the meeting were representatives of Syria and Israel. Syria's delegate Bashar Ja'afari rejected "the illegal statement" by the United States, emphasizing that the unilateral behavior has neither legal nor moral value.World public opinion is isolating the United States and Israel, he added.

                    US under UN fire over Golan decision
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The United States came under sharp criticism from the 14 other United Nations Security Council member states on Wednesday for its decision to recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights in violation of council resolutions.Speaker after speaker at the open meeting supported Syria's sovereignty over the strategic plateau and opposed Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights and US President Donald Trump's proclamation earlier this week, The Associated Press reported.UN Under Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo said the UN position on Golan is clear in the relevant UN resolutions, notably in Security Council resolutions 242 and 497, Xinhua News Agency reported."We hope that the recent developments will not be used as an excuse by anyone to pursue actions that could undermine the relative stability of the situation on the Golan and beyond," she said.France's Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Anne Gueguen said any attempt to move away from international law and Council resolutions through unilateral decisions "is doomed to failure", expressing regret that the move by the United States undermines collective Council action.British Ambassador Karen Pierce affirmed her country's belief in the rules-based international order.Wu Haitao, the deputy permanent representative of the Chinese mission to the UN, said China is opposed to the alteration of the fact through unilateral action, and that China does not wish to see the further escalation of tensions in the region."China does not wish to see the further escalation of tension in the region," he said.The parties concerned should implement relevant Security Council resolutions and agreements on disengagement, exercise restraint and desist from any action that may exacerbate tensions along the cease-fire line, he added.Russia urged the international community to continue to view the Golan Heights as Israeli-occupied territory."If anybody feels any temptation to follow this poor example, we would urge them to refrain from this aggressive revision of international law," Russia's Deputy Ambassador Vladimir Safronkov said.South Africa's UN Ambassador Jerry Matjila said: "This unilateral action (of the US) does nothing to assist in finding a long-term peaceful solution to the conflict in the Middle East."He and others pointed to resolutions calling for Israel to end its occupation of the Golan Heights, including a December 1981 Security Council resolution that called Israel's 1967 annexation of the strategic area "null and void and without international legal effect".Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War and annexed it in 1981. A 1974 cease-fire agreement that officially ended the 1973 Middle East war led to the deployment of a UN peacekeeping force known as UNDOF on the Golan Heights.Trump's proclamation that the Golan Heights is now part of Israel raised questions about the future of UNDOF after its mandate expires on June 30.US political coordinator Rodney Hunter told the council that UNDOF has "a vital role to play in preserving stability between Israel and Syria", an assurance that the US government's recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the strategic plateau won't affect its operation.He said the force's mandate to ensure that the area of separation between Syria and Israel "is a buffer zone free from any military presence or activities" is of "critical strategic and security importance" to Israel, and "can contribute to the stability of the entire Middle East".Meanwhile, the European Union said it will not recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, AP reported.The EU Foreign Affairs Department said in a statement on Wednesday that it was the "unanimous position" of all 28 member states not to change their stance in line with UN resolutions that identify the Golan Heights as occupied territory and reject the seizure of land by force.In Istanbul, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday accused Trump of resorting to "bully boy" tactics over a disputed move to proclaim that the Golan Heights belong to Israel, Agence France-Presse reported."Unfortunately, Trump is behaving like a bully boy," Erdogan told A Haber television during an interview."He did the same on Jerusalem. ... America has preferred to escalate tensions ... rather than contribute to peace," he said.

                The seventh Art Basel Hong Kong ended on Sunday with 242 galleries presenting works by renowned contemporary artists from all around the world.The five-day fair attracted a record 88,000 visitors.Collectors from 70 countries and regions and representatives from more than 130 top international art galleries and institutions attended. Collectors from China, South Korea and the United States recorded strong sales at all levels of the market."Our sales record has been impressive, with Asian and Western collectors keen on gallery artists. The art market has continued to lean toward Asia in recent years, and we have met a number of new collectors and sold a range of works to local organizations," says Alex Logsdail, the international director of the Lisson Gallery.At this year's exhibition, art galleries from East and West worked side by side to present high-end artworks. Eight Asian art galleries made their debuts at the exhibition, with five of them participating in the main exhibition areas, including the Beijing Art Now Gallery, Galerie du Monde from Hong Kong and Tang Contemporary Art."I was impressed by the outstanding contributions made by the Asian galleries and how they helped visitors to learn more about the rich historical heritage of the region. The exhibition was a unique opportunity to explore the world of art in-depth, thanks to the work of leading artists from all over Asia," says Adeline Ooi, director of Art Basel's Asian Art show in Hong Kong.The Almine Rech Gallery has been involved in Art Basel Hong Kong since the first exhibition. Almine Rech, the owner of this gallery, says he was delighted to see the show evolve both in terms of the quality of the work and the diversity of the collectors.At the same time, Hong Kong hosted a number of cultural events, such as Art Central and the Asia Contemporary Art Show, in addition to the annual spring auctions held by several auction houses. The booming art market in Hong Kong has been the focus of international attention for some time."Hong Kong's cultural activities are on the rise, and many museums and foundations have organized first-class exhibitions to offer visitors a rich artistic experience," says Sadie Coles, owner of the Sadie Coles HQ gallery.Art Basel was founded in 1970 in Basel, Switzerland, and was first launched in Hong Kong in 2013. The event is held annually in Basel, Miami and Hong Kong.Xinhua (China Daily 04/04/2019 page20)

No casualties were reported in the incident, and the cause of the blaze is under investigation.According to local media reports, the original Lingguan Mansion was built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and destroyed in a magnitude 8 earthquake that hit Sichuan in 2008. The temple, with what was considered the tallest wooden tower in Asia, later became restored but remained under construction when the fire broke out. The cause of the blaze is still unknown.

                    EU fines US chipmaker Qualcomm 242 mln euros for predatory pricing
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                BRUSSELS -- The European Commission on Thursday fined US chipmaker Qualcomm 242 million euros for predatory pricing.Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, said in a statement that "Baseband chipsets are key components so mobile devices can connect to the Internet. Qualcomm sold these products at a price below cost to key customers with the intention of eliminating a competitor. Qualcomm's strategic behaviour prevented competition and innovation in this market, and limited the choice available to consumers in a sector with a huge demand and potential for innovative technologies. Since this is illegal under EU antitrust rules, we have today fined Qualcomm 242 million euros."The case concerns Qualcomm chipsets of the third generation ("3G") standard between mid-2009 and mid-2011, and the European Commission found the US chip giant's intention was to eliminate Icera, its main rival - a growing threat at the time - to Qualcomm's chipset business in the market segment offering advanced data rate performance.In May 2011, Icera was acquired by US tech company Nvidia, which decided to wind down its baseband chipset business line in 2015.The European Commission said the fine, taking account of the duration and gravity of the infringement, represents 1.27 percent of Qualcomm's turnover in 2018 and is also aimed at deterring market players from engaging in such anti-competitive practices in the future.Brussels also ordered Qualcomm not to engage in such practices or practices with an equivalent object or effect in the future.

The S&P 500 was down 86 points, or 2.9 percent, to 2841.The Dow Jones Industrial Average's plunge followed Tuesday's market rebound of 373 points, when US President Trump announced he suspended until Dec 15 the imposition of new tariffs on many goods imported from China.The yield on two-year US Treasury notes climbed above the 10-year note for the first time since 2007. Also the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to a record low.Yields on bonds are negative in Japan and in many European countries. Investors therefore buy US bonds, sending prices higher and yields lower.Inversion of the yield curve — when short-term yields rise above long-term yields — shows that investors have little confidence in the short-term outlook and bid up long-term notes.In 2005, two-year and 10-year yields inverted ahead of a recession. While curve inversions normally precede economic downturns, they don't necessarily signal a recession is imminent. But in the past 50 years, a recession — two consecutive quarters of economic retraction — has followed within 18 to 24 months."This is not a positive sign for the market," Jonathan Golub, chief US equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said on Bloomberg TV. "The Fed is totally empowered to change this dynamic, and the market is saying they have to."Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics, said, "Trump's trade wars have rattled executives worldwide, and they're delaying investment decisions."The inverted yield curve is another signal of caution to the executive suite. Trump needs to reverse course to restore confidence — and that's not at all likely," Hufbauer told China Daily.In Germany, Europe's largest economy, a decline in exports shrank the gross domestic product by 0.1 percent in the second quarter.ING, a Dutch international banking and financial services company, said the latest figure shows that there has been no growth since the third quarter of 2018.In China, industrial production grew 4.8 percent in July, below June's 6.3 percent rise and lower than the expected 5.9 percent growth.The yield-curve inversion came after the Federal Reserve last month cut short-term interest rates a quarter-point. The cut was generally viewed as an effort to stimulate the economy by reducing the cost of borrowing. Most analysts expect the Fed to cut interest rates further."The Fed could do a surprise 50 basis-point (half of 1 percent) cut in the funds rate in September, but I think a majority of the board will resist dramatic action," Hufbauer said.Another indication of the slowing US economy came earlier this month from the Institute for Supply Management, a private research organization based in Tempe, Arizona.New orders, production and employment continued to expand, but at a slower rate. It said the manufacturing index registered 51.2 percent in July, a decrease of a half-point from June's reading. A reading above 50 percent shows growth, while a reading below 50 percent shows contraction.The institute's non-manufacturing index, including hotels, food services, professional services, financial services and insurance, was 53.7 percent in July, down from 55.1 in June. Employment registered 56.2 percent, up 1.2 points from June's reading of 55 percent.

                Zone's internet of things-related companies in Wuxi have grown nearly 400 percent since 2009 The Wuxi National Hi-tech District, also known as the WND, in Jiangsu province embraces the internet of things as a new engine of development. With the World IoT Expo 2019's hosting in Wuxi earlier this month, the WND is in the world's spotlight. As a national demonstration zone for sensor network innovation and a forerunner of the Chinese IoT industry, the district in Wuxi generated more than 160 billion yuan ($22.57 billion) in business revenue from the sector in 2018, accounting for more than 60 percent of the city's total. It has become an influential hub of the industry nationwide, local officials said. Established in 1992, the WND has developed into a technological innovation center and exerted great influence on the surrounding areas to promote industrial innovation, according to Wang Jinjian, vicemayor of Wuxi and Party secretary of Xinwu district, home to the WND. In the past decade, the district has made efforts to improve local companies' production efficiency, promote innovation and reconstruction of the industrial chain and put more IoT applications into practice. When the WND was approved to build a national sensor network innovation demonstration zone a decade ago, the IoT industry was still in its infancy. The district pioneered the new industry and attracted professionals and investments from China and abroad. Local authorities accelerate the integration between IoT technology and the traditional manufacturing industry, focus on the transformation and upgrading of manufacturing and promote tech applications to the sectors of smart city and intelligent medical services. In the past decade, the WND has launched 125 national and provincial demonstration application projects, covering intelligent environmental protection, intelligent medicine, intelligent transportation and energy sectors. The number of IoT-related companies has grown to 1,152 from 242 a decade ago. The companies complete the industrial chain with sensing equipment design and manufacture, data collection and transmission, intelligent applications and services sectors. The output value of the IoT industry at the WND has developed at double-digit growth for years. "IoT is an important part of the digital economy and provides key support for transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry," Wang said. Tancheng IoT, a company based in the WND focusing on upgrading traditional transportation, began adding GPS and other sensing equipment on vehicles to its product portfolio in 2008. The vehicle driving tracks and transportation statuses will be uploaded into a system. After big data analysis, the system helps truck drivers obtain orders and plan their routes. The company launched an initial public offering in 2016 and has become one of the leaders in the industry. The WND's IoT industry has become a development highland nationwide. The district plans to reinforce its position in the industry with increased international influence, Wang said. To date, the WND has gathered leading IT companies, including Alibaba, which launched the Feifeng platform in the district, focusing on big data and cloud computing; Chinese home appliance maker Haier, which set up China's first radio frequency identification industrial chain; and Shanghai Huahong Integrated Circuit, which invested $10 billion to build a manufacturing center to develop intelligent chips and microcontroller chips. National scientific research institutes and innovation platforms from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tsinghua University and Shanghai Jiaotong University have become involved in the district. To attract global innovative companies and professionals, the district said in May it would invest 500 million yuan in a human resources fund, 600 million yuan in a technology fund and 10 billion yuan in an IoT special fund every year. At the same time, authorities plan to add professional service teams, launch a promotion mechanism for innovation demonstration projects and offer experts brought in to the district "green channels "for medical services, schooling and housing. The WND also set up an IoT industry research institution in 2009 to help solve financing problems, which has served more than 270 small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises. caoyingying@chinadaily.com.cn  photoliClockwise from top: The Wuxi National Hitech District in Jiangsu province pioneers the internet of things industry.
