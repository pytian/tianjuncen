                             He said Johnson, who took office in July, believed that campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union during the 2016 referendum would make him the "darling" of their Conservative Party. In extracts published in The Sunday Times newspaper, Cameron - who as prime minister led the failed "Remain" campaign to stay in the EU - also accused his "Leave" rivals of lying to the public. Johnson is desperately seeking a divorce deal from Brussels but insists Britain will leave without one if necessary - even after parliament last week prohibited him from carrying out a "no-deal" exit

                             If Osborne stays on as chancellor or moves to another important position within the government, like foreign secretary, then Britain's continued fostering of the China relationship is highly likely. Now that the ice has been broken between Britain, which remains one of the West's most influential societies, and China, the main Asian power and leader of the newly emerging world, the Sino-British relationship will probably continue to be of real economic and strategic significance to both sides, with or without British membership in the EU. The answer will depend largely on two things: first, the departure terms agreed by Britain with the EU, particularly regarding Britain's post-Brexit access to the single European market and the ease with which London-based financial institutions can continue to operate inside the EU; and second, Britain's longer-term success in creating a global economic footprint, based on developing trade relationships with important countries outside Europe like India and, yes, China

                             According to veteran diplomats, interactions between China and the US in Shanghai, and what they have achieved in the city in past decades, are part of the two countries' shared legacy and are lessons that need to be passed on. "But at the time, political support within the US toward developing relations with China was not very strong, and many US politicians were unable to observe China's economic growth and social changes that had taken place," Wu added. Yuan Peng, a leading US expert and president of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that despite the Taiwan question, many new issues that emerged - including the Korean nuclear situation, the South China Sea, global economic governance and climate change - were not included in the landmark joint statements issued by the two governments in 1972, 1978 and 1982

The Press Trust of India news agency reported on Monday that the lander was unbroken but was lying tilted on the lunar surface, and that the chances of restoring communication were low. The fresh image of the crash-landed lander, called Vikram - after the founder of India's space program - was said to have been obtained by the onboard camera of the unmanned moon orbiter, which continues to be in a perfect condition

                             If the UK left without a deal, showing it was unable to have constructive conversations with close trading partners [the EU], it would not be a great incentive for third parties," says Simon Usherwood, a reader in politics at the University of Surrey. In fact, most economists and business groups believe "no deal" would lead to economic harm, and the Office for Budget Responsibility - which provides independent analysis of the UK's public finances - believes a no-deal Brexit would lead to a UK recession. What is also worth mentioning is the fact that a "no deal" scenario poses a serious threat to the Union, bearing in mind that Scotland didn't vote for Brexit in the first place, and both Scotland and Northern Ireland feel their national interests are better served within the EU framework
