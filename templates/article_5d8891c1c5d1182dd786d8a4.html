[Photo by Jiang Dong/China Daily]An exhibition about the Austro-Hungarian queen is touring China. Wang Kaihao reports. Many Chinese who grew up in the 1970s and '80s are familiar with the name Sissi.That was how Queen Elisabeth (1837-98), a dual monarch of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was commonly known, even among her subjects.The first film of a trilogy about the queen that was made in Austria, starring Romy Schneider, was shown in China in 1988, when Western films were still rare in Chinese cinemas.Sissi's real life is now being presented through an exhibition in Beijing, with nearly 150 cultural relics related to her or Hungary loaned from the Hungarian National Museum in Budapest.The exhibition, Sissi and Hungary: The Magnificent Life of Hungarian Aristocracy in the 17th to 19th Centuries, will run through Jan 3 at the Palace Museum, also known as the Forbidden City."Her beauty, her romantic spirit and her tales are known to all," says Shan Jixiang, director of the Palace Museum."She sympathized with Hungary and was welcomed and loved by people there."Sissi played a pivotal role in calming tensions between Hungarians and the ruling Habsburg family since she took the throne in the 1860s, he says."Queen Elisabeth is still a popular star in Hungary," says Benedek Vagra, director general of the Hungarian National Museum."Due to shared emotions in both countries (Hungary and China), she is a good example to give a brief introduction of Hungarian history to Chinese visitors."Sissi had a difficult relationship with her mother-in-law, Emperor Franz Joseph I's mother. And she was emotionally detached from royal life at the Habsburg court. So, she spent much of her time living in Budapest and traveled all over Hungary. The queen also gave birth to her last child in Budapest."Actually, her real life and marriage were more difficult than what was depicted in the films," Vagra says.

                Exhibition about life of popular Austro-Hungarian monarch known as Sissi is currently touring China. Wang Kaihao reports. Many Chinese who grew up in the 1970s and '80s are familiar with the name Sissi. That was how Queen Elisabeth (1837-98), a dual monarch of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was commonly known, even among her subjects. The first film of a trilogy about the queen that was made in Austria, starring Romy Schneider, was shown in China in 1988, when Western films were still rare in Chinese cinemas.  Saddle and horse ornaments from the 17th century. Jiang Dong / China DailySissi's real life is now being presented through an exhibition in Beijing, with nearly 150 relics related to her, or to Hungary, loaned by the Hungarian National Museum in Budapest. The exhibition, Sissi and Hungary: The Magnificent Life of Hungarian Aristocracy in the 17th to 19th Centuries, will run through Jan 3 at the Palace Museum, also known as the Forbidden City. "Her beauty, her romantic spirit and her tales are known to all," says Shan Jixiang, director of the Palace Museum. "She sympathized with Hungary and was welcomed and loved by people there." Sissi played a pivotal role in calming tensions between Hungarians and the ruling Habsburg family after she took the throne in the 1860s, he says. "Queen Elisabeth is still popular in Hungary," says Benedek Vagra, director-general of the Hungarian National Museum. "Due to shared emotions in both (Hungary and China), she is a good example to give a brief introduction of Hungarian history to Chinese visitors." Sissi had a difficult relationship with her mother-in-law, the mother of Emperor Franz Joseph I. And she was emotionally detached from royal life at the Habsburg court. So she spent much of her time living in Budapest and traveled all over Hungary. The queen also gave birth to her last child in Budapest. "Actually, her real life and marriage were more difficult than what was depicted in the films," Vagra says. Beyond the queen's old photos, oil paintings, dresses and other daily items, the exhibition also provides a panoramic view of Hungarian aristocracy during her time through such displays as jewelry, dinnerware and religious items. Vagra points to a few highlighted exhibits. For example, a saddle made in the 18th century enabled women to ride horses sitting on one side. Sissi also used such a saddle. "I think the 'lady's saddle' is quite unique," he says. "It was designed in that way because of the custom that demanded women sit 'properly' on horseback." He also says the Hungarian aristocrats' costumes and armories reflect the country's history. A replica of the Holy Crown of Hungary, dating back to 1000 AD, is also on display. The crown, made of silver gilt, pearl and cloisonne, was used to prove the legitimacy of the monarchy in olden times. The original is displayed in the Hungarian Parliament and is heavily guarded. "It's very important in Hungarian history - not only as a sign of royalty," Vagra says. "Even though there is no king now, the crown expresses the spirit of a nation and holds the country together." Hungarians, also known as Magyars, are thought to have first settled in today's Hungary in 896 after migrating from the East. According to one theory, they are descendants of Huns - the Eurasian nomadic people who possibly had connections with the Xiongnu people from China. "We are unique in Europe due to our Eastern origins," Vagra says. "Exhibits such as weapons also show some Eastern characteristics." Szonja Buslig, a cultural counselor at the Hungarian embassy in Beijing, says the exhibition at the Palace Museum reveals part of the larger cultural cooperation between China and Hungary. In the Xiongnu city ruins in Yulin, in Northwest China's Shaanxi province, archaeologists from both countries are conducting studies comparing finds from there with Hun relics unearthed in Hungary. Hungarian scholars also recently conducted field research in Shandan county, Gansu province, to look for more evidence of links. "After starting from such a familiar topic (Sissi), we're planning another major cultural relic exhibition in China," Buslig says. "It will reveal how our ancestors migrated from the East." She says Hungary will participate in more projects in an upcoming museum of Xiongnu history in Yulin. Hungary became the first European country to sign a memorandum of understanding with China on June 6, 2016, on the Belt and Road Initiative. Buslig says the initiative will create opportunities for closer cultural ties between the two countries. Under the framework, Vagra says, the rich history of Hungarian bronzeware will be shown in China. He adds that his museum also plans to introduce an exhibition on ancient Chinese civilization in Hungary, which he believes will easily strike an emotional chord in Budapest. The ongoing exhibition about Sissi visited Shanghai before it came to Beijing in late September. It will move to Yunnan and Shaanxi provinces in January.

                Bye, 'greasy' man: Hello, a new you
            </a>
            <p>
                Controversial writer Feng Tang stirred the flames on the internet and social media again.Noted for his blatant descriptions of sex and the use of foul words, Feng was criticized for his erotic translation of Rabindranath Tagore's  poems in 2015.Recently, he played with fire again.In a story named, How to Avoid Becoming a Greasy and Creepy Middle Aged Man, the writer gave 10 pieces of advice to his peers.The first is to eat less and lose weight. In Feng's eyes, being fat is the reason why middle aged men have a "greasy" look."When a man comes to his middle age, a woman may fall in love with many things he has, but not he himself," Feng wrote.Soon, the word "greasy" became a hit on the internet. Similar advice for women about "not being greasy" also popped up.Discussions about men's looks also were sparked on the internet and social media.Some netizens said the writer is a creepy and greasy man who had the nerve to advise other people. People look "greasy" due to their nasty thoughts and talks, rather than their clothes. Others said they believe that Chinese men may have too much confidence in themselves to care about their appearance, especially in a new era when women’s social status keeps on rising, men's looks were given more attention.Some people even said, "just being talented and rich is not enough to make your sweetheart satisfied with you any more".However, as an old Chinese saying goes, "The benevolent see the benevolence, the wise see the wisdom", or, everyone thinks in his own way. There is no need to judge who is right or wrong.Yet a healthy diet and regular exercise are necessary at any age.Dressing appropriately and having a clean and fresh look also is a way to show respect to people around us.In traditional Chinese culture, men are always connected to the sky. The beauty of the sky, compared to the prosperity of earth, lies in its simplicity, which also should be the mark of a mature man.Here are the simplest tips that a man needs if he wants to have a clean look all year around. Even if you are very busy and don't have much time to care about your looks, the following tips are easy to learn and quick to take effect.

                Aug 7 is the Start of Autumn period, ushering in another fall according to the traditional Chinese 24 solar terms.Though it is still hot in most parts of China, it's time to bid farewell to summer, those bright sunny days with blossoms and colors.Changes in nature can always give a stir to sentimental souls, which also moved Irishman Thomas Moore about 200 years ago.

                19 dead in Crimea college rampage
            </a>
            <p>
                MOSCOW/KIEV - An 18-year-old student strode into his vocational school in Crimea, a hoodie covering his blond hair, then pulled out a shotgun and opened fire on Wednesday, killing 19 students and wounding more than 50 others before killing himself. Local authorities started to hold a three-day mourning, Russian media reported on Thursday, as it wasn't clear what prompted Vladislav Roslyakov, described as a shy loner, to go on the rampage. A security camera image carried by Russian media showed him calmly walking down the stairs of the school in the Black Sea city of Kerch, the shotgun in his gloved hand. "He was walking around and shooting students and teachers in cold blood," said Sergei Aksyonov, the regional leader in Crimea. "This is not a terrorist act. It's a mass killing committed by one scumbag." Roslyakov "really hated the college because of evil teachers and hinted he would take revenge on them", RBK newspaper quoted an anonymous fellow student as saying. Officials said the fourth-year student killed himself in the library of the Kerch Polytechnic College after the attack. His mother, a nurse, was helping to treat victims at a local hospital after the shootings, unaware yet that her son was accused of the rampage and was already dead. Crimea was incorporated into Russia in March 2014 following a local referendum. Ukraine says the peninsula was annexed. Such school shootings are rare, and Wednesday's attack was by far the worst by a disgruntled student in Crimea. Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed his sadness over the "tragic event" and offered his condolences to the victims' families at a news conference in the southern city of Sochi, where he was meeting with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko also expressed his condolences to the families of victims in the attack, calling the attack a "tragedy" and a "terrible murder", and called for an investigation. Officials said Roslyakov had only recently received a permit to own a shotgun and bought 150 cartridges just a few days ago, according to local officials. Aksyonov, the regional leader in Crimea, said the gunman had been described as a shy boy who had no conflicts. "He wasn't aggressive, he was rather timid," Aksyonov said, speculating that Roslyakov might have "watched some movies" that inspired him to go on the shooting spree.

                Concerned parents seek to reduce influence of 'effeminate' role models

                Debate rages about the younger generation's apparent lack of overt masculinity. Yao Yuxin reports.When the temperature rises during China's sweltering summers, few men consider using a parasol or sunscreen, arguing that's something only women - and niang, or "sissies" - do.Chinese males have long been ashamed to display such delicateness, and looking rough around the edges is a sign of masculinity for many young men struggling to attain maturity, as shown by the beer bellies and shining foreheads flaunted by some middle-aged men at the slightest hint that winter is over.

                Fathers adapt to changing times
            </a>
            <p>
                What role does a father play in the family? Traditionally in Chinese culture, fathers play a disciplinary role in raising children."My father was an authority figure when I was a kid," said Zhou Changshui, a 26-year-old drum teacher.In the past, being a disciplinarian meant many fathers deliberately kept a distance between themselves and their children. Also, in the past it was customary for fathers to go out to work while mothers stayed at home to look after the children and do housework.A reality television show called Dad, Where are We Going? put the spotlight on father-child relationships, scoring big ratings from the moment it debuted.In the show, celebrity fathers took their children on trips to rural areas around China, and some unwittingly revealed how inexperienced they were at taking care of their kids. While the show generated plenty of comedic episodes, there were also many tender father-and-child moments that touched audiences.The show's popularity prompted a debate about how fathers should raise their children now that women no longer need to rely on men to be breadwinners, and what sort of role models fathers should be for their children in today's changing society.Zhou, who has a 2-year-old son, said he is still learning to get along with the toddler. However, he is more involved in family life than his own father was, and he and his wife often discuss how best to raise and educate their son.Certainly, Zhou has a different view on raising children than his own father did, and hopes to build more than just a father-son relationship with his boy."I want to be friends with my son," he said, adding that it would make no difference if he were raising a boy or girl.That view was shared by Yu Zhichao. The 33-year-old China Post employee said he raises his 8-year-old daughter the same way he would raise a son, and he gives her preferences full respect.Nowadays, more couples see raising their children as a shared responsibility."After all, both mother and father are equally busy," Yu said.That means fathers are now spending more time with their children, which will be welcome news to those who think that boys being raised solely by women is producing a nation of "sissies".

                Breaking through the 'bamboo ceiling'
            </a>
            <p>
                Beyond discrimination, professionals argue that a cultural divide is holding back Chinese employeesQian Yin grew up in Rudong, Jiangsu province, a fishing county on the coast of the Yellow Sea. As a child she loved the English language, and worked on grammar before and after school hours, studying most days from 6:30 am to 10 pm at night.She realized her dream of moving to the United Kingdom in 2011 when she was accepted into a masters program at the London School of Economics, where she excelled as a student.Spotting her talent, recruiters came calling from London's "Big Four" accounting companies, and she went on to work for two of them, EY and PwC where she now manages alongside 750 other Chinese employees at the London company.It's an impressive resume accumulated in just seven years, but Qian is aware of a frustrating truth - if she is to get much further in the company, it will be against the odds."I'm determined, but not many Chinese professionals get to the top level," says Qian." I think I am still at the stage where I haven't reached the 'bamboo ceiling' yet, but I have spent a lot time considering how far I will be able to go in my career in this country."The term "bamboo ceiling" was coined by author Jane Hyun to describe barriers faced by East Asians as they climb the corporate ladder in the United States.In the United Kingdom, both data and anecdotal evidence support the view that while Chinese professionals excel at the lower and mid managerial range, a large number of employees fail to achieve senior roles."It's a no-brainer that we should be developing Chinese talent," says Tom Troubridge, partner at PwC and chair of its China Business Group. "When we look around, there aren't that many Chinese people in leadership positions."The wider view of the labor market for Chinese people in the United Kingdom is largely positive. There is a low rate of unemployment and a high proportion of Chinese people in professional level services.A 2017 government review of race in the workplace found that 43 percent of Chinese workers in the United Kingdom are in managerial and professional occupations, the highest proportion out of all ethnic minority groups.But the pay gap among Chinese people within those higher level occupations suggest they are not attaining the highest paying jobs.Overall, Chinese people earn more than those in any other ethnic group in the UK, and make 20 pence an hour more than whites. However, within higher-level occupations, Chinese people earn 6p less than whites.A University of Essex study on the ethnic pay gap in Britain concluded that this gap exists because Chinese employees are promoted less than whites.There is a higher proportion of employees of Chinese and East Asian origin at FTSE 100 companies (1.8 percent) than in the overall UK working population (1.3 percent). Yet there is not one Chinese employee at the executive level in any FTSE 100 company, according to recruiting agency Green Park.The FTSE 100 is an index composed of the 100 largest (by market capitalization) companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.Discrimination has been identified as one motivating factor behind this occupational bottlenecking, which occurs within most ethnic minority groups in Britain. The government review found that 25 percent of Chinese workers in the UK feel they have been overlooked for a promotion due to their ethnicity.But Jiang Suwei, the first and only Chinese person to make partner at a Big Four accounting company, believes there are also cultural differences that impede progress for Chinese professionals."The Confucian values and ideals that individuals of Chinese heritage are raised to observe and respect often don't conform to the demands and pressures of the British workplace, hindering development and career progression," said Jiang, who is lead partner of PwC's China Business Group."There is a deep-rooted culture of respect in China and many children are brought up not to challenge people more senior to them both by age and by authority. But in UK culture, this is often seen as a lack of confidence or assertiveness," she added.Maggie Zhao was talked down from resigning twice before becoming the only Chinese partner at one of London's five "Magic Circle" law companies."There is some truth in the bamboo ceiling cliche," said Zhao, who is partner at Clifford Chance. "Anyone who wants to advance to senior levels in London needs to show they have ambition, to get out of their comfort zone and be more outspoken than they are used to. I think the Chinese character does not sit well with the British culture in a business organization because we are often brought up to be modest, not to boast. But Western cultures encourage and reward individualism."Qian says that one major adjustment she has had to make in the British workplace is to contribute ideas even when they might not be bulletproof."If you don't collaborate and contribute, you won't be seen as having leadership skills," Qian said. "When we speak up in school or at work in China, we want to be 100 percent sure we are right. So I used to not say much in meetings, until I realized that no one really thinks it's a big issue to be wrong, they just want to hear your voice."To help Chinese professionals adjust to British business culture, Standard Chartered Bank and PwC launched a new initiative last month. Open to all UK companies, the Chinese Talent Development Platform will combine online and classroom learning with networking and coaching to improve the Chinese talent pipeline in Britain.Personal perspectives:Qian YinManager, Banking & Capital Markets, PwC"I talked a lot about the bamboo ceiling with friends in China before coming to the UK. They said that you will hit the ceiling after a few years at which point you will reconsider your career, and you might move back to China where you will have better opportunities.What I've observed is that there are definitely cultural differences. We tend to be quieter compared with people from other countries, especially in the workplace. This is because of our educational background.I followed a system where I showed a lot of respect to older people and to teachers. You obey, you follow and you rarely raise your hand. That is not the case in Western culture where you are expected to speak up more and share your opinions. You need to do this to have more opportunities in your career, and that is one of the obstacles for Chinese professionals here."Carina WuHead of China Alliances, Arup"I can understand why people feel there is a 'bamboo ceiling' but in my opinion I don't think there is one. It might exist more in people's heads than as an outside pressure or discrimination.I would say that there are certain obstacles that you need to overcome because you are not working in your home country. It does take a lot of time and observation to understand how your colleagues work.There are challenges that exist for any foreigner, and also ones that exist for women working in a male-dominated industry.Being more assertive is the change I do see in myself. I am more confident in my role now. I learnt that in the UK, if you are quiet and sit in the corner without contributing, it's very easy for people to ignore you, whether or not you are Chinese or whether or not you are a woman."Sissi ZhaoManager, Transaction Services, PwC"I hadn't heard the term 'bamboo ceiling' before, but I think just from looking at the statistics it does exist. There haven't been a lot of China-born people made partners or directors, and there is a big population of managers, at my own company and others.It's a prevalent problem across all minorities. It's the same issues highlighted by Michelle Obama's book. Cultural differences and discrimination cause confidence issues as well as less diversity and inclusion in the workplace.I think discrimination impacts confidence, the two are interrelated. It applies to women, and other ethnic minority groups.A factor in getting past this is making your voice heard in the first place. For Chinese people, if we are not completely sure about our views, then we won't think they are worth mentioning. Whereas in this culture, if you think if you have a point to make, you go ahead and discuss it."Jinny YanManaging Director, Chief China Economist, ICBC Standard Ban"When you are talking about the so-called 'bamboo ceiling' you are really talking about language issues. To reach the top level you have to be confident in English, and that's hard to do if you haven't been here for a while.I came over to the UK from China when I was 9 years old, so I am most comfortable speaking English now, and I might come across as a less confident person in Chinese.Once you master both languages, and have an awareness of both cultures, combined with professional skill sets, I think it's limitless what you can do.Another important point is that China hasn't been open to the world for very long. Chinese people really only started working abroad in the 1990s. So we have had less than 30 years in the UK, it's not long enough to nurture the kind of talent to reach the very top levels."Jiang SuweiLead Partner, PwC UK China Business Group"Why do a lot of Chinese people really struggle to reach the top? I think there are some deep rooted issues here in terms of the way we were brought up and our cultural values.You are not really encouraged to express your own opinion and to challenge people more senior to you. And that doesn't work so well in the working environment in the UK. If you don't speak up, you are perceived as having no opinion or you are not interested in participating.So that prevents you from progressing to certain levels. At the junior level, the focus is more about delivery. As long as you deliver what you are asked to do, then you can progress. But when you reach a certain level you are expected to develop more independent views, make your own judgements, and to be more proactive. Around that point is where a lot Chinese people struggle in the UK."

                Princess Sissi's palace launches WeChat account
            </a>
            <p>
                Schönbrunn Palace, where Princess Sissi once resided, and Schönbrunn Zoo announced its first official WeChat account at a news conference held at the Summer Palace in Beijing on Thursday.Officially known as Empress Elisabeth of Austria (1837 – 1898), Sissi, a dual monarch of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, has been a big reason for Chinese tourists to visit Schönbrunn Palace, Klaus Panholzer, managing director of Schloss Schönbrunn Kultur- und Betriebsges.m.b.H. (SKB), told China Daily website during an interview."Last year was the first time that Chinese tourists ranked No 1. Before it was always Germany or other countries in Europe," Panholzer added.In total, more than 4 million tourists visited the 1,441-room baroque palace in 2018.The WeChat account offers a convenient way for people to obtain relevant tourist information and purchase tickets. In addition, group ticket booking is available on the platform for both palace and zoo visitors.UNESCO catalogued Schönbrunn Palace and its gardens on the World Heritage List in 1996 as a remarkable baroque ensemble and example of a synthesis of the arts.An art exhibition about Sissi is expected to be held in China in late 2019, said Panholzer at the news conference.Personal belongings and paintings of the princess will be exhibited in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and Shenzhen.2021 marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Austria.A cultural exhibition on the Habsburg monarchy will be held in the Forbidden City in Beijing, said Friedrich Stift, Austrian ambassador to China, at the news conference.
