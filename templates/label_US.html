                            Without this demand from the US government, the companies would not have been able to do the expensive research or make the huge upfront investment that made the microchip industry possible.Once Huawei deploys its own new Harmony operating system, will it ever be willing to rely on Google's Android again? Will Chinese tech companies be willing to rely on US chips? For that matter, will countries around the world be willing to be dependent on US technology? The decisions being made now are irreversible. But, realizing the goal of creating a more vibrant and innovative domestic tech industry would be very difficult if the new companies and products faced constant competition from established foreign players

In an article published in July 2018, I stated that the "trade war" that the US administration was going to start would put in peril not only the economies of both the US and China, but the economies of the entire world. In this sense, the International Monetary Fund had already predicted in October that a full-blown trade conflict between the US and China would put a significant dent in the global economic recovery

Some Chinese companies have already started to grow agricultural produce, including soybeans, in Russia to sell to the Chinese market. However, as costs have increased, the return has fallen as more companies from South Korea, Japan and China have arrived in Russia in the past two to three years to grow soybeans

The recovery of those growth levels could take long, due to the decline in industrial production and particularly as the US-Sino trade war is taking its toll

                            Earlier in the day, a senior US official told reporters that evidence from the attack, which hit the world's biggest oil-processing facility, indicated Iran was behind it, instead of the Yemeni Houthi rebel group that had claimed responsibility.Officials said the photos show impacts consistent with the attack coming from the direction of Iran or Iraq, rather than from Yemen to the south.Iran rejects 'baseless' claims following Trump warning; Crude prices jump 19%WASHINGTON - Tensions are flaring in the Persian Gulf after US President Donald Trump said the United States is "locked and loaded" in response to a weekend drone assault on Saudi Arabia's energy infrastructure that his secretary of state blamed on Iran

I don't want war with anybody," Trump told reporters at the White House when asked if he wants war with Iran, which the Trump administration officials held accountable for the attacks on Aramco oil facilities that have halved Saudi oil output.When asked if Iran was behind the attacks, Trump said "it's certainly looking that way at this moment", seemingly distancing himself from his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who asserted on Saturday that it was Iran which launched this "unprecedented attack".He also said that Pompeo and others "will be going over to Saudi Arabia at some point" to discuss the incident

China was called a "thuggish regime" for even bringing this up — naturally, the "free press" was all crickets when it came time to do their purported jobs and speak a little truth to power. Because the US has the largest economy and military many times over, however, leaders who might otherwise speak out against this treatment stay silent. These clandestine activities used to be the sole purview of the Central Intelligence Agency, and when word got out the US' definition of "liberty" really meant "not being communists", quite a few people were furious

In October 1971, Kissinger returned to China for a publicly announced six-day visit to prepare an agenda for the meetings between Nixon and Chinese leaders and to work out the basic language for the communique that would be issued at the end of the president's trip

China's central bank has been letting market forces play a larger role in determining the yuan's exchange rate, and on Monday, when the yuan faced growing devaluation pressure under the latest US threat to impose 10 percent punitive tariff on $300 billion Chinese goods starting Sept 1, it went beyond 7 to the US dollar.

The airline said it "remains confident" MAX jets will be recertified for commercial service this year

Roy Cooper said about 800 people had remained on the island to wait out Dorian, which made landfall Friday morning over the Outer Banks as a far weaker storm than the monster that devastated the Bahamas.Nova Scotia officials asked people in the province to stay off the roads so crews could safety remove trees and debris and restore power

                             Recently, there have been attacks upon passing oil tankers in this area: it remains a matter of debate whether such attacks are conducted by pirates or are state-sponsored operations from a nearby country. A couple of centuries ago, Britain's Royal Navy led the armed opposition to pirates on the high seas, eventually reducing that maritime threat to life and international trade to a negligible level. It is simply not good enough for countries to leave it to the few, such as to China, Britain and the US, to combat piracy by deploying their warships whilst most countries contribute nothing to the battle

But thanks to its administration's political chicanery, the US could also quit the WTO to avoid following established global trade rules, which for some weird reasons it believes are detrimental to its economic interests. Not to mention that by quitting the WTO, the US would lose a whole lot of free trade treaties and the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism, which ironically the US helped set up and has benefited tremendously from

                            The Independent newspaper, meanwhile, says the United States Justice Department delivered a formal extradition request for Assange on Thursday, meaning further US charges against the WikiLeaks co-founder are unlikely.The US Justice Department is understood to have decided not to charge Assange in connection with his alleged exposure of some of the CIA's most secret spying tools, deciding instead to pursue one count connected to allegedly assisting former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in leaking information, and a 17-count Espionage Act indictment.Assange is serving a 50-week sentence in the UK for breaching the nation's bail conditions as a result of him claiming political asylum in Ecuador's embassy in London in 2012

                             According to veteran diplomats, interactions between China and the US in Shanghai, and what they have achieved in the city in past decades, are part of the two countries' shared legacy and are lessons that need to be passed on. "But at the time, political support within the US toward developing relations with China was not very strong, and many US politicians were unable to observe China's economic growth and social changes that had taken place," Wu added. Yuan Peng, a leading US expert and president of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that despite the Taiwan question, many new issues that emerged - including the Korean nuclear situation, the South China Sea, global economic governance and climate change - were not included in the landmark joint statements issued by the two governments in 1972, 1978 and 1982

It is also the ability to produce foreign designs, using domestic supply chains, that has allowed China to retain foreign knowledge that enters the country

                            So does John Bolton's departure from the White House suggest a change in US foreign policy?No matter what the answer is, the United States should reflect on its "America first" foreign policy over the past couple of years, which has heightened tensions and sparked frictions in many parts of the world.Because by the time Bolton became national security adviser — on April 9, 2018 — the US administration was already pushing ahead with its "America first" strategy, his departure is not likely to bring about any major changes in the US foreign policy.The dice were loaded against him, for he was not only opposed to letting up the pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and against the US president's suggestion of a possible meeting with the Iranian leadership, but also a likely cause of the failure of Washington-Taliban talks

                             In particular, since a large part of Johnson's leadership campaign focused on the possible post-Brexit deals with non-EU economies, it is possible that under his prime ministership, Britain will become the first European country to sign a free trade agreement with China.As an ideal opposition party leader, Corbyn didn't waste time in reminding the members of Parliament on Thursday that Johnson backed May's Brexit deal, saying: "Can he explain this flip-flopping?" And quoting US President Donald Trump's remark that Johnson was "Britain's Trump", Corbyn said that the failure to "take back control" ("Vote Leave" slogan during the Brexit referendum) could make the United Kingdom "a vassal state of Trump's America". "In the 98 days that remain to us, we must turbo-charge our preparations to make sure there is as little disruption as possible to our national life," Johnson said, referring to the Brexit deadline of Oct 31

                            Investors might ask this question: why don't we compare the valuation to 2008? Isn't the end of 2008, when the global financial crisis was growling, supposed to have the lowest historical valuation? Fact is, the valuation of the Hong Kong market in 2008 was even higher than the valley that appeared in February 2016. Although P/E ratio is more frequently cited in financial analysis, the volatility of earning, as it fluctuates from the top of the business cycle to the bottom, makes it unfit for a comparison that is made across many years.Depending on which gauge you use to value the market, valuations are either at the lowest level in many years or at least close to the lowest level of the past few decades

                            Three weeks earlier, on Aug 2, US President Donald Trump called the protests in Hong Kong "riots" and said that it is China's business how it handles the "riots" and therefore there was no need for him to offer any advice. In other words, how does Washington justify its double standards when it comes to street violence in the US and Hong Kong?The UK government has always been poking its nose into Hong Kong affairs.On June 19, the Speaker of US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, a longtime critic of China's human rights record, called the mass demonstrations in Hong Kong "a beautiful sight to behold", despite the fact that the "beautiful sight" soon turned into a freak show of extreme actions that rocked the global financial hub for the following two months

                             US National Security Advisor John Bolton said Huawei is a source of "Manchurian chips" during his visit to London early last week showing the US is still trying to prejudice other countries against Huawei. Although it might be the US suppliers of Huawei that care more about the outcome than the Chinese telecommunications giant itself, the US should not try to hold Huawei hostage to try and force China into agreeing to an unfair trade deal. Yet given the promise the US leader made in his meeting with his Chinese counterpart on the sidelines of the Osaka G20 Summit in Japan in late June that the issue of Huawei would be decided at the very end of the trade talks, it is to be hoped that the US does not go back on his word

The best solution to the current stand-off is for both sides to take a step back, which Iran already seems to have taken, and engage in talks, talks in which the US should not ask for too much

                            In what one expert called a "course adjustment" by the Trump administration, the US trade representative's office announced Tuesday that a planned 10 percent tariff on a range of Chinese imports would be delayed, sending the stock market soaring.Hundreds of companies testified in June against the new tariffs, and many warned that additional tariffs would raise prices at home and cost a loss of American jobs.The tariffs that Trump had proposed on Aug 1 would have been stacked on top of a 25 percent levy on about $250 billion in Chinese goods and would result in a duty on nearly everything the US imported from China

Since he reportedly discussed specific disarmament steps that the DPRK could promise at the Vietnam summit and corresponding measures the US would be willing to take, the bargaining on who will do what in return for what seems to be getting down to the necessary nitty-gritty.There appears to be a real need on both sides for the negotiations to move forward in order for such engagement to continue making sense

Thanks to the miracle of email and the internet, China Daily was able to catch up with Lam - a Yale-trained eye surgeon whose passion is the history of World War Two in China and whose novel, Two Sons of China (Bondfire Books) came out last year and was reviewed in these pages. Some of the best details available of Whittlesey's final mission and death come from Wilbur Peterkin's Inside China 1943-1945: An Eyewitness Account of America's Mission in Yenan (Baltimore: Gateway Press, 1992), Lam said

Iran, which has grown increasingly frustrated with the incompetence of the EU and some other signatories to protect its economic interests, announced last week that it was preparing initial steps to distance itself from the nuclear deal.

                            One wonders if anyone in the Foreign Office had briefed Raab that the "one country, two systems" is a constitutional principle that facilitated Hong Kong's return to China sovereignty since 1997. Instead, they exploited the unrest in Hong Kong by expressing concern over democracy and for the law-breaking protesters, while trying to discredit China by saying the country is preparing to break away from the framework that established the SAR and will take action, military ones if needed, to restore law and order in Hong Kong. Despite the fact that he expressed support for the SAR's high degree of autonomy under the "one country, two systems" principle and acknowledged that the protests were "not all peaceful", he went on to suggest that there was a "need to find a way forward through meaningful political dialogue"

                            On the heels of US President Donald Trump's $12 billion aid package to help American farmers who may suffer losses in the tariff dispute with China, several members in the US House of Representatives are backing a plan to help fishermen and the fishing industry.Jeff Bennett, an analyst at the Maine International Trade Center, said Maine sold at least $57 million worth of lobster to China last year. And while I'm glad that USDA (US Department of Agriculture) will offer aid to agricultural producers, the government needs to step up for others who have been harmed - especially fishermen," Pingree said in a statement

                            Higher tariffs as well as US restrictions on investment between the two countries will send the global trade and investment liberalization process that continued during the past century into a backwater, said Enrique Dussel Peters, coordinator of the Center for China-Mexico Studies of the National Autonomous University of Mexico.Andres Borquez Basaez, director of Chinese Studies Program at the Institute of International Studies with the University of Chile, said the world economy was an interdependent system and US-China trade friction would cause damage to developing countries.The trade friction will shrink global trade, risk threatening global economic growth, and weigh on the export-oriented Latin American economies, which already suffered from trade weakness, said Yue Yunxia, a scholar with the Institute of Latin American Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences

                             Washington's calls for reforming an economic system that has worked very well for China over the past 40 years seem absurd," O'Connell said.Christopher Bovis, professor of international business law at the University of Hull in the United Kingdom, noticed that as the US administration has maintained a US-centric trade policy with protectionist and nationalistic features, it has departed from the principle of free trade and embarked upon a series of trade wars with its major partners across the world, including China.As China published a white paper on Sunday denouncing US unilateral and protectionist measures, foreign business and trade experts said that protectionism must be avoided as it is shortsighted and will have an adverse effect on the global economy in the long run

                            China and the US need a fresh approach to get their economic relationship back on track, one built on mutual trust, a leading Wall Street expert on China said Tuesday.In previous, intermittent sessions over the 400-plus days of the US-China trade dispute, Chinese and US negotiators have built a structure for a potential trade deal.Roach stressed that no one is winning the trade dispute, adding that the US "is actually more vulnerable to a trade shock today", with trade equaling almost 30 percent of GDP versus 11 percent in the 1930s, when the US economy took a hit after the Smoot-Hawley tariff act

Representatives from Russia and the US were to meet in Geneva on Wednesday to explore a new accord to limit nuclear arms that could eventually include China, according to Reuters, which cited senior US officials who requested anonymity. Russia does not plan to deploy new weapon systems on the European part of its territory after the US withdrawal from the INF Treaty, unless new US missiles are installed in Europe, the Russian Permanent Mission to NATO announced after a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council in Brussels on July 5

                             How can we avoid going down the path of protectionism and possibly trigger a trade war with our most important trade partner? Congress should re-write US trade laws to insure more balance and fairness to replace the current laws that strongly favor one set of US companies over others. But there is also increased politicization of the regulatory process that is causing injury not only to foreign producers but also to US companies, who are becoming the victims of heavy tariffs. A key issue in the near future is making China a market economy country

A few years later, as China was opening up to the world, the same young man came to the American University in Washington to study and was welcomed as a regular guest at the Bonkers' apartment on many occasions.Although China at the time looked gray and backward with bicycles everywhere and facilities in dire condition, everyone on the trip could feel there was something powerful just waiting to be unleashed, Bonker says

                            The trip, which represents the two powers' common aspiration to strengthen military trust and reduce misunderstanding and misjudgments, came amid efforts by Beijing and Washington to build a new model for the relationship between great powers, the US' insistence on pushing forward its Asia-Pacific rebalancing strategy and increasing tensions over the maritime disputes in East Asia. Washington is caustic about the so-called lack of transparency of China's military spending, worried about China's development of new military equipment, uncertain about China's military strategic intention, and believes China is carrying out an "anti-access/area-denial" strategy, which poses a challenge to the US' military supremacy. The lack of military mutual trust might lead the two countries to fall into the historical trap of conflict between a rising power and an established power

                             According to the KPMG report, Australia is the second most favored country for Chinese investment, behind only the United States ($118 billion in 2015). The report also showed that while investment in agriculture was small, the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA), as well as pending deals for agribusiness firms such as S Kidman and Co, had paved the way for a leap in this year's figures.

                             Sneider said the symbolic significance of Trump's visit with Japan's new emperor cannot be underestimated, adding that the Japanese government's central goal in organizing this trip was to make sure that the US president was the first foreign leader to see the new emperor. Trump's two visits to Japan present windows of opportunity for Japan to strengthen its strategic position on the world stage, said Akimoto. Smith, senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a blog that the pomp and circumstance planned for this visit by Trump to Japan shows how important the leader-to-leader approach has been to Abe

An editorial in the Japan Times said the US and Iran are too entrenched and the changes demanded are too great. The newspaper continued that both Iran and the US have given Abe an opportunity to make the case for direct engagement, but all he can propose are general principles and vouch for the other side's good will
