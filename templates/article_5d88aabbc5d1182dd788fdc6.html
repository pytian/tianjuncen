            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Foreign capital in China is not only a great contributor to growth of China's economy and multinational companies but also a facilitator of cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries, experts said during a session on the World Trade Organization and foreign capital at the China Millennium Monument in Beijing on Wednesday.The session is part of an exhibition on the Chinese seal carving from Sept 10 to Oct 10, staged to mark the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.According to organizers, the exhibition is the first of its kind in China. More than 400 seals from professionals, teachers and students in primary and secondary schools and employees are on display.Those seals honor China's milestone achievements from 1949 to 2019, including the founding of New China, the start-up of RMB internationalization and the birth of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.They also remind attendees about inventions that are important for everyone, such as the Daxing International Airport, indica hybrid rice and new high-speed bullet train, Fuxing.Among them, three seals made by China's leading e-commerce platform XBN steal the spotlight. Xu Danxia, its chairman of the board, said during the session that a seal could be a product, which can sail far to the outside world."Culture should be first in the major boost for international trade," Xu said."It is a traditional way for Chinese people to record their commitments to others by carving a seal," added Long Yongtu,chief negotiator of Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic cooperation, the Ministry of Commerce's precursor. "The seal showcasing the event of China joining WTO reminds me of WTO's win-win strategy, which is already part of our ideology".Chen Deming, president of China Association of Enterprises with Foreign Investment, said foreign direct investment has been booming in China, totaling $2.1 trillion at the end of July 2018."Foreign countries have expressed their confidence in China's capability and China will open its door wider to welcome them, as always," Chen said.

                    US-initiated trade war with China dampens global economic growth: scholar
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                HOUSTON - The spillover of the US-initiated trade war with China will have a more serious impact on global economy, a US scholar has said.Jon R, Taylor, political science professor and department chair at the University of Texas at San Antonio, told Xinhua in an interview last week that the economic chaos being created between the two largest global economies has impacts on the world."While we may not notice it very much in the United States yet, other parts of the world are already noticing it, and they're going to notice it even more," Taylor said.The professor said the year-long trade dispute has hit American economy hard, especially the agriculture sector."I think in particular farmers in Iowa and other farmers throughout the Midwest are being seriously hurt by the tariffs. They are wrecking the livelihoods, not only of individual farmers but the corporate farmers as well," he said.He cautioned that if the trade friction continues, the United States "will be in a recession, probably sometime during the (US) presidential election year."Besides, he argued, the trade friction could also create political instability in the world."Economic instability leads to political instability, which leads to civil war, riots and political unrest," he said, adding that countries that are already going through hard times economically are more vulnerable to such impact.US President Donald Trump tweeted earlier that his administration would raise the 25-percent tariff already placed on $250 billion' worth of Chinese imports to 30 percent, and that the 10-percent tariff on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese goods scheduled for Sept 1 would go up to 15 percent. China also announced countermeasures.China on Monday announced that it had filed a case at the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the United States following Washington's recent tariff measures.The tariffs imposed by the United States severely violated the consensus reached by the two heads of state in Osaka, a statement released by China's Ministry of Commerce said, adding that China is extremely dissatisfied with and resolutely opposes the tariffs.

                    Importance of WTO highlighted: China Daily editorial
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                With the United States carrying out its threat to levy an additional 15 percent tariffs on the first batch of another $300 billion of Chinese goods on Sunday, the Ministry of Commerce filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization against the US on Monday for violating WTO rules.The US has imposed punitive tariffs on Chinese goods based on an investigation under Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, which empowers the US to take unilateral action against any country deemed threatening its national interests.Back in 1998, while settling the "banana trade war" between the US and Europe, the WTO dispute settlement mechanism ruled that the use of Section 301 is a breach of WTO rules, and the US later promised to strictly abide by it. But in its trade dispute with China, the US has yet again cited Section 301 as a "legal basis" to justify its long-arm jurisdiction and trade imperialism.That the US has long been violating WTO rules is widely known. But thanks to its administration's political chicanery, the US could also quit the WTO to avoid following established global trade rules, which for some weird reasons it believes are detrimental to its economic interests. In fact, the US president has on several occasions threatened to pull the country out of the WTO.But that may not happen at least until the US reaches free trade agreements with the European Union and Japan, which at the moment seem unlikely given the divergences between Washington and Brussels on automobiles, steel and other products, and the differences between Washington and Tokyo on agricultural products.By withdrawing from the WTO in a rush, the US will invite unforeseen troubles for its economy and cause an upheaval in domestic politics. Not to mention that by quitting the WTO, the US would lose a whole lot of free trade treaties and the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism, which ironically the US helped set up and has benefited tremendously from.Like many other international organizations, the WTO too needs reform to become more efficient and to better adapt to the changing global trade landscape. But that does not mean its free trade rules and dispute settlement mechanism are outdated.China has taken the right course of resorting to the WTO as part of its countermeasures against the US' "maximum pressure" tactics. It may take a long time to settle the case, but by approaching the WTO, China has shown its resolve to defend the multilateral trade system and a rules-based global trade order. Which highlights the WTO's importance, too, in the fight against unilateralism and protectionism.

                    Ministry: No plans to withdraw WTO complaint over tariffs

            <p class="style-content">
                China has not considered withdrawing the complaint against the US latest tariff move from the World Trade Organization, the Commerce Ministry said on Thursday, although a new round of trade talks is scheduled to take place next month in Washington.Gao Feng, the spokesman for the ministry, said the US tariff measures targeting Chinese imports seriously violate the rules of free trade and the multilateral trading system.China's complaint against the US at the WTO is a bid to protect the country's legitimate rights and interests, and to defend the multilateral trading system, Gao said.On Sept 1, part of the new additional tariffs recently announced by Washington on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods came into force. China took countermeasures on the same day, before lodging a complaint against the US under the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism.

                In a speech delivered in Brussels on Wednesday, outgoing European Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmstrom mocked the US president on trade without even mentioning his name. In the speech, titled Truths about Trade, Malmstrom, a veteran at European Union institutions, sighed that "we live in the age of government by Twitter", a reference to the US president, who less than a day ago attacked the EU on Twitter for treating the United States very "unfairly" on trade.She then explained the misconceptions about tariffs, such as the levying of tariffs target foreign businesses when, in fact, they target the consumers; and making a product at home saves money, strengthens the economy and creates jobs, which is a tempting argument but untrue. She also pointed to the big mistake people make in confusing a trade balance with a bank balance by interpreting exports as profits and imports as losses.This is what the US leader has said repeatedly in his speeches and tweets.

            <p class="style-content">
                The World Trade Organization's mission is to promote the sustainable development of economies using multilateral trade rules. But the capacity of different economies is different when it comes to participating in multilateral trade negotiations and making multilateral trade rules. Also, since many economies may be unable or unwilling to participate in such negotiations or in the making of such rules, the multilateral trade system could be undermined.Besides, whether an economy can benefit from the multilateral trade system depends on its own conditions including economic structure and technological level. Ignoring such differences among economies will result in unfairness, which would go against the original intention of the WTO.Developing countries lag behind developed countries not only in production and income levels, but also in other economic spheres. Since the multilateral trade system acknowledges the differences in the development levels of different countries and regions, its aim is to promote the development of developing economies.

                    Business expert: 'huge uncertainty' over trade rules
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                American and Chinese companies are facing a world of uncertainty due to the lengthy trade dispute, according to an international business expert."We are in an era of such a huge uncertainty right now over the trade rules. It's not good," said Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council."Companies need certainty. Without certainty, how can we do business?" he asked. That said, Allen said business was still strong for American companies operating in China.Allen spoke at a Vision China event —"China-US Relations: 40 Years & Beyond"— on Tuesday in New York at the Asia Society. It was hosted by China Daily and Bank of China."We have a glorious history. We have a mutual responsibility to ensure that the success of the past continues into the future," said Allen, a former US ambassador to Brunei Darussalam.Even with the trade tensions, US companies are still looking to China for its markets, talent, capital and rising middle class."China is 20 percent of the global population. It's growing over 6 percent," he said."And China this year will graduate about 1.8 million STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workers. That is a magnificent number," he said."It (China) is a very dynamic and innovative market," he told China Daily before the event.The US-China Business Council (USCBC) is a nonprofit organization of more than 200 American companies doing business in China.Allen said that more than 90 percent of its member companies are reporting profitability in the Chinese market in 2018."Thus far in 2019, it's been a pretty good year too," he said.According to a member survey this year, the bilateral trade tensions are overwhelmingly the top concern of American companies operating in China in 2019.US companies report that trade tensions are having a measurable impact on their competitiveness in the Chinese market, especially with domestic Chinese companies.More than 80 percent of American companies report that trade issues have affected their business operations in China, an 8 percent increase from the previous year."One worry is that the overall Chinese market seems to be slowing a little bit. Not dramatically, but there are weak parts of the Chinese economy that some of them are feeling more acutely than others," he said."The tariffs and the bilateral trade tensions are concerns for many of our companies, those who have supply chains going either from the US into China or from China into the US. Almost all of them would be affected by the tariffs," he said.Allen said it's natural that some companies are shifting supply chains out of China."However, more and more companies are investing in China where there are a lot of opportunities," he said."We encourage both governments to get back to the table to resolve the trade differences," he said. "Both of our governments are signatories to the WTO. We have a common framework; we have a common language. Let's resolve the problems in accordance to our commitments," Allen said."We believe we are not far away from that, but we just need to focus on the core problems and resolve them in a respectful, positive and constructive manner," he said."The US and China have got to reach a new understanding under which both countries can continue to prosper and to expand," he added.
