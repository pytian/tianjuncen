                Australia to cut migrant intake by 15 percent: PM
            </p>
            <p>
                 CANBERRA - Australian Prime Minister (PM) Scott Morrison has flagged permanently cutting the nation's annual migration intake cap by 30,000.In a keynote speech delivered on Monday night, Morrison said that he "expects" the maximum annual migration intake to be reduced from 190,000 as his government works to better manage population growth in "clogged" capital cities.The annual cap has been set at 190,000 since 2011 but under the current Liberal National Party (LNP) government Australia welcomed only 163,000 permanent arrivals in 2017-18, the lowest level in a decade."We're running 30,000 below where it has been ... It wouldn't surprise me if any process that we went through would arrive in that sort of territory," Morrison said on Monday night."I believe that this is likely to end up in revising down the permanent migration cap in Australia. That would be my expectation."The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in June revealed that Australia's population has grown by 3.75 million, or 17.9 percent, in the 10 years between 2008 and 2018.Net overseas migration (NOM) was the biggest driver of population growth in that period and the vast majority of new arrivals settled in either Melbourne or Sydney, the nation's two biggest cities.Morrison's government is currently considering a plan that would force new arrivals to live outside of those two cities for at least five years so as to boost growth in other regions.The PM on Monday night said Melbourne and Sydney were victims of their own success as cities and called for a "new discussion with state and territories and local governments about how we manage and plan for our changing population.""In Sydney, migrants accounted for around 70 percent of population growth last year. This has created its own pressure points and pressure points in population always manifest themselves in housing and infrastructure," he said."I'm very concerned about the rate of population growth ... not the existence of population growth, but the pace of population growth. The roads are clogged, the buses and the trains are full, the schools are taking no more enrolments ... We can hear that."Former PM Tony Abbott, a leading conservative within the LNP, has previously called for the cap to be reduced to 110,000 but Morrison, who was treasurer at the time, said doing so would cost the budget up to 5 billion Australian dollars over four years.Alan Tudge, the Minister for Cities, on Tuesday said reducing the cap by 30,000 would not have such a significant impact on the budget."Of course, the migration number has an impact on the budget figures," Tudge, who has been dubbed the "minister for congestion busting" by Morrison, told Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) radio."Migration brings growth, it brings skills, it brings younger people to cater for the older generation. So it's very important we maintain a strong migration intake.""But that's got to be balanced out with the population pressures, which particularly Sydney and Melbourne are feeling."Tudge said he plans to reduce his signature population policy early in 2019.

With a forecast of gusts topping 30 mph for the third round of the British Open on Saturday, the R&A finished its morning preparation of Royal Troon and decided not to cut or roll the putting surfaces in case the wind got out of hand. The greens were slower, though links putting surfaces typically are not fast.

                Suspense over this year's literature Nobel to end shortly
            </a>
            <p>
                Literary circles are abuzz with speculation ahead of Thursday's Nobel Prize announcement, with award watchers suggesting this year's honors in literature could go to a controversial writer such as Syrian-born poet Adonis. The academy is known for its cloak-and-dagger methods to prevent any leaks about its choice, resorting to code names for authors and fake book covers when reading in public. The list of nominees is never revealed and the jury's deliberations are kept secret. The suspense will come to an end on Thursday when the winner is announced, ending an unusually long wait. It comes a week later than usual "for calendar reasons", the Academy said in late September. "That leaves a little more time to speculate" about the 2016 laureate, jokes Swedish Academy member Per Wastberg. While perfectly in line with academy statutes according to Wastberg, some Nobel watchers have interpreted the late date as a sign of discord over this year's choice. "If you ask me, it's absolutely not a 'calendar' issue," says Bjorn Wiman, cultural pages editor at Sweden's main daily Dagens Nyheter. "This is a sign there's a disagreement in the process to select a winner." Mattias Berg, cultural reporter at Swedish Radio, suggests the academy's 18 members may have argued over a "politically controversial laureate, such as Adonis", whose most recent publication is a polemic tract on political Islam. "The prize would in such cases be seen as taking a stance," Wiman says. If the academy is indeed looking for a laureate who divides opinion, it may also have set its sights on Indian-born British author Salman Rushdie. In March, the academy denounced the Iranian fatwa on the author of The Satanic Verses, after a 27-year silence it attributed to its neutrality and independence. Literary critic Madelaine Levy at daily Svenska Dagbladet says only one thing was certain: We know that we know nothing about the academy's choice. "Year after year, the writers chosen are incredibly different," she notes. Some of the same names have been making the rounds for several years, including Ngugi wa Thiong'o of Kenya, Don DeLillo and Joyce Carol Oates of the United States and Haruki Murakami of Japan. Wiman meanwhile has his Nobel trifecta for this year: "I think it will be (Norwegian playwright Jon) Fosse. I'm hoping for (Israeli writer David) Grossman. And I would jump for joy for (the novelist using the pseudonym Elena) Ferrante." Amid all the speculation, the academy is remaining tight-lipped. "Some people want to know what's in the Christmas parcel and some people want to be surprised. We want to surprise you," says Swedish Academy director Odd Zschiedrich. Every year, the venerable tradition remains the same. In February, the academy makes a list of all of the nominations submitted before reducing it to a secret short list of five names in May. Throughout the summer, academy members study their works, before reaching a decision in October. Last year, the academy surprised everyone "by not surprising us", Wiman says. Belarusian writer Svetlana Alexievich, who won for her documentary-style narratives based on witness testimonies, was the favorite in both literary circles and on betting sites. This year, most observers say they are expecting a return to fiction. But Murakami, the big favorite among bettors and the public, is not considered a serious contender. Too superficial, is the unanimous verdict among the Stockholm literati. "There's room for a category of authors who haven't yet won", as was the case with the short story genre and Alice Munro, and Alexievich and her documentary style, according to Swedish Radio's Berg. Despite that, and even though novelists are those most frequently honored with a Nobel, he says he would love to see Joyce Carol Oates win. And, note many observers, more women ought to win the award. Since 1901, only 14 women have won, compared to 98 men. Others suggest it's time for an American laureate, the last one dating to 1993 when Toni Morrison was honored. "It's been a long time since an American author won the prize," Levy says. "The great American novel is underrepresented." But the academy insists its members do not consider gender or geography when selecting a laureate. "They're only interested in whether it's a skilled writer," Zschiedrich says.   Left: Syrianborn poet Adonis, a top contender for the Nobel literature prize this year.

                Colson Whitehead's novel The Underground Railroad won the Pulitzer Prize and the 2016 National Book Award for fiction. The book has been translated into 40 languages. [Photo provided to China Daily]Colson Whitehead explains how New York, post-traumatic stress and a long gestation helped shape his latest award-winning novel. Mei Jia reports.Colson Whitehead, this year's winner of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, who is on his first book tour in China, says he finds Beijing's roads too broad to make walking around enjoyable, but Shanghai, like New York where he grew up, is an incredible place to walk around."I love cities. They're fascinating," he tells China Daily at the hotel where he is staying in Beijing, a few hours before he joins poet Xi Chuan for a talk on the theme of cities."A city is sort of a calendar," Whitehead, 47, says. They chronicle their residents' lives and emotional history by, for example, "mapping a nice meal in Manhattan, or the corner where I broke up with my ex".For his novel The Underground Railroad, which has won multiple awards since it was published last year, Whitehead wanted to weave his hometown New York into the book, which was not that easy since it is set in the 1850s and tells the tale of Cora, a slave who makes a bid for freedom from the Georgia plantations using the underground railroad."I managed it with the main villain, Ridgeway. He is from New York," he says.The novel is his sixth, and, in his words, it has had "quite a year". It was a New York Times best-seller, won the Pulitzer and the 2016 National Book Award for fiction, and it has been translated into 40 languages. The Chinese version was published in 2017.It also got recommendations from Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey.The New York Times said he "told a story essential to our understanding of the American past and the American present".

                CANBERRA - Besieged Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's leadership looked doomed on Thursday after three of his senior ministers announced they had tendered their resignations and called for a second leadership vote.The ministers, who supported Turnbull in a leadership ballot on Tuesday against former home affairs minister Peter Dutton, said they had changed their position and now backed Dutton.Turnbull only won the Tuesday contest by seven votes. Dutton on Thursday publicly called for another leadership vote.Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, Turnbull's key cabinet supporter who tendered his resignation, said he now believed that Dutton was the best person to lead the conservative government to the next election, due by May 2019."I can't ignore reality," Cormann said as he announced he was withdrawing support for Turnbull, adding five other ministers who voted for Turnbull on Tuesday had told him they were changing sides."I can't ignore the fact that a majority of colleagues in the Liberal Party... are of the view that there should be a change," he said.Turnbull is unlikely to contest a second leadership ballot, Australian media reported on Thursday, making way for Treasurer Scott Morrison as a surprise challenger for the top job.Morrison has been a Turnbull supporter, but has reportedly long held ambitions on the prime ministership.Whoever emerges as Australia's next prime minister, they will become the country's seventh prime minister in a decade.Turnbull came to power in a party-room coup in September 2015 over former premier Tony Abbott, who also survived an internal leadership contest before his eventual defeat.A social liberal and multi-millionaire former merchant banker, Turnbull rode an early wave of popular support but he has struggled to appeal to conservative voters and only narrowly won an election in 2016.The ruling Liberal-National coalition government has consistently trailed the opposition Labor party in opinion polls, but Turnbull has remained the voters' preferred prime minister over Labor leader Bill Shorten.Australia's continued political instability has fuelled anger and frustration among voters and hindered investment by the business sector."For everybody in the country what is happening in Canberra is disappointing and frustrating. Business likes certainty and confidence in what happens in the future. Anytime we see uncertainty like is happening in Canberra it is not helpful," said Qantas CEO Alan Joyce.Reuters

                Aussie voters worn out by politicians
            </a>

                Elections should respond to will of the people instead of elites, analyst saysPolitics used to be taken seriously in Australia. Today, even with an upcoming general election, it is a sideshow, open to ridicule and contempt by ordinary Australians.Ng Yee-Fui, a law lecturer at Monash University in Victoria, said there is a perception among voters that democracy is failing them. Party membership is dropping in Australia as faith in politicians diminishes, she told China Daily."That is why you are seeing a rise in minor parties and independent politicians who are not aligned to any party," Ng said.The two men vying for the nation's top job - Scott Morrison of the Liberal National Party and Labor leader Bill Shorten - galvanize the nation with their policies and vision. But neither speaks with conviction, let alone sincerity.Michelle Grattan, one of the country's leading political commentators and professorial fellow at the University of Canberra, has been following politics Down Under for more than four decades."Australians are over their politicians," Grattan wrote recently on the nonprofit news site The Conversation."All the stridency, the bad behavior, the lying, the relentless campaigning, the judgment by opinion poll, and the media shrillness have taken their toll on the tolerance of the average voter."She said it does not make a difference which side wins the federal election on May 18, as the incoming government will "inherit a bitter, skeptical, exhausted electorate".Grattan added that the election will be fought in "this climate of unprecedented public distrust of politics and cynicism about its practitioners".Much of the disillusionment has been "turbocharged" by the bipartisan cannibalism that has toppled multiple prime ministers in a remarkably short period.The last six years of the Liberal National government has seen three prime ministers: Tony Abbott (2013-15); Malcolm Turnbull (2015-18) and Morrison, the current prime minister.A survey by Griffith University last year found that Australians no longer trust their politicians or the country's political institutions. They believe politicians and officials use their positions to benefit themselves or their families, or to favor businesses and individuals in return for political donations or support.For the average voter, the closest they will ever get to a politician, including their own elected members, is on television or via a flyer through the mailbox. There was a time when people would wander from door to door canvassing voters. Not anymore.Politicians are reluctant to meet the masses on home turf unless their "spin doctors" think it can be controlled - which means no embarrassing questions.Politics today is stage managed by the political elites, and the grassroots hardly get a look in. This means there is little room to deviate or think for themselves anymore.Michael Daley, the former New South Wales Labor leader, learned this recently when a week from the state election, someone released a tape of a remark he made in a bar in which he said Asians with PhDs were taking jobs from "our kids". That was enough to cost him the election."The major parties are no longer holding all the cards," said Ng. "Independents and minority parties are chipping away at their electoral base."She said there is also another question that many people are now asking: "What do the main parties stand for today?'Professor John Uhr from the School of Politics and International Relations at the Australian National University in Canberra was more cautious when he told China Daily: "I don't think they (voters) have given up on politics as such."True, there is a lot of discontent with the political class today, but I think voters are buying time ... they are giving the politicians notice to become more responsive to the will of the people rather than the political elites who seem to control things."Uhr said: "There is something in national politics today (in Australia) which is dispiriting. People are not happy with the circulation of leaders and we have seen this with both the major parties. It weakens and cheapens politics."He noted, however, that he does not "buy the line that people have lost interest in politics". Uhr said at the last general election the informal vote was around 5 percent, which "was quite high".He conceded that politics has become "cheapened", and it has opened the doors to independents and groups like GetUp.Activist organization GetUp has pulled together A$12.5 million ($9 million) to solicit clear statements from individual candidates on where they stand on issues, such as coal mining and climate change, to gain support for the group on polling day.One member of GetUp spoke to China Daily on condition that her name not be used."Politics in Australia no longer speaks for the people. It speaks for the elites of this country," she said."Here we are - a rich country where kids go to bed at night hungry. There is no big picture for the future, just the promise of 'you vote for me'."

                Climate change key poll issue in Australia
            </a>
            <p>
                Australians will go to the polls on Saturday to elect the 46th Parliament. It is fair to say that even before Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the date on April 11, the treasurer's budget speech and opposition leader Bill Shorten's budget reply the previous week were the opening shots of the campaign. Both speeches laid bare the ground on which the two major parties would do battle. While the election has been touted by some in the media as a "climate referendum", Morrison himself stated that this election would be about trust - "Who do you trust to deliver that strong economy which your essential services rely on?" The campaign is now largely over, with little time left before election day. The advertising has been relentless, and the campaign apparently hard fought. Shorten's Labor Party has enjoyed a lead in opinion polls, as it has done for much of the time since the last election in 2016. Polling during the campaign has seen the Labor Party remaining consistently ahead, at between 51 and 52 percent of the vote. While being behind at the beginning of an election race is not fatal to a party's chances, it is always better to be in front, so the Labor Party will be feeling confident going into this election. The campaign has been largely fought between the two party leaders, Morrison for the governing Liberal Party, and Shorten for the Labor Party. Morrison and his strategists have clearly decided he is the best person to carry his party's message, and so he has kept his ministers on a tight leash. Whether intended or not, this appears as though he lacks trust in them. Shorten, on the other hand, has felt confident enough to use his shadow ministers to sell the party's message. The key policies being fought over have largely been those of the Labor Party. Since the beginning of the year, Shorten has been announcing policies, which Morrison and the Liberal Party have been waging a rearguard action against. Whether it is climate change, assistance for cancer patients, adjustments to the tax system or economic management, the key debates have been between Labor, a party that wants change, and a Liberal Party that thinks everything is fine as it is. What do we know about the two leaders and their policies? Morrison secured prime ministership following what might be called a "palace coup" against his predecessor Malcolm Turnbull in October 2018. Turnbull's own ascension was via the same manner, over Tony Abbott two years previously. A question of democratic legitimacy still hangs over Morrison's head. For Shorten this is less the case, having been elected to lead the Labor Party after Kevin Rudd's election defeat in 2013. Shorten has led his party since the last time they were in government, and he came close to toppling Turnbull in the 2016 election. His party considers this election as his best chance to win power. Of the other parties in the election race, the Greens and One Nation are both likely to do best among a large crop of minor parties. The Greens have again called this election a "climate referendum", while the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - an intergovernmental body of the United Nations, dedicated to providing the world with an objective, scientific view of climate change - announcements suggest the time for climate action is short. The Greens would cancel the Adani coal mine, expand public health provision under Medicare, and remove university education fees. Pauline Hanson's One Nation, and the smaller Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party, have capitalized on what they see as neglect of rural and regional Australia, and the pandering of Australian governments to overseas interests. While not explicitly racist, Hanson's party has argued that the country should dramatically cut immigration. The race is nearly over, but as the old adage goes, "A week is long time in politics" - so we will just have to wait until election night to really know who will govern Australia into the century's third decade.

                Nobel laureate Toni Morrison dead at 88
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW YORK - Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, a pioneer and reigning giant of modern literature whose imaginative power in Beloved, Sula and other works transformed US letters by dramatizing the pursuit of freedom within the boundaries of race, has died at age 88.Publisher Alfred A. Knopf announced that Morrison died on Monday night at Montefiore Medical Center in New York after a brief illness."Toni Morrison passed away peacefully last night surrounded by family and friends," Morrison's family said in a statement through the publisher. "She was an extremely devoted mother, grandmother, and aunt who reveled in being with her family and friends. The consummate writer who treasured the written word, whether her own, her students or others, she read voraciously and was most at home when writing."
