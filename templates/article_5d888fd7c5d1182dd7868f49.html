                Making financing easily accessible to African women is critical if the continent is to attain the sustainable development goals or SDGs, Giovanie Biha, the deputy executive secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa, said on Tuesday.She was speaking in Marrakesh, Morocco, at an event to discuss the African Women Leadership Fund, ahead of the fifth Africa Regional Forum on Sustainable Development.Biha said adopting the right actions to integrate gender in Africa's economies will result in financial inclusion as well as guarantee women's economic empowerment and achievement of the SDGs, thereby helping transform the face of the continent.Failure to integrate gender equality and women's empowerment into national economies has cost African countries a combined $95 billion in lost productivity annually, according to the UNECA's Women's Report published in 2013.She said the African Women Leadership Fund aims at strengthening the economic empowerment of women and accelerating the emergence of African women fund managers who in turn will invest in and develop women-led businesses and micro businesses.Over the next decade, the fund is expected to make an investment of up to $500 million in African-owned and women-led companies.Moumina Houmed, Djibouti's minister of Women and Family Affairs, said the story of women and finance is similar in every African country. Her country has launched more capacity-building programs to further expand women's participation in building the economy."In family-owned businesses, women's earnings are much lower compared to their male counterparts. We have very few women entrepreneurs on the continent because of the hurdles to accessing finance. As such, the fund seeks to lower these hurdles faced by women-owned businesses, promote investments in micro enterprises and take women's cooperatives to the next level," said Nabila Freidji, a Moroccan entrepreneur and member of the AWLF committee.Thoko Ruzvidzo, the director of the Gender, Poverty and Social Policy Division at UNECA, said funds will be earmarked for each of the five regions of North Africa, East Africa, Central Africa, West Africa and Southern Africa, with a strategy being established for each region to address unique elements of the markets, or to reflect priorities for each region.Priority would be given to women-led businesses. At least 65 percent of capital will be invested in women-led companies.Leila Rhiwi, a representative of UN Women in Morocco, emphasized the importance of women accessing finance to bolster their businesses, saying they have already proven themselves as entrepreneurs and drivers of the economy.The high-level meeting was attended by representatives of the Moroccan business and financial ecosystem, government officials, senior women executives and young women entrepreneurs, among others.

                    Proposal envisions shared energy grid

            <p class="style-content">
                An alliance for building stronger China-African ties and pursuing win-win cooperation in the energy sector through an integrated African grid was proposed in Beijing on Tuesday.The strategic platform - the African Energy Interconnection Sustainable Development Alliance - was proposed by the Republic of Guinea and the Beijing-based Global Energy Interconnection Development and Cooperation Organization, or GEIDCO."To promote the sustainable development of Africa, it is crucial to take energy as the core issue, give full play to the advantage of rich resources and promote clean development and energy transition," Liu Zhenya, chairman of GEIDCO, said at the African Energy Interconnection Development Forum.Liu called on all parties concerned to put more efforts into African energy interconnectivity, a project whose aim is to form a massive electricity grid on the continent powered by renewable sources.The project will provide a strategic solution for accelerating the sustainable development in Africa, Liu said.Alpha Conde, president of Guinea, said that while Africa is rich in natural resources, making full use of them for sustainable development is a major problem facing many countries, including Guinea.The construction of an interconnected African grid will help promote the use of clean energy, connect local electrical grids and accelerate the development of mineral resources and deep processing industries, he said in a video presented at the forum.The forum is a major event of the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. It was organized by GEIDCO, the African Union Commission and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). More than 400 participants attended the event.At the forum, GEIDCO released a new report - African Energy Interconnection Planning Research. It analyzes the opportunities and challenges of sustainable development in Africa, and provides a set of solutions to connect energy resources.According to the report, the construction of backbone grids in Africa can be carried out in three stages. It is estimated the ambitious project will cost $2.9 trillion by 2050, of which the investment in clean energy would account for 86.9 percent.Zhou Xiaofei, deputy secretary-general of China's National Development and Reform Commission, said many African countries have seen great changes in industrialization and agricultural modernization thanks to Chinese investment and technology sharing.In the future, China and Africa will join hands in deepening cooperation and explore more opportunities in the energy sector, he said.

                However, infrastructure deficit may hinder the progress of building AfCFTAChinese entrepreneur He Liehui boarded a flight to Ghana and visited Africa for the first time 18 years ago. Now his businesses have landed on more than 20 African countries, after knocking on the door of each market one by one"The process was extremely difficult, due to a lack of understanding of the culture and laws of different African countries," said He, founder and president of the Touchroad International Holdings Group, a multinational business engaging in international trade, cultural exchanges, tourism, and special economic zone construction in Africa.To cite a few examples. His T-shirt business failed in Ghana, he lost large amounts of money when he first entered Nigeria, and he also had other experiences, like escaping from an arsenal explosion and stray bullets.African countries all have different rules and regulations, and each market has its unique features. The experience of doing business in one country could hardly be copied in another, said Tang Xiaoyang, a researcher on Africa studies at Tsinghua University in Beijing."Having many scattered markets has long been an important factor that makes it difficult for traders and investors to expand their business on the African continent, and hinders the economic development of Africa," he said.However, the grand plan of building the African Continental Free Trade Area will definitely bring great economic momentum to the continent when it is completed.The AfCFTA was first signed in March of 2018 by 44 countries that pledged to boost intra-African trade by removing trade barriers, increasing investments in industrialization and infrastructure expansion and consequently creating jobs for the world's fastest growing labor force.So far, 49 of the African Union's 54 member states have signed the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement, and 13 countries have ratified it, while 12 others are in advanced stages of obtaining parliamentary approval for ratification, according to the AU.A minimum of 22 countries are required for the AfCFTA to come into force.Once realized, the AfCFTA will create the biggest trading bloc in the world - 1.2 billion people with a GDP of over $3 trillion, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.It will buoy consumer spending to about $1.4 trillion in 2020 and increase intra-Africa trade by as much as $35 billion per year, or 52 percent above the baseline, by 2022, UNECA says.Under the AfCFTA, the phasing out of tariffs will be applied gradually over five years for developing countries and 10 years for the least-developed ones. For sensitive products, there is an even longer phaseout period of 10 years for developing countries and 13 for the least-developed.Currently, intra-Africa trade has been low, at about 16 percent of the continent's total exports, compared with intra-Asia trade, at 59 percent, and intra-Europe trade, at 69 percent, according to UNECA. Moreover, local manufacturers have faced the highest tariffs globally, at 6.9 percent, when trading within Africa.AU Director for Trade and Industry Treasure Maphanga said that industrialization and infrastructure are at the core of the AfCFTA. Currently, 42 percent of intra-African trade is made up of manufactured goods.The AfCFTA will also bring better opportunities to partners outside the continent."For us, the AfCFTA is a sensible solution. It is good for Africa; it is good for our partners," she said.He Wenping, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that a single market has long been a target for the continent, as African countries long for integration."In Africa, the markets are segmented and each of them are relatively small, which makes it difficult for the continent to realize industrialization, " she said. "A single market will benefit industrialization, and industrialization will also push forward the development of a single market."She said some regional organizations have already made great progress in facilitating regional free trade in the recent years, including the East African Community.Five East African countries - Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda - resolved to boost economic integration and continental trade facilitation by making trade between them and other countries cheaper, faster and simpler on Dec 13.In a joint statement issued in Nairobi, the five countries vowed to implement trade facilitation reforms including reducing "non-tariff barriers" such as burdensome and incompatible product regulations.He said, however, that the process will not be easy, as the economic development in different countries in the continent are at different stages."When countries are of similar levels of economic development, it will be easier to make unified tariff policies and even fiscal policies, but when they are at different levels of development, a single market will be more difficult to realize," she said.For example, as a free trade area supports the free flow of labor, then a country that is at a much higher level of economic development in Africa might be worried that labor forces in a neighboring poor country might all want to rush into its market.Currently, the infrastructure deficit is still common in many African countries, and the lack of railway or flight networks between neighboring countries could also hinder the progress of the building of the AfCFTA, she said.Lucie Morangi and Xinhua contributed to this story.

                Continental FTA is slated to launch in May, but non-tariff barriers may persistDecline in trade in the intra-East Africa Community, Africa's most dynamic regional economic bloc, is casting doubts over the takeoff of the soon-to-be-established Continental Free Trade Area, according to experts.The speed at which governments are resolving obstacles, however, may be an indication of commitment to drive the integration agenda that would create the biggest free trade market in the world. Expectations are high that the agreement will enter into force in May.Last March, 44 African countries signed the CFTA agreement to create a single market for goods and services, with free movement of people and capital. Once enforced, it would create a market of more than 1.2 billion people with a rapidly growing middle class and a combined African GDP of $3.4 trillion under the CFTA, more than that of India, which had a GDP of $2.6 trillion in 2017.The free trade zone has the potential to boost intra-African trade by 52.3 percent by 2020, according to UN Economic Commission of Africa. For this to be achieved, countries need to eliminate import duties, and to double this trade, non-tariff barriers will also have to be cut.Albeit posting an average growth of almost 6 percent over the last decade, intra-EAC trade has fallen from $3.5 billion in 2013 to $2.4 billion in 2017, according to a research carried out by the Regional Office for Eastern Africa of UNECA in September 2018.It conclusively proved that the five countries－Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi－are collectively trading with itself at half its potential level, said the report.Experts blame the underperformance on non-tariff barriers, calling them protectionist and discriminatory rules that largely persist especially in the agricultural sector. This is in addition to poor policies to stimulate expansion of the manufacturing sector at a rate equal to or faster than the broader rate of economic growth."Most of the obstacles experienced in the region are compounded by protectionist policies," said Robert Kagirian adjunct lecturer at the Institute of Diplomacy and International Studies, University of Nairobi. "Although there have been efforts to reduce them, fresh ones keep emerging," said the economist.During the recent EAC heads of state summit in Tanzania, a report on the status of long outstanding non-tariff barriers showed that at least 45 had been resolved, 17 were outstanding while two were chronic.Peter Mathuki, chief executive officer of the East Africa Business Council, said this was a vote of confidence to the integration process. "We are on stable grounds," he said. "I believe that the success of the EAC will inform the CFTA," he said.He revealed that residents in the region still pay higher prices for goods, negating the benefits of the regional block. The barriers are intertwined, he said, and one cannot be resolved independent of the other. He points to delays at the borders, different standard quality checks that attract taxes and additional costs such as storage. "There are better ways to resolve this and that is why the business community is pushing for more engagement at the decision-making level."In the summit, the leaders resolved to strongly support the entrepreneurs, saying the spirit of the region remains private-sector led.Karigi refuted claims that the EAC integration momentum is losing steam. "The focus previously has been on policies. It has, however, become obvious that policies will be implemented by the private sector. And this is where we are at the moment."He noted that the success of the CFTA will be built on success of the regional economic blocs. "The CFTA will not replace the current blocs, but rather build upon them and ensure greater harmonization and coordination between them. It is imperative, therefore, for the blocks to have high intra-trade before opening their borders to others."

            <p class="style-content">
                The much awaited Africa Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA), which is expected to scale up intra-trade, will finally come into force after The Gambia ratified it on Tuesday.It is the 22nd country to so. The agreement, enacted one year ago by 44 African heads of state and governments in Kigali, Rwanda, needed a minimum of 22 countries to ratify for it to come into effect.The CFTA seeks to create the largest trade zone in the world. According to UN Economic Commission of Africa (UNECA), it is expected to increase intra-African trade by 52 percent by the year 2022 and remove tariffs on 90 percent of goods.Lamin Jobe, Gambia's trade Minister, while presenting the motion before lawmakers said it will address the country's international trade difficulties."This document will definitely serve as a take-off point to enhance the free movement of people, good and services. By using this there is a lot of advantages that we can gain from the implementation of this agreement," he said.Celebrating the occasion, Vera Songwe, the executive director of UNECA called it a golden moment, on her twitter handle. "Breaking geographic, logistic & regulatory barriers #theafricawewant @ECA_OFFICIAL @_AfricanUnion @AUTradeIndustry @ATPC Impossible until it is done" N. Mandela'."Albert Muchanga, the commissioner for Trade and Industry at the Africa Union also took to his twitter account. "Good news! The Parliament of The Gambia has APPROVED ratification of #AfCFTA Agreement making us meet the minimum threshold. The AfCFTA market is being born and is one step ready for launch of its operational phase in July this year."The CFTA is expected to remove trade barriers, increase investments in industrialization and infrastructure expansion and consequently create jobs for the world's fastest growing labor force.

                    Africa urged to speed up digitization
                </p>

                UN report says more investments are needed to prop up network facilitiesAfrican countries should speed up their digital transitions to raise more financing for the continent's development, according to a recent report by the United Nations Economic Commission of Africa, or UNECA.Vera Songwe, executive secretary of UNECA, said Africa's annual growth is underperforming and the continent faces real possibilities of falling short of meeting the sustainable development goals by the target date of 2030."We should be growing at 10 percent annually to raise domestic resources that are urgently needed to achieve transformative growth," she said.The report, Fiscal Policy for Financing Sustainable Development in Africa, said an increase of 12 percent to 20 percent in tax collection could raise up to $400 billion annually and go a long way toward filling the $600 billion financing gap Africa faces. In 2018, Africa's average government revenue ratio was 21 percent of GDP and tax revenue ratio was 15 percent.Pundits and policy makers agree that the mass adoption of digital services by consumers, enterprises, and governments would rapidly accelerate economic growth and move the continent closer to catching up with the rest of the world. However, the process faces serious headwinds including huge infrastructure deficit, governance and cybersecurity.A report by management consultants Booz & Company estimated that despite an unfavorable global economic climate in 2011, digitization provided a $193 billion boost to world economic output and created 6 million jobs globally. About $8.3 billion was injected in Africa's GDP in addition to creating more than half a million jobs in the same year, according to the UNECA.Some countries are already reaping the fruits of digitization. Rwanda has raised revenues by 6 percent while South Africa has reduced compliance costs by 22.4 percent and lowered the time to comply with the value added tax by 22 percent, according to the report."Digitization has the greatest potential to influence trade and productivity in Africa," said Adam Elhiraika, head of macroeconomics and governance division at the UNECA.Africa should expect to see further success stories as more countries get converted to digital methods, which make it easier than ever to reach hard-to-tax domains such as agriculture, the informal sector and the digital economy itself, he added.Omobola Johnson, former Nigerian minister for Communications Technology, said there is enough evidence that Africa can be digitally transformed. "But what is holding us back?" she asked ministers in Marrakech, Morocco."Affordability is an issue: The internationally agreed target is for 1 gigabyte of data to cost no more than two percent of the average national monthly income. In Africa this currently stands at 9 percent, compared to 4 percent in Latin America or 2 percent in Asia. And the latest affordability reports show that this has increased over the past year," she said.More investments are urgently needed to prop up infrastructure and fiber network. Currently when connecting Cape Town in South Africa to Khartoum in Sudan, the connection will hop via London, New York, San Jose or Tokyo to arrive in Khartoum 409 milliseconds later.Private sector participation in the sector needs to be taken a notch higher through innovative government policies, she said. "And this would also apply in capacity building to develop a pool of skilled talent that can turn the continent into the world's digital talent pool in the same way that China became the world's factory, through a large labor force and targeted government policy."Young entrepreneurs are already using digital solutions to drive up trade and domestic revenue collection. Axel Emmanuel Gbaou, an artisan chocolatier and founder of Instant Chocolate, based in Cote d'Ivoire, said he sources from more than 100,000 women farmers and buys their cocoa beans. He then manufactures and sells the bars of chocolate."I have sourced for markets using various e-platforms available in the country. This has increased visibility of locally manufactured products, translating to sales," he said.His products are slated to be showcased in Paris later this year.

                    UNECA chief hails role BRI to play in Africa's infrastructure, job creation
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                ADDIS ABABA - Vera Songwe, executive secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), hailed the role that the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) would play in addressing Africa's problems in infrastructure and job creation.Songwe told Xinhua on Wednesday in an interview that the BRI will positively affect hundreds of millions of people in different countries, while it helps Africa develop infrastructure connectivity of varied types and create job opportunities that are pressing issues on the continent.Proposed by China in 2013 to promote common growth and gain shared benefits, the BRI involves infrastructure development, trade and investment facilitation and people-to-people exchanges aimed at improving connectivity on a trans-continental scale."This (BRI) is probably one of the biggest growth and development initiatives that we have in the world," the UN official said, noting the BRI is essential to the continent.She believes that the initiative, with the participation of many African countries, is particularly important because "infrastructure today is one of the necessary requirements for Africa's growth."The overall cost of infrastructure in Africa is around 130 billion U.S. dollars, Songwe estimated, saying that the initiative, a bid to enhance regional integration from policy to finance, will help boost the region's infrastructure construction.Since its proposal in 2013, the BRI, which envisions a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe, Africa and beyond, has created economic opportunities and boosted common development among a number of countries.The planned African free trade area will create a market covering around 1.2 billion people, she said, expecting the initiative to make more contribution to the continent's trade facilitation."Essentially when we talk market, we talk goods, we talk transportation," she said, adding that the BRI could help African countries move those goods much faster.The free trade area was outlined in the African Continental Free Trade Agreement signed by over 40 African countries in March 2018. According to the UNECA, the agreement will boost intra-African trade by 52 percent by 2022.

                    Tech startups try to change African healthcare

                Benin platform makes patient histories readily accessible, KEA founder saysThree years ago, a patient died following an allergic reaction from antibiotics administered by a 25-year old Beninese doctor, Arielle Ahouansou. It then dawned on Ahouansou that knowing the patient's medical history might have improved the outcome and informed her decision. She decided to develop a solution that would make critical medical information readily accessible to doctors.With a seed capital of $1,000, in 2017 she founded KEA Medicals, a platform where a patient's medical data is interfaced with hospitals' systems using a digital identification code. Patients create a personal identity using their mobile phones and doctors can then input information about pertaining to a patient's allergies, chronic diseases, blood type and contact person during hospital visits.This was among inventions by young people that were showcased during the first Africa Business: Health Forum, held at the sidelines of Africa Union Summit in Ethiopia early this year. The event brought together government leaders, entrepreneurs and international health organizations to discuss how technology can lower costs as universal healthcare is scaled up in Africa.Africa has a health financing gap of $66 billion per annum and accounts for less than 2 percent of the nearly $9.7 trillion spent globally, according to World Health Organization. The continent accounts for 16 percent of the global population and 26 percent of the disease burden.Following underinvestment in the sector occasioned by competing priorities and donor fatigue, millions of Africans are inadvertently pushed into poverty by high medical bills. Africans pay about 36 percent of total healthcare expenditure from their pockets, according to the UN Economic Commission of Africa, or UNECA.African governments are betting on technology to accelerate equitable access to quality healthcare while addressing costs. By embracing the KEA Medical platform, Benin has driven the uptake. Eight months since its launch, more than 72,000 people and 10 hospitals in the country are using the platform, said KEA founder Ahouansou.She explained that by registering in the platform, a universal medical identity in the form of a QR code is generated, which is then imprinted in bracelets, or patches that cost $4 and $2, respectively. Doctors can then scan and access patient's medical history.The solution saves 40 percent of doctors' time, safeguards patients' healthcare, makes hospitals 40 percent more efficient and cuts down 20 percent of insurance costs, she said."It provides a low-cost solution for Africa to cut down on healthcare costs while enhancing quality of healthcare," Ahouansou said. "It can be used anywhere and so we are looking at reaching Cote d'Ivoire and Senegalese markets."The health forum in Ethiopia sought to promote public-private partnerships. With a booming population growth, Africa's health market is estimated to be $259 billion. It will be the second largest after the United States in 2030, estimates UNECA.Adama Kane, founder of JokkoSante, a Senegalese tech company, has developed a solution that would enable people to return unused medicines and help them purchase urgently needed drugs at a subsidized rate.Underpinned by the slogan, "One man's trash is another man's treasure", the platform enables people to earn points from returned drugs, which they can redeem in their next purchase of drugs. It has netted pharmacists, international organizations and the community to make medicine affordable and accessible."About 80 percent of Senegalese do not have health insurance. The situation is compounded by having some medicine not being used and ultimately expired. This is expensive for low-income families," said Kane.Success at home has fueled the desire for JokkoSante to reach 40 African countries by 2030 and manage 15 percent of health payments in pharmacies. "The pilot project is already tried and tested. It is ready for launch," Kane added.
