                AYBAK, Afghanistan -- A total of 12 militants including Mawlawi Noorudin, the shadow governor of Taliban for the northern Samangan province, were killed as fighting aircraft struck the armed outfit's hideout in the relatively restive province on Sunday, army spokesman in the region Mohammad Hanif Rezai said."Acting upon intelligence report, the fighting planes targeted a hideout of the Taliban rebels in Dara-e-Suf Payan district Sunday morning, killing 12 rebels including Mawlawi Noorudin, the shadow governor of Samangan province," Rezai told Xinhua.Without providing more details, the official said the security forces would continue to chase the insurgents elsewhere in the province.Taliban militants have not made comments on the report yet.

                    ’Trilateral diplomacy’ prevails at China-Pakistan-Afghanistan meeting
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                At a critical moment when the US canceled the “peace process” in Afghanistan, a trilateral meeting was held between Afghanistan, China and Pakistan, on Sept 7 in Islamabad. It is the third round of trilateral talks focusing on regional peace, cooperation, stability and friendship between the three countries, all of which share borders.Foreign Minister of Pakistan Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Foreign Minister of Afghanistan Salahuddin Rabbani and State Councilor and Foreign Minister of China Wang Yi came together to discuss regional issues and challenges. They worked hard to reach a common strategy to face challenges jointly.While closely following recent developments in the region, the three reiterated their support for a politically negotiated settlement of the prolonged conflict in Afghanistan, to take war off the talbe. All took note of the cancellation of peace talks between the US and the Taliban. They expressed hope intra-Afghan negotiations would begin soon and lead to full cessation of violence. They underlined the need for an inclusive, pure, Afghan-led peace process leading to a comprehensive agreement for durable and sustainable peace and stability.Their commitment to further strengthening relations was confirmed by advancing connectivity under the Belt and Road Initiative, the Regional Economic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan and other regional common economic initiatives. It was agreed to explore “China-Afghanistan-Pakistan plus” cooperation, as well as working toward promoting trade and connectivity projects between Afghanistan and Pakistan, such as the Kabul-Peshawar Motorway. In the future Afghanistan may be included in CPEC, becoming a beneficiary of BRI. It may also be granted membership in SCO.China, under the Belt and Road Initiative, is ready to support the construction of refrigeration storage, clinic centers, drinking water supply schemes and immigration reception centers at checkpoints between Afghanistan and Pakistan to facilitate the movement of people and trade activity among the two countries. It will generate great opportunities for people-to-people contact and help promote understanding and eliminate mistrust.Games and sports will be promoted among the three, and bring the countries close to each other. Public diplomacy will be promoted. An Archaeologists' Exchange Program will be organized to explore cooperation among Red Crescent Societies of the three countries, along with regularly undertaken exchange projects in other areas.China, Afghanistan and Pakistan reiterated their strong resolve to fight common enemy — terrorism and extremism in all its forms. They reaffirmed the commitment of not letting any terrorist organization, element or individual use their soil. It was also decided the countries would work toward effectively implementing the trilateral Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in Counter-terrorism, signed at the second round of Trilateral Foreign Minister Dialogue held in Kabul. The three also agreed on a list of initial projects of enhancing counter-terrorism cooperation, recognized the need to continue their joint fight against the “East Turkestan” Islamic Movement and stayed committed to countering terrorists’ logistical capabilities.It was decided to hold the fourth round of this dialogue in Beijing next year in 2020. The first was held in Beijing in 2017, the second in Kabul in 2018 and the third was in Islamabad this year. It seems it will become a routine feature to promote close contacts among three friendly nations.Zamir Ahmed Awan is a sinologist and non-resident fellow at the Center for China and Globalization.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                    Rocket blast at US Embassy in Kabul on 9/11 anniversary
                </p>
            </a>

                KABUL, Afghanistan — A rocket exploded at the US Embassy in Afghanistan just minutes into Wednesday, the anniversary of the 9/11 attack on the United States.A plume of smoke rose over central Kabul shortly after midnight and sirens could be heard. Inside the embassy, employees heard this message over the loudspeaker: "An explosion caused by a rocket has occurred on compound."About an hour later the all-clear was given, with no injuries reported.There was no immediate comment from Afghan officials or those with the NATO mission, which is also nearby.It was the first major attack in the Afghan capital since President Donald Trump abruptly called off US-Taliban talks over the weekend, on the brink of an apparent deal to end America's longest war.Two Taliban car bombs shook Kabul last week, killing several civilians and two members of the NATO mission. Trump has cited the death of a US service member in one of those blasts as the reason why he now calls the US-Taliban talks "dead."The 9/11 anniversary is a sensitive day in Afghanistan's capital and one on which attacks have occurred. A US-led invasion of Afghanistan shortly after the 2001 attack toppled the Taliban, who had harbored Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaida leader and attacks mastermind.In the nearly 18 years of fighting since then, the number of US troops in Afghanistan soared to 100,000 and dropped dramatically after bin Laden was killed in neighboring Pakistan in 2011.Now about 14,000 US troops remain and Trump has called it "ridiculous" that they are still in Afghanistan after so long and so many billions of dollars spent.It is not clear whether the US-Taliban talks will resume.AP

                    Trump says peace talks with Taliban are now 'dead'
                </p>

                WASHINGTON - Peace talks between the United States and the Taliban are now "dead", US President Donald Trump declared Monday, two days after he abruptly canceled a secret US meeting he had arranged with Taliban and Afghan leaders aimed at ending Washington's longest war. Trump's remark to reporters at the White House suggested he sees no point in resuming a nearly yearlong effort to reach a political settlement with the Taliban, whose protection of al-Qaida extremists in Afghanistan prompted the US to invade after the Sept 11, 2001, plane attacks on the US. Asked about the peace talks, Trump said: "They're dead. They're dead. As far as I'm concerned, they're dead." It's unclear whether Trump will go ahead with planned US troop cuts and how the collapse of his talks will play out in deeply divided Afghanistan. Trump said his administration is "looking at" whether to proceed with troop reductions that had been one element of the preliminary deal with the Taliban struck by US presidential envoy Zalmay Khalilzad. "We'd like to get out, but we'll get out at the right time," Trump said. The Taliban on Tuesday vowed to continue fighting against US forces in Afghanistan, saying the US would regret abandoning negotiations. "We had two ways to end occupation in Afghanistan, one was jihad and fighting, the other was talks and negotiations," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said. "If Trump wants to stop talks, we will take the first way and they will soon regret it." What had seemed like a potential deal to end Washington's longest war unraveled, with Trump and the Taliban blaming each other for the collapse of nearly a year of US-Taliban negotiations in Doha, Qatar. The insurgents are now promising more bloodshed, and US advocates of withdrawing from the battlefield questioned on Monday whether Trump's decision to cancel what he called plans for a secret meeting with Taliban and Afghan leaders at the Camp David, Maryland, presidential retreat over the weekend had poisoned the prospects for peace. "The Camp David ploy appears to have been an attempt to satisfy Trump's obsession with carefully curated public spectacles - to seal the deal, largely produced by special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban negotiators, with the president's imprimatur," said John Glaser, director of foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, a think tank. Trump has been talking of a need to withdraw US troops from the "endless war" in Afghanistan since his 2016 presidential campaign. And he said anew in a tweet on Monday: "We have been serving as policemen in Afghanistan, and that was not meant to be the job of our Great Soldiers, the finest on earth." He added, without explanation: "Over the last four days, we have been hitting our Enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years." US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Trump's weekend moves. "When the Taliban tried to gain negotiating advantage by conducting terror attacks inside of the country, President Trump made the right decision to say that's not going to work," Pompeo said on Sunday. Trump said he called off negotiations because of a recent Taliban bombing in Kabul that killed a US service member, even though nine other US citizens have died since June 25 in Taliban-orchestrated violence. But the emerging agreement had started unraveling days earlier after Afghan President Ashraf Ghani postponed his trip to Washington and the Taliban refused to travel to the US before a deal was signed, according to a former senior Afghan official. As Trump's reelection campaign heats up, his quest to withdraw the remaining 13,000 to 14,000 US troops from Afghanistan remains unfulfilled - so far.

                    Bolton's exit doesn't signify policy change: China Daily editorial
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                The dice were loaded against him, for he was not only opposed to letting up the pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and against the US president's suggestion of a possible meeting with the Iranian leadership, but also a likely cause of the failure of Washington-Taliban talks.But that he would be fired for being a foreign policy hawk, a trait for which he was made the US national security adviser, is something very few imagined.So does John Bolton's departure from the White House suggest a change in US foreign policy?No matter what the answer is, the United States should reflect on its "America first" foreign policy over the past couple of years, which has heightened tensions and sparked frictions in many parts of the world.In June 2017, Washington withdrew from the Paris climate accord, undermining the global efforts to fight climate change. In May 2018, it pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal, which was reached after intensive talks among major world powers to ease tensions in the Middle East. The heightened tensions that followed the US' decision almost sparked a war.And last year, it unilaterally imposed additional tariffs on imports from various countries, especially China. Accusing China of forced technology transfer, it refuses to see reason and has instead intensified the trade row.Worse, in violation of the three Sino-US communiqués, Washington has continued to sell arms to Taiwan, increasing uncertainties across the Straits. It has also beefed up its forces in the Asia-Pacific region, with its navy frequently transgressing Chinese waters in the name of freedom of navigation.In its desperate attempts to "make America great again", the US administration has resorted to trade protectionism, throwing the world economy out of gear. And Washington's "maximum pressure" and unilateral actions, from sanctions against Iran to tariffs on Chinese goods, are threatening overall global stability.Because by the time Bolton became national security adviser — on April 9, 2018 — the US administration was already pushing ahead with its "America first" strategy, his departure is not likely to bring about any major changes in the US foreign policy. Let us be clear: Bolton was fired not for being a foreign policy hawk, but because of his disagreements with the US president on some major issues.That the US administration will realize the harm it has caused to the world and change its ways is a welcome thought but too good to be true.

                    Doubt casts on Afghan election as insecurity intensifies
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                KABUL -- The increased Taliban onslaught and deteriorating security have spelled fear among the war-weary Afghans ahead of presidential polls.An Afghan presidential election hopeful has asked for postponement of the upcoming presidential election, believing people would not attend the process due to the harsh security situation.The Sept 28 poll will be the fourth presidential election in Afghanistan since 2001, when the United States invaded the country following the Sept 11 attacks, ousting the Taliban regime.Addressing a gathering of his election campaign, Ibrahim Alokozay citing the critical security situation, said that "holding an inclusive and transparent election was impossible under the current deteriorating security."According to him, the poll results would not eventually be acceptable if the process was held under the current circumstances.The countdown for the upcoming poll has already begun, particularly when the United States canceled the talks with the Taliban, after the militants' claimed suicide car bombing that killed two foreign soldiers, including an American, and 11 others in the Afghan capital Kabul.The Taliban militants intensified fighting across the country after US President Donald Trump tweeted that he has called off negotiations with the Taliban group, blaming it for having no power to continue the peace process.Some Afghan citizens cast doubt on the election process and say people would not dare to join the polling centers for tough security reasons."We are facing growing insecurity, everywhere is fighting, people will not dare to go to the voting centers and I will not attend the process," Daud Nejrabi, a Kabul resident told Xinhua, adding that the peace process must be resumed to have a possible peaceful and inclusive presidential election in the country.Another Kabul resident and a government employee, Suraya Raiszada said she dares not to go to the election polls as Taliban militants have warned to target anyone who goes to vote."We are receiving death threats on a daily basis, from the militants in big cities and districts as well, in case we attend the presidential election. The security must be strengthened and the security of polling stations must be guaranteed before the polls," she said, hoping the security forces could remove all security challenges for the people to attend the election.Taliban militants have boycotted the election, warning they will disrupt the process.The extremist group has attacked three provincial capitals and overrun several districts within the past two weeks, causing heavy casualties on security forces and civilians.Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani and election commission officials are consistently emphasizing that the vote would be held on the scheduled date and that the militants did not have the ability to disrupt the process.Meanwhile, Afghanistan's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Adela Raz has recently said that the Afghan government was committed to holding a transparent, free, credible and inclusive election.Some 9.6 million eligible registered voters are expected to cast ballots in more than 5,300 polling centers across the country.

                    Taliban kill 48 as pre-poll violence mounts
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                KABUL, Afghanistan - Taliban suicide bombers killed at least 48 people and wounded dozens more in two blasts on Tuesday - one at a campaign rally for the president and the other in Kabul - with the insurgents warning of more violence ahead of Sept 28 elections.The first attack saw a motorcyclist detonate a suicide bomb at a checkpoint leading to a rally where Afghan President Ashraf Ghani was addressing supporters in Parwan Province, just north of the capital, killing 26 and wounding 42.Just over an hour later, another blast also claimed by the Taliban rocked central Kabul near the US embassy. Authorities initially did not give casualty figures, but later said 22 people had been killed and a further 38 wounded.The explosions came after US President Donald Trump, following a previous deadly Taliban blast, abruptly ended talks with the extremists earlier this month over a deal that would have allowed the United States to begin withdrawing troops from its longest war.In a statement sent to media claiming responsibility for both of Tuesday's blasts, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the attack near Ghani's rally was deliberately aimed at disrupting the Sept 28 ballot."We already warned people not to attend election rallies. If they suffer any losses, that is their own responsibility," the statement said.At the scene near Ghani's rally, roughly an hour's drive north of Kabul, the remains of a burned motorcycle, with a body on top, were covered by a blanket, next to a badly damaged police car.Women and children were among the casualties, Parwan hospital director Abdul Qasim Sangin said.The president was unhurt. He later condemned the attack, saying the incident proved the Taliban had no real interest in reconciliation."As the Taliban continue their crimes, they once again prove that they are not interested in peace and stability in Afghanistan," Ghani said in a statement.Sixty kilometers away in Kabul, a shopkeeper, Rahimullah, said he had been sitting inside his shop when the second blast came."The wave broke all the windows," he said."I rushed outside and saw several bodies just across the street. This is the second time in less than a month that a blast has broken our windows. I just fixed them a week ago."The UN's mission in Afghanistan also criticized the Taliban, accusing them of showing "despicable disregard for civilian life & fundamental human right to participate in democratic process".These and other attacks "demonstrate blatant disregard for the people and institutions of Afghanistan," US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement."For Afghans to truly reconcile, the Taliban must begin to demonstrate a genuine commitment to peace rather than continue the violence and destruction that causes such inordinate harm to the Afghan people and the future of their country," Pompeo said.The elections will see Ghani face off against his own Chief Executive, Abdullah Abdullah, and more than a dozen other candidates.For weeks, the election had been sidelined by the US-Taliban talks, with many Afghans and observers expecting the vote to be canceled if a deal was agreed. Even candidates did little in the way of campaigning.But with the deal off, Ghani and his rivals have begun the race.Ghani is seeking a clear mandate to negotiate with the insurgents on a lasting peace in Afghanistan.Trump's declaration that the US-Taliban talks were "dead" spurred the insurgents to declare last week that the only other option was more fighting.Agencies

                 QALAT - The death toll of a car bomb on Thursday that rocked Qalat city, the capital of southern Afghanistan's Zabul province, has risen to 20, with over 93 others wounded, provincial government spokesman Gul Islam Sayal said."Twenty people lost their lives and 93 others wounded in the car bomb that hit a hospital in Qalat city today morning," Sayal told Xinhua.Earlier, Interior Ministry spokesman put the number of casualties at 15 dead and 66 injured.Sayal said the target of the militants was the civilian hospital and all the victims including women and children are civilian people.Taliban outfit has claimed responsibility for the blast and in contact with media claimed that a suicide bomber targeted the provincial office of National Directorate of Security or the country's counter-intelligence agency, inflicting huge casualties.Sayal rejected the Taliban claim, saying all the victims killed in Qalat's attack Thursday morning are the innocent civilians.The armed group which has stepped up activities mostly in the shape of suicide bombing has also claimed responsibility for the deadly bombings that claimed scores of lives in Kabul, Charikar and Jalalabad cities over the past week.
