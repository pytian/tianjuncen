                 YOKOHAMA, Japan - China and the United States both recorded their fourth successive wins at the FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup on Wednesday. World champions Serbia defeated Argentina 3-1, as the South American side, along with Cameroon and Kenya, still await their first win of the tournament.Zhu Ting, MVP of the last World Cup, kept her 20-plus scoring streak with 20 points, and Li Yingying added 11 in China's 25-19, 25-21, 25-19 victory over the Dominican Republic, for whom 21-year-old Jineiry Martinez top-scored."Our players have become more mature compared with last year's World Championship. They were able to keep their composure when faced with difficulties on court," said China coach Lang Ping.The USA also won, with a 25-23, 25-18, 25-19 victory over the Netherlands extending their unbeaten record at the tournament.Jordan Larson and Kelsey Robinson tied for a game-high 16 points for the Nations League champions, while Lonneke Sloetjes was the most prolific Dutch player with 10 points."We knew it would be tough today. The Netherlands are a great team. I think we got better as the match went on. I'm really proud of my team for staying in it and grinding through. It was an all-around team effort," captain Larson said after the match.With the victory, the USA sits second in the table with 12 points, level on points with China who remains top with a superior set quotient. The Netherlands fell to third, three points behind the two leaders.Elsewhere, Russia cruised to a 25-18, 29-27, 25-12 win over a South Korean side that rotated its starting line-up and benched Kim Yeon-koung, top scorer of the last World Cup. Nataliya Goncharova had a game-high 14 points for the winning side."We had strong attacks, good serves and blocks and I think that's why we were able to win today," Irina Koreleva told Xinhua after a game in which she managed three blocks.Captain Ana Bjelica had 29 points to spearhead Serbia's 25-15, 23-25, 25-23, 25-23 triumph over Argentina. Jelena Blagojevic, returning from an injury she picked up at the European Championships, added 14. Daniela Bulaich Simian scored a team-high 16 points for Argentina."Before the game, we knew it would be a tough match because Argentina have good defense and blocking, and we were prepared for a longer game, and it was a really long game. I'm really happy some players who didn't play from the beginning came back. Blagojevic did a great job and gave us some opportunities in attack and defense," Bjelica said.African teams Cameroon and Kenya remain winless at this year's World Cup, with Cameroon losing 25-17, 25-17, 25-20 to host nation Japan, while Kenya came up short against Brazil, going down 25-20, 25-17, 25-14.The 12 participating teams will play their last match in Yokohama and Hamamatsu on Thursday before moving to Sapporo and Toyama on Sunday.

                    Why more African students choose Chinese universities
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                On Friday, Sept 6 I arrived at Central China Normal University to begin my doctoral degree studies in international relations. I was among the over 200 Kenyans who had received Chinese government scholarships to pursue higher education in different academic fields in China.While speaking earlier on behalf of the beneficiaries during the reception ceremony at the Chinese Embassy in Kenya, I was struck by the sheer number, energy and curiosity of the students. This view was dramatically reinforced when we arrived at the university. Over 300 students from 80 countries thronged the science hall for the welcome address. Data from the university indicates that a total of 2,200 foreign students are currently enrolled at the university, making it one of the most international institutions in Central China's Hubei province.According to China's State Council, Beijing received the first batch of 33 foreign students from Eastern European countries in 1950. This number of international students would astronomically rise to hit 407,000 from 160 countries at the turn of the century.Closely tied to China's reform and opening up policy of 1978, internationalization of the country's higher education sector has tremendously hoisted its academic, technological and innovation capacity. This has created a strong pool for African students, who now prefer China to other countries for higher education.Fundamentally, China has leveraged its research and academic institutions in its rejuvenation agenda. The resulting knowledge, innovations and technologies have immensely contributed to China's economic rise, poverty alleviation and global prestige.These factors have created incentives for individuals, corporations and countries to learn from the Chinese experience in the search for sustainable solutions to the many socio-economic challenges in different parts of the world.In his goodwill message, Tom Amolo, the political and diplomatic secretary of Kenya's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urged the 2019 Chinese scholarship beneficiaries to prioritize learning in order to be effective agents and contributors to Kenya's development aspirations upon their return.China has been a longtime ally of Kenya in people-to-people exchanges and development. From 1982, nearly three decades before China became Kenya's largest trading partner, and construction and development projects financier, Beijing was already supporting human capacity development through targeted scholarships. Today, more than 2,400 Kenyans are studying in China.Chinese enterprises operating in Kenya are estimated at 400 and have equally been actively engaged in knowledge and technology transfer to the locals, besides providing sources of income. A 2017 McKinsey survey into the operations of 1,000 Chinese enterprises in Africa revealed that two of every three African employees in Chinese enterprises had received skills upgrading.As China and Kenya continue to work closely towards the actualization of the Belt and Road Initiative, I hope that additional opportunities for skills and knowledge transfer will arise to benefit more Kenyans.With formal registration for my studies now behind me; it is time to get down to business and give this lifetime opportunity the deserved meaning. I hope to decode the academic, technological and cultural nuances that make China the new knowledge capital of the world. And while I'm at it, I hope to leverage the time at Central China Normal University to develop useful linkages with Chinese nationals, as well as students drawn from other countries.The world has increasingly been flattened by technology into a tiny village. While this has enhanced the diffusion of ideas, technologies, products and services, it has also created new challenges, like the raging trade dispute between China and the United States. Such frictions carry significant implications for all countries, Kenya included.It is for this reason that I am more than proud to study international relations at this point and in a renowned Chinese university.Adhere Cavince is a PhD student in international relations at Central China Normal University.Twitter: @Cavinceworld.WeChat: Cavinceworld.

                    Guangzhou Customs focus on travelers using their bodies to smuggle drugs

                Guangzhou Customs has vowed to introduce more effective and concrete measures to prevent people from smuggling drugs inside their bodies as the number of such cases increases.Zheng Jun, deputy director of the Bureau of Anti-Smuggling of Guangzhou Customs, said there has been a reduction in the number of drug smuggling cases involving passengers' carry-on bags and mailed items after great efforts have been made to crack down on such methods."But cases involving the use of human bodies as vessels to smuggle drugs now represent a bigger part of the total drug smuggling cases investigated and fought by Guangzhou Customs in recent years," Zheng said at a news conference in Guangzhou on Wednesday.To this end, Customs departments in the southern metropolis will strengthen cooperation and exchanges of information with foreign counterparts in the fight against the smuggling method to prevent drugs from entering the country and to help construct a safe, social environment, Zheng said.Li Si, a senior customs officer with the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, said customs officers from the airport, one of the three busiest in the country, have investigated nine cases of people using their bodies to smuggle drugs in the first eight months of the year."More than a dozen kilograms of drugs have been seized after cracking down on such cases," Li said.On Aug 30, customs officers found an Angolan man and woman with dozens of small bags of suspected drugs inside their bodies during CT examinations at a hospital after they detained the pair, who arrived at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on the same flight.The man later discharged a total of 60 pills of suspected drugs while the woman discharged another 80. All told, the contents weighed nearly 1.7 kilograms.The pair admitted to using their bodies to smuggle drugs when the pills they discharged were later confirmed to contain cocaine.Between January and August, Guangzhou Customs officers detained 15 suspects in 38 drug smuggling cases and seized 17.3 kilograms of various drugs. Marijuana and cocaine are the drugs most often seized by customs officers."We will never relax our vigilance fighting against drug smuggling, which has been the top priority of the customs department," Zheng said.Zheng made his remarks after Guangzhou Customs on Wednesday burned 312 kilograms of various drugs seized by customs officers in recent years. The drugs included 201.6 kilograms of khat, a plant that is a fairly mild narcotic.Khat is mainly planted in Ethiopia, Kenya and other African countries, as well as some nations in the Arabian Peninsula.Other drugs that were burned include heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana, Zheng added.

                    Milk bank saving tiny lives in Kenya
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                When Roseline Kwamboka gave birth to a baby girl seven years ago, ill health affected the flow of her breast milk and this left her baby starved and crying incessantly. It took another three weeks for her to recover. By then, her baby had dropped a lot of weight.To make up for the shortage, they had turned to baby formula, which was costly. It also took time for the baby to adjust from bottle to breast feeding afterwards, in what is referred to as nipple confusion.Asked if she would have agreed to feed her baby human milk that was not hers, Kwamboka does not hesitate. "If it would have nourished her, I would have done it immediately," said the mother of two.Presently, new mothers with premature or sickly babies do not have to undergo this experience anymore. Kenya's health ministry and PATH, a US-based nonprofit health organization, launched the region's first human milk bank at Pumwani Maternity Hospital in Nairobi city in April.The facility is targeting babies who have no access to human milk because their mothers may be sick, unable to produce breast milk or dead, or because the babies were abandoned.The move supports a global campaign by the World Health Organization promoting exclusive breastfeeding of newborn babies for six months.According to the global health body, one of the leading causes of death among children under five in 2017 was preterm birth complications. More than 60 percent of these deaths are in Africa and South Asia. Furthermore, preterm babies make up 12 percent of babies born in KenyaAccording to research by the African Population and Health Research Center, 44 percent of newborns in urban health facilities were separated from their mothers for varying periods of time. This ranged from less than an hour to more than six hours and even days after birth.Of these infants, only 14 percent were fed the mother's own milk during separation. Thirty-six percent of the newborns were not fed anything during this period and an additional 23 percent were fed formula or cow's milk."There is very strong evidence on the innumerous benefits of human milk. It reduces the risk of diseases and infections such as respiratory tract infections. Infants are also able to better tolerate human milk than baby formula. This is especially acute in newborn babies," said Beatrice Marube, a nutritionist at the Pumwani Maternity Hospital.The facility has been receiving at least 15 donors daily. Most of them have babies at the newborn unit, who are preterm or sickly. Therefore, after routinely feeding their babies, they would then donate the surplus at the milk bank.The stream of donors matches the baby-feeding times. The mothers would come after every three hours starting at 10 o'clock in the morning. Donors are assisted by supporting staff on how to use either electric or manual breast pumps.Prior to becoming a donor, the new mother undergoes counseling in a bid to determine their psychological fitness. She also goes through laboratory screening to test for HIV, hepatitis and syphilis. A clean bill of health adds her to the donor list."We also counsel them on their nutrition so that they are healthy throughout their stay in the hospital," said Marube. On average, they stay in hospital for five days."We have seen an upsurge in the number of voluntary donors. We have also seen a high uptake in the number of recipient babies as their mothers agree to feed them with the milk. We do not store this milk for long," said Faith Njeru, a nurse manning the station.She attributed the uptake to the strict screening tests done on the milk to ensure it is free from conditions that are transmissible through breast milk. It is tested before and after pasteurization to kill microorganisms, ensuring its nutritional composition is not altered and that it is safe for vulnerable babies.Before storing in a freezer, the milk is put in 50 milliliter bottles. "This curbs waste as the babies feed small amounts at a time," said Njeru. Priority is given to sick preterm babies, preterm babies, sick term babies and, last, a term baby without access to its mother's milk. Milk that is not used is discarded.The impact of the facility is already evident. Marube, the nutritionist, said the length of hospital stay for both mothers and babies has been tremendously reduced. The recovery period for the babies has also improved.On the other hand, the hospital has been able to significantly reduce the costs incurred in purchasing formula milk to cater to these babies. Geoffrey Mosiria, the hospital administrator, revealed that the hospital was spending $24,000 annually. "This has been cut down to zero," he said.He added that besides the facility expanding the range of services it offers to mothers, it has also opened it up to more partners. The mortality rate has also been reduced drastically."We are looking forward to scaling up our reach and supplying other hospitals with the milk. Once the pilot program is over, probably next year, we will then work on the logistics," he said.Mosiria said it will take time before they start receiving milk from donors already at home. Safety checks and storage are also a critical component in the supply chain and this cannot be guaranteed yet he said. "But I am sure we will reach there," he added.The Kenyan project has borrowed from milk banks in South Africa and Scotland.

                    My first Mid-Autumn Festival in China
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                I just marked my first Mid-Autumn Festival celebration in China. Exactly a week after arriving for my graduate studies, I was kind of nostalgic- memories of past experiences back in Kenya with family and friends swapping scenes in my mind. In the morning of Friday 13, the atmosphere on the Central China Normal University (CCNU) grounds was very upbeat. Chinese students explained to us the importance of the day as gifts of mooncakes and osmanthus wine were exchanged.Then came the night. The full moon dangled precariously in the sky. Like it was about to fall; as millions of eyes looked at it with reverence. Unlike previous nights, a cool breeze swept through the campus; and for the first time, I felt this liberating spirit. With African music playing on my headphones, a danced my way, floating in the wind, and forgetting myself for a moment.The feeling was so wonderful. Perfectly aligned with nature while tapping into the human exuberance around me.As I settled back into my hostel room, I was intrigued by the festival's idea. My curious mind nudged me online where I stumbled upon the poem Prelude to Water Melody, by the renowned Chinese writer Su Dongpo.This poem succinctly captured what I was going through. The message and the tone both resonated with my feelings. Writing to his family, Su wondered what time it was back at home. Given the time differences between China and Kenya, I was constantly trying to figure out what time it was back at home.Riding the wind, there I would fly, goes a line in the poem. I too remembered how, with arms wind open, I chided the Wuhan breeze to lift me off the ground.Finally, Su asks his family to join him in celebrating the timeless perfection of a full moon in a cloudless night. What a way to finish. I, too, was hoping that all was well with my family. That despite the distance and anxiety that comes with not seeing or hearing from a loved one; we were all flourishing under the watch of the full moon.There was more. The poem speaks to the singularity of humanity. That geography is no barrier to shared destiny. Human experiences; though expressed in symbolic languages of the world converge where it matters the most.And while we may go away from home, as happens from time to time; the family remains the most important unit to our productive existence. As the Chinese used the holiday to reunite with the loved ones, the Kenyan community in CCNU also got together, shared a meal and walked the streets of Wuhan under the neon lights.As I write this, a day after the Festival, I cannot help but look forward to the next. Thanks to the Chinese friends whose generosity and candor played out to make me and a horde of other foreign students experience unforgettable 2019 Mid-Autumn Festival.The Writer is a PhD Student of International Relations at Central China Normal University. The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                    Time for Tsai to read the writing on the wall: China Daily editorial

                That her refusal to accept the 1992 Consensus that there is only one China and instead curry favors with the United States, which in reality can be no one's friend, would come back to haunt her was obvious. But rather than waking up and realizing it was a shadow she and her ruling party were following, she continued to dream of "independence".Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen's failure to realize her follies, apart from souring relations across the Taiwan Straits, has also cost the island seven "diplomatic" partners, the latest being Kiribati.Despite the constrained cross-Straits ties causing serious economic difficulties, Tsai and her Democratic Progressive Party could not see the light. As a result, the island's economic performance has continued to weaken, in part due to falling revenue from tourism which thrived for eight years before Tsai assumed office in 2016 thanks to record numbers of visitors from the Chinese mainland.Tsai didn't realize the foolishness of choosing the perilous path of "independence" even when the DPP suffered a humiliating defeat in the local elections last year. But even before getting the electoral shock, Taiwan had been receiving consular blows.Less than a year after Tsai assumed office, Sao Tome and Principe cut off official ties with the island to establish diplomatic relations with Beijing. The African island country was followed by the Dominican Republic, Burkina Faso, El Salvador and Panama. On Monday, the Solomon Islands became the sixth country to sever ties with Taiwan since Tsai took office, followed by Kiribati on Friday.Tsai believes, wrongly though, that her tough stance against Beijing will help her get re-elected next year, without realizing her flawed policy has done little to improve the island's economy and people's livelihoods despite the island's economic growth declining from 2.89 percent in 2017 to 2.69 percent last year. This year's growth forecast is even lower.Tsai and her party, in trying to strengthen their ideological hold over the island, are actually destroying the one thing Taiwan compatriots were proud of: economic prosperity. The situation across the Straits could not be more different, as Beijing's focus is on qualitative economic growth and improving people's livelihoods.The United Nations and the international community accept that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government that represents the whole of China, and that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China.Unless Tsai and her DPP acknowledge this essential fact, the island's economy will continue to suffer, partly because of the strained relations across the Straits, and the Taiwan administration will continue to be isolated, because the developments of the past years suggest Kiribati's decision could trigger a domino effect.

                    Promoting global development cooperation
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Developing countries have emerged as impressive forces with profound influence in international development cooperation, and China has become one of the major players in this field.China began providing material assistance to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Vietnam in 1950. And in 1964, it announced the Eight Principles of Foreign Economic and Technical Assistance, featuring equality, mutual benefit and no conditions.After the resumption of its legitimate seat in the United Nations in 1971, China established economic and technical cooperation with more developing countries, which helped build major infrastructure projects such as the Tanzania-Zambia Railway. With the launch of reform and opening-up in 1978, China's economic cooperation with other developing countries evolved from simple assistance to various forms of mutually beneficial cooperation.Series of pragmatic initiatives launchedIn recent years, China has successively launched a series of pragmatic initiatives by, for example, rolling out 10 major China-Africa cooperation plans, establishing the South-South Cooperation and Development Institute, setting up the South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund and the China-United Nations Peace and Development Fund, and initiating the BRICS Economic and Technological Cooperation and Exchange Program, in order to contribute Chinese wisdom to such issues as poverty alleviation, disease prevention and control, climate change mitigation, capacity building and humanitarian assistance.In the past seven decades, China has provided more than 400 billion yuan ($56.36 billion) of assistance to more than 160 countries and international organizations, trained more than 12 million people from developing countries, and implemented more than 5,000 foreign aid projects.With the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative and the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and BRICS New Development Bank, and especially with the founding of the China International Development Cooperation Agency in April 2018, China's international development cooperation has become more and more institutional and influential. Over 70 years, China's foreign aid has gradually transformed from relatively simple forms of capital and material support to diversified forms of assistance.Belt and Road Initiative and UN 2030 AgendaSince it was proposed six years ago, the Belt and Road Initiative has transformed from a blueprint to reality, and has been included in a UN document, receiving the endorsement and wide support of the international community. By May this year, 131 countries and 30 international organizations had signed cooperation documents with China on the initiative.The Belt and Road Initiative fits perfectly well with the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union's Agenda 2063, and has expanded South-South cooperation. The initiative has also helped many developing countries clear bottlenecks on growth, which could help them better integrate their markets with the global market.In more than one sense, the initiative's five priority areas-policy coordination, infrastructure connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial cooperation and people-to-people bond-are linked with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

                    Digital technologies could boost public services in African countries
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Africans may benefit from improved public services - and reduced corruption - if advocates of digital technology persuade governments across the continent to embrace change.Sam Yongo, chief executive officer of MC Telecom, a telecommunications operator in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, said the digitization of public services could help African countries fight corruption, a blight that has held back economic growth and undermined good governance and social development."When documents and services are digitized, it's difficult to illegally alter them, especially when specific technologies like blockchain are used," said Yongo, referring to the electronic ledger system that underpins some digital currencies.He believes that African countries yet to begin digitization processes should first invest in basic digital infrastructure and adopt policies aimed at facilitating growth in the sector. Cybersecurity, Big Data, artificial intelligence and overall capacity building should be priorities, he said.Cavince Adhere, a researcher and PhD student of international relations at the Central China Normal University, said digital technologies have the potential to bring efficiency and accountability to public services in Africa, Adhere said."Regardless of the stage of development of a given economy, the additional investments in digital technology increase the economic value to citizens," he said.Adhere said Rwanda, Nigeria, Tanzania and Kenya are African countries are using technology to improve public service delivery.Kenya has greatly increased its collection of public revenues, while cutting bureaucratic red tape, corruption and generally stripping out inefficiencies, he said.Through the country's e-citizen portal, as well as online procurement platforms, ordinary people and businesses can access government services without the need to deal with civil servants.The portal has more than 4 million registered users and clocks up 500,000 transactions a month, according to GSM Association, a trade body that represents mobile network operators worldwide.Additionally, 200 types of digitized services are being offered nationwide through establishments known as Huduma Centres.In Kenya's capital Nairobi, motorists can pay for parking spaces electronically, and online channels are also available for payment of household utility bills.Rwanda also has been making strides. In 2015, the government launched an e-government platform dubbed Irembo.The platform handles 88 government services, including Mutuelle, a community-based health insurance program, along with those relating to immigration and emigration.Irembo has more than 2 million registered users and transactions are running at 300,000 a month, government figures showed.In an interview with KT Press, Jules Ntabwoba, the spokesperson of Rwanda Online, said the portal had saved the government money in cutting out the role of front-line civil servants and the scope for them to take bribes.

                    Foreign dance growing popular in China
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                SHANGHAI -- Foreign dance used to be considered controversial in China. But now, more Chinese are learning it thanks to the country's opening up.Ariadna Naveira and Fernando Sanchez are masters in Tango. They come to China from Argentina every year to participate in the Tango International Festival in Shanghai."We don't know how many people are learning Tango in China, but the number of people who learn it is growing," Sanchez said.Tang Jiaying is a public servant in east China's Jiangsu Province. Her passion for Tango returned after she recently watched a Tango competition in Shanghai."My parents thought Tango was not decent and I would become 'bad' if I learned it," Tang said."Now we are more rational, and with a stable income and the desire to enhance my artistic taste, my parents encouraged me to take a Tango class," she added.Shi Yiqi, another girl in Shanghai even quit her job to learn Flamenco in Spain for a year. She opened a Flamenco training center to transmit the Flamenco dance culture to more Chinese enthusiasts.Currently, about 400 people assist in Flamenco training courses every year in Shanghai where Spanish and Latin dance shows and activities are endless.Hip-hop dance is also becoming more popular this summer in China with various competitions held in Shanghai, Shanxi and Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.Breakdance is part of hip-hop dance. In the early 1980s, breakdancing made a sensation in Shanghai after the screening of an American film.In 1988, breakdance competitions were held in various Chinese cities such as Nanjing and Xi'an, while an American breakdance company came to Beijing.However, modern dance became controversial in China."Before the opening-up, Chinese audiences only saw some folk dances of African and Asian countries, and classic ballet was once the only foreign dance for professional dancers," dance critic Lan Fan said."People's vision changed after the opening-up. Innovation can be seen in different types of dance combined with traditional and modern elements," he said.In the future, Lan Fan plans to introduce AI technology in dancing to motivate the interactions between people and machines."We are looking forward to the new development of dance in China," Lan said.

                    California to Trump: 'See you in court'
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                When Barack Obama was in the White House, the state of Texas sued his administration at least 48 times. For Donald Trump, no other state in the United States has resisted his administration in and out of court as frequently as California.On Friday, it was "Mr President, we'll see you in court" from Attorney General Xavier Becerra as the state filed its 60th suit against Trump, more suits against a sitting US president than any in history.California and 23 other US states, along with the cities of Washington, Los Angeles and New York, sued the Trump administration after it moved to revoke California's authority to set its own vehicle emissions standards, first granted under Obama.Trump announced on Twitter the plan to revoke California's greenhouse gas pollution waiver on Sept 18 while in Los Angeles to attend a fundraiser. The next day the Environmental Protection Agency formally announced it.Taking the Trump administration to court over the move further escalates what has been an antagonistic relationship between Trump and the state on many policy matters, including immigration, the environment and healthcare.Those lawsuits have resulted in 37 legal victories for the state - a mix of decisions in favor of California, or preliminary injunctions halting the Trump administration's actions pending a final decision.The state that launched the political career of Ronald Reagan and was once a hotbed of conservatism has become a very liberal, very Democratic state.One in eight US citizens lives in California. Its 39.5 million people make it the country's most ethnically diverse state. Whites make up just under 38 percent of the population. Latinos are the largest group at 39 percent, followed by Asian-Americans - the fastest growing group - at 15 percent and African-Americans at 6 percent, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.Democrats hold the governorship and every other statewide office and have a super majority in both houses of the legislature. Independents hold more elected political positions in the state than Republicans.The party gained even more power in the House of Representatives in last year's midterm elections. Republicans hold just seven of the state's 53-member House delegation. And the speaker of the House is Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat who often tangles with Trump."Donald Trump has put California in his sights because we have a governor and statewide officials, all of whom are Democrats," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst and former University of Southern California professor. "We have a legislature under the control of Democrats, who are all of them about 180 degrees opposite in terms of the major issues that concern Californians - opposite from Donald Trump. We are perceived as the fulcrum of the 'resistance' movement."During his time in office, Trump has singled out the state on Twitter more than any other, calling its sanctuary cities "ridiculous", accusing it of "gross mismanagement" of its forests, and allowing the streets of San Francisco to become "disgusting" with its homeless population.Not lone critic Trump hasn't been his party's lone critic of California."They (Democrats) want us to be just like California, right down to tofu and silicone and dyed hair," Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz told a crowd of supporters during his reelection campaign in 2018.Some Republicans have said that the party should plan to make California a symbol of Democratic dysfunction and "socialistic stagnation" in the 2020 presidential campaign.Dan Patrick, the Republican lieutenant governor of Texas, has suggested that Trump's reelection slogan should be: "I'm not going to let the Democrats turn America into California."Trump has repeatedly hammered away at the state's homeless problem.During a reelection rally on Aug 2 in Cincinnati, Ohio, he said: "California is a disgrace to our country. It's a shame. The world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles with the tents and the horrible, horrible disgusting conditions."That came just days after Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill requiring presidential candidates to release their tax returns if they want to appear on the state's primary ballot - a law aimed at Trump, who hasn't released his tax returns.On Thursday, a federal judge ordered a temporary injunction against the law saying California can't force candidates to disclose their tax returns. He said he would make his final ruling on the law before Oct 1.After Trump said he was revoking the state's emission policy, later that day as he returned to Washington from a three-day trip to California and New Mexico, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that San Francisco was in "total violation" of environmental rules because of used needles used by many homeless people that he said were ending up in the ocean. "We're going to be giving them a notice very soon," he said, indicating that the city could be put on notice by the EPA within a week that its homelessness problem was causing environmental damage.San Francisco Mayor London Breed called Trump's comments "ridiculous".The emissions lawsuit represents the start of what is expected to be a legal battle over states' rights and climate change that is likely be resolved only when it reaches the Supreme Court.The federal government has never before revoked a waiver once it's been granted. But the Trump administration argues that California is violating a long-held principle that only the US government can regulate automobile fuel mileage standards.The auto industry has long favored a unified emissions rule. Four automakers in July - Ford, BMW, Honda and Volkswagen - announced they had partnered with California to manufacture cars that would satisfy the state's more stringent emissions standards.
