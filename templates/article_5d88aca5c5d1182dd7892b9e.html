                Having faith in China's new Foreign Investment Law, many Azerbaijani businessmen are getting eager and looking forward to establishing firms here as soon as possible, Azerbaijan's trade representative said recently.“No other country in the world encourages the import of foreign products like China does,” said Teymur Nadiroghlu, the Azerbaijan envoy and trade representative to China at the Embassy of Azerbaijan.Azerbaijan joined the Belt & Road Initiative in 2015 and has been among its strongest supporters ever since. During the Second Belt and Road Forum this year, companies from Azerbaijan signed ten agreements worth over $820 million with Chinese enterprises, forging stronger cooperation between the two countries.

                    China, Colombia sign treaty on transfer of sentenced persons
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                On behalf of their respective countries, Fu Zhenghua, China's Minister of Justice, and Carlos Holmes Trujillo García, Colombia's Minister of Foreign Affairs, signed a treaty on the transfer of sentenced persons between the two countries in Beijing on July 31.The treaty's signing was witnessed by the leaders of the two countries.As an important legal document on the judicial assistance between the two countries, the treaty lays the legal foundation for cooperation on the transfer of sentenced persons.Once the treaty is in force the two sides will be in a position to transfer citizens of one side who are serving sentences in the other side back to their home country to continue serving their sentences, so as to help them avoid difficulties in language and culture, habits of living, religion, correspondence and visits, which will be good for their correction and their reintergration into society.The two countries completed negotiations and initialed the treaty in December 2016. They agreed that the treaty would be officially signed during the visit by Colombian President Iván Duque Márquez to China.So far, China has signed bilateral treaties on the transfer of sentenced persons with 16 countries, namely Ukraine, Russia, Spain, Portugal, South Korea, Australia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Thailand, Kirghizia, Iran, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Belgium, and Pakistan and Colombia.The treaty with Colombia remains to be ratified by the legislative bodies of the two countries to become effective.

                    Extradition deals with Sri Lanka, Vietnam ratified
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China has expanded international legal cooperation by approving new extradition treaties with two countries on Monday to jointly fight transnational crimes.The extradition treaties - with Sri Lanka and Vietnam - were both ratified at the closing meeting of a five-day bimonthly session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the top legislature.Under Chinese law, a treaty takes effect only after it is reviewed and adopted by the country's top legislators.The treaties unveiled on Monday clarify extradition-related content, such as what crimes can trigger extradition and what materials need to be prepared while applying for one.The signing of the treaties is aimed at combating transnational crimes through more effective legal cooperation, said Le Yucheng, vice-minister of foreign affairs, as he explained the two treaties to the top legislature on Thursday.China began working on extradition treaties with Sri Lanka in September 2014 and Vietnam in October 2013. The treaty with Vietnam was reached in 2015, while the one with Sri Lanka was done a year later."We have had more exchanges in recent years with Sri Lanka in several industries, such as in trade, culture and defense, and we have also become closer with Vietnam in personnel and trade sectors in recent years, which made our needs for legal cooperation gradually greater," he said.He added that joining forces with Vietnam to fight transnational crimes has proved successful in some individual cases.In April, another two treaties - one with Barbados regarding judicial assistance on criminal cases and the other with Azerbaijan about transferring prisoners - were also passed by the top legislature.A statement released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in April showed that China has signed 161 judicial treaties with 77 countries, including for extradition, judicial assistance and asset return and sharing. Of those, 131 have taken effect, it said.The judicial treaties also provide a stronger legal basis for China in its anti-corruption fight to pursue fugitives and recover stolen assets around the world, it added.The Communist Party of China Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the country's top anti-graft watchdog, said 5,974 suspected fugitives and 59 of the top 100 wanted fugitives were returned to China from 2014 to June of this year.
