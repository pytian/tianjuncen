                UN’s Afghanistan mandate extended by Security Council
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                The UN Security Council on Tuesday unanimously adopted a resolution extending the UN political mission in Afghanistan.The technical resolution renews the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) for one year.It asks the UNAMA to provide assistance to Afghanistan with elections, connectivity, regional cooperation, security, anti-narcotics and reconstruction, promote partnership on connectivity, and welcome joint efforts to enhance dialogue and collaboration and to advance shared goals of economic development across the region.The resolution also stresses the importance of supporting capacity building by the Afghan government on security to maintain stability and combat terrorism.Zhang Jun, permanent representative of China to the UN, said in an explanatory statement:"China is glad to see the unanimous adoption by the Council of the resolution on a technical renewal of the mandate of UNAMA. The result meets the expectation of the Afghan people and enables UNAMA to continue doing its job. It has also accommodated the concerns of all parties.""As a direct neighbor, China most wants to see peace, stability, development and prosperity in Afghanistan. China cares most about the interests and well-being of the Afghan people," the ambassador said.Thinking of Afghanistan's position, Zhang emphasized "China believes that to achieve lasting peace, economic development must be boosted; to achieve security and stability, the country's security concerns must be addressed; to maintain unity of the Security Council, existing consensus must be respected."Zhang said that China has been emphasizing that it is not a good time to adopt a comprehensive resolution; technical renewal is the way.China took part in the consultations on extending the mandate of UNAMA and proposed revisions."To China's regret, a few countries refused to keep the text of consensus previously agreed and refused to accommodate the core concerns of the parties. The draft also failed to address possible security vacuum in Afghanistan. All this led to serious division among the parties," Zhang told the council."The argument that supporting Afghanistan in taking part in regional cooperation and promoting connectivity is unrelated to the mandate of UNAMA is a complete misunderstanding of UNAMA's mission," he said."China welcomes the fact that the relevant parties have then come back to the track of consultation in seeking a solution and reached consensus on a technical renewal of the mandate," he added.Zhang said that it must be pointed out that helping the Afghan economy is vital to achieving lasting peace and stability in the country. "That is what the Afghan people want, and no country has the right to deny them a better life," he said.He said that China supports Afghanistan in holding a general election, advancing peace and the reconciliation process and strengthening capacity-building of the Afghan security forces.

                UNITED NATIONS - The 74th session of the UN General Assembly opened at UN Headquarters in New York on Tuesday.Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, president of the 74th session of the General Assembly, declared the opening of the 2019-2020 session of the most representative body of the United Nations.In his remarks to the opening plenary meeting, Muhammad-Bande asked for action in line with the theme of this year's General Debate: "Galvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion.""Our vision statement focused on the implementation of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), particularly poverty eradication, zero hunger, quality education, climate action and inclusion," he said."Accordingly, I will ... pay close attention to the effective implementation of inherited mandates and the following priorities, which I initiated in my vision statement and at the dialogue with member states prior to my election: promotion of peace and security, particularly prevention, and collaborate and coordinate with the Security Council, the (UN) Secretariat to ensure that greater attention is paid to prevention rather than reaction to full-blown conflict."I will also advocate for effective early detection and warning systems as well as mediation, negotiation, and peaceful settlement of ongoing conflicts. I will work to engender cooperation that addresses drivers of conflict, such as poverty, exclusion and illiteracy, increase partnership for the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals, particularly poverty eradication, zero hunger and quality education."In his remarks, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed the need to convince people that the United Nations is relevant to all and that multilateralism offers real solutions to global challenges."The General Assembly is a unique and indispensable forum where the world can come together to advance on sensitive and important issues," he said. "It is vital that the world has strong and effective multilateral institutions and architecture, and that international relations are based on international law."The General Assembly is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations, and the only one in which all member states have equal representation.The General Debate at the beginning of each session is considered the largest gathering of world leaders. This year, 143 heads of state and government are believed to have registered to speak at the high-level week.The 74th session of the General Assembly will also feature other high-profile events, including a Climate Action Summit and a high-level meeting on universal health coverage.
