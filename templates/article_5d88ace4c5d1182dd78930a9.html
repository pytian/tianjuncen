                Several ministry-level departments, including those responsible for culture and tourism, veterans affairs, and education, have responded recently to issues of public concern.Villages offered help to develop tourist resources A line of credit of up to 100 billion yuan ($14 billion) will be used to help Chinese villages develop tourism in the next five years, according to a notice published on Wednesday.The notice, jointly issued by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and Agricultural Bank of China, said the line of credit will be used to help major tourist villages across China develop their cultural and tourist resources, conserve the environment and traditional culture, and improve public services and tourist facilities.It will also be used to develop and promote cultural and tourist products and services such as village homestays, farming experiences and rural cuisine, it said.A series of measures, including expanding credit supply, promoting product innovation, strengthening policy guarantees and stimulating rural consumption, will be adopted to push forward the high-quality development of village tourism, the notice said.

                    Punitive list to target home service wrongdoers
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China plans to roll out a list of misbehaving nannies and home service companies in an effort to discipline a fast-growing sector fueled by an aging population and relaxation of the family planning policy.In a circular released on Friday, the National Development and Reform Commission, the country's top economic planner, requested authorities including the central bank, the market regulator and the public security departments to work in coordination and create a credit system targeting wrongdoers in the home service sector.Authorities were requested to release "at a proper time" a blacklist containing individuals and businesses that violate relevant laws or rules.After a review, the punitive list will be made public via the Ministry of Commerce website and two credit inquiry platforms－the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System and creditchina.gov.cn.The circular said an incentive list will also be created for complying nannies and businesses. Those on the list would be treated favorably, including fewer government inspections, more tax breaks and better financing terms.The move aims to create a credit-based management system that supplements the sector's self-discipline and government oversight, as well as to promote the sector's healthy development, it said.The developments came as the central government works to upgrade the fast-growing sector that has created jobs for tens of millions of rural women.In June, the State Council released a guideline encouraging domestic service providers to sign labor contracts with their employees, pay salaries higher than the minimum wage, and offer social security to them.That would bring about drastic changes to home service enterprises that mostly function as matchmakers.In that role, they have not been obliged to offer pre-work training and have not been held accountable for work related accidents, according to Jiang Ying, a professor at China University of Labor Relations."It has made it difficult to discern a nanny's background and credentials," she said.A spate of scandals involving unqualified nannies have tarnished the sector's image over the last few years.One of the most high-profile cases involved Mo Huanjing, a nanny in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, who was sentenced to death last year for arson.The 35-year-old, who had heavy gambling debts, was found guilty of setting a fire that she had intended to put out to win her client's gratitude and a financial payback. But the fire spread quickly, killing a mother and her three children in the house.

                    Chinese tourists take to German attractions
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China has become Germany's second-largest inbound tourism market, contributing 3.8 billion euros ($4.19 billion) to the European country's tourism revenue last year, The Beijing News quoted the German National Tourist Board as saying. Petra Hedorfer, CEO of the GNTB, announced Germany's inbound tourism data at the recent Germany Travel Mart, an annual industry gathering. China, as the second-largest tourism source of Germany, maintained growth in 2018, with room night figures reaching 3.02 million last year, an increase of 5.6 percent from 2017. The room night statistic is used in the hospitality industry to measure occupancy. It is equivalent to the number of occupied or reserved guest rooms in a hotel multiplied with that of nights spent in the rooms. The increase in Chinese travelers' room nights in Germany was higher than that of total foreign tourists, as well as those from Europe alone. Data from the World Tourism Organization found the number of international tourists to Germany increased 5 percent in 2018 from a year earlier, ranking the country among the 10 most popular destinations globally. Of international visitors to Germany, nearly 59 million are from other European countries. Germany saw an upswing in both its inbound business and leisure travel markets last year. International travelers tended to stay longer and spend more on their visits to Germany in 2018 than before, according to the GNTB. Germany is becoming a destination favored by the young generation. The country saw an 8.5 percent year-on-year increase in the number of travelers aged between 15 and 34 in 2018. The GNTB found that young visitors opted for online platforms for inquiries and reservations. About 63 percent of the European bookings were made online. When it comes to other regions outside Europe, online bookings accounted for 80 percent. (China Daily 09/07/2019 page14)

                    Violence 'must end' for dialogue to happen
                </p>
            </a>

                Executive Council convener praises police performance under pressure during protestsHalting violent, riotous protests is the city's top priority so that law and order in Hong Kong can be restored, Executive Council Convener Bernard Charnwut Chan said.If the violence is not stopped, then dialogue - not to mention reconciliation - between the government and the protesters cannot happen, Chan told China Daily in an exclusive interview.Chan, the leader of the Executive Council's non-official members, also said he backs the Hong Kong Police Force, which he said is doing a good job dealing with violence and the never-ending protests and vandalism. Chan praised the officers' calmness and restraint under very difficult situations, while the protesters still chant their "five demands" and urge all of them to be met.Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor hopes to talk with the protesters, Chan said. However, he said, that will be difficult because it is not easy to identify them, and nobody can promise violent protests will stop if they make peace with the government because the protesters claim they have no leaders."The government has in fact responded to their demands, contrary to their claim that the government has not made any response," Chan said. "It is only that they are not satisfied with the government's answers."For instance, he said, Lam has repeatedly said the extradition-law amendment bill, which sparked the protests, is dead, as the entire legislative process has stopped.As to the demand for an independent commission of inquiry, the government has reiterated time and again that the Independent Police Complaints Council as the existing, established mechanism should handle the inquiry. He also noted that council Chairman Anthony Neoh has agreed to expand the scope of investigation by including events that happened after July 2.Chan said he agrees with Lam that the demand to release and not prosecute the arrested suspects in the protests is against the spirit of the rule of law. He added that public prosecutions are within the portfolio of the secretary for justice in accordance with Article 63 of the Basic Law.Preconditions hinder talks"I have privately talked to the protesters and realized there is a small batch of around 2,000 violent, radical ones. I told them it is very dangerous to chant 'Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times,' but they claimed those were merely slogans and denied advocating Hong Kong independence."There are a very large number of nonviolent people, who maintain they are not addicted to Hong Kong independence but they are unsatisfied with the government," he said."The central authorities are worried that some Hong Kong people are being exploited to challenge the country's sovereignty and 'one country, two systems'. The nonviolent people should consider carefully that it is time to disconnect from the violent ones. Though they are not happy with the government, they should not support the unlawful, violent protesters."Chan also said that while Lam is willing to meet the protesters in public, some protesters, including both students and working adults in their 20s, are unwilling to do so because they fear they would be attacked if their identities were exposed. But he doesn't know if Lam wants the protesters to remove their masks and give their real names at the meeting.Asked if he would suggest to Lam that she explain at a news conference or in a statement why the "five demands" cannot be entertained, Chan said it will be better to explain that during her meeting with the protesters."The protesters should not have any prerequisites, or else the dialogue cannot start. If they have five demands today, how many will they have tomorrow? It is better to have a meeting first and let Mrs Lam explain and narrow the differences. Some young people really want the government to listen to them," Chan said.On Emergency RegulationsSome people are suggesting the government make law during emergencies or when the public is endangered, under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance. Under the law, the government can, among other things, make laws to censor communications, appropriate property, and enact or suspend any law for an unlimited period of time without approval of the Legislative Council. On Tuesday, Lam neither confirmed nor denied the government would do that. Some pro-establishment figures support the move, but the opposition camp is strongly opposed."The chief executive has not said the government would do that," Chan said. "The 'pan-democrats' who said the government would resort to such extreme measures are simply causing panic and inciting more people to take to the street, just as they demonized the fugitive extradition bill. What they said is irresponsible, and their motives are malicious."Although the law is there, how will the government resort to such measures that would harm Hong Kong as a financial center? But as CE, Mrs Lam has the duty to consider every possible, legal method to return things to proper order," he explained.

                    Apartment tenants go for budget renovations

                BEIJING - Although he is not an interior designer, Feng Su has revamped nine apartments he has rented in Beijing over the past decade. In one instance, he repainted a wall and replaced the door handles and all the ceiling lamps. "My parents were against the renovation and complained that I was wasting money on the properties of landlords. My landlords also raised an eyebrow and wondered why I couldn't settle for what I had," recalls Feng, CEO of Haohaozhu, an interior design ideas sharing platform. Feng's enthusiasm for interior renovation has found him a wide audience among his young followers. An increasing amount of apartment renovation content has appeared on Chinese social media and knowledge-sharing platforms.
