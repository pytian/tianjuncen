            </p>
            <p>
                CHANGZHOU, China - World No 1 male shuttler Kento Momota of Japan and the women's singles second seed Tai Tzu Ying of Chinese Taipei powered through to the respective finals at the 2019 Badminton China Open here on Saturday.The top-seeded Momota strove 87 minutes to eliminate China's Olympic champion Chen Long 19-21, 21-18, 21-16."Of course we all hoped to win and we both played well," commented the fifth seed Chen, who won five times in their previous eight competitions."Chen is a very powerful player and it was an intense game," said Momota, who will face Anthony Sinisuka Ginting of Indonesia in the final, a replay of last year's final where Ginting finally won the gold medal."I will try my best to perform well," said Momota when asked about the final.

                The Japanese beauty that influenced Vincent
            </a>
            <p>
                Take a look at a Van Gogh masterpiece and you may spot a cherry blossom or two."To some extent all my work is based on Japanese art," Vincent Van Gogh wrote to his brother on July 15, 1888.The artist had a personal collection of hundreds of Japanese works, and their influence on him is evident when you put some of his paintings alongside certain ukiyo-e, or woodcut prints, a genre that originated in the Edo period (1600s-1860s).Ukiyo, a word from Buddhist sutra, means floating world, and ukiyo-e works reflect various aspects of everyday life in Japan over 400 years.When American ships berthed in Yokohama, the port city south of Tokyo, in the late 1850s, it signaled that after 200 years of isolation Japan had opened its trading doors to the rest of the world. That trade would include works of art, and thus the wonders of ukiyo-e's floating world were scattered to the four winds.What makes ukiyo-e stand in stark relief to other Japanese art forms such as kabuki and noh opera is its earthiness and utter straightforwardness."Ukiyo-e is about what you see, what you hear and what you think," said Yukiko Takahashi, the sixth-generation inheritor of the Takahashi family, which specializes in woodblock prints."It reflects what people pursued and what was popular at that time."At first ukiyo-e works, which were then known as sumi-e, or ink-wash painting, were black and white. Later, with the import of pigment, sumi-e developed into esoushi.There were three basic steps in producing a ukiyo-e piece: drawing, engraving and coloring."One work used about 20 to 30 different colors, and white was not used, keeping down the cost," Takahashi said. "A ukiyo-e piece costs about a bowl of soba noodles."

                Premier Zhou, we have enough fighter planes now
            </a>
            <p>
                Beijing residents on Sunday shared photos and video clips of military planes training for a parade in the sky.As many of them show, some of the planes trailed colored smoke as they flew, while some flew in formations making the number 70, to mark the People's Republic of China's 70th birthday, which falls Oct 1.Sunday's hottest hashtag on Sina Weibo, China's equivalent to Twitter, referenced late Premier Zhou Enlai, the first Premier of the republic. At the founding ceremony of the nation 70 years ago, with only 17 planes that participating in the parade, Zhou ordered them to fly twice to finish the ceremony.The hashtag features the sentence, "Premier Zhou, we have enough planes now and they do not need to fly twice any more."Westerners might find it hard to understand, but behind that sentence is the 70-year struggle of the Chinese nation. When the republic was newly founded, there was still a significant number of territories to be liberated and New China had barely enough air and naval forces to protect itself.According to historical records, four of the 17 planes participating in the ceremony were fully loaded with bullets, because there were fears that air forces of the Kuomintang, which was losing its power, could bomb Beijing in revenge.A weak industrial capacity had already left the Chinese people painful memories.From the Opium War in 1840 to the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression (1931-45), Chinese soldiers had to counter better-equipped enemies almost every war, which resulted in more sacrifices and casualties than the enemy.In the war against Japanese aggression, part of World War II, the casualties of the victorious China were 35 million, much higher than that of the defeated Japan. It was lack of industrial capacity that caused these additional sacrifices.Now 70 years later China, as the second largest economy of the world, can finally equip young soldiers to defend its people so they do not need to fight tanks with rifles.China can finally proudly defend its people's lives and security.Of course, that achievement would not be possible without the struggles of New China's founding fathers 70 years ago. Had they not achieved national independence and unity, China might still be a big, weak agricultural country today, not a major global player.That's why, upon seeing the aerobatics of these military planes, so many people were moved to remember Premier Zhou.The best way to honor their efforts is to continue building the nation and realizing the great national rejuvenation, so that the days of weakness will never return.

                Stable, affordable housing is key to driving growth and innovation
            </a>
            <p>
                All over the world, when a group of middle-aged people get together, talk will eventually turn to real estate. Their houses are their largest lifetime purchases and they are afraid the value might drop. But, in many high-cost cities around the world, economic growth is being stifled because young people can't afford to live where the jobs are.The difficulty is that policymakers must achieve both affordability and stability. Unaffordable housing kills innovation and growth. And big fluctuations in housing prices cause economic crises.The collapse of the Japanese economy in 1991 and the global financial crisis in 2008 were both caused by a property price boom, followed by a sudden collapse.Famous venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who was a co-founder of Pay-Pal and Palantir and a very early investor in Facebook, recently argued that high housing prices in Silicon Valley are killing entrepreneurship there. "One thing I've been thinking about is the vast majority of the capital I give to companies is just going to landlords," he said in a 2018 speech to the Economic Club of New York.Research by the US National Bureau of Economic Research estimated that lack of affordable housing in such places as New York, San Francisco and Silicon Valley cost the US about $1.6 trillion per year in lost wages and productivity.Surprisingly, the study concluded that 75 percent of US economic growth from 1964 to 2009 came from a relatively small group of Southern cities and central cities, led by Atlanta and the big cities in Texas. "Even though superstar metros like New York, San Francisco, and San Jose created great wealth in sectors like finance and high-tech, nearly all the gains were eaten up by wages used to pay for higher housing costs," the study concluded.You might think that the high-wage cities have high housing prices because of their rapid economic growth. But, at least in the US, extremely expensive housing is usually caused by nimbys, that is house owners who use government regulations and zoning to prevent building new housing. (Nimby means "not in my backyard".)Extremely high housing prices have long been a problem in China. According to Reuters data, a typical two-bedroom apartment in Beijing cost about 6 million yuan ($860,000) in 2017, about 69 times the average disposable income in the city, much higher than the ratio of less than 25 times in New York City.Almost unbelievably, when I was young in the 1980s, the standard rule of thumb was that you should not buy a house costing more than two times your average annual income.China is taking a series of steps that should stabilize housing prices without precipitating a dangerous rapid fall. Restrictions on financing the purchase of second or third apartments are reducing the speculative demand that drove up prices. Plus, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development says that access to affordable housing is a top priority of the government and, in 2017, announced plans to build 2 million more affordable housing units.Also, large domestic and foreign investors are investing in building new rental housing - reducing the need for young people to purchase homes early in their careers.Most importantly, recent steps to reform and open up the financial services markets will open up new savings avenues for Chinese savers, reducing their desire to purchase property as an investment.Chinese cities are not very dense by international standards. For example, New York City has roughly twice as many people per square kilometer as do Beijing or Shanghai. So, many city planning experts argue that Chinese cities, which have excellent public transportation systems, could accommodate a significant increase in residential housing even in the city centers.This will allow China's big cities to attract the young people needed to drive growth and innovation and at the same time stabilize housing prices as the cities grow.
