                ACCRA, Ghana - Sicley Williams was ready to escape what she found to be an unfriendly climate in the United States and take a leap of faith, leaving her native Chicago for Ghana.She had previously visited the West African nation on vacation and when she returned in 2017 found work practicing yoga and offering spa services."The climate of the US was just really negative, especially the racial climate," said Williams.In Ghana, that tension disappeared almost entirely, she added."It's much more pleasant to be in a place where you feel more accepted, you feel freer, you feel more open to being who you are and, of course, you are around people who look like you."Williams has become an unofficial ambassador of a growing movement encouraging other African-Americans to move to Ghana.President Nana Akufo-Addo has designated 2019 the "Year of Return" both to commemorate the resilience of Africans forced into slavery and to encourage their descendants to "come home"."We know of the extraordinary achievements and contributions they (Africans in the diaspora) made to the lives of the Americans, and it is important that this symbolic year, 400 years later, we commemorate their existence and their sacrifices," he said in September.His timing was based on the first recorded landing of a ship carrying Africans in Virginia in August 1619, said by historians to be an English warship that had plundered a Portuguese slaver.Celebrities including supermodel Naomi Campbell and actors Idris Elba and Rosario Dawson kicked off the yearlong program by attending the Full Circle Festival in Accra in late December.Ghana is still dotted with dungeons and castles established during the slave trade, which serve as a powerful reminder of the past to educate citizens and foreign visitors about slavery.US former president Barack Obama and his family visited the Cape Coast Castle in 2009 and described it as a place of "profound sadness"."It reminds us that as bad as history can be, it's also possible to overcome," he said during the tour of the landmark, with its infamous "door of no return" in the dungeon.Akufo-Addo's invitation isn't the first from Ghanaian presidents.In 2000, Ghana passed legislation designed to make it easier for people from the African diaspora to live and work in the country.Akufo-Addo has pledged to simplify the visa process.Tourism Minister Catherine Abelema Afeku is organizing music and culture festivals, including Ghana independence celebrations in March.There will also be Panafest, a theater festival aimed at bringing together Africans on the continent and in the diaspora "around the issues of slavery".Support and development Christabel Dadzie hopes that 12 months of celebration will inspire Ghanaians in the diaspora to move back.After a decade working in the US, Dadzie founded the Ahaspora Young Professionals to help those in the diaspora make the transition to Ghana.With a network of about 2,000 people, Dadzie and others help field questions like how to get a job, where to recruit a baby sitter or even buy household goods.The group also offers community services such as mentoring high school students in professional development and has raised funds and donations for disaster relief.Seeing those in the diaspora coming to Ghana "will be great for our tourism and camaraderie, getting to know other people who are related to the country", said Dadzie, who is planning one of the events of the celebration."They come home and do amazing entrepreneurial things to actually thrive here."Entrepreneur Dedo Azu said there were obvious challenges to moving to Ghana, including having to pay one or two years' rent up front and a sense of alienation.After 11 years in Canada it took Azu some time to find her feet.But she had a breakthrough as the owner of Tea Baa, one of Accra's most popular bars, serving ice cold drinks in Mason jars.Those who are determined to "come home" can carve out a living, said Azu. "If you come, you will find a little space to do what you want or make it better.Agence France-Presse

                    Loan move to Barca has Boateng beaming

                MADRID - Ghanaian forward Kevin-Prince Boateng has vowed to make the most of his arrival at Barcelona after a loan move for the journeyman from Italian side Sassuolo was sealed on Monday.The Catalan giant said in a statement it had agreed a deal to take Boateng on loan until the end of the season, with an option to make the move permanent in the summer."The agreement includes a $9 million purchase option," the club said.The arrival of Boateng, 31, will provide much-needed cover for Luis Suarez up front in Ernesto Valverde's squad following the departure of Munir El Haddadi to Sevilla.The fiery forward has been a successful stopgap many times before, which Barca boss Ernesto Valverde valued in his decision to bring him in."He doesn't seem to need much time to adapt, he knows his stuff and he's able to start playing straight away," Valverde said."He's comfortable in many positions, as a central striker or playing off another striker, and even deeper too."The player himself was upbeat about the move when journalists spoke to him at the airport in Italy."Barca, I'm coming! I'm sad to leave Sassuolo but this is a great chance," Boateng said, according to a Sky Sports Twitter feed."But don't ask me about Real Madrid. I only want to focus on Barcelona and I hope to score at Bernab for the next Clico," Boateng said.The player will be presented to press and fans on Tuesday afternoon on the Camp Nou pitch, the club revealed.Born in Germany, the half-brother of Bayern Munich defender Jerome Boateng moved back to Serie A last year after helping Eintracht Frankfurt win the German Cup.He has scored five goals in 15 games this season for Sassuolo."With experience of playing in four of the biggest leagues in Europe, the Premier League, the Bundesliga, Serie A and La Liga, he is a man who has scored goals wherever he has been," a Barcelona statement said.The former Tottenham Hotspur, AC Milan and Schalke player has previously had a spell in Spain, suiting up for Las Palmas during the 2016-17 season.Agence France - Presse

                When Forster Asare-Yeboah, from Ghana, arrived at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in 2008, he never expected he would have millions of followers in the future. Upon graduating in 2012, he started playing music. Five years later, short video clips of him became popular so he posted videos on social networks of him speaking Sichuan dialect. Those videos were watched millions of times and he quickly became famous. Now he has a new name: Li Kui, which comes from an ancient martial arts novel of China. He is good at speaking Sichuan dialect and uses some uncommon idioms. "I like to make people happy and I never expected I could have so many followers," he said with a laugh. He has a local wife, Zhu Lan from Chengdu, whom he met at a party.

                    Global community urges Nigeria’s aggrieved parties to resort to legal means to seek redress
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The international community has called upon the Nigeria’s aggrieved parties on the presidential election results announced on February 27, 2019, to resort to legal means to seek redress.In a joint statement, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Union (AU) and the United Nations (UN) said they had been drawn to the rejection of the results of the presidential election by one of the participating political parties.They thus called on all aggrieved parties and persons to resort to legal means to seek redress, in accordance with the constitution and relevant Nigeria laws.Abubakar Atiku of People's Democratic Party, and who was Muhammadu Buhari’s main competitor, rejected the presidential results, saying there were manifest and premeditated malpractices in many states which negated the announced results.In a statement circulated on social media dated February 27, Atiku said the suppressed votes in his strongholds were so apparent and amateurish, that he was ashamed as a Nigerian that such could be allowed to happen."If I had lost in a free and fair election, I would have called the victor within seconds of my being aware of his victory to offer not just my congratulations, but my services to help unite Nigeria by being a bridge between the north and the south,” the statement read.He said in his democratic struggles for the past three decades, he had never seen the country’s democracy so debased as it was on Saturday, February 23, 2019.“I hereby reject the result of the February 23, 2019 sham election and will be challenging it in court,” he said.In a statement from the British High Commission in Abuja quoting Harriett Baldwin, the minister of state for Africa at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the UK government congratulated Buhari on securing a second term.“The Nigerian people have demonstrated resilience and a commitment to democracy. The result declared by the Nigerian election commission is consistent with the result obtained through the civil society Parallel Vote Tabulation process. Along with our international partners, the UK believes the Nigerian people can have confidence in the result,” the statement read.The UK government however recognized that independent Nigerian voices had expressed concerns about the conduct of the electoral process, in particular logistics and results collation, and reports of intimidation of election officials.“We urge any party or individual who wishes to challenge the process to do so peacefully and through the appropriate legal channel. We also encourage Nigerian authorities to examine all allegations of wrongdoing carefully, and take the necessary action against individuals found responsible,” the statement read.African leaders have also taken to their tweeter accounts to congratulate Buhari for winning a second term as the president of Nigeria.Uhuru Kenyatta, the Kenyan president wrote, “Your victory is a clear demonstration of the trust and confidence the people of Nigeria have in your ability to lead the country to greater heights of progress.”Kenyatta said he looks forward to continuing working closely with Buhari in consolidating mutually beneficial areas of cooperation for the greater good of the two countries.Nana Akufo-Addo, the president of Ghana, also congratulated Buhari for his victory. “The Ghanaian people, their government and I extend warm congratulations to Muhammadu Buhari on his re-election, for a second successive term,” he wrote in his official tweeter account.In his congratulation message, Cyril Ramaphosa the president of South Africa, said the Nigerian people should be commended both for their patience following the postponement of the election date by a week and the peaceful manner in which they conducted themselves during the election process, SABC News reported.Ramaphosa expressed his commitment to working closely with Buhari's government to enhance the good bilateral relations which exist between South Africa and Nigeria, paying particular focus on the strengthening of economic cooperation.Mahamadou Issoufou, the president of Niger, and Macky Sall, the president of Senegal, also called to congratulate Buhari, according to a statement send to local media houses by Femi Adesina, the special adviser to the president on media and publicity.

                Nigerian newly elected president says he will lead the country to the 'next level' Chinese President Xi Jinping has sent a congratulatory message to Muhammadu Buhari on his re-election as Nigerian president. In the Friday message, Xi said he attaches great importance to the development of China-Nigeria relations and would like to work with Buhari to continuously lift the Sino-Nigerian strategic partnership to higher levels by implementing the outcomes of the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, so as to better benefit the two countries and their people. Buhari, candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress party, won the presidential election last week by securing 55.6 percent of the votes, according to Nigeria's electoral body, the Independent National Electoral Commission. In his acceptance speech, Buhari said he would focus on consolidating his achievements to take the country to the "next level" during his second term of office. "I can assure that you will see a country moving to the next level, as we consolidate on our fundamental areas of securing the country, reviving the economy, and fighting corruption," the 76-year-old president said. The runner-up, Atiku Abubakar of the main opposition People's Democratic Party, won more than 11 million votes, or 41.2 percent of the total. In Nigeria, the candidate with the most votes is declared the winner as long as he or she wins at least 25 percent of the vote in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states. Buhari won in 19 states, mostly in the northern part of the country, which has been his stronghold since 2003. The final results was released after a three-day collation of polls from all states, including the capital Abuja. The Electoral Commission presented a certificate of return to Buhari and vice-president Yemi Osinbajo in the Nigerian capital last Wednesday. The certificate formally validates their re-elections. Buhari said he and his team will "roll up their sleeves afresh", and give their best in his second term of office. Peaceful process "The hard work to deliver a better Nigeria continues, building on the foundations of peace, rule of law and opportunities for all," he said. "We have no other motive than to serve Nigeria with our hearts and might, and build a nation which we and generations to come can be proud of." Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairman of the African Union Commission, welcomed the successful conduct of the presidential elections in Nigeria on Friday. In a statement, Faki noted that the African Union Observer Mission and other international observers concluded that the process was "largely peaceful and orderly and in conformity with Nigeria's legal framework, thus marking another important step in the consolidation of democracy in Nigeria." Faki "commends the INEC (Electoral Commission) for the conduct of the elections, and all the political actors and the Nigerian people for their high participation and maturity," the statement said. Faki called on all stakeholders that were involved in Nigeria's election process "to continue in this exemplary spirit." After Buhari's re-election, African leaders have also sent congratulation for his winning the second term. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta tweeted: "Your victory is a clear demonstration of the trust and confidence the people of Nigeria have in your ability to lead the country to greater heights of progress." Kenyatta added that he looks forward to continuing working closely with Buhari in consolidating mutually beneficial areas of cooperation for the greater good of the two countries. President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana also congratulated Buhari for his victory. "The Ghanaian people, their government and I extend warm congratulations to Muhammadu Buhari on his re-election, for a second successive term," he wrote in his official Twitter account.

                ACCRA, Ghana - As Ghana's urban landscape gently slides by the train window, Shaibu Amoah swells with pride.The 37-year-old has been helping to renovate railway lines in Accra since last June, clearing debris and shoveling ballast in the hot sun.When the short line from Accra to the port of Tema finally reopened in January, Amoah was on the first public run."I am feeling proud of my work because I am helping my country to move ahead," he said.The head of the Ghana Railway Development Authority, Richard Diedong Dombo, said the transport sector was crucial for the country's development, pointing to railways as historic "engines of growth".Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo established the Ministry of Railways Development in 2017 to restore existing lines dating back to British colonial rule - and build new ones.Ghana's railway network comprises three lines with some branch extensions, totaling 940 kilometers of track.Under a 2013 Master Plan, the country aims to have 4,000 kilometers of track by 2048.It would connect Accra with Sekondi-Takoradi in the southwest to the central city of Kumasi, and to Tamale in the north, and link Tema to Burkina Faso, Ghana's northern neighbor.The total cost is estimated at about $21.5 billion.That's a big ask for any country, let alone a developing country in sub-Saharan Africa, and the authorities said they are cautiously taking a phased approach to the project, based on funding.Diedong said "a mixed bag" of financing, including local sources, was helping with rehabilitation work, but foreign firms were likelier to build new lines, which are far more costly.No contracts have been awarded for new lines, but Chinese companies seem more interested in investing in infrastructure in Ghana than those in the West, he said.However, some people also worry about if the government is afford to carry the construction on.Train driver supervisor Kofi Asare, 52, is a more than 20-year veteran of Ghana's railways.While he was pleased with the renewed focus on railways, he was concerned about whether the support would be sustained.In his long experience, he said, he had seen an "off and on" approach to the railways. During "off" periods, this often meant months without pay."It's a matter of sustainability - they have done it, so are they going to continue to maintain it?" he asked.He and others who have dedicated their working lives to the railways are now just hoping for the best."We are still putting our faith high, our hope and expectations. We are expecting things will go well," he said.AFP

He also called for full support from the Ghanaian government and local people.Wang Shiting, the Chinese Ambassador to Ghana, affirmed POWERCHINA's contribution to the construction of Bui Dam and other projects in Ghana.Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo delivers a speech at the commencement ceremony.[Photo/POWERCHINA]He reviewed the development of bilateral relations, as well as economic and trade cooperation since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Canada, expressing wishes that the cooperation between POWERCHINA and Ghana's government can yield more results.Li Yanming, deputy general manager of POWERCHINA, said that POWERCHINA is willing to further deepen and expand its close cooperation with the Ghanaian government, as well as make efforts for the further promotion of the Belt and Road Initiative on the African continent. The enterprise will work hard to facilitate China-Africa cooperation in infrastructure and capacity.Since entering the Ghanaian market in 2004, POWERCHINA has actively participated in the construction of energy, power, and infrastructure projects in the country.Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo (R) shakes hands with Li Yanming (L), deputy general manager of POWERCHINA.[Photo/POWERCHINA]Among a large number of cooperative projects, the Bui Dam is the first large-scale project with mixed loans in Africa, carrying out functions such as irrigation, agricultural planting, fisheries, and sightseeing. It has provided a successful example in related fields for others to follow.With various projects currently proceeding, more than 6,000 technical personnel including civil engineers, equipment operators, and managers have been trained for work in Ghana.

                    Learning Chinese popular among students in Ghana
                </p>

                Benjamin Gyimah, 21, is a high school graduate working at the GS Plaza Hotel, a leading Chinese hospitality facility in Ghana's capital.He grew up loving Chinese movies and arts but could not understand the films without subtitles.Now, his dream of learning Chinese is on the way to being fulfilled after he enrolled at the Confucius Institute earlier this year after his elder brother, who studied Chinese at the University of Ghana, encouraged him to do so."I thought Chinese was complex. But as more time passes, I love it," he said.Learning Chinese "is simpler than I thought. Learning Chinese is fun. I love Chinese movies, especially kung fu films", he said.Like many young Ghanaians who have studied Chinese, the Chinese-owned hotel where he works presents him with plenty of opportunities to interact with Chinese people.Others, like Emelia Ansong, a local Chinese language teacher with the Confucius Institute at the University of Cape Coast, about 146 kilometers west of the capital, are continuously improving their proficiency in the language.Speaking about her efforts, Ansong said: "I did my bachelor's degree in Chinese and geography. And after that, I traveled to China to do a master's in teaching Chinese."Later, I got the opportunity to return to Ghana and teach Chinese at UCC."The Confucius Institute established its first Ghanaian campus at the University of Ghana in 2013, and the second at the university in 2016, to promote Chinese language and culture learning among Ghanaians."So, more opportunities are now available for people to learn Chinese," she said."At the Confucius Institute at the university, we have three courses for students who are interested in learning Chinese."In addition to the Confucius Institute centers in the universities, the University of Ghana also runs a degree program in Chinese, giving more people the chance to learn the language.Speaking about what drives Ghanaian youth to take up learning Chinese, Ansong said: "A lot of young Ghanaian people are curious and would like to explore the world beyond their borders."Nathaniel Oquaye graduated from the University of Ghana with a double major in Chinese and political science. And in 2016, he got the opportunity to study in Zhejiang province in China, where he studied Chinese language and culture for nine months.He said that learning Chinese is a must for every young person seeking to rise in the job market."I think Chinese is going to become very important over the next decade," Oquaye said.He described Chinese artworks as beautiful, and said: "I studied a bit of calligraphy and painting."Now, back in Ghana, he praised the Chinese government for doing much through the embassy to reward excellent and outstanding students who study the language at the University of Ghana.
