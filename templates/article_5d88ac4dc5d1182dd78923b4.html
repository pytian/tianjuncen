            <p class="style-content">
                There have been different ages for mankind, stone and bronze to name just two. We are now, as a species, on the foothills of a new age, that of artificial intelligence and as the name implies, it is helping us solve various quandaries as shown in a documentary.Hello AI is a cheerful welcome to a new guest in our lives. Spanning five episodes, the series on the online streaming media platform Youku showcases how AI can make our lives better.From restoration of the Great Wall, protection of the Siberian Tiger and raising yaks to space exploration, Hello AI takes audiences to travel around the world with touching stories involving AI. The crew spent 18 months interviewing 77 people."We did not want another production of 'hard' scientific technology," Chen Yi, director of Hello AI, says at a pre-screening of the documentary in Beijing on Thursday. "We wanted to create something warm to highlight AI's benefits for humanity."The documentary focuses on the technology's many uses, not least on the Great Wall on the outskirts of Beijing. Restorers used to have to climb treacherous cliffs to survey a "wild and very dangerous" section of the structure. But drones are now being utilized.And with help of an AI algorithm, co-processed by tech company Intel and Wuhan University, engineers can easily detect cracks on the wall, and are able to accurately calculate how many bricks are needed for restoration through virtual modeling.Another example shows the UNESCO World Heritage site at Mogao Caves, a collection of 735 grottoes spanning more than a millennium in Dunhuang, Gansu province. Wu Jian, a researcher who has spent decades taking high-definition pictures of the frescoes, once worried his team's work was not fast enough to digitally record the gradually fading pieces of art.It was painstaking work. His team had to take 300 pictures of a square-meter area, and put the "puzzles "together in postproduction. It often took one month to finish the digitization of just one cave. Time was of the essence and an AI team from Zhejiang University was able to instantly build a picture mosaic. This digital exhibition of the treasure of Mogao Caves has toured the country.AI, the film shows, also helps NASA scientists in compiling information on moon craters.The common theme running through the series is "Tech for good".Liu Yile, an executive director of the documentary, says they only choose cases that can "reflect the relationship between scientific technology and people".It is not just ancient structures or outer space where AI benefits us all. In culture too, it can play a vital role. Deng Chunlei, an IT engineer who is of the Manchu ethnic group, regrets that he cannot fluently speak the Manchu language. Just about 20 people, he claims, can speak it throughout China. To help preserve it, he has recorded a 10-hour discussion with a 91-year-old Manchu woman. His team, with tech company iFly Tek, uses AI to analyze the woman's voice and gather 2,500 basic sentences of the language.AI will enhance people's daily lives, according to Song Jiqiang, managing director of Intel Labs China."Technology is at its best when it is widely and cheaply accessible," he says. "A boom time for AI has just started, but has room for improvement to meet our expectations. That needs our continuous exploration."According to Zhang Yanli, a scholar with Doc China, the sector's leading association of documentary production companies, the new series is the first Chinese documentary with 8k ultra high definition and the first such production in China that totally focuses on AI. He also says that Hello AI will be broadcast through TV stations nationwide later this year.Speaking on whether AI will be used to produce documentaries in the future, Liu smiles: "It's just like comparing a handicraft or product from an assembly line. No matter how exquisite the industrial product is, people will prefer a handmade art piece."AI will assist us, but not replace us."That is also probably why director Chen decides to invite her college classmate Ji Guanlin, rather than use AI dubbing, as the voice-over in the documentary. Ji is best known for the voice of lead actress in the popular historical drama Empresses in the Palace. Some things, humans are still better at.

                MIAMI - President Donald Trump canceled a visit to Poland on Thursday and Florida's governor expanded a state of emergency to prepare for Hurricane Dorian, which is forecast to make landfall on the Atlantic coast Monday as a dangerous Category 4 storm.Trump said Vice President Mike Pence would make the trip to Poland in his place so that he could remain in the United States to make sure federal resources were properly directed at the arriving storm."It's something very important for me to be here. The storm looks like it could be a very, very big one indeed," the president said.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who had already declared a state of emergency for 26 counties on the state's east coast, extended it on Thursday to the whole of Florida.Georgia Governor Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency in 12 counties to assist with storm readiness, response and recovery.Dorian, expected to strengthen in the Atlantic with violent winds topping 130 miles per hour, is aiming at central Florida, including Florida's famed Space Coast. It is expected to make landfall on the Labor Day holiday Monday. It could churn across dozens of launchpads owned by NASA, the US Air Force and companies such as Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin.Such winds would make Dorian a Category 4 storm, the second-strongest on the Saffir-Simpson scale for measuring hurricane intensity.Reuters

                    'A big deal': Florida braces for hurricane
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                MIAMI — Florida residents picked the shelves clean of bottled water and lined up at gas stations on Thursday as an increasingly menacing-looking Hurricane Dorian threatened to broadside the state over Labor Day weekend.Leaving mercifully little damage in its wake in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, the second hurricane of the 2019 season swirled toward the US, with forecasters warning it will draw energy from the warm, open waters as it closes in.The National Hurricane Center said the Category 1 storm is expected to strengthen into a potentially catastrophic Cat 4 with winds of 130 mph and slam into the US on Monday somewhere between the Florida Keys and southern Georgia — a 500-mile stretch that reflected the high degree of uncertainty this far out."If it makes landfall as a Category 3 or 4 hurricane, that's a big deal," said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy. "A lot of people are going to be affected. A lot of insurance claims."President Donald Trump canceled his weekend trip to Poland and declared Florida is "going to be totally ready."With the storm's track still unclear, no immediate mass evacuations were ordered.Along Florida's east coast, local governments began distributing sandbags, shoppers rushed to stock up on food, plywood and other emergency supplies at supermarkets and hardware stores, and motorists topped off their tanks and filled gasoline cans. Some fuel shortages were reported in the Cape Canaveral area.Josefine Larrauri, a retired translator, went to a Publix supermarket in Miami only to find empty shelves in the water section and store employees unsure of when more cases would arrive."I feel helpless because the whole coast is threatened," she said. "What's the use of going all the way to Georgia if it can land there?"Tiffany Miranda of Miami Springs waited well over 30 minutes in line at BJ's Wholesale Club in Hialeah to buy hurricane supplies. Some 50 vehicles were bumper-to-bumper, waiting to fill up at the store's 12 gas pumps."You never know with these hurricanes. It could be good, it could be bad. You just have to be prepared," she said.As of late Thursday morning, Dorian was centered about 220 miles northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico, its winds blowing at 85 mph as it moved northwest at 13 mph.It is expected to pick up steam as it pushes out into warm waters with favorable winds, the University of Miami's McNoldy said, adding: "Starting tomorrow, it really has no obstacles left in its way."The National Hurricane Center's projected track had the storm blowing ashore midway along the Florida peninsula, southeast of Orlando and well north of Miami or Fort Lauderdale. But because of the difficulty of predicting its course this far ahead, the "cone of uncertainty" covered nearly the entire state.Forecasters said Dorian could bring 4 to 8 inches of rain to the Southeastern coast, with a foot possible in places, and trigger life-threatening flash floods.Also imperiled were the Bahamas, with Dorian's expected track running just to the north of Great Abaco and Grand Bahama islands.Jeff Byard, an associate administrator at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, warned that Dorian is likely to "create a lot of havoc with infrastructure, power and roads," but gave assurances FEMA is prepared to handle it, even though the Trump administration is shifting hundreds of millions of dollars from FEMA and other agencies to deal with immigration at the Mexican border."This is going to be a big storm. We're prepared for a big response," Byard said.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency, clearing the way to bring in more fuel and call out the National Guard if necessary, and Georgia's governor followed suit.At the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, NASA decided to move indoors the mobile launch platform for its new mega rocket under development. Royal Caribbean and Carnival began rerouting their cruise ships. A Rolling Stones concert Saturday at the Hard Rock Stadium near Miami was moved up to Friday night.The hurricane season typically peaks between mid-August and late October. One of the most powerful storms ever to hit the US was on Labor Day 1935. The unnamed Category 5 hurricane crashed ashore along Florida's Gulf Coast on Sept 2. It was blamed for over 400 deaths.AP

                    'Extremely dangerous' Hurricane Dorian worries Florida

            <p class="style-content">
                MIAMI - Hurricane Dorian churned toward Florida with increasingly powerful winds and drenching rains on Friday, wreaking havoc on people's Labor Day weekend plans in one of America's biggest vacation destinations.The Miami-based National Hurricane Center said in a statement at 830pm EDT (0030 GMT) on Friday that Dorian had strengthened into an "extremely dangerous" category 4 hurricane, packing maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h).In the Bahamas, evacuations were underway, two days before Dorian is expected to bring a life-threatening storm surge of as much as 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.5 meters) to the northwest of the islands, the NHC said.On Florida's east coast, where Dorian's winds are expected to begin hitting on Monday morning, items ranging from bottled water to plywood were being bought as quickly as they could be restocked. There were reports some gas stations had run out of fuel."They're buying everything and anything that applies to a hurricane, flashlights, batteries, generators," said Amber Hunter, 30, assistant manager at Cape Canaveral's ACE Handiman hardware store.The hurricane has the potential to put millions of people at risk along with big vacation parks such as Walt Disney World, the NASA launchpads along the Space Coast, and even President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach.In its longer earlier bulletin at 8 pm EST (0000 GMT), the NHC said: "Additional strengthening is forecast, and Dorian is anticipated to remain an extremely dangerous hurricane while it moves near the northwestern Bahamas and approaches the Florida peninsula into early next week."

            <p class="style-content">
                TITUSVILLE, Fla. - Hurricane Dorian, the second strongest Atlantic storm on record, pounded the Bahamian islands of Great Abaco and Grand Bahama on Sunday night and was forecast to move dangerously close to Florida in the next two days, US forecasters said.Hazards for the Abaco Islands included storm surges 18 to 23 feet (5.5 to 7 metres) above normal tide levels with higher destructive waves, the Miami-based US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.At 8 pm (0000) GMT, the hurricane was about 150 miles (240 km) from the Florida coast, parts of which were evacuating. Farther north, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster ordered mandatory evacuations for parts of eight coastal counties effective at noon (1600 GMT) on Monday.Even a glancing blow from one of the strongest storms ever to menace Florida could bring torrential rains and damaging winds, the NHC said.
