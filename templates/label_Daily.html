                             Since the central government announced plans in April last year to build Hainan into a pilot free trade zone and gradually explore building it into a free trade port with Chinese characteristics, the tourist resort city has signed strategic cooperation agreements on 300 projects with names like Merlin Entertainments, Thomas Cook, China Taiping Life Insurance, China Minmetals and COFCO, among many others. Efforts must be made to upgrade the industry by taking advantage of the construction of Hainan into an international tourism center, one of the four positions for the Hainan FTZ set by the central government, and make Sanya a benchmark for Hainan FTZ development," said Tong. Besides deepening supply-side reform in the tourism sector, Sanya is also striving in developing high-end service industries and high-tech industries, according to Tong

                             Many of the advanced technologies one hears so much about in the media remain unexploited by a nontrivial share of companies, which suggests that we have a long wait before even the most revolutionary innovations start driving GDP.To avoid an even worse backlash, and to develop a better appreciation of what the Fourth Industrial Revolution actually entails, one must understand where all companies－not just those at the top－stand with respect to today's disruptions. But it is worth remembering that smaller companies, even if they face economic headwinds, still have the political power to push for tougher regulation of new technologies that threaten their existence

The regulation on foreign experts' work permits states that overseas language teachers in China must obtain a work visa and be a native speaker with a bachelor's degree or higher, and have at least two years of related teaching experience and no criminal record. "Some families in China spend a considerable amount on foreign English-language teachers for their children, but sometimes parents mistakenly think any foreigner - regardless of the level of their skill in the language - can provide quality education in English," Huang said

China's central bank has been letting market forces play a larger role in determining the yuan's exchange rate, and on Monday, when the yuan faced growing devaluation pressure under the latest US threat to impose 10 percent punitive tariff on $300 billion Chinese goods starting Sept 1, it went beyond 7 to the US dollar.

                             According to veteran diplomats, interactions between China and the US in Shanghai, and what they have achieved in the city in past decades, are part of the two countries' shared legacy and are lessons that need to be passed on. "But at the time, political support within the US toward developing relations with China was not very strong, and many US politicians were unable to observe China's economic growth and social changes that had taken place," Wu added. Yuan Peng, a leading US expert and president of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that despite the Taiwan question, many new issues that emerged - including the Korean nuclear situation, the South China Sea, global economic governance and climate change - were not included in the landmark joint statements issued by the two governments in 1972, 1978 and 1982

                             During his state visit to Russia in early June, Xi said the two countries should proactively push forward the connection between the Belt and Road and the Eurasian Economic Union and dedicate themselves to promoting the integration of the regional economy. Juan Carlos Capunay, Peru's former ambassador to China, said the BRI is the best solution for countries that want to embrace open business environments and build up their economies by joining global groups like the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization. A study by the World Bank found that fully implementing deeper policy reforms related to the BRI would lift 32 million people out of moderate poverty, increase global trade by up to 6

                             The talks came days after a renewed threat, made by US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland in an interview with Politico, that the US remains ready to impose car tariffs, or other actions, with "immediate financial consequences" for the EU if there is no progress in bilateral trade talks, or if countries such as France and the United Kingdom go ahead with plans for a digital services tax.Trump said in May that imports of cars and certain car parts from the EU and Japan "threaten to impair the national security of the United States" and directed US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to address the threat in trade talks with those countries in the following six months.Sabine Weyand, the European Commission's director-general of trade, said in Washington on Monday that the European Union would not be bullied by the threat of sanctions that it views as illegal under WTO rules, and will retaliate if the US imposes punitive tariffs on European cars, according to a Reuters report

At the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation held at the end of April this year, the topic of overseas port investment attracted much attention and brought about more new achievements

                             The US move also shows a subtle change in the attitude of the US leader, who while triggering the trade war against China didn't believe that the US would also have to pay a high price for it. Indeed, the US' more than 100 months of economic growth could come to an end according to the laws of economics. Therefore, it is likely that the US' economic rebound could take longer without the trade war

This duality can also help me better understand the people who have the same background as I have," said Lin, who hopes to hold exchange exhibitions in China and South Korea for artists from both countries." In addition to ethnic Koreans, he said that a rising number of other people from China are also moving into Daerim-dong, adding that he finds it difficult to communicate with some of these residents

It is undeniable that the US used to be the world leader in responding to climate change and will continue to play an important role in the fight, since dozens of its states and cities have promised to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at local levels

On Saturday, China said FedEx was put under investigation after Huawei Technologies claimed the company, without offering any explanation, diverted two parcels destined for addresses in China to the US. The Chinese telecommunications equipment maker said FedEx tried to reroute two other packages sent from Vietnam to Huawei addresses elsewhere in Asia without authorization

Maybe that can explain the contribution of protection; or is it because of advanced research tools?"

Also, is it viable for China to participate in INF Treaty negotiations, as sought by the US and Japan?The withdrawal is a result of the current world situation. If they did the deployment under American pressure, China and Russia would take counter-measures diplomatically and militarily, creating new confrontation.On Aug 3, US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said he wants to place intermediate-range missiles in Asia within months and that Europe is also a priority region
