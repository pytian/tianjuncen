                Ghana bets on rejuvenated railways for growth
            </p>
            <p>
                ACCRA, Ghana - As Ghana's urban landscape gently slides by the train window, Shaibu Amoah swells with pride.The 37-year-old has been helping to renovate railway lines in Accra since last June, clearing debris and shoveling ballast in the hot sun.When the short line from Accra to the port of Tema finally reopened in January, Amoah was on the first public run."I am feeling proud of my work because I am helping my country to move ahead," he said.The head of the Ghana Railway Development Authority, Richard Diedong Dombo, said the transport sector was crucial for the country's development, pointing to railways as historic "engines of growth".Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo established the Ministry of Railways Development in 2017 to restore existing lines dating back to British colonial rule - and build new ones.Ghana's railway network comprises three lines with some branch extensions, totaling 940 kilometers of track.Under a 2013 Master Plan, the country aims to have 4,000 kilometers of track by 2048.It would connect Accra with Sekondi-Takoradi in the southwest to the central city of Kumasi, and to Tamale in the north, and link Tema to Burkina Faso, Ghana's northern neighbor.The total cost is estimated at about $21.5 billion.That's a big ask for any country, let alone a developing country in sub-Saharan Africa, and the authorities said they are cautiously taking a phased approach to the project, based on funding.Diedong said "a mixed bag" of financing, including local sources, was helping with rehabilitation work, but foreign firms were likelier to build new lines, which are far more costly.No contracts have been awarded for new lines, but Chinese companies seem more interested in investing in infrastructure in Ghana than those in the West, he said.However, some people also worry about if the government is afford to carry the construction on.Train driver supervisor Kofi Asare, 52, is a more than 20-year veteran of Ghana's railways.While he was pleased with the renewed focus on railways, he was concerned about whether the support would be sustained.In his long experience, he said, he had seen an "off and on" approach to the railways. During "off" periods, this often meant months without pay."It's a matter of sustainability - they have done it, so are they going to continue to maintain it?" he asked.He and others who have dedicated their working lives to the railways are now just hoping for the best."We are still putting our faith high, our hope and expectations. We are expecting things will go well," he said.AFP

            </a>
            <p>
                Amadou Diop, journalist, Le Soleil, Senegal"I really appreciated the government work report delivered by the premier...what impressed me most is the government's decision to take courageous initiatives for the benefit of the people and the reduction of taxes, the promotion of foreign investment, and the efforts made by the government in developing public services to prevent corruption."Imbenque Baducaram Dema, journalist, Guinea-Bissau National TV"The report is amazing. What impressed me is the plan that China is going to create more than 11 million jobs this year, which means the country is fulfilling the people's hopes in all areas."Kris Crismundo, Philippine News Agency"Most of their targets have been achieved for 2018, and of course the country can achieve its targets this year to benefit the Chinese people. On international cooperation, the Chinese government is not just focusing on its domestic market, but also the international market with closer relationships with other countries, evidenced by the Belt and Road Initiative."Md Enamul Hassan, diplomatic correspondent, Daily Sun, Bangladesh"I have found it very impressive and informative. As a foreigner, I could get an in-depth overview of the work of the Chinese government. Its description of the Belt and Road Initiative has really impressed me. I am really upbeat to know that the Chinese government will step up global cooperation under the initiative, which can bring good news for Bangladesh too."Bilal Sabri Ahmed, journalist from Pakistan"I'm very impressed by the Government Work Report. President Xi Jinping is moving China toward success and is leading the country very well. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is already underway. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a big part of BRI. The project aims to alleviate poverty and boost employment. About 700,000 jobs will be generated by the CPEC project."Godo Morris Dogga Luwo, journalist from South Sudan"The Government Work Report is very comprehensive. It covers all sectors of the country and all of the measures and issues. The report has highlighted the major achievements made by the government.What impressed me most is that China has managed to create over 13 million jobs for the citizens. And also plans to enact the Foreign Investment Law.China has made positive progress in the past year. China has been able to create more jobs and reduce poverty. The innovation made by China is also great. China has reached the far side of the moon, which is a big achievement. China has also opened up its market to the international community."Badolo Karim, journalist from Burkina FasoThe Government Work Report is a comprehensive report about the various activities carried out by the Chinese government in 2018.I think the opening-up policy will have an impact on my country because China will help my country in many fields.Camara Moussa, journalist from Malawi"The progress China has achieved during the past year is quite impressive. China has managed to boost its economy. China's opening-up policy has definitely helped my country."

                More than $152m raised for urban development goals at UN-Habitat
            </a>
            <p>
                Development partners on Wednesday pledged to contribute over $152 million aimed at financing the UN-Habitat's urban dimensions of the sustainable development goals, especially goal 11 that seeks to make cities inclusive, resilient and sustainable.This was announced during a side event at the ongoing UN-Habitat Assembly, with the funding commitment being made by 38 governments, 10 local governments and 32 other organizations including seven companies.Speaking during the event, Maimunah Sharif, the executive director of UN-Habitat, outlined her strategic plan aimed at helping countries to reduce spatial inequality and poverty as well as enhance the prosperity of cities.This is in addition to strengthening climate change action, improving the urban environment, and mitigating and responding to the urban crisis.She said the plan will be guided by the principles of social inclusion and human rights for all including women, children, youth, elderly, the disabled and other vulnerable groups.Sharif said one of the UN-Habitat's roles will be acting as a center of excellence, providing a point of reference on data, norms, standards, legal frameworks, policies, strategies and urban innovations.Lars Gronvald, head of cities section, directorate general for international cooperation and development at the European Commission, said sustainable development is currently at the forefront of the European Commission's development strategy because of its link to the transformation of society and sustainability.Gronvald stressed the need for different types of partnerships to implement the urban agenda.Armand Roland, mayor of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, said there is a need for integrated development encompassing security, housing, health, mobility, land, waste management, environmental protection and equitable access to urban social services.Roland said the will to mobilize resources, tools and capacity building was important for managing emerging cities. He termed UN-Habitat as an important partner for local governments.Alexandre Pinho, Microsoft Global lead for the UN, said the private sector plays an important role in providing technologies for sustainable urbanization.Pinho said cities are important hubs of opportunity where the digital dimension is critical in planning innovative and sustainable urban development."Start with the outcomes and then build the partnerships that you need to create larger impact," he said.

                Land for Life Award winners named at forum
            </a>
            <p>
                The UNCCD 2019 Land for Life Award was given to three winners at the awarding ceremony of the seventh Kubuqi International Desert Forum, which took place at the Elion Ecological Demonstration Area in Ordos, North China Inner Mongolia autonomous region, on July 27.The Land for Life Award is dedicated to recognizing individuals, groups, organizations and businesses for their innovation and efforts towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).This year's land for Life Award goes to Yun Dan, incumbent head of the Department of Finance of Tibet autonomous region, the MERET project of the Ministry of Agriculture of Ethiopia and Mathieu Ouedraogo from Burkina Faso to honor their effective efforts in desert control and green development.Ibrahim Thiaw, executive secretary of UNCCD, along with Wang Wenbiao, chairman of Elion Public Welfare Foundation, presented the awards.Yun Dan played an active role in overcoming technological challenges to plant trees in the high-altitude Nagqu area of Tibet, alleviating poverty through ecological compensation by creating close to 300 000 foresting-related jobs.The MERET project of the Ministry of Agriculture of Ethiopia was created to respond to the food crises of the 1970s. Since then, it has enabled the restoration of more than 2.5 million hectares of degraded watersheds in more than 72 districts, reducing food shortages by 50 per cent and lifting millions of people out of poverty.Mathieu Ouedraogo from Burkina Faso was honored for his lifelong commitment in land restoration, developing and promoting contour stone bunds – a simple water harvesting technique combined with zaï planting, which has proven very efficient in empowering farmers of the Sahel region.This is the third year that the Land of Life Award has been presented at the Kubuqi International Desert Forum. In 2015, the Elion Resources Group was recognized by the prize for its contribution to managing more than 6,000 square kilometers and lifting 102,000 people out of poverty. In 2017, the award was awarded to the Watershed Organization Trust from India, the UN Environment and Practical Action Sudan from Sudan and Pan Yingzhen from China.

                Violence forces 2m children out of school
            </a>
            <p>
                Fourteen-year-old Omar Hussaini, who hails from a village in northern Burkina Faso, is supposed to be spending his days in school like others of his age.But last year. a violent conflict forced the closure of Hussaini's school and his family to flee their home for safety.Hussaini recalls the fateful day: "I was in class in my village. We heard people screaming, then gun shots. They shot at our teachers, killing one of them. They burned down the classrooms. I was scared. I felt weak and lost. Then we just ran," he said."I used to love school, to read, to count and to play during recess. It's been a year since I last went to school," he told UNICEF.Similarly, Fanta Mohamet lives in a makeshift tent in a settlement in Zamai, a village in the far north region of Cameroon, along with 1,500 other displaced people, about 900 of whom are children.Mohamet, 14, attends school near the refugee settlement where she landed after the Boko Haram Islamist group attacked her family, killing her father and brother, and kidnapping her only sister.The widespread abduction of girls often targets those who are in school, as Boko Haram and some other armed groups in West and Central Africa object to educating girls.According to recent research by UNICEF, nearly 2 million children in thee regions are being robbed of education due to violence and insecurity.The report states that Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Niger and Nigeria have faced threats and attacks against students, teachers and schools.As of June, 9,272 schools were closed in the region, affecting more than 1.91 million children and nearly 44,000 teachers.Cameroon is the worst-hit country, accounting for nearly half of the schools closed across the region.As of June, 4,437 schools were closed in Cameroon, pushing more than 609,000 children out of school. In Burkina Faso, more than 2,000 schools were closed along with more than 900 in Mali.The report states that about one in four children globally who need humanitarian support, including education and other services critical to learning, live in just 10 countries in West and Central Africa.Out-of-school children face the risk of recruitment by armed groups. Girls, on the other hand, face an elevated risk of gender-based violence and are often forced into child marriage, with ensuing early pregnancies and childbirth that threaten their lives and health.UNICEF is calling on governments in the region to reaffirm their commitment to education. "Now is the time for renewed efforts to make sure the potential of a generation of young people is not wasted," UNICEF said in a statement.To salvage the children's future, the UN agency is working with governments to offer alternative types of schooling."Conflict in this region has taught us that while a traditional classroom is preferable, it is not the only place to provide learning activities," UNICEF said.Since 2016, UNICEF and the Children's Radio Foundation have collaborated on piloting an innovative Radio Education in Emergencies program.The initiative provides up to nine months of broadcast lessons in literacy and numeracy, along with lifesaving messages about living in conflict.
