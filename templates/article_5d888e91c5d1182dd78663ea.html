                LONDON - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ended a hectic day in Luxembourg Monday insisting Britain will leave the European Union on Oct. 31.Johnson held talks with President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker. He gave an interview to British reporters to explain his side of how the day had progressed.Johnson said there has been movement in talks in trying to find an alternative plan to the Irish backstop to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.He said: "We are now at the stage where we need to start accelerating the work and that was the agreement today with Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier (the EU's chief Brexit negotiator)."Yes there is a good chance of a deal, yes I can see the shape of it. Everybody can see roughly what could be done."Johnson said: "I will uphold the constitution. I will obey the law but we will come out on October 31st. We're going to come out on October 31st and it's vital that people understand that the UK will not extend. We won't go on remaining in the EU beyond October. What on earth is the point?"Ian Blackford, leader at Westminster of the Scottish National Party (SNP) was critical of Johnson's assessment, accusing him of being guilty of "dealing in fiction, not in facts".He said the meeting between Johnson and Juncker confirmed the British government has failed to bring forward a single proposal to "end the Brexit mess". "Boris Johnson must stop dealing in fiction and start addressing the facts," he added.On the events in Luxembourg, the EU said the aim of what was the first meeting between Juncker and Johnson was to take stock of the ongoing technical talks between the EU and Britain and to discuss the next steps.The statement added that Juncker recalled it is Britain's responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions that are compatible with the Brexit withdrawal agreement.Juncker underlined the commission's continued willingness and openness to examine whether such proposals meet the objectives of the backstop."Such proposals have not yet been made," the statement said.The statement added the European Council meeting on Oct. 17 will be an important milestone in the process, adding the 27 member states of the bloc remain united.Juncker is to address the European parliament on Wednesday morning in Strasbourg, the statement concluded.Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel went ahead with the media briefing, with the place prepared for Johnson left empty.Bettel said the only solution that protected the EU's single market and prevented a hard Irish border was the Brexit withdrawal agreement that has already been rejected three times by politicians in Britain's House of Commons.Johnson said he had cancelled attending the conference with Bettel because of concerns they would be "drowned" by protesters."I don't think it would have been fair to the Prime Minister of Luxembourg. I think there was clearly going to be a lot of noise," Johnson told British reporters.In London, Downing Street described the meeting with Juncker as constructive, saying the pair agreed contact between Britain and the European Commission would be stepped up in the coming days.Johnson's focus will switch Tuesday to the Supreme Court, Britain's highest legal chamber. A panel of judge will start to hear a case claiming that Johnson had been unlawful in the way he prorogued, or suspended, the British Parliament last week until Oct. 14.

                    Johnson meets EU president for Brexit talks
                </p>

                British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was hopeful that progress could be made in Brexit talks with the European Union on Monday as European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warned that time is running out.The British PM had said he would make clear he would reject any offer to delay Brexit further than Oct 31, in the first meeting between the pair since Johnson took office in July.The two men were joined at lunch by the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, while Johnson was accompanied by Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and Downing Street's Brexit representative David Frost.Juncker, who will stand down as European commission president on Oct 31, was expected to ask Johnson to spell out his ideas for replacing the Irish backstop.The backstop is the controversial policy in the existing withdrawal agreement, rejected three times by members of Parliament, which would require the UK to follow the EU's customs rules to ensure there are no physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Johnson had said there were "real signs of movement" in Berlin, Paris and Dublin on getting rid of the backstop, the persistent stumbling block to a Brexit agreement. "A huge amount of progress is being made," he told the Daily Mail.But the Guardian newspaper quoted EU officials involved in talks with Johnson's envoy, David Frost, as saying this upbeat account was not an accurate assessment of the situation."No, in fact people are a bit dismayed," said one EU source, describing the mood. "I am not even going to call them negotiations — the last session on Friday did start touching on content — that's actually quite a step forward … but we still should have been there a long time ago and (an end result) is still quite far away."Reports have suggested Johnson is considering a plan to keep Northern Ireland more closely aligned to the EU after Brexit, as an alternative to the current backstop.A Downing Street source told the BBC that Johnson would make clear to Juncker that "he would not countenance any more delays" beyond Oct 31."The PM will stress to Juncker that, while he wants to secure a deal, if no deal can be agreed by Oct 18 his policy is to leave without a deal on Oct 31 — and reject any delay offered by the EU."The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the whole issue of whether the United Kingdom had the legal right to leave on Oct 31, come what may, could end up in court.Meanwhile, at their annual conference on Sunday, Britain's Liberal Democrats overwhelmingly approved the party's plan of going into an election with the promise to revoke Brexit without a referendum.The Liberal Democrats would still support a second Brexit referendum with an option of remain, but going into an election would promise to revoke article 50, the process of leaving the EU, if the party won an absolute majority — seen as highly unlikely.The party's leader, Jo Swinson, said the policy would allow the Liberal Democrats to be "straightforward with people in an election", and that it would be odd for a Liberal Democrat government to be obliged to negotiate a Brexit deal it did not support just to put it to a referendum.
