                CINCINNATI - Three-time Grand Slam champion Andy Murray said he "did OK" in his first singles match in seven months - a 6-4,6-4 loss to Richard Gasquet at the Cincinnati Masters on Monday."I don't really know what I was expecting, to be honest," said Murray, sidelined since January by a career-threatening hip injury."I did OK. There were a lot of things I would like to have done better in the match, but you also have to be somewhat realistic in terms of what you can expect, in terms of how you actually play and hit the ball."

                    Chinese swimmer Sun Yang allowed public trial for doping hearing
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Controversial Chinese swimmer Sun Yang will get a public hearing by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) over an appeal brought by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) against him and the Federation Internationale De Natation Association (FINA) which claimed Sun did not violate doping regulations after an out-of-competition test last year.The open hearing by the Court of Arbitration for Sport will probably be in Switzerland but is "unlikely to be before the end of October," the court said on its website Tuesday, and "will be open to the public (including the media)."The court did not reveal the exact date and gave no detail of which party asked to postpone the process. It was previously reported to be scheduled in September.Public trial is not common in the court's history as Sun will be only following another three-time Olympic swimming champion, Michelle Smith de Bruin of Ireland, as the only athlete opting not to have a closed-door hearing in the court's 35-year history.Smith de Bruin challenged a four-year ban imposed by FINA in 1998 two years after the Atlanta Olympics for allegedly tampering with a urine sample by adding alcohol.A panel of three CAS judges heard the case over two days in May 1999 in its home city Lausanne, Switzerland, and upheld the original verdict.Details of evidence in the previously confidential court process were published on the eve of the world championships held last month in South Korea.Swimmers from Australia, Britain, and the United States objected to Sun being allowed to compete in Gwangju while the appeal case was pending. After Sun won the 200 and 400 meters freestyle events, medalists from Australia and Britain made silent protests at the podium.The first male Olympic swimming champion of the country won two gold medals at the 2012 London Olympics and one in Rio de Janeiro four years later. He could be banned from the Tokyo Games next year because of incidents at his home in China last September.A collection team sent to take blood and urine sample failed to complete its work in an escalating late-night dispute.Sun disputed an official's credentials, and a vial of blood handed over to his entourage was destroyed with a hammer.WADA challenged swimming body FINA's verdict in January that a warning was enough for Sun, who served a three-month ban in 2014 for a positive test.The CAS hearing should be the first in public since the European Court of Human Rights last year said athletes should have more rights to open the sports court to scrutiny.

                Competing for gold in next month's World Para Swimming Championships at London's Aquatic Centre will be a dream realized for Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games hopeful Wang Lichao from China.The 25-year-old made a big impression at a major international event in April when he smashed two world records on his World Series debut in Indianapolis, and now he has set his sights on more glory.The World Para Swimming Championships, the largest para swimming championships outside of the Paralympic Games, will take place from Sept 9-15 at the venue that hosted the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games swimming competitions.When the British capital hosted the Games in 2012, Wang was watching on television,wishing that he might one day compete at the iconic pool, under the bright lights and with the crowds cheering him on."I remember thinking at the time, 'it would be great if I could stand-out and compete in front of a big crowd like that, in such a spectacular and eye-catching place'," Wang said.Wang, from Zhejiang province in Eastern China, made an encouraging Paralympic Games debut at Rio 2016, where he won a bronze medal in the men's 50 meter butterfly S6 class.He said he felt "very honored" to win a medal in Rio, having only taken up swimming at the age of 13, five years after an electrical accident which resulted in him losing both arms."It was the first time I had won a medal in such a big competition — I was happy at the time, but I knew clearly that I still had to work hard," he said.

                    Zhong aims to pedal to another gold
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China's cycling queen Zhong Tianshi is anxious to inspire residents of the "kingdom of bicycles" to further embrace the sport through a successful defense of her gold medal at next year's Tokyo Olympics.With road races gaining more popularity in recent years, the public perception of biking has gone from being just a means of everyday transportation to a healthy lifestyle choice.As the face of cycling in China, Zhong hopes to accelerate that process."I think only by helping people realize that riding bikes is more than just a way of transportation, and getting more people to embrace it as a serious exercise, can we call ourselves a strong biking nation," Zhong told China Daily at the launch of the 10th Tour of China road race in Beijing earlier this week.As ambassador of the Sept 7-22 event, Zhong will show up at the final stop of the 11-stage race across five provinces."To try to defend my title at the Olympics and pedal for more golds is the best I can do to help bring more attention to the sport," said the 28-year-old Shanghai native.A sprinting specialist with exceptional late-race acceleration, Zhong partnered with now-retired Gong Jinjie to win the team sprint final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janerio, bringing home China's only Olympic gold in cycling.The tandem clocked 31.928 seconds in their first-round sprint in Rio, which still stands as the world record in the team discipline.Zhong and Gong had also set the fastest time at the world championships in London earlier this year but were relegated in the final against Russian pair Daria Shmeleva and Anastasia Voinova.Less than a year out from the Tokyo Games, Zhong is vowing to fill the vacancy in her trophy collection for a major international individual title."Leading up to Tokyo, I am focusing more on improving my strength and endurance, which will consequently enhance our team's competitiveness," she said."My goal for Tokyo is to go for gold in both disciplines as hard as I can."After being hampered by a nagging lower-back injury that forced her to settle for bronze at the 2017 National Games, Zhong missed this year's track cycling world championships in Poland due to a rib fracture.She said a return to top form could take longer than anticipated after she struggled to keep up with the grueling pace and heavy workload during a recent training camp in Spain that involved daily rides of up to 100 kilometers.With Zhong still recovering her full strength, Hong Kong rival Lee Wai Sze is consolidating her supremacy in the individual events after claiming the sprint title at the worlds.The 32-year-old Lee now tops the elite sprint ranking by the International Cycling Union, having won four of six UCI World Cup series events in the 2018-19 season.Zhong said she will embrace the challenge against Lee at the upcoming Asian Championships, the World Cup series and next year's worlds in Berlin as invaluable tuneups for Tokyo.In the team event, Zhong is confident her chemistry with new partner Lin Junhong, who joined the team following Gong's retirement in October 2017, will reap benefits in Tokyo."Lin is one of my best friends, we are close in life and of course it will boost our performance riding with each other on the track," Zhong said."She is a good partner. I trust her, we can win more golds in the future."In their first major international outing, Zhong and Lin clocked 33.118 seconds to win gold ahead of Hong Kong pair Lee and Ma Wing Yu at last year's Asian Games in Indonesia.
