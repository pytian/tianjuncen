                DPRK fires projectiles, denouncing US drills
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                In an apparent show of protest against the ongoing joint military exercise by Seoul and Washington, Pyongyang fired two short-range projectiles into its eastern waters on Tuesday, the fourth such launch in less than two weeks.According to a statement from the Republic of Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, the projectiles, presumed to have been short-range ballistic missiles, were launched at 5:24 am and 5:36 am local time on Tuesday. Each projectile was launched from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's southwestern county of Kwail. Both flew around 450 kilometers before splashing into the East Sea.The first recent launch was on July 25 when Pyongyang fired two rounds of a new type of ballistic missiles. It hadn't launched any missiles in the previous 77 days. It then conducted two additional launches on July 31 and Aug 2.Media from the ROK said that all three previous launches involved a new type of short-range ballistic missiles, known as the DPRK version of Russia's Iskander code-named "KN-23". But the DPRK said the last two tests, conducted on July 31 and Aug 2, involved a new "multiple launch guided rocket system".Tuesday's firing also came a day after the ROK and the United States began their combined military exercise as scheduled, despite the DPRK's repeated warnings against it.In a fresh warning after the firing on Tuesday, DPRK's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the ROK-US joint exercise violated a series of agreements that it had signed with the US and the ROK, adding that it could seek "a new road" other than engagement."Seoul and Washington authorities remain outwardly talkative about dialogue. But when they sit back, they sharpen a sword to do us harm," the ministry said, according to the DPRK's state Korean Central News Agency in an English dispatch."If the US and the ROK authorities trust to luck, disregarding our repeated warnings, we will make them pay heavy price which will in turn make them very much difficult," it added.Analysts said the tests are conducted to pressure Washington to offer more concessions."The negotiations have been at a standstill since the no-deal summit between US President Donald Trump and DPRK top leader Kim Jong-un in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February, and after an impromptu meeting between the pair at the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjom in June, the situation is still stalemated even if the two sides agree to resume working-level talks," said Wang Junsheng, an associate research fellow at the National Institute of International Strategy under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.These type of firings are not threatening, but rather intended to get attention and to add to Pyongyang's bargaining chips in negotiations, Wang said."However, the situations has hardly changed at the moment," Wang said, as he explained that no one wants to be the first to make concessions and break the deadlock."Unless Washington is willing to back down on sanctions and Seoul is willing to scale down its military dependence on Washington in exchange for Pyongyang's disarmament in the upcoming working-level talks, the standoff is likely to continue for some time," he added.

                    Trump says he received letter from DPRK's Kim

                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump said on Friday that he had received a "beautiful" letter from Kim Jong-un, top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).Trump told the press before departing the White House for New York State that he received a "three-paged" "very beautiful letter" from Kim on Thursday, in which Kim expressed dissatisfaction with the military exercises of US and Republic of Korea.Trump also believed that he and Kim would be having another meeting, without mentioning the possible date and location.The denuclearization negotiations between the United States and the DPRK have been stalled since the second summit between Trump and Kim ended with no agreement in February in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi.At the end of June, Trump and Kim met at the inter-Korean border, and the two leaders agreed to set up teams to resume the working level negotiation in weeks. But the negotiation has not taken place yet.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday told the press that he was hopeful that Washington and Pyongyang would get back to the negotiating table in the coming weeks.The DPRK has conducted multiple short-range missile tests in less than two weeks. The Trump administration, Trump himself included, repeatedly downplayed the significance of these tests, pointing out that the missiles are short-ranged thus did not violate the agreement between Trump and Kim.The official Korean Central News Agency reported Wednesday that Kim watched the demonstration launching of new-type tactical guided missiles at daybreak Tuesday, sending an adequate warning to the US-ROK joint military drill underway.

                    ROK's president vows to build peace economy with DPRK via dialogue
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                SEOUL - The Republic of Korea (ROK)'s President Moon Jae-in vowed Thursday to build a peace economy on the Korean Peninsula with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) through dialogue and cooperation.Moon made the remarks in his address on the 74th anniversary of the Liberation Day to mark the liberation of the peninsula from the 1910-1945 Japanese colonization."We aim to establish a peace economy in which prosperity is achieved through peace and also complete our liberation through the unification of the peninsula," Moon said."The peace economy begins with the efforts to continue dialogue and cooperation so that DPRK can choose economic prosperity over nuclear program upon the foundation of complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," Moon said.The denuclearization talks between the DPRK and the United States have been stalled, but the working-level talks between the two sides would be resumed in the near future after top DPRK leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump met at the inter-Korean truce village of Panmunjom in June, he said."In spite of a series of worrying actions taken by DPRK recently, the momentum for dialogue remains unshaken," he added."Now is the time for both Koreas and the United States to focus on resuming working-level negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington at the earliest possible date," the president said.The DPRK fired off short-range projectiles in recent weeks in an apparent protest against the ongoing joint annual military exercises of ROK and the United States.The ROK's leader urged the DPRK to return to the dialogue table."When economic cooperation accelerates (between the two Koreas) and the peace economy begins, unification will beckon as stark reality before us someday," Moon added.

                    US envoy for DPRK says US ready to engage in working-level talks with DPRK
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                SEOUL - Stephen Biegun, US special representative for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) affairs, said Wednesday that his country was ready to engage in working-level talks with Pyongyang for the Korean Peninsula's denuclearization.Biegun made the remark after a meeting in Seoul with Lee Do-hoon, the Republic of Korea (ROK)'s special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, according to local media reports."We are prepared to engage (in a working-level dialogue with the DPRK) as soon as we hear from our counterparts in North Korea (DPRK)," said Biegun.The US envoy said he will be "fully committed to this important mission" as US President Donald Trump gave him the assignment to resume working-level talks with the DPRK following the US president's meeting with top DPRK leader Kim Jong-un in late June.Kim and Trump held an impromptu meeting at the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjom on June 30, agreeing to restart a working-level dialogue to implement the Singapore agreement, signed by the two leaders during their first-ever summit in Singapore in June last year.The two leaders met again in late February in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi, but the second DPRK-US summit ended without any agreement. Under the Singapore deal, Kim and Trump agreed to the complete denuclearization of and the peace settlement in the peninsula.Lee, the ROK's nuclear envoy, told reporters that he had a productive dialogue with Biegun as they discussed how to rapidly resume talks between Pyongyang and Washington and make substantive progress in the negotiation for the denuclearization.He noted that Biegun visited Seoul at a proper time when efforts were necessary to restart the DPRK-US working-level talks.Biegun arrived here from Japan Tuesday evening, right after the end of the ROK-US joint military exercises.The combined forces of ROK and the United States staged the command post computer-simulated military drills for about two weeks to verify the ROK's military's initial operational capability (IOC) for the transfer of wartime operational control of the ROK's troops from Washington to Seoul.ROK's wartime operational command was handed over to the US-led UN Command after the three-year Korean War broke out in 1950. Seoul regained its peacetime command in 1994.The DPRK lambasted the ROK-US joint military drills as a rehearsal for northward invasion, test-firing short-range projectiles into the East Sea before and during the drills to protest against it.During his three-day trip, Biegun was scheduled to meet with senior ROK's government officials, including Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul later in the day and Kim Hyun-chong, a deputy director of the National Security Office (NSO) of the presidential Blue House, on Thursday.

                    Since Greenland isn't for sale, Trump cancels upcoming Denmark visit
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - Two days after he said buying Greenland wasn't a top priority, US President Donald Trump canceled an upcoming trip to Denmark, which counts the mostly frozen island as part of its kingdom, after its prime minister dismissed the idea. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen had called Trump's musing about buying the autonomous Danish territory "an absurd discussion" after the former real estate mogul-turned-president began to talk up the idea. At a meeting on Tuesday in Iceland of the Nordic government leaders, Greenland Premier Kim Kielsen said Trump's idea "is not something to joke about". Trump said on Sunday that he was interested in such a deal for strategic purposes, but said a purchase was not a priority at this time. "It's not No 1 on the burner," he told reporters. Trump even joked about his proposal as it came in for ridicule, tweeting a doctored photo of a glistening Trump skyscraper looming over a small village in the Arctic territory. "I promise not to do this to Greenland," he joked on Monday. But on Tuesday, Trump abruptly canceled the visit, also by tweet. Just a few hours earlier, the US ambassador to Denmark tweeted that it was "ready for the POTUS @realDonaldTrump visit!" using an acronym for "President of the United States" along with Trump's Twitter handle. Trump wrote: "Denmark is a very special country with incredible people, but based on Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's comments, that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland, I will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time." He added: "The prime minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the United States and Denmark by being so direct. I thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future!" White House spokesman Judd Deere said later that the visit to Denmark has been canceled. The White House announced in late July that Trump had accepted an invitation to visit Denmark's Queen Margrethe and participate in a series of meetings, including with Frederiksen and business leaders. The trip, set to begin at the end of August, includes a stop in Poland to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the start of World War II. Trump is expected to go ahead with the Warsaw visit. Asked about Greenland on Sunday as he prepared to return to Washington after a vacation week at his central New Jersey home, Trump said "strategically ... it would be nice" to own the island. He also suggested he might not visit Denmark at all, saying he didn't think the previously announced trip had been "absolutely set in stone yet". Agencies - Xinhua (China Daily 08/22/2019 page11)

                    DPRK warns ROK of new cold war
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                PYONGYANG - The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) warned Thursday that "dangerous and unusual military moves" by the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the United States would trigger a new cold war on the Korean Peninsula.In a statement released by official Korean Central News Agency, a spokesperson from the Foreign Ministry said ROK was introducing "F-35A" stealth fighters -- "a cutting-edge lethal equipment" -- from the United States after the just-ended joint military exercises.The act "is a grave provocation that has openly denied the joint declarations and the military agreement" between the two sides on the Korean Peninsula, he said.The spokesperson said that the hostile military moves, including the US-ROK joint military exercises and the build-up of armed forces in ROK, are reducing the dynamics of dialogue for building a lasting and durable peace on the Korean Peninsula, and compel the DPRK to "weigh a realistic way of turning our attention more to strengthening the physical deterrence."The DPRK fired two unidentified projectiles into the sea off its east coast on Aug 16, the sixth round of launches in recent weeks, shortly after it denounced the US-ROK military drills and declared that inter-Korean talks were over.The spokesperson also mentioned that the United States has recently test-fired the intermediate-range cruise missile and plans to deploy a large quantity of offensive military equipment such as "F-35" stealth fighters and "F-16V" fighters in Japan and other surrounding areas of the Korean Peninsula, thus adding to the regional arms race and confrontation and calling for the DPRK's greatest vigilance.However, the spokesperson said his country remains unchanged in its position to "resolve all issues in a peaceful manner through dialogue and negotiation."Denuclearization talks between the DPRK and the United States have been stalled, despite a commitment made to revive them at a meeting on June 30 between DPRK top leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump along the border separating the two Koreas.

                    DPRK says hopes for talking with US fading
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                PYONGYANG - A senior official of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) warned on Saturday that the hopes for talks with the United States are fading, and Washington should be blamed for pushing Pyongyang to reconsider its measures."Our expectations of dialogue with the US are gradually disappearing and we are being pushed to reexamine all the measures we have taken so far," DPRK's First Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said in a statement released by the official Korean Central News Agency.Choe accused US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of spewing unreasonable utterance by stating that the United States recognized that "North Korea's rogue behavior could not be ignored.""What he uttered to seriously insult us by even using such phrase as 'rogue behavior' is just improper language, for which the US administration will surely regret," Choe said."Pompeo has gone so far in his language and it made the opening of the expected DPRK-US working-level negotiations more difficult. It, moreover, added to the Korean people's bad blood toward Americans," the statement stressed.During their impromptu meeting at the inter-Korean border on June 30, DPRK top leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump agreed to resume the working-level talks on the denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula that have been stalled since their no-deal summit in Hanoi in late February.
