                Lothar Herrmann shapes Siemens' efforts to help Chinese firms evolve in high-techLothar Herrmann, president and CEO of Siemens China, first came to Beijing as the company's executive in the 1990s. At that time, he knew the road ahead would be challenging, yet full of possibilities.In 1995 alone, the German conglomerate established as many as 13 operating companies across China. Herrmann was personally involved in the early phase, which laid a strong foundation for Siemens' subsequent success in China."My fascination with China has been growing ever since," he said, adding when it comes to growing the company's investment in China, what he has in mind are China's surging demand for digital solutions, fast-growing urbanization pace and share of the global gross domestic product.Many opportunities also come from Siemens' Chinese partners who have a need to upgrade their products and boost work efficiency. The larger plan is to strengthen the country's complete industrial chain, as well as other growth drivers such as the Belt and Road Initiative, the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).Herrmann said the GBA's vibrant bay economy is taking shape at a brisk speed and on a massive scale. Group wisdom is certainly needed now more than ever. Collaboration, digitalization and talent are the key levers for the future development of the GBA, he said.Attracted by the GBA's ultimate goal of building a world-class city cluster that is ecologically safe, socially stable, economically robust and culturally attractive by 2035, Siemens plans to provide technological support focusing on five priorities: enabling clean energy; developing digital manufacturing; building smart city cluster; driving innovation; and nurturing talent to support the region's development.Over 45 percent of fossil power plants across China use Siemens' turbine technologies, Herrmann said. Siemens is now working with China Resources Power Holdings to build digital power plants in China.The AI-enabled central analysis system keeps learning from history and real-time data to support remote early warning, advanced diagnosis and performance optimization. In the future, CR Power's generators in the GBA could also connect to this system.Siemens has enabled digital transformation of hundreds of Chinese industrial enterprises from a number of sectors so far. Its digital enterprise solutions have helped auto equipment manufacturer Mino transform from an assembly line builder to an intelligent solutions provider with engineering time shortened by one-third and on-site commissioning efficiency increased by 50 percent.MindSphere, Siemens' cloud-based open internet of things, or IoT, operating system, is designed to help customers evaluate and leverage data to gain new insights and turn data into value.The company launched its first Smart City Digital Hub in Hong Kong in 2017. As a collaborative initiative and an open lab, the hub allows researchers to develop solutions in the fields of data analytics and smart infrastructure that benefit Hong Kong and other GBA cities.Herrmann said Zhuhai of South China's Guangdong province can be a convincing example to build interconnectivity of city infrastructure. The city has adopted Siemens' integrated traffic management system to leverage data from multiple transportation modes.In addition, the company has provided signaling systems to 37 metro lines in 16 Chinese cities, including a number of projects in the GBA.For the GBA to grow to be a global innovation and technology hub, an open innovation ecosystem would be ideal. Governments, businesses and academia should work together to massively apply digital technologies that are future-oriented. They should enjoy opportunities to share, collaborate and succeed in the digital age. Continuous reform and opening-up are also needed to remove systemic barriers for better synergies among innovators and cities, he said.The company has already made available such technologies relating to AI, edge-computing and cybersecurity, he said."China is an opportunity for foreign companies. The enormous market potential, the customer base willing to try new things, and the quality of talent ... all make the country an important investment destination."The Munich- and Berlin-headquartered group has already partnered with over 100 Chinese companies from both State-owned and private sectors to serve more than 100 markets globally with its global network, industrial expertise, accumulated knowledge of the local customs and legal environment to jointly develop economies related to the BRI.Siemens generated a revenue of 8.1 billion euros ($8.93 billion) in China in 2018. Siemens has 21 research and development hubs, with more than 5,000 researchers and engineering staff, part of its global personnel of over 35,000. It has around 13,000 active patents and patent applications in China as well.Sun Fuquan, a researcher at the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development, said demand for automation manufacturing in China is among the world's fastest-growing. Many domestic companies are seeking solutions to get products to market faster at lower costs, to improve their asset utilization and cut associated risks.While large companies are making notable strides in terms of digital transformation, many global technology and solution providers have also begun to allocate financial resources to innovation and marketing channel expansion for small and medium-sized enterprises. They are keen to restore their core strength, as well as forming new cross-industry partnerships with other players, he said.

                    Shanghai announces AI talent development plan
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Shanghai has announced an artificial intelligence talent plan recruiting leading researchers under the age of 30.The Class A Project was proposed by founders and scientists of 20 AI startup companies, with an aim of fostering the next generation of local AI talent through collaboration of industry and academia, financial services and other initiatives.The first batch of 15 candidates comes from over 10 universities such as the University of California Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon University, Stanford University, and China's Peking University, Tsinghua University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University.With an average of 26, the group covers a wide range of AI research themes such as computing vision, natural language processing, machine learning, robots and data mining.Shanghai should draw experience from Silicon Valley, where technology, talent and career have formed a closed loop for AI development, said Zhu Mingjie, CraiditX Technology CEO and executive director of the Shanghai AI Young Scientists Alliance."It is very dangerous if an enterprise operates purely as a lab that lacks effective exposure to the market," Zhu said."Technology should look for clients, occupy the market and generate productivity. Key to productivity is talent, who need proper guidance and talent scouts."Lu Cewu, professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiaotong University, said the industry is in severe demand of two types of talent: scientists with the ability for fundamental research that can lead to original breakthroughs, as well as those who are able to translate these ideas into pragmatic product designs.He said AI courses in universities are conducive to filling the gap for application-focused talent, but it may take longer to nurture researcher-oriented talent, who can pioneer in genuine technology breakthroughs.

                Chinese and German institutions celebrate decades of academic excellence together Chinese universities and colleges have increased ties with German higher education institutions to provide domestic students with easier access to a wider variety of subjects. As Chinese higher education institutions were creating more diversified academic paths to the domestic students, a number of universities and colleges have enhanced their academic cooperation with German partners. For example, to begin talent cultivation and increase competitiveness regarding international programs, Qingdao University of Science and Technology has opened its new Sino-German campus. It will host 1,049 students this autumn. Foshan University is a higher education institution in technology and sciences based in Foshan city, Guangdong province. It gained permission to start its joint education program in environmental science with German university Hochschule Trier. They will start enrollment from 2020. This July, Jiangsu University of Technology celebrated the 15th anniversary of academic cooperation with Germany's Merseburg University of Applied Sciences. "In the 15 years of Sino-German academic cooperation in academy, more than 810 students have been sent to study in Germany in 13 consecutive years ... about 55 percent of the graduates choose to pursue further study or work in Germany. Most of the returning graduates are now working in German enterprises, banks and enterprises," said Zhu Linsheng, president of Jiangsu University of Technology. He Xingchu, an official with Jiangsu education department, spoke highly about the 15 years of achievement made by the joint effort of the institutions. "At present, the whole province is sparing no effort in pushing the quality of education in the province," he said. He hopes the joint project will promote the quality and efficiency of such an education model and play a leading role in future Sino-German cooperation projects. This year also marked the 20th anniversary of the Sino-German College of the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology - a cooperation project between the USST and Hamburg University of Applied Sciences. Liu Daoping, deputy Party secretary of the Party Committee of the USST, said that the achievements were due to the deep friendship and deep cooperation between the two universities and strong support from Shanghai and Hamburg. "Since the school started in 1988, Sino-German College has provided a large number of outstanding graduates with an international vision to all sectors of society and has become a name card for the internationalization of education of the USST," he said. He added the school will continue to seize the opportunity of development brought about by China-Germany relations. "The USST is rooted in the land of China and has been working ceaselessly in opening-up and promoting international cooperation in academia," said Ding Xiaodong, headmaster of the USST. He added that the university is aiming to improve its professional education through multi-certification systems in order to cultivate talent with an international vision and the ability to communicate across different cultures. Academic cooperation and cultural exchanges have been an important part of the Belt and Road Initiative. Pascal Abb, a senior researcher at the Austrian Study Centre for Peace and Conflict Resolution, said that the initiative does not just benefit China, Germany and other European countries. It will also bring vitality for development in the related economies, he said. Apart from education, the joint academic partnership also focuses on students after graduation. For example, the Sino-German College of Technology of East China University of Science and Technology requires its student to participate in at least 20 weeks of hands-on work to make sure they are prepared for the real world. "I'm very honored to be an intern at an emerging internet company. During my internship, I can always feel the innovations and energy," said Jiao Longhao. He is studying an electric engineering and automation major at the college. renxiaojin@chinadaily.com.cn  Visitors consult services at the country's booth at this year's China International Education Exhibition Tour in Beijing.Chen Xiaogen/for China Daily Contestants participate in a Sino-German automobile maintenance competition in Beijing.Wang Jing/china Daily Students from Germany practice calligraphy at a secondary school in Ruichang city, Jiangxi province.Wei Dongsheng/for China Daily(China Daily 09/07/2019 page12)

                    Smart city test bed
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Greater Bay Area can leverage its rich knowledge, human and financial resources to be pioneer China's Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area outline development plan has the potential to make the region a leader in smart cities. With a population of 70 million, the Greater Bay Area is equivalent to more than 12 percent of China's GDP. It includes Guangdong's nine key cities, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Foshan, and the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions. It is one of the most vibrant areas in the world and it has witnessed remarkable economic development in recent years. To facilitate innovative activities in the region, technology parks have been established to attract corporate research and development and to encourage the entry of local high-technology companies in the manufacturing sector. Utilizing the region's experience, accumulated by participating in the global supply chain for electronic products, many entrepreneurial companies have started to provide a variety of technologies and services. With large technological companies already established in the region and new start-ups being created, the Greater Bay Area is transforming itself into a leading innovation cluster. At the same time, the Greater Bay Area faces the serious challenge of achieving well-balanced progress in environmental, economic, and social aspects of sustainability. A key question is how the region can make best use of its rich knowledge, human and financial resources to create sustainable smart cities. For that, we need to understand and utilize the mechanisms involved in the innovation system for smart cities, with the lessons heeded for strategies in the future. It is particularly important to identify the knowledge and technological domains that have an advantage, key stakeholders in academia, industry and the public sector who can actively engage in innovation, and the institutional conditions and environments that facilitate cooperation and collaboration among them. Based on that, the Greater Bay Areas will be able to promote the drivers to stimulate innovative initiatives to form smart cities. Data-driven innovation such as the internet of things and artificial intelligence derive significant insights from the vast amount of data generated during the use of technologies and delivery of services every day. Therefore, training, the ability to learn from real-world use and experience, and adaptation, the capability to improve performance, become critical in the advancement of data-driven innovation. There is a great possibility that the Greater Bay Area will become a global open test bed for smart cities. As data-driven innovation is crucially dependent upon real-world uses and experiences, societal experimentation of technologies from an early stage of innovation plays a significant role. Active engagement and close collaboration with relevant stakeholders in business, academia, government and civil society will be key to implementing living laboratories for novel technologies. The existence of strong entrepreneurship producing numerous startups, coupled with support for their market entrance, will enable the region to be an excellent place for open innovation for smart cities. Data-driven innovation, which is advancing rapidly through trial and error, requires an appropriate governance system, as there are also growing concerns about safety, security and privacy. The regulatory sandbox is an approach that allows companies to test innovative products, services and business models in a live market environment, while ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in place. Potential benefits would include reducing the time and the cost of getting innovative ideas to market, enabling greater access to finance for innovators by reducing regulatory uncertainty, and allowing more products to be tested and potentially introduced to the market. As an increasing amount of various kinds of data is involved, it is of critical importance to manage open access, exchange, and sharing of data properly among stakeholders, while ensuring intellectual property rights receive fair protection. By establishing an international regulatory sandbox, the Greater Bay Area can become a global living laboratory in which entrepreneurs are encouraged to develop and experiment with novel technologies in close collaboration with stakeholders across the world.
