                Assange to face US extradition hearing in February 2020: report
            </p>
            <p>
                LONDON - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is expected to face an extradition hearing in February next year to decide whether he should be sent to the US, local media reported Friday.According to British newspaper The Guardian, Emma Arbuthnot, the chief magistrate at Westminster magistrates court, ordered on Friday that a full extradition hearing should begin on Feb 25, which would last for 5 days.British Home Secretary Sajid Javid told BBC's Today Program on Thursday that he has signed a US request for the extradition.Australian-born Assange, 47, faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison for each charge. He was initially accused of violating the US Espionage Act.He was sentenced to 50 weeks in jail in May for breaching the Bail Act in Britain after having been expelled from Ecuador's Embassy in London, where he was granted refuge in 2012 while on bail in Britain over sexual assault allegations against him in Sweden.Assange has said that he does not consent to being extradited to the US over charges related to leaking government secrets.

                Swedish court rules against detaining Julian Assange
            </a>
            <p>
                STOCKHOLM - A Swedish court ruled on Monday that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will not be detained for alleged rape, the country's prosecution authority said.The decision, however, does not mean that the prosecution must be terminated, Swedish News SVT reported. There is no requirement that he be brought to Sweden. Hearings may still be conducted in the United Kingdom.A detention hearing was held at Monday morning at Uppsala District Court.Sweden's Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions Eva-Marie Persson had requested that Assange be detained in order to face trial over rape allegations dating back to 2010.The investigation dates back in 2010, when Assange was accused of sexual molestation, coercion and rape. At the time, Assange denied the accusations but refused to be questioned in Sweden, fearing that Sweden would then extradite him to the US to face conspiracy charges.Assange fled to Britain soon after and was granted political asylum by the Embassy of Ecuador, where he had lived until April 2019.The misconduct and coercion cases were dropped in 2015 when the statute of limitations expired. The investigation into the alleged rape does not expire until August 2020, but was closed in 2017 after an assessment that Assange could not be extradited to Sweden for the foreseeable future.In April 2019, Assange lost diplomatic immunity and was arrested by UK authorities, making it possible for Sweden to resume the investigation.He was sentenced to 50 weeks in UK jail on May 1 for breaching his bail by entering the Ecuadorian embassy in London seven years ago.The UK is also currently pursuing an extradition request made by the US, in relation to Wikileak's release of a number of military and diplomatic documents.The US Justice Department said in May that it has filed 17 new charges against Assange, including receiving and unlawfully publishing classified military and diplomatic documents in 2010.

                Swedish attempt to extradite Assange is blocked
            </a>
            <p>
                Ruling prevents prosecutors from applying for warrant over 2010 rape allegationA Swedish court has rejected a request to detain Julian Assange in absentia, which means the nation's prosecutor will not immediately request his extradition from Britain.The WikiLeaks co-founder claimed political asylum in London's Ecuadorean embassy seven years ago to avoid extradition to Sweden over a 2010 rape allegation, which he has repeatedly denied.The Australian, who is in jail for breaching United Kingdom bail conditions, is also facing extradition to the United States on federal conspiracy charges related to leaks of government secrets.Swedish Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions Eva-Marie Persson told Uppsala District Court that Assange had not cooperated with the Swedish investigation previously, fleeing from an extradition order, and therefore needed to be detained and questioned in Sweden.The ruling by the district court prevents Swedish prosecutors from applying immediately for an extradition warrant for Assange to face the allegation of rape."As Julian Assange is currently serving a prison sentence, the investigation can proceed with the help of a European investigation order, which does not require Julian Assange's detention (in Sweden). The court therefore does not find it proportional to detain Julian Assange," the judgment said.Detention in a person's absence is a standard part of Swedish legal procedure if a suspect is outside the country or cannot be located, and which would be the first step to having him extradited from Britain.Assange's Swedish defense lawyer, Per Samuelson, argued that Assange's imprisonment in Britain meant there was no flight risk. "He is in prison for half a year at least, and he is detained on behalf of the United States. So there is no point detaining him in Sweden too," Samuelson said.He added that it was not proportionate to ask for someone's detention merely to conduct a questioning session. The court agreed with the defense, saying the prosecutor would be able to continue the investigation regardless."I fully respect the court's decision. They had to take a position on a difficult assessment issue, which I considered should be examined by a court," said Persson, in a statement on Monday."The investigation continues with interviews in Sweden. I will also issue a European investigation order in order to interview Julian Assange. No date has been set yet. We will constantly review the state of the investigation."Should Sweden allow an extradition request, it would be up to the UK where he would eventually be sent as it would compete with an extradition request from the US, where he is facing a total of 18 charges, most of which relate to obtaining and disseminating classified information over the publishing of military documents and diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.The US Justice Department has decided not to charge Julian Assange for his role in exposing some of the CIA's most secret spying tools, deciding instead to pursue one count of allegedly assisting former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning and a 17-count Espionage Act indictment.

                Assange supporters urge British public to lobby on his behalf
            </a>
            <p>
                Julian Assange is unlikely to win his case because of political reasons, according to the editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, who spoke at a press briefing in London on Tuesday."I don't believe we are going to win this in legal argument," said Kristinn Hrafnsson. "That's why I urge people to mobilize and put pressure on it because the judges are not acting in a vacuum. There is no chance that Julian will get a fair trial here, or in the US, unless there is a chance of reporting that people actually start speaking out."He urged members of the public to lobby their political representatives on Assange's behalf."There has to be pressure on politicians to intervene, because this is a corrupt political case," he said.Hrafnsson said Assange had been extremely unwell during the last 10 days and that he had been moved from Belmarsh prison in London to a hospital."We are not talking about a prosecution, we are talking about persecution," he added.The Independent newspaper, meanwhile, says the United States Justice Department delivered a formal extradition request for Assange on Thursday, meaning further US charges against the WikiLeaks co-founder are unlikely. The request was in line with a treaty between the US and the UK that requires such moves to be made within 60 days of an arrest. Assange was arrested on April 11.Assange is facing 18 charges in the US that mostly relate to obtaining and disseminating classified information in relation to the alleged publishing of military documents and diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website.The US Justice Department is understood to have decided not to charge Assange in connection with his alleged exposure of some of the CIA's most secret spying tools, deciding instead to pursue one count connected to allegedly assisting former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in leaking information, and a 17-count Espionage Act indictment.Assange is serving a 50-week sentence in the UK for breaching the nation's bail conditions as a result of him claiming political asylum in Ecuador's embassy in London in 2012. He reportedly entered the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden after that nation pursued him in connection with a 2010 rape allegation that Assange has repeatedly strenuously denied.He is still under investigation in Sweden for the alleged rape and a court there last week rejected a request from Swedish prosecutors to detain him in absentia, which suggests the nation's prosecutor will not immediately request his extradition from Britain.Christophe Marchand, a European Court of Human Rights and International Court of Justice lawyer, said at the press briefing on Tuesday: "We believe, from the human rights perspective, whistle-blowing is fundamental in the 21st century."He said, in the era of the internet, "WikiLeaks invented a system for whistle-blowers".

                US formally asks UK to extradite WikiLeaks' Assange
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - The US Justice Department has formally asked Britain to extradite WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to the United States to face charges that he conspired to hack US government computers and violated an espionage law, the UK has confirmed."Mr Assange was arrested in relation to a provisional extradition request from the United States of America. He is accused of offenses including computer misuse and the unauthorized disclosure of national defense information," a spokesperson for the Home Office, Britain's internal security department said."We have now received the full extradition request," the official told Reuters.Lawyers for Assange had no immediate comment.US and British security sources said US prosecutors sent the formal extradition request to UK authorities last week, shortly before the expiration of a legal deadline. The formal submission of the request was first reported on Tuesday by the Washington Post.On April 11, police forcibly removed the WikiLeaks founder from the Ecuadorean Embassy near Harrods department store in central London. Assange took refuge in the embassy there in 2012 while being sought by Swedish authorities for questioning in a sexual assault investigation.Sources familiar with the US extradition request said that it is based on an indictment federal prosecutors in Alexandria, Virginia filed against Assange in May. That indictment added 17 criminal counts to an earlier indictment, filed under seal in March 2018.The new charges include violation of a US espionage statute. The previous indictment alleged that Assange conspired with former US soldier Chelsea Manning to hack into a US government computer system.Manning was arrested and convicted by military court martial for leaking hundreds of thousands of US government reports to WikiLeaks. But her 35-year prison term was reduced to seven years by President Barack Obama and she was released from custody.However, Manning has now been jailed for refusing to testify before a Virginia-based federal grand jury which is continuing to investigate WikiLeaks. She faces potential daily fines if she continues to refuse to testify.After his removal from the Ecuadorean Embassy, Assange was jailed by a British court for 50 weeks for jumping bail while being sought by Swedish authorities in the sexual assault case.Britain will now consider the US extradition request and any possible new request from Sweden. A European government source familiar with British extradition procedures said it could take anywhere from two to five years for the US request for Assange's extradition to be resolved.Reuters

                Britain signs US extradition order for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange: report
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON -- British Home Secretary Sajid Javid has signed a US request for the extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who faces charges in the United States under the Espionage Act, local media reported Thursday."There's an extradition request from the US ... yesterday I signed the extradition order and certified it and that will be going in front of the courts tomorrow," British newspaper The Guardian quoted Javid as saying on BBC's Today Program on Thursday.Australian-born Assange, 47, faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison for all charges. He was initially accused of violating the US Espionage Act.However, multiple US media outlets said the new charges include one of conspiracy to receive national defense information, three of obtaining national defense information and 13 of disclosing national defense information."It is a decision ultimately for the courts, but there is a very important part of it for the home secretary and I want to see justice done at all times and we've got a legitimate extradition request, so I've signed it, but the final decision is now with the courts," said Javid.Assange was sentenced to 50 weeks in jail on May 2 for breaching the Bail Act in Britain after having been expelled from Ecuador's Embassy in London, where he was granted refuge in 2012 while on bail in Britain over sexual assault allegations against him in Sweden.Assange has said that he does not consent to being extradited to the United States over charges related to leaking government secrets.

                Airport turmoil shows the city is on a very slippery slope
            </a>
            <p>
                Just a few days ago, Hong Kong dodged a bullet — literally. Why do I say this? First, because nobody got shot even though we were just a hair trigger from such a tragic event.If you've seen the video footage of protesters trying to take a baton away from a lone policeman at the airport, forcing him to the ground, and finally backing off when the policeman pulled his service revolver, you will understand what I mean.The policeman involved deserves a medal. He kept his cool even though he appeared to be disoriented or injured. And despite the intense danger of the moment, he did not pull the trigger. As a matter of fact, the first shot has yet to be fired in anger from a police revolver despite so many of them having come under violent attack from rioters over the last two months. If nothing else, this speaks volumes about the discipline of Hong Kong's police officers.This is an important symbol of what makes Hong Kong special. Make no mistake, if a policeman in the United States had been attacked in this way, there would have been no hesitation. He would have emptied his magazine, and today we would be grieving and discussing the body count.Some of the protesters have come out with a public apology for what happened at the airport. They claimed to be frustrated and exhausted, and that this has led to poor judgment and the boiling-over of emotions.Sadly, this is far too little. I hope, for the sake of Hong Kong, that it is not too late.As a society, we must unequivocally condemn such violence. The protesters need to totally disavow all such violence going forward. If they cannot 100 percent guarantee that protests will remain peaceful henceforth, then they should simply stay at home.Beating up people just because they are from the Chinese mainland is totally unacceptable. Beating up reporters, or attacking the police, is unacceptable. Why? Because violence begets violence. And this will destroy Hong Kong.So, what to do about the violence that has already occurred? The protesters making the apology need to go far beyond just apologizing. Perhaps they could for a moment put themselves in the shoes of the Hong Kong police and the Hong Kong government. They could perhaps for a moment reflect on the levels of stress, fatigue, and frustration being experienced by people in those roles over the last several months. If they were to do this, they might understand that there is no "evil" afoot here. It's simply normal people doing their best for Hong Kong, and making mistakes in judgment and action just as the protesters admit having done at the airport.And then, they should consider dropping all preconditions, and agreeing to sit down and dialogue with the various different parties involved in this mess with the intention of creating a meaningful path forward.But we also need to dig deeper. Why did the violence break out in this way? What happened to those many tens of thousands of peaceful, patient people that we saw some weeks back? Yes, there is fatigue and frustration. But I think there is more going on.Perhaps some people think that a violent revolution in Hong Kong will spread into the Chinese mainland and turn the Chinese mainland into a Western-style democracy. To those people I say: "Dream on." Hoping that "violent revolution" in Hong Kong is somehow going to democratize the Chinese mainland is a child's fantasy. Any violence that happens in Hong Kong will only hurt Hong Kong. So, if you love Hong Kong, stop the violence.And there's something even deeper.I'm seeing on Twitter reports of protesters getting paid by "someone". The going rate is HK$8,000 ($1,020) per day just to show up and protest. And it's $10,000 for injuring or killing a member of the Hong Kong police force.Is this fact, rumor, or Hong Kong government psychological operations? I don't know for sure. What I do know for sure is that the US government funded riots and a coup in Venezuela with the goal of regime change. And there are others. Color revolutions in various countries over the past few years have been traced back to US financial and logistical backing, with clear documentation from organizations such as WikiLeaks showing this to be the case. We know that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is in Belmarsh prison in London, with the US trying to extradite him on charges of espionage simply for publishing information about US war crimes. So it's not too far-fetched to hypothesize that there are, indeed, "black hands" behind the violence that we have seen last week in Hong Kong.Anybody who truly cares about Hong Kong will never take money in order to either "show up" for a protest, or perpetrate any form of violence. A person who cares about Hong Kong will not beat up civilians from other places as they are passing through our airport!Let me be very clear. Anybody taking money to protest violently in Hong Kong is an enemy of this great city. Period,any protesters who truly care about Hong Kong should identify and totally reject every single person identified as serving the interests of groups or individuals from outside Hong Kong.Hong Kong is one of the best cities in the world. The violence we have seen does not represent Hong Kong. But, if it continues, it will harm Hong Kong very badly. We are on a very slippery slope, and we must get off before it's too late.The author is a psychologist, linguist, educator, entrepreneur, dialogue facilitator and corporate adviser with over 30 years' experience doing business in Asia.

                Cyber thief yells 'Stop thief!' while stealing all it can
            </a>
            <p>
                Editor's note: Some in the United States take great pains to fabricate "crimes" against China, and a new crime has been cooked up recently, that China is "hacking US computers to steal business secrets". Zhong Sheng, a columnist for People's Daily, comments:The US has long been engaged in large-scale and organized cyber espionage and surveillance activities against foreign governments, enterprises and individuals.No country in the world can match the US in cyber spying. According to information disclosed by Edward Snowden, a former US intelligence employee, the notorious "Prism" program operated by the US government monitors people's emails and social media communications without authorization, and even the leaders of some countries and international organizations have long been under covert monitoring by the US intelligence agencies. WikiLeaks released nearly 9,000 classified documents in 2017, showing the CIA had secretly infiltrated mobile phones, computers, smart TVs and other smart devices with its powerful hacking capabilities. Western media reports point out that "the US monitors 90 percent of global communications".What is more alarming is that US military and intelligence agencies have created the world's largest cyber arsenal that is comparable to nuclear weapons, triggering a cyber arms race around the world. In 2009, the US military established its Cyber Command, which was upgraded in 2017 to the 10th Joint Operations Command. According to Wiki-Leaks founder Julian Assange, the US is the world's leading cyber weapons power, with 2,000 kinds of weapons.According to a 2018 report published by National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China, the US has launched the largest number of cyber attacks, and in 2018, 3,325 IP addresses located in the US planted Trojan horses on 3,607 websites in China, a 43 percent increase over 2017. There is plenty of evidence that shows cyber theft and hacking are routine for the US.As a global concern, cyber security bears on the common interests of all countries and needs to be safeguarded by the international community. China firmly upholds cyber security and has never participated in any commercial spying. China is also a strong advocate of international cooperation on cyber security, insisting that commercial spying and hacking against government networks should be resolutely countered in accordance with relevant laws and international conventions.Cooking up the cyber espionage argument in an attempt to smear China's image has exposed the sinister intentions of some in the US.（409 Words in T

                Assange to remain in prison after sentence expires
            </a>
            <p>
                A British judge has ruled that WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange must remain in prison after the sentence he is currently serving expires and before he is due to face an extradition hearing to the United States, because of the likelihood of him trying to evade extradition.Assange took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2012 to try and avoid being sent to Sweden to face sexual offence allegations, and spent seven years there before being ejected in April this year.The 48-year-old was subsequently jailed for 50 weeks over the incident, and was due to be released from London's Belmarsh Prison on Sept 22, but at a court hearing, the judge said there was "substantial ground" to believe he might "abscond again"."I have given your lawyer an opportunity to make an application for bail on your behalf and she has declined to do so," said district judge Vanessa Baraitser."Perhaps not surprisingly in light of your history of absconding in these proceedings. In my view I have substantial ground for believing if I release you, you will abscond again."Assange, who appeared at the hearing via a video link, said he did not understand the ruling but "was sure the lawyers would explain it."He currently faces extradition to the US on computer hacking charges after then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid signed an order in June.The charge contains 18 counts, with some relating to the US Espionage Act. Assange is accused of soliciting and publishing classified information, much of it to do with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and conspiring to hack a government computer.A statement from the US justice department said WikiLeaks' publication of the material was "one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States", adding that "Assange's actions risked serious harm to United States national security to the benefit of our adversaries". If convicted, he faces a maximum of 175 years in prison.When the charges were announced, WikiLeaks Editor-in-Chief Kristinn Hrafnsson attacked the decision. "With the indictment, the 'leader of the free world' dismisses the First Amendment — hailed as a model of press freedom around the world — and launches a blatant extraterritorial assault outside its border, attacking basic principles of democracy in Europe and the rest of the world," he said.At the time of its issue, Javid said "It is a decision ultimately for the courts, but there is a very important part of it for the home secretary and I want to see justice done at all times and we've got a legitimate extradition request, so I've signed it, but the final decision is now with the courts."A preliminary hearing about the extradition case is scheduled for Oct 11, with a final verdict likely in February.
