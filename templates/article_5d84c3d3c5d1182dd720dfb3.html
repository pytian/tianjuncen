                Trump to place tariffs on Mexico over migration
            </p>
            <p>
                 US President Donald Trump said in a statement on Thursday that "to address the emergency at the Southern Border", he would impose a 5 percent tariff on all goods imported from Mexico, effective June 10."I am invoking the authorities granted to me by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act," Trump said. "If the illegal migration crisis is alleviated through effective actions taken by Mexico, to be determined in our sole discretion and judgment, the Tariffs will be removed," he said in the statement.Trump said, however, that "if the crisis persists", the tariffs will be increased to 10 percent on July 1."Similarly, if Mexico still has not taken action to dramatically reduce or eliminate the number of illegal aliens crossing its territory into the United States, Tariffs will be increased to 15 percent on Aug 1, 2019, to 20 percent on Sept 1, 2019, and to 25 percent on Oct 1, 2019."Tariffs will permanently remain at the 25 percent level unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory," the statement said.Trump said that "workers who come to our country through the legal admissions process, including those working on farms, ranches, and in other businesses, will be allowed easy passage".The announcement took a toll on stock futures, as Dow futures were down 192 points at 8:10 pm, while S&P 500 futures fell 21 points. The Mexican peso was lower by about 2 percent.Mexico's deputy foreign minister for North America, Jesus Seade, said that it would be disastrous if Trump goes through with his threat to impose new tariffs on Mexico.Investors' focus up to now had been on the US tariff escalation against China and the administration's moves to largely cut off Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd from American business."We have confidence that Mexico can and will act swiftly to help the United States stop this long-term, dangerous, and deeply unfair problem. The United States has been very good to Mexico for many years," Trump said. "We are now asking that Mexico immediately do its fair share to stop the use of its territory as a conduit for illegal immigration into our country."At the same time, Mexico cannot allow hundreds of thousands of people to pour over its land and into our country — violating the sovereign territory of the United States.Trump said he "will not stand by and allow our sovereignty to be eroded, our laws to be trampled, or our borders to be disrespected anymore".Earlier Thursday, the Trump administration took a procedural action aimed at speeding up a vote in Congress on the new North American trade deal, but the move rankled House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has sought more time to review the pact.US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer submitted a draft statement of administrative action to congressional leaders, which allows the White House to submit the text of the agreement to Congress after 30 days for a vote.Republicans, who control the US Senate, have been seeking a vote on the new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) before the August recess to avoid budget debates and 2020 presidential campaign activity expected to intensify in the autumn.But legislative time is running short as Democrats, led by Pelosi, seek improvements in the trade deal's enforcement of new labor and environmental standards. Pelosi controls the schedule for trade legislation.She said in a statement that submission of the draft at this time was "not a positive step". Pelosi added that her fellow Democrats had "been on a path to yes" on USMCA, but stronger enforcement provisions were needed for the pact.US Vice-President Mike Pence said on Thursday in Ottawa that he was pushing to get Congress to ratify the USMCA this summer after both Canada and Mexico signaled they are ready to start the approval process.Reuters contributed to this story.

                Trump urges Congress to approve USMCA in State of the Union address
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON -- US President Donald Trump on Tuesday urged the Congress to approve the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) to replace the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).In his State of the Union address on Capitol Hill on Tuesday night, Trump said he hoped the Congress could pass the USMCA into law to bring back manufacturing jobs, expand American agriculture, protect intellectual property and boost the US auto industry.The USMCA, signed by leaders of the three countries on Nov 30 in Argentina, still needs to be ratified by lawmakers of the three countries before going into effect. The deal faces a tough road ahead in a split Congress.Democrat Nancy Pelosi, who took the role of House Speaker in early January, has repeatedly expressed deep concerns over the deal's enforceability, especially related to labor and environment protection.For example, the USMCA requires at least 40 percent of car production to come from factories with an average wage of $16 per hour, which might increase costs of cars made in the USMCA region.Meanwhile, a number of lawmakers and business groups have been pushing for the removal of US tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico. Even some Republican lawmakers said they would not move to vote on the agreement until the steel and aluminum tariffs are eliminated.After the signing by the three leaders, the US International Trade Commission will have up to 105 days to complete a report on the economic impact of the agreement, which could be ready by mid-March. Many lawmakers are still waiting to see the analysis before making a final judgment.If the USMCA goes to Congress, it will face a simple yes-or-no vote under the so-called "fast-track" law, a 2015 trade legislation, with no amendments or procedural delays allowed.However, the Democrats-controlled House can challenge that by introducing a rule to remove the deal from fast-track consideration, which could lead to a prolonged debate about possible "tweaks" of the deal.Analysts said Democrats are unlikely to reject the new deal completely, as there is no available alternative. Trump has threatened to unilaterally pull out of NAFTA if the new deal fails to get through Congress.

                New NAFTA deal 'in trouble', bruised by elections, tariff rows
            </a>
            <p>
                MEXICO CITY/OTTAWA - More than six months after the United States, Mexico and Canada agreed a new deal to govern more than $1 trillion in regional trade, the chances of the countries ratifying the pact this year are receding.The three countries struck the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA) on Sept 30, ending a year of difficult negotiations after US President Donald Trump demanded the preceding trade pact be renegotiated or scrapped.But the deal has not ended trade tensions in North America. If ratification is delayed much longer, it could become hostage to electoral politics.The United States has its next presidential contest in 2020, and Canada holds a federal election in October.The delay means businesses are still uncertain about the framework that will govern future investments in the region."The USMCA is in trouble," said Andres Rozental, a former Mexican deputy foreign minister for North America.Though he believed the deal would ultimately be approved, Rozental said opposition from US Democrats and unions to labor provisions in the deal, as well as bickering over tariffs, made its passage in the next few months highly unlikely.Canada's Parliament must also ratify the treaty and officials say the timetable is very tight. Current legislators only have a few weeks work left before the start of the summer recess in June, and members of the new Parliament would have little chance to address ratification until 2020.Trump, a Republican, has shown frustration with the Democratic-led US House of Representatives for failing to sign off on the USMCA. He has threatened to pull out of the old pact, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), if Congress does not hurry up.If Trump did dump NAFTA, the three nations would revert to trade rules in place before it came into effect in 1994.TARIFFSCanada and Mexico are seeking exemption from US tariffs on global metal imports imposed last year.The metals tariffs were not included in the USMCA and Mexico and Canada are impatient to resolve the issue. Mexico has repeatedly threatened to target new US products by the end of April in retribution if tariffs are imposed.Meanwhile, Trump on Thursday threatened to slap tariffs on Mexican auto exports unless Mexico does more to stop drug traffickers and illegal immigration.Mexico's government is in the final stages of completing a new list of potential US imports to be targeted, said Luz Maria de la Mora, a Mexican deputy economy minister."There's going to be a bit of everything," she told Reuters, declining to give details of how the list - originally encompassing products such as bourbon, cheese, motor boats, pork legs, steel and apples - could be modified.De la Mora would not be drawn on whether Mexico could refuse to ratify USMCA if steel tariffs are not withdrawn, saying only: "All options are on the table."In Ottawa, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said this week her government was "constantly" looking at its own retaliation list, noting that Trump's tariffs left the country over C$16 billion worth of space to strike back.Freeland did not say when that list could change, and a government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it might not be necessary. Still, Freeland said Canada was coordinating with Mexico about its options.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who faces a tough re-election battle, on Thursday rejected accepting quotas on Canadian steel and aluminum in exchange for US tariffs being dropped.Trudeau was criticized during the USMCA negotiations for giving ground to Trump on access to Canada's dairy sector.WORKERSUS Democrats have threatened to block the USMCA unless Mexico passes legislation to improve workers' rights, a demand shared by the Canadian government.A bill already in Mexico's Congress to strengthen trade unions should be approved this month, the government says.Trump blamed NAFTA for millions of job losses in the United States as companies moved south to employ cheaper Mexican labor. Trump is running for re-election in 2020, and his 'America First' policy will likely feature prominently in the campaign.Forcing Mexico and Canada to rework NAFTA was one of Trump's signature pledges during his shock win in 2016, and Democrats are pulling out the stops to avoid losing again."The closer the election gets, the harder it will be for Democrats to grant Trump a victory" by ratifying the USMCA, said Sergio Alcocer, a former deputy Mexican foreign minister.Some Democrats are pushing to change the deal - an idea that both Canadian and Mexican officials resist."People need to be very careful around opening up what could really be a Pandora's box," Freeland said on Thursday.Canadian officials say they fear that if one part of the treaty were reopened, it could spark clamor for other sections to be renegotiated as well.Reuters

                Trump's EU tariff threats unlikely to happen
            </a>
            <p>
                Negotiated settlement still likely in trade dispute, says former policy chiefExperts expressed concern after US President Donald Trump threatened to place tariffs on billions of dollars of imports from the European Union in retaliation for what he called unfair subsidies of Airbus planes, but they suggested the tariffs would not be imposed anytime soon.On Tuesday, Trump tweeted: "The World Trade Organization finds that the European Union subsidies to Airbus has adversely impacted the United States, which will now put Tariffs on $11 Billion of EU products!""The EU has taken advantage of the US on trade for many years. It will soon stop!" he wrote to his nearly 60 million Twitter followers. The proposed tariffs would cover not only Airbus planes, but also cheese, wine, woolen suits and numerous other European goods.The threat comes amid a battle between Airbus and US-based Boeing, which have accused each other of benefiting from unfair government subsidies.The World Trade Organization has ruled in separate cases against Boeing and Airbus.A statement on Monday by the Office of the United States Trade Representative said Airbus subsidies are costing $11 billion a year in lost market share for US companies.US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the case "has been in litigation for 14 years, and the time has come for action". He said the Trump administration is preparing to respond immediately when the WTO issues its findings on the value of US countermeasures."Our ultimate goal is to reach an agreement with the EU to end all WTO-inconsistent subsidies to large civil aircraft. When the EU ends these harmful subsidies, the additional US duties imposed in response can be lifted," he said.Jo Leinen, a German member of the European Parliament, told Bloomberg, "Ultimately, the EU has to retaliate with extra tariffs on US goods－the same amount of money."He said the European Parliament has expressed its opposition to negotiation under US pressure.Gary Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based nonpartisan, nonprofit institution, told China Daily he expects litigation in the WTO to continue for several months."This drama has a while to play out before tariffs are actually imposed, and a negotiated settlement- in the context of US-EU trade talks－is a strong possibility," said Hufbauer, a former deputy assistant secretary for international trade and investment policy of the US Treasury Department.The threat by the Trump administration comes when Boeing is under great pressure. The Boeing 737 Max has been indefinitely grounded worldwide following two fatal crashes involving the aircraft just months apart that killed 346 people.Zhang Haiyan, a professor at NEOMA Business School in France, said he does not think the Trump administration can legitimately impose tariffs on Airbus before the WTO arbitrators' decision, especially since the case is ongoing."If the EU takes a tit-for-tat approach, the trade conflicts between these two long-established partners will certainly be escalated, which could further slow down the recovery of the world economy," Zhang told China Daily.He said the legal battles between Airbus and Boeing at the WTO have been going on for more than a decade and show that government subsidies to pillar industries are not an "exclusive practice" of government-driven economies."Therefore, it is not wise and fair to impose unilateral tariffs on their trade partners as a countermeasure for subsidies when it is a practitioner itself" of such a policy, he said.The latest spat also comes at a time when the US and China are expected to reach a trade deal after many rounds of high-level talks."I think the trade war with China is winding down to a truce, and Trump's focus in the summer and fall will be the EU, Mexico and the USMCA deal (the signed but not ratified US-Mexico-Canada Agreement)," said Hufbauer.

                US to remove tariffs on Canadian metals, Mexico deal imminent
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON/OTTAWA - The United States and Canada on Friday announced a deal to remove tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, paving the way for a similar pact with Mexico.The quota-free deal will eliminate the US metals tariffs within 48 hours as well as Canada's retaliatory tariffs on some $12 billion worth of US products, including pork, beef and bourbon.The 25% tariff on steel and 10% tariff on aluminum from Canada and Mexico were a major hurdle to ratification of the new trilateral trade deal to replace the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement.Several prominent US lawmakers had said that a vote on the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) was impossible until after the metals tariffs — and retaliatory measures aimed largely at US farmers — were lifted.News of the deal to put in place a "monitoring system" for steel and aluminum transshipments broke after US President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discussed the tariffs earlier on Friday.Trudeau is scheduled to speak to reporters on Friday afternoon after he meets with steel workers at Stelco Holding Inc steel mill in Hamilton, Ontario, his spokesman said on Twitter.A senior Mexican official said that once the deal is announced and implemented, Canada and Mexico will lift retaliatory tariffs on billions of dollars of US products.The deal announced on Friday leaves room for the reimposition of tariffs if imports of steel or aluminum "surge meaningfully beyond historic volumes" over a period of time, according to the joint statement. But any retaliation for such action would be limited to the steel and aluminum sectors.Reuters

                MEXICO CITY -- Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Wednesday said he is confident the US Congress will ratify the renewed North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) "by September at the latest."Once legislative powers in the US, as well as Canada, have approved the deal, now called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), it will boost confidence in Mexico's economy, attracting more investment and spurring growth, said Lopez Obrador.In June, Mexico became the first of the three trade partners to ratify the content of the new agreement when it met with Senate approval.The three heads of state signed the renegotiated deal on Nov 30, 2018 on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina.NAFTA was renegotiated on the insistence of US President Donald Trump, who blamed the 1994 agreement for the loss of industrial jobs in the United States.
