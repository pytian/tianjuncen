China's central bank has been letting market forces play a larger role in determining the yuan's exchange rate, and on Monday, when the yuan faced growing devaluation pressure under the latest US threat to impose 10 percent punitive tariff on $300 billion Chinese goods starting Sept 1, it went beyond 7 to the US dollar.

                            Recent examples of cities facing water shortages show how this monitoring is important to ensure that utilities have necessary water resources and infrastructure to satisfy customer demand in the short and long term.In Asia's developing countries, water utilities face three major issues: First, they have to manage diminishing resources and infrastructure that is largely spread out, often dilapidated and not well located and identified.Three focus areas－infrastructure, operations and institutions－together made more formidable by smart systems, build a solid base from which we can help to ensure water supply and equitable access

                            TEPCO says the removal at Unit 3 would take two years, followed by the two other reactors where about 1,000 fuel units remain in the storage pools.Removing fuel units from the cooling pools comes ahead of the real challenge of removing melted fuel from inside the reactors, but details of how that might be done are still largely unknown. Removing fuel from the cooling pools will help free up space for the subsequent removal of the melted fuel, though details of how to gain access to it are yet to be decided

He said long-term storage would gradually reduce the radiation because of its half-life, but would delay decommissioning work because the necessary facilities cannot be built until the tanks are removed.Nearly 8 1/2 years since the accident, officials have yet to agree on what to do with the radioactive water

Meanwhile, dozens of Palestinians organized a sit-in in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Saturday in protest against the regional workshop in which the Trump administration intends to unveil the economic part of its long-awaited plan to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Abbas stressed that "we reject the US peace plan", better known as the "Deal of the Century", in a meeting with the leaders of the Fatah Youth Movement in Ramallah

Yet given the promise the US leader made in his meeting with his Chinese counterpart on the sidelines of the Osaka G20 Summit in Japan in late June that the issue of Huawei would be decided at the very end of the trade talks, it is to be hoped that the US does not go back on his word

                            A maritime expert said it's unlikely a judge would grant a petition by the owners of a dive boat to limit their financial liability for a Labor Day fire on board that resulted in the loss of 34 lives. Second, the court must determine whether the owner of the vessel had knowledge or privity of those same acts of negligence or conditions of unseaworthiness," he said.Martin Davies, a martime law professor from Tulane University, told China Daily that "on average, petitions for limitation succeed about 50 percent of the time in the US, but averages are of little help – everything depends on the facts of the case, and it's too early to say in the present case"

                            Teheran would return to landmark 2015 nuclear agreement for $15b in oil salesWASHINGTON - As tension continues to escalate between Washington and Teheran, the two sides are closer to a military conflict than any other time in recent years, a sanctions expert in the United States has said.Asked about who should be blamed for the current deteriorating situation, Nephew said the standoff has its roots in the US' widely criticized withdrawal from the accord, which softened economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for a suspension of the country's nuclear development."Iran's nuclear program is once again expanding in problematic ways and there is a greater threat of a conflict in the Persian Gulf than a few months or years ago," said the expert, who is also the author of The Art of Sanctions, a book published in 2017

The fresh image of the crash-landed lander, called Vikram - after the founder of India's space program - was said to have been obtained by the onboard camera of the unmanned moon orbiter, which continues to be in a perfect condition

"It (China-UK) is an indispensable economic relationship, indispensable for the UK because of our need to engage with an economy of the size and sophistication of China's, indispensable for China because China's best friend in the West is the United Kingdom," said Cowper-Coles, who emphasized that huge synergy lies in the Sino-UK partnership on the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative

                            SANTA BARBARA, Calif — A middle-of-the-night fire swept a boat carrying recreational scuba divers anchored near an island off the Southern California coast early Monday, leaving at least 25 dead and nine others missing. The Coast Guard says five others have been found but not recovered due to unsafe conditions under the boat, which sank about 20 yards (18 meters) from shore.Rescuers initially recovered four bodies about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles just off Santa Cruz Island, and 16 others were pulled from the water later in the day

"When I came to China, I wanted to be friends with Chinese people, to understand them, and tea was the perfect way to do that," he said. "Though I've learned many things about tea, I feel like I've only scratched the surface - I find out from my Chinese students that there's much more to learn," he said

It seems that the Philippine government officials are confused about the status of waters around the Sibutu passage - whether they are territorial sea, exclusive economic zone or archipelagic waters.Philippine legislation does not require clearance or prior notification of foreign vessels passing through the waters within its baselines On Aug 20, Senator Christopher Lawrence Go said the Philippine government would require vessels from other countries to notify the Philippine authorities about their impending passage through "territorial waters" and get approval from proper government authority well in advance

He said low investment in agricultural research and development in Africa has resulted a huge domestic resource gap in generating agricultural investments, weakening the continent's chances of reducing the number of undernourished people by 2030. "The African Union should consider establishing a continental agricultural research and development facility which will lobby foreign investment on behalf of African farmers and producers and also assist in exploiting and enhancing Africa's sustainable agricultural potential," he said

                            UNITED NATIONS - Russia and the United States on Thursday blamed each other for the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, while China said it has no interest in trilateral arms control talks that Washington wants.In response to the US criticism of China's development of intermediate-range missiles, Zhang stressed that the US withdrawal from the INF Treaty is yet "another act of unilateralism and escape from international obligations by the United States".At the meeting, Russia's Polyanskiy also appealed to his "European colleagues" to heed the US withdrawal from the INF treaty, and warned of a possible new arms race as a result

                            JAKARTA, Indonesia - Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Friday he would press on with plans to move the nation's capital and roll out measures to kick-start Southeast Asia's biggest economy as it feels the sting of slowing global growth. The economy has been expanding around five percent annually, but that is well short of the seven percent Widodo had pledged in his first term. Speaking a day before the 74th anniversary of Indonesia's independence, the recently reelected leader said his second term would focus on cutting red tape and luring foreign investment
