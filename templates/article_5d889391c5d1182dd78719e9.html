                Sino-Kyrgyz anti-terror drill keeps soldiers in top shape
            </p>
            <p>
                The China-Kyrgyzstan "Cooperation-2019" joint counterterrorism exercise was launched on Tuesday at a training base in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.The exercise is the first joint exercise conducted by security forces of the two countries and will last about 10 days, according to a statement from the People's Armed Police Force of China.About 150 officers and soldiers from a commando unit of the force's Xinjiang division and a special warfare brigade under the National Guard of Kyrgyzstan, are taking part in counterterrorism drills at a training base of the Xinjiang division in Urumqi, the region's capital. They are expected to hone their capabilities in a wide range of fields such as joint command, basic technical training and joint tactical operations, the statement said."The exercise is intended to deepen security cooperation between the two countries, enhance the counterterrorism capability of the security forces and expand the two forces' cooperation," Lieutenant General Yang Guangyue, deputy commander-in-chief of the People's Armed Police Force, said at the exercise's opening ceremony in Urumqi. He added that it does not target any third party.Zhou Zhen, commander of the Chinese troops in the exercise, was quoted in the statement as saying that his soldiers are specialized in counterterrorism operations in mountainous regions, so they would be focused on joint tactics in mountain tasks with their Kyrgyz counterparts.The People's Armed Police Force has been gearing up its exchange and collaboration with security forces in other nations in regards to counterterrorism activities.It held an international counterterrorism forum in Beijing in June to boost communication and cooperation in the fight against terrorism. It was the third time the Chinese force had organized such a forum since 2016.In addition, the force has also hosted two international contests for snipers since that year.

                Kyrgyz special forces conduct operation to detain former president
            </a>
            <p>
                BISHKEK -- The special forces of Kyrgyzstan's State Committee for National Security are carrying out an operation to detain the country's former president Almazbek Atambayev, the official Kabar news agency reported Wednesday."The soldiers were equipped only with rubber bullets. Currently, the detention operation continues," Kabar said, citing the committee's press service.The special forces attempted to storm Atambayev's residence in the village of Koi-Tash near the capital of Bishkek, using flashbang grenades and rubber bullets, but they were resisted by about 200 supporters of the former leader, Sputnik news agency said.The supporters armed with sticks and stones are preparing for another assault of the special forces who are receiving reinforcements, eyewitnesses told Sputnik.At least 15 people were injured during the clashes, Kabar reported, citing the Health Ministry.Kyrgyz President Sooronbai Jeenbekov suspended his one-week vacation and went to Bishkek on Wednesday, according to a statement published on the presidential website.A special commission of the Kyrgyz parliament found that Atambayev, 62, could be involved in six crimes during his presidency from December 2011 to November 2017.The charges included the suspected corruption during the reconstruction of Bishkek's thermal power station, the unlawful obtaining of land for building his residential house, and helping release Chenchen criminal Aziz Batukayev.The Kyrgyz parliament voted on June 27 to deprive Atambayev's immunity, paving the way for his detention and trial.Atambayev called the allegations "absurd" and said that he was clean and ready to answer all the accusations.

                West has to discard prejudice to see real Xinjiang: China Daily editorial
            </a>
            <p>
                In the developed world, strengthening public security is the most effective way of combating terrorism and safeguarding public order. Some Western countries have even extended the fight against terrorism to other countries and regions.Yet when China establishes education and vocational training centers in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region to educate and teach youths skills so they can earn a decent living and shun terrorism, the West resorts to double standard.Western countries should look at the bigger picture, then they would realize the importance and effectiveness of China's policies, and the poverty of their own policies.Believe it or not, China has tried most of the conventional methods to combat terrorism in Xinjiang. But despite its best efforts, terrorists and separatists plotted and carried out thousands of criminal acts in Xinjiang between 1990 and the end of 2016.Which made China realize the cat-and-mouse game between security forces and terrorists would not end unless the roots of terrorism were weeded out.Only after the education and vocational training centers were established in the region, particularly in the Kashgar, Hotan and Aksu prefectures, and the Kizilsu Kyrgyz autonomous prefecture, where the economy is less developed and people mostly live in remote villages, could terrorism be curbed. Not only has no terrorist attack taken place in the past two and a half years, but also tourists both from home and abroad have made 76 million trips to the region in the first half of this year, up 46 percent year-on-year.And those questioning China's methods of fighting terrorism should know Xinjiang has become one of the safest places in China.Terrorists and separatists in Xinjiang mainly prey on simple, uneducated Uygurs as they can be easily brainwashed. The confessions of many former "holy warriors" show that far from attaining "inner peace", they were mentally shackled after being indoctrinated by terrorists.The education and training the trainees receive at the centers will not only help them get jobs in fields other than farming and animal husbandry but also is the most effective way of preventing them from falling into the trap of predatory terrorist groups.The pursuit of knowledge and skills is accorded high value in the developed world. Why does it become questionable in China?China's anti-terrorism campaign in Xinjiang is an invaluable contribution to the global war on terrorism, not least because it has allowed the people to live in peace and pursue a better life. The doubting Thomases in the West have to stop looking at China through their biased prism to see reality.

                Joint battle exercise held in the deserts of Xinjiang help Chinese and Kyrgyz armed units improve their anti-terrorism capabilities On the morning of Aug 11, harsh sunlight beat down on the Gurbantunggut Desert, illuminating Bogda Peak in the distance. At about 6 pm, special force members abseiled out of four helicopters passing over the Tianshan Mountains. This was the opening maneuver off the Sino-Kyrgyzstan "Cooperation 2019" joint anti-terrorism exercises, which began with a comprehensive series of desert battle drills in the north of Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.  An early morning search for terrorists. Photos by Wang Jing / China DailyThe 32-hour overnight exercises marked the intense opening stages of a series of exercises conducted by the Chinese People's Armed Police Force and the Kyrgyz National Guard. The joint maneuvers were based on the premise that a group of armed international terrorists had taken over a village 30 kilometers away from the Chinese border by stealth and were planning to carry out a multipronged terrorist attack. The scenario saw the group team up with foreign terrorist organizations and their Kyrgyz accomplices before leaving the desert hinterland to launch a combined terror attack. In response, the Chinese armed police "Mountain Eagle" commando team and the Kyrgyz National Guard "Black Panther" special brigade completed first-level war preparations at the scene by establishing an anti-terrorism command post and joint battle formations. The aim of the joint battle drills is to focus on the real-world combat capabilities of the training units involved. Officers from the Sino-Kyrgyzstan team learn from one another, exchange tactical ideas and study joint anti-terrorism mechanisms to help maintain regional peace and stability. Alimas, a soldier with the Kyrgyz National Guard, said he intends to participate in the monthlong exercises every year. And because Kyrgyzstan's landscape is dominated by mountains, the drills in unfamiliar desert terrain have so far proved arduous and challenging, but ultimately rewarding. "Although there is a language barrier, we can benefit from the process through the use of tactical demonstrations, gestures and translations," Alimas said. "Our common goal is to fight terrorism." "Terrorism is a worldwide problem and requires cooperation between nations. This exercise is an important way for us to improve the anti-terrorism capabilities of both China and Kyrgyzstan," said Zhou Jianguo, commander of the Xinjiang Corps of Chinese People's Armed Police Force.

                Xinjiang helps neighbors with telemedicine
            </a>
            <p>
                Foreign patients who border region welcome virtual health consultationsThe Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region will harness remote technology to deliver medical services to more foreign patients, a senior official with the region's health commission said on Monday.Neighboring countries have welcomed virtual health consultations offered by medical workers in Xinjiang, and the region will strive to improve telemedicine services to benefit a larger population of foreign patients, said Mutanlip Roz, head of Xinjiang's health commission.Currently, the global telemedicine platform based in Urumqi, the regional capital, has enlisted 29 hospitals in Xinjiang and 24 major medical institutions in three foreign countries, according to the commission.Medical resources in Xinjiang have already benefited a growing number of patients from neighboring countries in recent years.The commission said nearly 21,200 foreign patients have received diagnoses and treatment at five large hospitals in Xinjiang since the region stepped up healthcare cooperation among Belt and Road countries in 2015, the commission said.At the Kezilesu Kirgiz autonomous prefecture in southwest Xinjiang that borders Kyrgyzstan, over 200 Kyrgyz people have crossed the border to take part in a previously domestic medical assistance program targeting congenital heart diseases, said Ding Qiang, president of the People's Hospital in the prefecture."They have marveled both at the economic prowess of China and the country's advanced medical technologies," he said. "They are satisfied with the quality of care they have received in Xinjiang."Ding said the program, which began in 2016 as a heart surgery-oriented program, has recently expanded to provide operations for lung diseases and congenital chest defects.Medical and health services in Xinjiang have undergone "transformative" changes in the past seven decades, with the average life expectancy climbing from less than 30 years to 72 years, according to Mutanlip Roz.He added that the maternal mortality rate has fallen substantially from 1,500 per 100,000 in the early 1950s to less than 27 per 100,000 last year, and the infant mortality rate has dropped from 60 percent to 1.4 percent for the same period.One driving force of progress is the nationwide medical assistance initiative that has seen over 500 medical professionals from large hospitals in more developed regions in China heading for eight hospitals in Xinjiang to provide long-term medical care and help train local doctors.The initiative was rolled out in April 2016 by several government bodies including the National Health Commission, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security.Due to the effort, the total number of hospital admissions has increased by over 12 percent and the number of surgeries has also gone up by nearly 20 percent, said Zhou Changqiang, an official with the National Health Commission."Next, we will focus on nurturing local medical professionals and boosting hospital management skills," Zhou said, adding that telecommunication technologies will be deployed to broaden medical access in remote areas in Xinjiang.
