                US spy chief Coats to step down in coming days

            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, who has clashed with US President Donald Trump over assessments involving Russia, Iran and Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is expected to step down in the coming days, the New York Times reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter.Trump is seriously considering tapping US Representative John Ratcliffe, a fellow Republican, to replace Coats in the job, a source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.Representatives for Ratcliffe were not immediately available for comment. Coats' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Coats, a Trump appointee who served as director of national intelligence since March 2017, clashed with his boss early on, taking a hard line toward Russia that sharply contrasted with the conciliatory approach Trump pursued toward Russian President Vladimir Putin.In January, Coats told Congress that DPRK was unlikely to give up its nuclear weapons, contradicting Trump's statement that Pyongyang no longer poses a threat. He also told lawmakers that Iran had continued to comply with a nuclear deal that Trump abandoned.The next day, Trump on Twitter complained about the "passive and naive" US intelligence leaders, suggesting they "go back to school!"Reuters

                 Cinemagoers wear 3-D glasses to watch a film at the BFI IMAX movie theater in London. Cinema chains worldwide will spend about $1 billion over the next three to four years upgrading screens for digital projection. Chris Ratcliffe / BloombergEquipment makers to profit as Chinese, European movie theaters upgrade LOS ANGELES - Makers of digital movie equipment are forecasting a surge in sales as Chinese and European cinemas upgrade to tap the popularity of 3-D movies such as Avatar. Sales at Christie Digital Systems USA, the world's largest maker of digital projectors, may double to $400 million this year if it can meet demand, said Jack Kline, president of the Cypress, California-based company, a unit of Japan's Ushio Inc. Kortrijk, Belgium-based Barco NV, the second largest, estimates revenue will climb 50 percent to $200 million. The upgrades in Asia and Europe are part of a worldwide trend in theater spending. The three largest US chains are outfitting 14,000 screens for digital projection after raising $660 million. Cinemas charge more for 3-D movies and will benefit from the 19 films scheduled for release this year, up from 14 in 2009, according to researcher Hollywood.com Box-Office. Digital systems also cut costs by eliminating film reels and projectionists. "We didn't expect China to expand so fast," said Andrew Robinson, managing director at Harkness Screens International Ltd, the largest maker of screens for digital cinemas. Closely held Harkness, based in Dublin, sold 500 screens in China last year, Robinson said. Harkness is running its US factory around the clock, seven days a week, Robinson said in an interview. A second plant in France is running 18 hours a day, he said. The wait for delivery is 10 weeks, up from the usual four, he said. Like in the US, demand for 3-D theaters in China is increasing following the success of James Cameron's Avatar, the highest-grossing movie of all time, said Weng Li, a spokesman for China Film Group, the State-run company that controls most cinemas and film distribution in that nation. There are about 2,000 digital screens in China, including 800 that are equipped to show movies in 3-D, Li said in an interview. Even small cities in China are installing 3-D equipment, he said. Avatar has generated $193.6 million in ticket sales in China since its release, the film's second-highest grossing nation behind the US, according to News Corp's Twentieth Century Fox. China Film Group is seeking bids to add 500 digital projectors over the next four to six months, said John Wilmers, chief executive officer of Ballantyne Strong Inc, an Omaha, Nebraska-based seller of digital cinema equipment and services. Time Antaeus Media Group, based in China, plans to add 500 to 700, Christie's Kline said. Consumers may lose enthusiasm for 3-D as the format becomes more common, said Matthew Harrigan, an analyst with Wunderlich Securities in Denver. Bloomberg News (China Daily 04/02/2010 page14)

                WASHINGTON -- US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he will nominate Congressman John Ratcliffe as the new director of national intelligence (DNI), the White House's top intelligence adviser.The nomination needs to be approved by the Senate.Dan Coats, the current director, will be leaving office on Aug 15, according to Trump.The president added that an acting director will be named shortly.The DNI leads the nation's intelligence community and serves as the principal intelligence adviser to the White House.A 53-year-old Republican, Ratcliffe has been viewed as one of the most conservative members of Congress based on his voting record. He has served the House since 2015.Ratcliffee sits on four standing committees of the House that respectively oversees intelligence, judiciary, homeland security and ethics issues.He defended Trump during former special counsel Robert Mueller's testimony this week in front of the House about the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election and Trump's possible obstruction of justice.During his questioning of Mueller, Ratcliffe fiercely challenged the legal basis for the conclusions of Mueller's report.Coats, a former US senator, was sworn in as the fifth DNI in March 2017. He frequently appeared out of step with Trump over policy and intelligence issues, including the alleged Russian interference.

                    Trump names counterterrorism chief as acting director of national intelligence
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that Joseph Maguire, the current chief of the National Counterterrorism Center, will become the acting director of national intelligence.Trump's announcement on Twitter came after the deputy director of national intelligence, Sue Gordon, resigned. She said in a note to Trump that stepping down was not her "preference," but added, "You should have your team."Trump said Maguire will take over the acting post on Aug 15, when Dan Coats, the current director of the agency overseeing civilian and military intelligence, steps down."Admiral Maguire has a long and distinguished career in the military, retiring from the US Navy in 2010," Trump said on Twitter.Maguire has led the National Counterterrorism Center, which is overseen by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), since December. He retired from the Navy after a 36-year career that included leading the Naval Special Warfare Command."I've known Admiral Maguire for some time and I have confidence in his ability to step into this critical role," Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said in a statement.Coats said he was pleased that Trump had chosen Maguire to serve as acting DNI. "Joe has had a long, distinguished career serving the nation and will lead the men and women in the (intelligence community) with distinction," he said in a statement.Last week, Trump dropped his first choice to replace Coats, US Representative John Ratcliffe, after questions arose about the Republican congressman's lack of experience and possible exaggerations in his resume.Last week, Trump said he liked Gordon and might name her acting DNI. Gordon, a career intelligence official, had the backing of current and former officials because of her deep experience."Sue Gordon's retirement is a significant loss for our Intelligence Community," Burr said in a statement.Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that Gordon's departure was a "great loss."Trump had a strained relationship with Coats, who endorsed the US intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election with the objective of promoting Trump over his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.Trump also has objected to US intelligence community analyses of major issues - from Iran's nuclear program to North Korea - that have clashed with his own assessments."President Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that he is seemingly incapable of hearing facts that contradict his own views," Warner said in his statement on Gordon's resignation.The post of director of national intelligence, which was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, oversees the 17 US civilian and military intelligence agencies including the CIA.Under the law, Trump needed to name a new acting director from the senior staff of the agency. The National Counterterrorism Center is part of ODNI.His choice for the permanent job must be confirmed by the Senate.Among the potential candidates for permanent director are Republican congressmen Mike McCaul and Devin Nunes, and US Ambassador to the Netherlands Pete Hoekstra, according to administration officials and media reports.McCaul is a former chairman of the House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee and Nunes is a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Hoekstra is a former nine-term member of the House who spent more than six years in top positions on the intelligence committee.Reuters
