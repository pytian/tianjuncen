                Neymar looms large as PSG renews Euro offensive
            </p>
            <p>
                PARIS - Real Madrid's visit to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday is arguably the blockbuster matchup of the opening Champions League round, but one that will bring back unhappy memories for the host.When the clubs last met in the competition's last 16 two seasons ago, a Neymar-less PSG lost 2-1 at Parc des Princes to crash out 5-2 on aggregate, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring three times over both legs.That was one of three consecutive exits in the first knockout round for PSG, which has failed to make its mark on the Champions League despite the hundreds of millions of euros spent by its Qatari owners.

                Unheralded 'little' Dominican squad relishing cutting rivals down to size
            </a>
            <p>
                SHANGHAI - The Dominican Republic, tied with the Philippines as the shortest team at the FIBA World Cup, is proving that size isn't everything after winning its first two games.The Caribbean nation surged into the second round of the tournament on Tuesday with a gutsy 70-68 victory over favored Germany, to go with an opening 80-76 win over Jordan."Maybe for a lot of people we are the tournament surprise," said the Dominicans' Argentine coach Nestor Garcia after seeing off the Germans. "We believe in ourselves and now we enjoy this moment."But this is only one game, this team can do more things in the World Cup."Their place in the next round assured, the 54-year-old Garcia's men are now sizing up France on Thursday with Group G supremacy at stake.The Dominicans' tallest player is the 6-foot-11 center Eloy Vargas and the average height of their roster is 6-foot-4, according to FIBA statistics.That makes them, along with the Philippines - twice heavy losers in the tournament - the shortest team of the 32 in the competition.The tallest team is Serbia, which averages 6-foot-9.The Dominicans will again be staring upwards at their opponents when they face France (average height 6-foot-8), but forward Ronald Roberts said what they lose in height they make up for in other ways."We played with a lot of energy. They couldn't match the energy the whole game and that was the biggest thing," said Roberts, who plays club basketball in France, after the Germany victory in Shenzhen."We needed to bring the energy. We're the underdogs. We're a little bit smaller than these other teams, but we play harder and that's what's going to keep us going."Stars absent There are a record 54 NBA players at the World Cup - but none represent the Dominican Republic because Garcia is without Karl-Anthony Towns of the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Philadelphia 76ers' Al Horford.That makes the job done by Garcia - a veteran of nearly 30 years' coaching in South America and latterly Spain - all the more commendable.He saw the funny side following the win over Germany when, in the absence of a Spanish translator in Shenzhen, he acted as a stand-in to interpret the comments of star performer Victor Liz, who finished with 17 points, five rebounds and four assists."I did my job, I don't want to be a translator, I've already finished my job," joked Garcia.But taking a more serious turn, he gave an insight into the way that he handles his men when they are facing adversity - and inevitably taller opponents."The world has changed," he said, sounding more philosopher than coach."Before, in the past, if you see, you believe. That was my father's school of thinking."Now, if you believe, you see."Agence France - Presse

                Nadal to face Berrettini in US Open men's singles semis
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW YORK - Three-time champion Rafael Nadal defeated Argentine Diego Schwartzman 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 in the men's singles quarterfinals of the US Open on Wednesday and will take on Italy's Matteo Berrettini in the semifinals.The No 20 seed Schwartzman put up firm resistance against Nadal and twice fought back from double-break deficits in the first two sets, but the Spaniard found another gear at crucial moments to secure the victory after two hours and 47 minutes' battle."Straight sets but big challenges especially after the first two sets, having 4-0 and 5-1 and losing both breaks in a row, but I know how good he is when he's confident," Nadal said."I'm so happy how I accepted the situation and challenge and kept going, point after point. Here I am in the semifinals. I'm super happy, it means everything."In the semifinals, the Spaniard faces Berrettini, who beat Frenchman Gael Monfils 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 7-6(5) over three hours and 56 minutes in another quarterfinal.On the women's side, Swiss Belinda Bencic reached her maiden semifinals at the majors with a 7-6(5), 6-3 win against Donna Vekic of Croatia. Bencic will next face the 15th-seeded Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu who rallied to beat Elise Mertens of Belgium 3-6, 6-2, 6-3.The women's semis will be held on Thursday, with six-time winner Serena Williams of the United States meeting fifth seeded Elina Svitolina of Ukraine in the other match.

                China, Netherlands had second straight set victory at Women's Volleyball World Cup
            </a>
            <p>
                YOKOHAMA, Japan - China and the Netherlands both recorded their second 3-0 victory over their respective opponents to kick their FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup off to a good start. Russia edged host nation Japan 3-2 in a five-set thriller to wrap up Matchday 2 here on Sunday.The defending champion sent a completely different starting lineup to face Cameroon on Sunday and the Chinese young players managed to nail a 25-18, 25-14, 25-19 win despite ups and downs. 19-year-old Li Yingying was the shining star of the match, especially in the third set in which the defending champions recovered a 4-11 deficit to claim the victory."We decided to send our young players on the court to give them chances to get accustomed to the arena and international games. We had some fluctuations during the match and we were slow in reading the opponents' tactics," commented Chinese head coach Lang Ping, who also praised Li for being more stable on the court than at the World Championship last year.The win lifted China to second place on the table, behind the Netherlands on point quotient disadvantage. The Dutch defeated Kenya 25-12, 25-19, 25-17 for its second straight-set win at the tournament to lead the 12 participating teams.The United States was also victorious against a young Serbian squad, recovering from one set down to defeat the world champion 25-23, 25-17, 25-16, 25-15. Team USA head coach Karch Kiraly gave credit to the opponent and his opposite spiker Karsta Lowe, who was sent on in the second set and pocket 19 points."We approached this match knowing it would be very difficult. They beat us in the first set, but the team did a nice job adjusting the block and defense, and we are happy with the result. Karsta Lowe came in and gave us some great energy today and some great power, and she helped us change the match after we lost the first set.""We couldn't do our best because we were very tired from yesterday's match against Brazil. In my personal opinion, I think the USA could take first place in this World Cup. Our team has a few injured players and some who are very tired from the European Championship, so I'm satisfied to win the first set against the very strong USA team. We just need to keep our focus in games like we did yesterday and as we did in the first set today," Serbia coach Aleksandar Vladisavljev responded to the second loss.The home fans had a bitter-sweet night as Japan lost 3-2 to Russia in a brilliant five-set showdown on Sunday night.Nataliya Goncharova scored 31 points for Russia's 25-11, 23-25, 25-27, 25-19, 15-7 win while Irina Koroleva added 21. Yuki Ishii led the Japanese team with 27 points.Shaking off a sluggish start, the host nation pulled one back and Ishii's super spike clinched a hard-fought 27-25 win for the Asian Championship winner in the third set after wasting three set points.Russian spikers regained their form in the fourth set and forced a decider, in which they shattered the Japanese defense with an 8-2 opening and safely claim the 15-7 victory.Elsewhere, powerhouse Brazil breezed past Argentina 25-17, 25-19, 25-16 for a 2-0 record at the World Cup with clear domination on the net, as the two-time Olympic champions had 17 successful blocks compared to seven on the Argentine side.The Dominican Republic had a 25-17, 24-26, 25-23, 25-23 victory over South Korea thanks to its on-fire wing spiker Elizabeth Martinez, who scored game-high 27 points. Kim Yeon-koung, the best scorer of the last World Cup, had 19 points and Kim Hee-jin pocket 20, yet not enough for the 2018 Asian Games champion to harvest a win at the tournament."I am happy with the win. They are an aggressive team with a strong attack and serve. They caught us in the second set, but we regained our rhythm in the third set. We will prepare for the next match now. We did target Kim Yeon-koung with our serves today so that she could focus less on attacks," said coach of the Pan American Games champion Marcos Kwiek.
