                Over 20,000 flood victims remain trapped in northeast Thailand: government
            </p>
            <p>
                BANGKOK - The Thai Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (DDPM) confirmed on Thursday that 20,620 victims in four northeastern provinces are still awaiting evacuations from floods caused by tropical storms that have so far killed 34 people.Chayaphol Thitisak, the director-general of DDPM said at a press conference in Bangkok that 32 provinces have suffered the effects of tropical storms "Podul" and "Kajiki," as well as the southwest monsoon in the Andaman Sea and Gulf of Thailand since Aug 29.He also said that other factors including flash floods, runoff and landslides have hit 182 districts and 7,115 villages in the north, northeast and east of the country."These storms and monsoon have affected 418,549 households, resulting in 34 deaths and many injuries," said Chayaphol.He also said that DDPM is collaborating with military and local offices to evacuate the 20,620 people who remain stuck in flooded provinces including Yasothon, Ubon Ratchathani, Roi Et and Si Sa Ket, all in the northeast provinces."State agencies are assisting flood victims by deploying military trucks to help evacuate villagers from their homes along with their belongings," said Chayaphol, "we have also installed several water pumps to help divert floodwater from critical areas, as well as providing food, drinking water and survival kits to flood victims."At the same time, the Thai Finance Ministry has launched a fundraising program to assist flood victims in north, northeast and central Thailand.

                US 'locked and loaded' after oil attack
            </a>
            <p>
                Iran rejects 'baseless' claims following Trump warning; Crude prices jump 19%WASHINGTON - Tensions are flaring in the Persian Gulf after US President Donald Trump said the United States is "locked and loaded" in response to a weekend drone assault on Saudi Arabia's energy infrastructure that his secretary of state blamed on Iran. Teheran on Monday called the accusation "unacceptable" and "baseless".The attack, which cut Saudi Arabia's oil production in half and sent crude prices spiking, led Trump to authorize the release of US strategic oil reserves should they be necessary to stabilize markets."There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!" Trump said on Twitter.Earlier in the day, a senior US official told reporters that evidence from the attack, which hit the world's biggest oil-processing facility, indicated Iran was behind it, instead of the Yemeni Houthi rebel group that had claimed responsibility.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also said there was no evidence the attack came from Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Houthis for four years in a war widely seen as a conflict between Saudi Arabia and Shiite Muslim rival Iran."Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply," Pompeo said.Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi dismissed the US allegations that it was responsible as pointless."These allegations are condemned as unacceptable and entirely baseless," Mousavi said in remarks carried by state TV.A senior Revolutionary Guard commander warned the Islamic Republic was ready for "full-fledged" war."All American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometers around Iran are within the range of our missiles," the semiofficial Tasnim News Agency quoted Commander Amirali Hajizadeh as saying.China urges restraint Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday that it was irresponsible to blame others for the oil attack without a conclusive investigation."The Chinese side's position is that we oppose all actions that enlarge or intensify the conflict," Hua told a news conference in Beijing."We call on relevant parties to avoid taking actions that will escalate the current tensions. We hope all sides can exercise restraint and jointly maintain the peace and stability of the Middle East," she said.Tensions between Washington and Teheran were already running high because of a long-running dispute between the two nations over Iran's nuclear program that led the US to impose sweeping sanctions more than one year ago.Oil prices surged as much as 19 percent in early Asian trade on Monday on worries over global supply and soaring tensions in the Middle East.Brent crude posted its biggest intraday percentage gain since the start of the Gulf War in 1991.The US government produced satellite photos showing what officials said were at least 19 points of impact at two Saudi energy facilities, including damage at the heart of the kingdom's crucial oil processing plant at Abqaiq.Officials said the photos show impacts consistent with the attack coming from the direction of Iran or Iraq, rather than from Yemen to the south.Iraq denied that its territory was used for an attack on Saudi Arabia.The US officials said additional devices, which apparently didn't reach their targets, were recovered northwest of the facilities and are being jointly analyzed by Saudi and US intelligence. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, did not address whether the drone could have been fired from Yemen, then taken a roundabout path, but did not explicitly rule it out."There's no doubt that Iran is responsible for this. No matter how you slice it, there's no escaping it. There's no other candidate," a US official told reporters.The attacks and recriminations are increasing heightened fears of an escalation in the region, after US Senator Lindsey Graham suggested striking Iranian oil refineries in response to the assault, and Iran warned of the potential of more violence.Actions on any side could break into the open a twilight war that's been raging just below the surface of the wider Persian Gulf in recent months. Already, there have been mysterious attacks on oil tankers that Washington blames on Teheran, at least one suspected Israeli strike on Shiite forces in Iraq, and Iran's shooting down a US military surveillance drone.Agencies - Xinhua - China Daily

                A steady drum beat reverberated off waterfront buildings and multiple colorful light beams illuminated normally tranquil waters while musical performances from a temporary stage adjacent to the river enhanced the festive atmosphere.Tianjin was celebrating Mid-Autumn Festival, which this year incorporated a three-day international Dragon Boat race. It felt like an incredible time to be in the city. The beats were emitted from circular wooden drums mounted near the front, or bow, of long, low draught, racing boats. Such drums were beaten with earnest passion aimed to edge and encourage each crew to go to the limit!

                Trump says US not seeking war amid tension with Iran over Saudi attacks
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump said on Monday that he is not seeking war with any country as Washington has been indicating Iran was behind the attacks on Saudi Arabia's key oil facilities."Do I want war? I don't want war with anybody," Trump told reporters at the White House when asked if he wants war with Iran, which the Trump administration officials held accountable for the attacks on Aramco oil facilities that have halved Saudi oil output.When asked if Iran was behind the attacks, Trump said "it's certainly looking that way at this moment", seemingly distancing himself from his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who asserted on Saturday that it was Iran which launched this "unprecedented attack"."We have to find out definitively who did it. We have to speak to Saudi Arabia," Trump said.He also said that Pompeo and others "will be going over to Saudi Arabia at some point" to discuss the incident.Iran has strongly dismissed the US accusations as "baseless" and "big lies."The attacks on Saudi oil facilities have ratcheted up the already tense situation in the Middle East caused by the US maximum pressure policies on Iran, including a total oil trade ban.There are fears that the rising tensions could spark a military conflict in the Gulf between Iran and the United States or Saudi Arabia.While speaking to reporters on Monday, Trump also noted that diplomacy has not been exhausted when dealing with Iran."It's not exhausted. Nothing is exhausted. And we'll see what happens," he said.

                Iran rules out talks with US as tensions rise
            </a>
            <p>
                Supreme leader digs in after Teheran blamed for attacks on Saudi oil facilitiesTEHERAN - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei announced on Tuesday that "there will be no talks with the United States at any level", as tensions mount between the two countries after Washington blamed Teheran for attacks on Saudi oil installations, which Iran has denied.Iranian state TV quoted Khamenei as saying this is the position of the entire leadership of the country and that "all officials in the Islamic Republic unanimously believe" this.Khamenei said the US wants to prove its "maximum pressure policy" against Iran is successful."In return, we have to prove that the policy is not worth a penny for the Iranian nation," Khamenei said. "That's why all Iranian officials, from the president and the foreign minister to all others have announced that we do not negotiate (with the US) either bilaterally or multilaterally."There had been reports about a possible meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, during the upcoming United Nations General Assembly this month in New York.But tensions roiling the Persian Gulf have escalated following a weekend attack on major oil sites in Saudi Arabia that the US alleged Iran was responsible for - a charge Iran has denied.The attack on Saudi Arabia, which set ablaze a crucial Saudi oil processing plant and a key oilfield, was claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebels, who are at war with a Saudi-led coalition that is trying to restore Yemen's internationally recognized government to power.Around 3 million barrels per day of Saudi oil will remain offline for a month, about half the production halted by the devastating attacks, S&P Platts said on Tuesday.Trump said on Monday it looked like Iran was behind the attacks on the oil plants but stressed he did not want to go to war, as the strikes sent oil prices soaring and raised fears of a new Middle East conflict.The strikes damaged the world's biggest crude-processing plant and triggered the largest jump in crude prices in decades.Rouhani said the drone attacks were a "legitimate defense and counterattack" against the Saudi-led war in Yemen."Regarding the drones' attack, this problem has its root in invading Yemen. They (the Saudi-led coalition) are bombing Yemen on a daily basis," he said during a summit in Turkey to discuss Syrian crisis with the Russian and Turkish leaders.Raising concernsIn Riyadh, officials said on Monday initial investigations indicate that Iranian weapons were used in the attacks and it "will invite UN and international experts to view the situation on the ground and to participate in the investigations".A statement from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: "The kingdom will take the appropriate measures based on the results of the investigation, to ensure its security and stability."It called Saturday's attack that resulted in the suspension of approximately 50 percent of Saudi Aramco's production "an unprecedented act of aggression and sabotage" and an "egregious crime which threatens international peace and security".Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, who currently chairs the UN Security Council, said the attacks on the Saudi oil installations were "unanimously and unequivocally condemned" by all 15 council members.As for Trump's statement that the US is "locked and loaded" to respond if necessary, Nebenzia said: "We are very concerned that incidents similar to this may provoke larger conflicts in the Gulf."Agencies

                Guangxi a key cog in success of trade route
            </a>
            <p>
                Land-sea trade corridor greatly reduces travel time of seaward exports from western and central China, officials with the province say The Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region has developed into a crucial hub of the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor as a result of blossoming cooperation with China's inland regions and neighboring countries. The new land-sea corridor is an international trade and logistics passageway jointly built by western Chinese provinces and Southeast Asian countries under the framework of the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Demonstration Initiative on Strategic Connectivity, an agreement signed between the Chinese and Singaporean governments in November 2015. With Chongqing municipality serving as one of its transportation hubs, the corridor uses ports in Guangxi's Beibu Gulf coasts to provide access to Singapore and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations members by sea, and links with China-Europe freight trains coming from many western Chinese cities before heading to Central Asia, South Asia and Europe.  Clockwise from top: Fangchenggang has one of the busiest ports in the Beibu Gulf region. The Hengyang-Liuzhou High-Speed Railway has slashed the travel time between Guangxi and the central part of China. Nanning Comprehensive Bonded Area is an important part of the land-sea trade corridor. Photos Provided to China DailyIn August 2017, Guangxi, Chongqing, Guizhou province and Gansu province signed agreements to cooperate in developing the corridor. Qinghai province and the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region came on board in June and November 2018. Yunnan province and the Ningxia Hui autonomous region were the latest regions to join the program. The land-sea corridor can greatly shorten the travel distance of seaward exports from China's western and even central region, according to Guangxi's officials. They said exports from Chongqing, for instance, are traditionally shipped via the Yangtze to Shanghai and then transshipped to larger vessels. The trip on the 1,800-kilometer Yangtze waterway takes more than 10 days. In contrast, it takes only two days to transport Chongqing's cargoes to Beibu Gulf via railway. Guangxi also offers the shortest passageway for western China's freight to ASEAN, and other regions in the world through the Malacca shipping route. In the past two years, Guangxi has promoted cooperation with other Chinese regions and neighboring countries engaged in this initiative. These include agreements for implementation measures between Guangxi and other Chinese regions, as well as a memorandum between Guangxi regional government and the Ministry of Trade and Industry of Singapore. In addition, Guangxi also held promotional events in Singapore in May and in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in July. A number of key projects have been carried out in Guangxi to improve its land and sea transportation and information interconnectivity with its neighboring regions and countries. One of the landmark projects under the new land-sea corridor initiative is the Qinzhou Railway Container Central Station. Construction of its first phase, which covers an area of about 85 hectares, began in July 2017. According to Wei Ran, deputy chief of the Beibu Gulf affairs office at the regional government of Guangxi, the station has a designed annual handling capacity of 1.05 million containers, compared with the city's annual throughput of 150,000 railway containers before the operation of the new station. The central station was officially put into operation on June 30, as a China-Europe freight train loaded with 70 container cargoes departed from Qinzhou, to Duisburg, Germany. Construction of another key project for railway transportation, the first phase of Nanning International Railway Port, was completed at the end of last month. Construction of other transportation and logistics facilities, including a railway logistics center in the border city of Pingxiang and an expansion project of the Fangchenggang Port, has also been completed. Guangxi will accelerate construction on the Huangtong-Baise Railway, the Hunan-Guangxi Railway's Nanning-Pingxiang section and the Nanning-Kunming Railway's Weishe-Baise section. Qinzhou Port will add a 200,000-metric-ton container terminal and have its eastern shipping lane expanded. More direct freight trains will be launched to connect Chongqing with Beibu Gulf, and more shipping routes will connect Beibu Gulf with ASEAN countries. The China-ASEAN Information Port, which was proposed at the first China-ASEAN Cyberspace Forum in 2014, is a program for internet connectivity, information sharing and cultural exchanges between China and ASEAN members. It features five platforms for infrastructure construction, information sharing, technological cooperation, economic and trade services. According to executives of China-ASEAN Information Harbor Corp, the company that takes charge of the program's operation, the information harbor has made breakthroughs in infrastructure construction and promotion of IT-related businesses in regions involved in the program.
