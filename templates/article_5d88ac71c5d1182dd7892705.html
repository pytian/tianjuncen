                Riotous protesters who have degenerated Hong Kong with another weekend of turmoil involving fights and fires have drawn wide condemnation from society on Monday.In a statement, the police severely condemned such violent acts which disregarded law and order. It said the force will continue to take resolute enforcement actions and bring all lawbreakers to justice.As an illegal assembly turned ugly on Sunday afternoon, radical protesters attacked police officers with gasoline bombs and other weapons, set fires at multiple locations, and attacked others and reporters.Mobsters also hurled bricks and gasoline bombs into the central government complex at Admiralty, forcing the adjacent Legislative Council building to issue a rare "red" alert that required everyone to leave the complex immediately.At about 5:45 pm, around 20 radicals attacked two police officers and hurled several gasoline bombs at them at a short distance in Wan Chai. The officers had to withdraw pistols as a warning to disperse them.During the mayhem, some thugs also attacked residents holding different opinions, beating one of them unconscious.Having given repeated warnings in vain, the police used tear gas, rubber bullets, and specialized crowd management vehicles with water cannons to disperse radical protesters.Some mobs also wreaked havoc at a number of MTR stations, with the Admiralty, Wan Chai and Causeway Bay stations suffering the most, despite the fact that the head of the railway operator said the city's railway system is on the brink of being unrepairable, after having been battered by radicalism and vandalism time and again.Jacob Kam Chak-pui, chief executive officer of the MTR Corporation, said earlier on Sunday the company is finding it extremely difficult to locate parts to mend the damage amid sustained vandalism and attacks on the railway system. The cost may run up to HK$10 million ($1.28 million) for the more than 90 metro stations that were affected.Train services at the three stations had to be suspended for public safety concerns.In a statement issued on Sunday night, the MTR strongly condemned and expressed deep regret over the malicious acts.The recurrence of violence and malicious vandalism at MTR stations not only severely affected passengers' journeys but also endangered the safety of passengers and MTR staff, the statement read.Noting the cases have been reported to the police, the corporation said it will take suitable follow-up actions on the incidents and reserves the right to take legal action against the parties concerned.The escalating violence also drew strong condemnation from prominent political parties.Stressing that society should not tolerate any violent acts disrupting law and order, the New People's Party called on the authority to introduce anti-mask legislation as soon as possible to subside the unrest.The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong - the city's largest political party in the legislature – stressed that the protesters' malicious acts definitely cannot be tolerated.In a statement issued late Sunday night, it reiterated the support for police to bring the rioters to justice. The party also urged all residents to immediately draw a clear line against violence and to not bear with such extremely violent acts.To break the current political impasse, the party hopes the people of Hong Kong can join the government's efforts to solve the city's deep-rooted problems through dialogues.The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, the city's largest labor group, also deplored the rioters' outrageous acts, which have defied the law and spread hatred among society. The federation appealed to all sectors to unite together to bring order and peace back to Hong Kong soon.

                    Moderating economic data should not be a cause for alarm: China Daily editorial
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Major economic data for August have moderated from the previous month, sparking concerns about further slowdown of China's economy. Such concerns may be somewhat reasonable, but considering the declining trend of major economies across the world, in large part due to rising trade protectionism, and the still-strong growth momentum of the Chinese economy, there is no reason to view China's economic prospects with pessimism.Year-on-year growth rates of industrial output, fixed-asset investment and retail sales were all lower than in July, indicating the Chinese economy faces heavy growth headwinds. Yet the economic data are in line with the global cycle of easing growth.No wonder economists widely believe the United States Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates to help the world's largest economy cope with the slowdown. In Europe, the European Central Bank introduced an aggressive stimulus package on Thursday, cutting its deposit rate — the first such reduction in more than three years — to a record low of minus 0.4 percent, and restarting its bond-buying plan as part of a quantitative easing program to boost growth.Which shows the world is searching for a way to boost the global growth momentum, even though some countries have resorted to protectionism and unilateralism. Given these facts, China's growth remains impressive, because despite the weakening of its major economic indicators in August, its unemployment rate dropped compared with July.As Premier Li Keqiang said in an interview with a Russian media outlet on Sunday, the country can tolerate moderate fluctuations in growth so long as the employment market remains stable.Also, some new and emerging sectors are making greater contributions to China's longer-term high-quality growth. National Bureau of Statistics data show that some high value-added sectors, such as services, online retail, high-tech, environmental protection, education, culture and entertainment, have registered higher growth than the traditional sectors.The strong performance of the high value-added sectors, in fact, has continued over many quarters, filling the gaps created by the slowing growth of some traditional industries and laying the foundation for higher growth in the future.The growth potential of the Chinese economy is evident from the fact that Shanghai signed 42 contracts for foreign investment projects worth $7.7 billion on Monday alone in traditional fields such as finance, chemical engineering and biomedicine, as well as high-value-added sectors like integrated circuit, smart manufacturing, new energy and new materials.And with the economic restructuring continuing, it could become normal for the Chinese economy to fluctuate within a narrow band in the coming quarters, but the possibility is high that China will maintain a healthy growth rate despite the downward global economic cycle.
