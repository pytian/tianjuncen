                Cui: Now is time to cooperate, not decouple
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                As the China-US relationship sits at another crossroads, the world's two largest economies should come together by expanding cooperation rather than "decoupling" from each other, Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai said Tuesday."We have learned from the past four decades that cooperation is the only right option for us," China's top envoy to the US said as he delivered the keynote address at a Vision China event in New York. "It is something we should always uphold."The forum, "China-US Relations: 40 Years & Beyond", hosted by China Daily and Bank of China, featured commentary by experts intricately involved in Sino-American relations."Decoupling our two countries in trade and industrial development goes against globalization and the tide of history. And considering China's advantages in cost, market and supply chain and its growing edge in innovation, to decouple from China is to decouple from opportunities," Cui said.Cui's remarks came amid trade differences between the two countries that date to early 2018. Another round of talks between the countries' top trade negotiators is scheduled for early October."The trade war the US launched and repeatedly escalated was based on a wrong rationale in the very beginning, and its negative impact has now hit both countries and spilt over to the whole world," said Cui.Scientific, technological and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries also are hard to decouple, Cui added.China and the US differ on some issues, said Cui; however, instead of justifying confrontation or conflict, the disagreements should be seen as opportunities and potential for complementarity and cooperation."It is extremely dangerous and irresponsible to base America's policy on alarmism and label China as a strategic rival and even adversary," said Cui.He refuted the rhetoric that a rising China will "displace the US to be the world's new hegemon", and said China aspires to pursue happiness for its people, rejuvenation for the nation and harmony for the world.Despite the economic advancement achieved by China in past decades, the country still faces tough challenges, including eliminating poverty, preventing and resolving systemic risks, and preventing and controlling pollution, noted Cui."China develops itself to deliver a better life to its people, not to scramble for global dominance," Cui said.Cui pointed out that China's development has served other countries, including the US, and any decoupling of China and the US is hardly possible, given the inseparable links between the two.In the past three years, China has remained the US' top trading partner. Daily trade between the two countries is worth more than $1.5 billion, according to the Chinese embassy in Washington.More than 14,000 people fly between the two countries every day for work, study and leisure. There are now more than 270 pairs of sister-states and sister-cities, and more than 360,000 Chinese students in the US, according to the embassy.The bilateral relationship has major bearing on world stability and prosperity, said Cui, and the two nations could cooperate to deal with global issues such as nuclear proliferation, terrorism, climate change, and natural disasters and challenges.While the US will remain "the world's strongest country a long time to come", whether it can take an open and confident approach to China's development "will affect its future, and will determine the direction of China-US relations and very probably the future of the world", Cui said.

                Anyone who attempts to fall back on foreign forces to engage in anti-China activities or create chaos in Hong Kong will only fail in humiliation, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday.Hua made the remark after Agence France-Presse reported that Hong Kong separatist Joshua Wong Chi-fung urged US President Donald Trump on Friday to include a "human rights clause" in any trade agreement with China."As a Chinese, Wong is begging foreign forces to interfere in China's domestic affairs. ... I don't think he is eligible to make any irresponsible comments over issues in China-US ties," Hua said.She reiterated that Hong Kong affairs belong purely to China's domestic affairs, in which no foreign government, organization or individual has the right to meddle.

                    Washington slammed over Solomons remark
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Beijing urged Washington on Wednesday to not interfere in the Solomon Islands' domestic affairs and respect its right to make its own decisions.Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said that the United States is in no position to make irresponsible remarks on the Pacific islands country's decision to establish diplomatic ties with China based on the one-China principle, given that Washington itself established diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979."If the US is really concerned about the Pacific islands countries, it should do more practical things that help to develop the island nations' economies and improve the livelihoods of their people, instead of wielding the stick of sanctions and flagrantly interrupting their domestic affairs," Geng said at a regular news conference in Beijing.Geng's remarks came after a spokesperson for the US State Department told Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao newspaper on Monday in an email that Washington was disappointed by the Solomon Islands' decision to establish diplomatic ties with Beijing.It was also reported that US Vice-President Mike Pence canceled his plans to meet with Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare to discuss development partnerships after the Pacific islands nation severed official ties with Taiwan authorities.The meeting was set to take place this month on the sidelines of the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, or later in Washington."We urge the US side to respect other countries' sovereign right to decide their own internal and foreign affairs independently," he said.In response to the latest Vietnamese claim that the Chinese scientific research ship Haiyang Dizhi 8 had "invaded" its exclusive economic zone and continental shelf, the spokesman reiterated China's sovereignty over the Nansha Islands as well as its sovereign rights and jurisdiction over surrounding waters at the news conference on Wednesday."The Chinese side's operations in the South China Sea waters under China's jurisdiction is lawful and there is nothing wrong with them," Geng said.He added that Vietnam has been unilaterally carrying out oil and gas drilling since May, and this "seriously violates China's rights and interests".
