                Nowitzki takes trip down memory lane
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                NBA great relives 'dream' days at Beijing OlympicsGerman hoops legend Dirk Nowitzki was filled with pride, and just a little pain, as he returned to the scene of one his most memorable games on Saturday.To the excitement of a capacity crowd at Wukesong Arena in Beijing, the 14-time NBA All Star showed off the World Cup trophy in a halftime ceremony during China's opening Group A victory over Cote d'Ivoire.As fans chanted his name, the former Dallas Mavericks star stood near the exact spot where Chinese forward Yi Jianlian drained a decisive jumper to send the host into the last eight and Nowitzki's German squad packing."I always think back to that game-that was a tough game for me, but it was good for the Olympics that the host went to the next round," said the 41-year-old, who retired in April after spending all of his 21 NBA seasons with Dallas."That was a big game with a great atmosphere in the gym. They beat us, they had a great team and they deserved to win to go to the next round," said Nowitzki, one of three global ambassadors for the World Cup alongside Yao Ming and Kobe Bryant.Nowitzki cited carrying the German flag into the opening ceremony of the 2008 Games as the proudest moment of his legendary career, during which he claimed an NBA MVP award (2007) and a championship ring (2011)."I was able to fulfill my dream here at Beijing 2008. Every athlete wants to be a part of the Olympics at least once, which is a great experience," he said. "Hopefully the young (German) guys can fulfill their dream and be in the Olympics next year."However, qualifying for the Tokyo Games in Beijing seems a tall task for the current Germany squad. The World Cup offers direct entry to just the top two European performers. If that route fails, a continental qualifying event, which offers one place, will be Germany's remaining hope.Since the 2010 world championships, which Nowitzki missed, Germany has reached neither the worlds (now the World Cup) nor the Olympics."Young teams have to go through experiences like this and make mistakes on the biggest stage. So they learn from these mistakes, get better and don't make those again at the big tournaments. For Germany, I hope the young team can make a difference this time around."Even with the likes of Serbia, Spain and Greece closing the gap with their own NBA superstars, Nowitzki still rates the United States as favorite for the title, despite not having LeBron James and several other big names on board."They are still going to represent their country well. With (Gregg) Popovich, they will be well coached. He is the best in the business. They are still going to be the team to beat," said Nowitzki, who is the most successful foreign player in NBA history.A strict workout regime helped Nowitzki extend his career into his forties. However, a few months into his retirement, he has no desire to return to that old routine.Instead, the German giant is enjoying spending time with his Swedish wife Jessica Olsson and their three children, as well as working with his charity foundation in Dallas.But he admitted: "I am going to miss basketball of course. I've done it for over 20 years. It's going to be weird when training camp starts while I am at home watching on TV."For me, it's just great now to enjoy myself and go traveling with my family without looking for gyms or workout rooms all the time. I've been enjoying that."

                BEIJING - Yi Jianlian and Guo Ailun combined for 36 points as the Chinese men's national basketball team beat Cote d'Ivoire 70-55 here on Saturday in a Group A first round meeting to start their FIBA World Cup journey on home soil.The former Milwaukee Bucks player Yi led the scoring sheet with 19 points, 17 of which came from the second half, while Guo Ailun contributed 17 points and 9 assists for the hosts."We did a great job tonight. The tough defence of our rivalry caused us lots of troubles in the first half, but we were more concentrated in the second half. Although we didn't make many long-range shots, we got better on both ends," said China head coach Li Nan.The host team, under pressure from playing in front of home fans, only shot 36% from the field and missed three of six free throws in the opening quarter.China's Zhai Xiaochuan made three straight baskets for 12 points, while Diabate Souleyman contributed two 3-pointers to gift Cote d'Ivoire a 16-14 lead.

                China's young guns announced themselves on the global stage with a hard-fought 70-55 victory over Cote d'Ivoire on Saturday as the host got its FIBA World Cup campaign off to a flying start.The energy was high, the crowd was loud and the hustle was at times brutal at a packed Wukesong Arena in Beijing - all making for an electric atmosphere reminiscent of the 2008 Olympics at the same venue.Led by star trio Guo Ailun, Yi Jianlian and Zhou Qi, China snapped a 14-game losing streak at the tournament and the Olympics that stretched back over nine years. China's last major international win was over the same opponent at the 2010 world championships (the Cup's predecessor) in Turkey.

                    African agriculture calls for more investments
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Investments in research would transform agriculture, promoting inclusive growth and sustainable development in Africa, experts said. Brian Cheboi, farm manager at Integrated Crop Management Solutions, a Kenyan consulting firm, said research would produce quality seeds suitable for the continent's climatic conditions and consequently increase yields. "Through research, farmers will get advice on how to control pests and disease challenges, as well as acquire more ideas and skills on new farming techniques and value addition," he said. Cheboi said agricultural extension provides a critical support services for rural farmers facing challenges. According to the World Economic Forum, Africa holds about half of the world's fertile unused land, yet it spends $25 billion annually to import food. Sikhumbuzo Zondi, a research assistant at the Institute for Global Dialogue, associated with the University of South Africa, said most of the African countries are underinvesting in agricultural research and development and have limited human resource capacity. Investments in agricultural research need to be significantly increased to ensure food sustainability and growth of Africa's agricultural research output, he said. He said low investment in agricultural research and development in Africa has resulted a huge domestic resource gap in generating agricultural investments, weakening the continent's chances of reducing the number of undernourished people by 2030. Additionally, low investment in agriculture has meant there is weak organization and management of African agricultural organizations, culminating in their weak capacity. "A blend of marginal investment and limited capacity thus hinders their ability to generate the technological innovations needed for agricultural productivity growth," Zondi said. With the help of development partners, he said, continental leaders should reformulate their agricultural development strategies. The strategies include making greater emphasis on macroeconomic and sectoral incentives, strengthening institutional capabilities, raising and sustaining productivity and competitiveness, diversifying production and trade and improving access to foreign markets. He called on African countries to strengthen collaborative agricultural research and extension development. "The African Union should consider establishing a continental agricultural research and development facility which will lobby foreign investment on behalf of African farmers and producers and also assist in exploiting and enhancing Africa's sustainable agricultural potential," he said. He said Zimbabwe, Kenya, Cote d'Ivoire and Mali have increased agricultural productivity specifically in maize production, horticulture, cocoa and rice, respectively. Similarly, South Africa has invested mechanisms for extension and research systems such as accelerating partnerships between the public and the private sector including a portion of civil society. John Kibet, food technologist at Kenya's University of Kabianga, said rapid agricultural growth occurs when many small-scale commercial farmers and large-scale farmers apply a steady stream of science-based innovations. "Profitable science-oriented innovations are largely generated in public agricultural research institutions and their public sector extension programs connect farmers with the research results, solving some of the major agricultural challenges," he said. edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 09/02/2019 page7)

                    Tired but motivated, Team China set to pull out all the stops

                Wednesday showdown with Venezuela will decide who advances at World CupGo big or go home.Frustrated and exhausted, Team China is vowing to recover from Monday's heart-wrenching overtime loss to Poland in time for Wednesday's do-or-die final group match against Venezuela at the FIBA World Cup.Most of China's woes in Monday's 79-76 setback at Wukesong Arena were self-inflicted, ranging from lax execution on offense to poor shooting decisions.The victory guaranteed Poland a berth in the second round while leaving the host in a must-win situation against Venezuela.Losing to higher-ranked Poland was not unexpected, given Team China has managed just one international win (against Cote d'Ivoire) in the past nine years. But blowing a lead due to unnecessary fouls and egregious late turnovers stunned the capacity crowd of 18,000.Watching in the arena where he led China to an eighth-place finish at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Chinese Basketball Association chairman Yao Ming was pictured on the jumbotron in the final seconds, shaking his head in disbelief, while retired forward Wang Shipeng, another member of the 2008 team, wept during his post-game TV commentary."It was so difficult to accept losing this way. It was a huge confidence-boosting opportunity thrown away," Team China head coach Li Nan told the post-game media conference."After so many years struggling at rock bottom following the era of Yao and his peers, the current generation of players is in a desperate need of proof they can compete internationally. Today they just fell short after coming so close on the biggest stage they've ever had," added Li, a prolific shooter on the 2008 squad."I understand their frustration and regret, but it's all over now as we have to pull ourselves together to prepare for one last stand, which really matters."Since Yao's retirement in 2011, Team China has been pummeled internationally, low-lighted by a fifth-place finish at the 2013 Asian championships, disqualification from the 2014 World Cup and 10 straight losses at the Olympics (2012 and 2016).The World Cup, being held in eight cities across the country, is considered a major confidence-building test for the host as China aims to rebound for next year's Tokyo Olympics.It now appears the younger generation needs more time to mature."They have to learn their lessons," said veteran forward Yi Jianlian, who notched a game-high 24 points and eight rebounds in the loss."Sometimes, to grow you have to experience a painful period and I hope this one is tough enough for them to remember and to draw motivation from."As the only member on the 2008 squad still playing, Yi is proving in an awkward way that he remains the go-to guy, with no one else in the post position coming up strong.Aggressive guard Guo Ailun, the most promising offensive threat alongside Yi, fouled out midway through the third quarter with just six points in 13 minutes, reflecting his lack of maturity.Still, pushing an average European team like Poland to overtime should not be considered a failure, said former national team guard Zhang Yunsong."The way we lost was disappointing but the takeaway from such a close game against the strongest team in the group is definitely positive," said Zhang, now coach of Beijing's entry in the Women's Chinese Basketball Association.With both teams entering the final group game with 1-1 records, China versus Venezuela should play out as a contrast of styles between the host squad's dominance in the paint and Venezuela's small yet sharp assault.The winner will join Poland in the next round, drawn into a second group stage, possibly with Russia and Argentina, to compete for two quarterfinal spots."It was a sleepless night for us yesterday but we know we have to put all the negative emotions behind our back to refocus on our next game," said Yi, who will celebrate his 32nd birthday next month."Venezuela's strength and athleticism especially on the backcourt is something we must prepare for and we should stick to our strength in the paint to dictate the play," added Yi, who spent five turbulent years in the NBA with five teams after being drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks in 2007.
