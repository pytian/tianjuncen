                Speech by H.E. Li Keqiang Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China At the Eighth Summit of Heads of Government of China and Central and Eastern European Countries
            </p>
            <p>
                Prime Minister Andrej Plenković,Colleagues,It gives me great pleasure to join you in Dubrovnik, known as the Pearl of the Adriatic. Let me first express, on behalf of the Chinese government, sincere appreciation to the host country Croatia and Prime Minister Plenković for the thoughtful preparations and arrangements made for the summit. I wish to welcome Greece joining as a full-fledged participant of China-CEEC cooperation, and welcome Austria, Belarus, the European Union, Switzerland and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to the summit as observers.China-EU relations are now showing a good momentum. Not long ago, President Xi Jinping paid a successful visit to three European countries, lending fresh impetus to deepening China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership. Thanks to the joint efforts of all parties involved, 16+1 cooperation, as an important component of overall China-Europe relations, has steadily moved forward and evolved into an open and inclusive platform for cross-regional cooperation of mutual benefit. It has played a positive role in boosting the economic growth of participating countries, improving their people's wellbeing and advancing China-Europe relations as a whole.New and encouraging progress was made in China-CEEC cooperation last year. Trade between China and the CEE countries saw substantial growth. Landmark projects such as the Budapest-Belgrade railway and the Pelješac Bridge in Croatia made new progress. The Mozura wind farm, a Montenegro-China-Malta trilateral project, is well underway. A new China-Europe freight train service was launched from Mannheim to Chongqing via Poland. Over 1.4 million visits were made by Chinese tourists to the CEE countries, and people from the CEE countries made 350,000 trips to China. Cooperation in other areas saw similar growth, and cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has been moving forward smoothly.China-CEEC cooperation is a good example of cross-regional and multilateral cooperation in the era of globalization. It builds on the economic similarity and complementarity of the participating countries, and is consistent with the trend of economic globalization and free trade. Cooperation platforms like this abound in the world. Our cooperation, which is results-oriented, meets the development needs of all participating countries.In pursuing China-CEEC cooperation, we have established a framework with the CEE countries in the driver's seat. We have followed the principle of mutual respect and equality, been sensitive to each other's major concerns, and taken into full account the realities of the countries concerned in making cooperation plans and identifying projects. This approach has helped ensure that our cooperation truly delivers, and as a result, the China-CEEC framework has attracted wide participation and strong support.Embracing the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, we have adhered to internationally recognized rules, including those of the WTO and followed EU laws and regulations in China-CEEC cooperation, and respected the responsibilities and obligations of the CEE countries which are also EU members.In pursuing China-CEEC cooperation, we have given equal importance to trade and investment, and advanced economic cooperation and people-to-people exchanges in parallel. The China-CEEC cooperation has promoted the common development of all participating countries, and contributed to more balanced development in Europe and European integration, providing an important underpinning for all-round cooperation between China and Europe.Colleagues,Our world is undergoing profound and complex changes, yet peace and development remain the theme of our time. While a new round of technological and industrial revolution brings new opportunities for development, we are also faced with the challenges of slowing growth, rising protectionism and unilateralism, and an array of regional hotspot issues, giving rise to even greater instability and uncertainty. Major international institutions have recently revised downward their global growth forecasts.Under these new circumstances, our common interests have been growing and so has our mutual need. By working together to broaden and upgrade China-CEEC cooperation, we will not just bring greater benefits to the people of China and CEE countries, but also boost the steady growth of the world economy.With this larger context in mind, the theme of our summit this year: Building New Bridges Through Openness, Innovation and Partnership is particularly focused and relevant.－ We need to build the bridges through greater openness. China-CEEC cooperation is a catalyst for open cooperation. It is not just about two-way opening of markets between China and the CEE countries, but also about being open to the EU and to countries outside the region. China is a beneficiary of reform and opening-up. The just-adopted Foreign Investment Law has sent a clear signal of China's commitment to opening-up at a higher level. This will help create a well-regulated and law-based business environment for CEE enterprises in making investments in China. Likewise, we hope CEE countries could provide more convenience for the import of medium and high-end Chinese products such as in the electronics, communications and clean energy sectors.－ We need to build the bridges through unimpeded innovation. China-CEEC cooperation, which started small but developed into a maturing mechanism in just seven years, is an act of innovation in itself. It has built a new platform for cross-regional, multi-party cooperation, and created a new channel for China-Europe cooperation. It has explored new areas of practical cooperation, and established over 20 mechanisms in areas from economy and trade to cultural and people-to-people links, and from government cooperation to subnational exchanges, with new contents and forms of cooperation added every year. In particular, science, technology and innovation have become new highlights of cooperation, and third-party cooperation with the EU has generated benefits to all parties and demonstrated a broad prospect.－ We need to build the bridges through stronger partnership. China-CEEC cooperation is a robust practice of multilateralism. By building closer partnership between China and the CEE countries, it has served as a model of harmonious co-existence, inclusive development and win-win cooperation among countries with different social systems, cultural traditions and levels of development. The China-CEEC Global Partnership Center to be inaugurated later today aims to provide policy and legal advice and intellectual support for enterprises from both sides in expanding trade and investment cooperation. We welcome the active participation of academic institutions from CEE countries and the EU in the center's activities.I look forward to hearing your insights and building greater common understanding with you on further deepening our practical cooperation.Colleagues,China wishes to share its development opportunities with the CEE countries and foster new drivers for China-CEEC cooperation. Here I wish to make the following proposals on our future cooperation.First, we need to jointly uphold the multilateral trading system. A free and open international trade and investment environment is essential for deepening China-CEEC cooperation. The rules-based and WTO-centered multilateral trading system, which was established on the basis of historical lessons and through sustained and hard work by all parties, plays an irreplaceable role in the global economic and trade system.It is true that certain aspects of the WTO rules need to be reformed and improved to reflect changing realities and enhance their authority and effectiveness. China also takes a positive stand to the WTO reform. That said, the reform does not mean starting all over again or serving the interests of only a small number of countries. The fundamental principles and core values of the WTO, such as openness, transparency, inclusiveness and non-discrimination, should remain unchanged. Nor should there be any change in the direction of trade liberalization. Otherwise, the reform may disrupt global trade and stall global growth.As a developing country, China believes that the reform should accommodate the concerns of the majority of WTO members, uphold the development rights and interests and the special and differential treatment of developing members, and create conditions for narrowing the North-South gap. China stands ready to work with CEE countries to advance economic globalization, uphold multilateralism, and make the global governance system more just and equitable.Second, we need to further expand our trade volume. Economic and trade cooperation between China and the CEE countries promises a huge potential. Last year, bucking the global trend of slowing trade growth, China-CEE trade saw a robust increase of 21 percent, reaching US$82.2 billion. China does not seek trade surpluses. What we want is an improving trade structure along with growing trade. We will explore every possible means to increase imports as a way to promote balanced trade. The quality yet inexpensive agricultural products from CEE countries are popular in China. Last year, China-CEEC agricultural trade exceeded US$1.2 billion, with wine and dairy product trade up by 37.6 percent and 85.5 percent respectively over 2014. To meet the diverse needs of Chinese consumers, we are ready to import more specialty and quality agricultural products from CEE countries. To this end, China will further speed up the inspection and quarantine process and facilitate the export of high-quality agricultural products from the CEE countries to China.Third, we need to promote cooperation on the development of the BRI. The BRI follows the approach of consultation and collaboration for shared benefits, and upholds the principles of openness, transparency and inclusiveness. It is not meant to replace existing mechanisms and initiatives on regional cooperation, but to build on the good foundations to promote win-win and common development of all participating countries. All the 16 CEE countries have signed BRI cooperation agreements with China. Recently, European countries such as Italy and Luxemburg have also signed such MOUs with China.China is committed to strengthen the complementarity of development strategies with CEE and other European countries to better leverage our comparative strengths. We also stand ready to promote cooperation on cross-border connectivity, industrial capacity and equipment manufacturing to boost the level of economic, trade and investment cooperation and achieve win-win outcomes and common prosperity. The second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation will be held at the end of this month in Beijing, where the parties will explore new ways to promote BRI cooperation through further consultations.Fourth, we need to step up efforts to expand innovation cooperation. Given our comparative strengths in innovation, there is much space to tap in our cooperation. The Chinese side will work with CEEC governments to encourage cooperation in joint research and joint laboratories, and expand exchanges between scientists and in science popularization. We need to earnestly implement the Science, Technology and Innovation Partnership, hold a successful Conference on Innovation Cooperation, and foster new areas of innovation cooperation such as digital economy, e-commerce, FinTech, and smart cities. We need to work together to maintain a fair, just and non-discriminatory market environment to pave the way for progress in innovation cooperation.Developing the green economy is the shared goal of China and the CEE countries and an important part of innovation cooperation between the two sides. We need to make good use of the new Environmental Protection Cooperation Mechanism, encourage subnational cooperation on the implementation of environmental protection demonstration projects, promote cooperation in joint research and environmental protection technology, and expand joint development of wind, solar and other clean sources of energy. We also need to encourage relevant institutions to support cooperation projects on the green economy through issuing green bonds and other means to increase the green elements of China-CEEC cooperation.Fifth, we need to continue to advance cooperation between our SMEs and on industrial park development. Both China and CEE countries have a large number of SMEs, which are important sources of jobs and innovation. They deserve an important place in China-CEEC cooperation. The SMEs Cross-Border Matchmaking Event to be held during the Business Forum is expected to deliver more results in this field. China welcomes the launch of the Coordination Mechanism for SMEs website in Croatia, and welcomes SMEs from CEE countries to participate in the second China International Import Expo.Industrial parks provide an effective platform for SMEs to achieve cluster development and economies of scale, and serve as an important channel for enhancing cross-border SME cooperation. We need to ensure the smooth operation of the China-CEEC Demonstration Zone for Economic Cooperation and Trade in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, the SMEs Cooperation Zone in Cangzhou, Hebei Province, the People-to-People Exchange and Experience Headquarters in the Yangtze River Delta Industrial Zone, and the China (Liaoning) CEEC Pavilion to build bridges for cooperation between our businesses. We welcome CEE countries' participation in the development of industrial parks in various forms, and will continue to improve laws and regulations to create an enabling investment climate for companies from CEE countries in China.Sixth, we need to deepen people-to-people and cultural exchanges and cooperation. China-CEEC friendship has taken deep roots, and mutually beneficial cooperation between the two sides has yielded fruitful results. We need to build on the positive momentum generated by the China-CEEC Education and Youth Exchange Year to ensure the success of the China-CEEC Education Policy Dialogue and the meeting of the China-CEEC Higher Education Institutions Consortium. China will invite education officials and heads of universities of CEE countries to visit China to promote cooperation between institutions of higher education and carry out capacity building programs in educational fields.China will continue to support the development of Confucius Institutes to provide better services for the people of CEE countries to learn the Chinese language. China supports the establishment of a China-CEEC Youth Development Center at an early date and will continue to hold China-CEEC youth camps and university winter sports festivals to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the young people of our countries.We need to give better play to the role of the China-CEEC Coordination Center for Cultural Cooperation in promoting cultural dialogue and people-to-people communication. We need to make good use of existing platforms to expand cooperation between our local governments and think tanks as well as in tourism, health, sports and other fields. We need to hold a successful China-CEEC Forum of Capital City Mayors to encourage direct cooperation between our local governments.The beautiful landscapes, profound historical and cultural legacies, and rich tourism resources have made CEE countries popular destinations for Chinese tourists. China welcomes the holding of tourism expos in China by companies from CEE countries. As conditions permit, China is ready to explore the possibility of opening more direct flights to facilitate the travel of Chinese tourists to CEE countries.Here, I would like to announce that China will host the ninth China-CEEC Summit next year. It will be the second summit to be held in China after the Suzhou Summit in 2015. I look forward to seeing you all in China and working with you to map out the blueprint for China-CEEC cooperation.Colleagues,This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China as well as the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and some CEE countries. Building on the good progress we have made in our friendly cooperation over the past seven decades, China is ready to work with CEE countries to open up greater space for our cooperation. As a Croatian proverb goes, "The bread is made of numerous grains while the palace is built out of many stones." Similarly, we in China often say, "Tiny streams converge to make rivers and seas." As long as we all pitch in and persist in our efforts, China-CEEC cooperation will only grow stronger, deliver greater benefits to our peoples, and make new contribution to China-Europe friendship and cooperation as well as world peace and development.Thank you.

                Discovering Chinese culture in a tea cup
            </a>
            <p>
                Inspired by a can of tea given to him by one of his Chinese friends in 2004, Hugh Henry began to enjoy the unique flavor and culture of Chinese tea."I enjoyed that can of tea very much and never went back to coffee!" said Henry, an American who is fascinated by tea. "I want to encourage Americans to try to understand Chinese people and culture.""Many people are drinking coffee in the US and sometimes we use coffee as a substitute for sleep. One can get addicted to coffee and become the slave of coffee. But I found that with tea, there is less caffeine, so you can enjoy the tea without the slavery of caffeine," he said.Among aspects of Chinese culture, Henry found that tea provides a bridge to understanding China and making friends. "When I came to China, I wanted to be friends with Chinese people, to understand them, and tea was the perfect way to do that," he said."People in China drink tea from a small cup, they drink it slowly. It is a beautiful blend of art, science, fragrance, taste and friendship," he said. "I enjoy experiencing new varieties of tea, but I drink Duyun Maojian (a green tea produced in Southwest China's Guizhou province) almost every day."In 2014, he became an English teacher at the College of Tea Art in Guizhou Forerunner College, a higher education vocational institution in Guizhou province. It suits him well both in pursuing his interest in tea and improving the students' language skills.Henry is very modest while studying tea culture. "Though I've learned many things about tea, I feel like I've only scratched the surface - I find out from my Chinese students that there's much more to learn," he said.

                China's Gao Xiaosong becomes an associate of Harvard
            </a>
            <p>
                Chinese singer-songwriter Gao Xiaosong became an associate of the faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University in the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, Gao announced on social media."I am officially appointed to Harvard University today. I went to the library and it was exciting to find out that the staff members at the library had prepared lots of materials I am interested in. I am touched by their professionalism," Gao wrote on Jan 31 on his Sina Weibo account, which has more than 40 million followers.He also posted pictures of manuscripts written by Sun Yat-sen, the pioneering Chinese revolutionary and political leader, and those from China's famous writer Lin Yutang as well as letters by Lin, American economist Eliot Janeway, and American novelist Pearl S. Buck. He also added that besides doing his job at Alibaba Entertainment, he will "do research at Harvard".Gao's appointment is also posted on the university's website.The 48-year-old Gao, who was born in Beijing and dropped out of Tsinghua University in 1991, is recognized for introducing "campus folk music style" to Chinese music lovers in the 1990s by writing popular hits, including My Desk Mate. He released his song collection, No Regret Youth, in 1996, with some of the country's most popular singers performing his songs. In 1996, he, along with Song Ke, a guru in Chinese music circles, launched a record company, Taihe Rye Music.Now, Gao and Song serve as chairman and CEO of Alibaba Music Group, which is under Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group. Besides music, Gao also has his talk show, directs films and publishes books.

                Turn off the TV and e-games and travel through time, space
            </a>
            <p>
                One of the many good things I have experienced since I moved to China has been an invigorated interest in reading. With my favorite television programs harder or impossible to access, I turned to the (electronic) pages of an e-reader.Since I was eager to learn all about my new home, I turned to Chinese authors as well as foreign authors, including those of the Chinese diaspora. (I had read a biography of early revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen when I was about 12, long before I ever imagined living here.)One of my early favorites when I arrived in China was US writer and journalist Peter Hessler, who took the name He Wei in China. His River Town: Two Years on the Yangtze, about his introduction to China in 1996 as an English teacher in Fuling, Sichuan province (now part of Chongqing), is an excellent primer for newcomers. His descriptions of day-to-day life are insightful, and he captures an interesting point in time as China opened up.

                From Buck to Bush: the Heritage of Understanding
            </a>
            <p>
                In a recent speech at a literary event, former librarian of the British Library Frances Wood recollected how former Chinese premier Wen Jiabao, during a visit to Britain in 2011, said he read Shakespeare in his younger years and wanted to pay homage to the Bard's birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon. Wood wondered why no British Prime Minister had requested to see the homes of the authors despite early exposure to Chinese classics such as Journey to the West or Dream of the Red Mansion.That reminded me of President George H.W. Bush and Pearl S. Buck.The senior Bush was among the favorite US presidents for the Chinese. As the second director at the US Liason Office in China after the normalization of US-China relations, Bush wandered around Beijing on a bike with his wife and had fried dough sticks and bean curd soup for breakfast like a Beijing resident. Later, as US president, he adopted a pragmatic and constructive approach to Sino-US relationship, actively engaging China in the world economy and politics. Without exaggeration, Bush Sr. contributed most to decades of goodwill between the two countries and the two peoples as a US president.

                Whole lotta sole for All-Star weekend
            </a>
            <p>
                'Sneakerheads' celebrate unveiling of new designs by NBA's top gunsNBA players once again will be sharing personal stories this weekend during All-Star festivities - and using basketball shoes as a platform to get their message out.When Kevin Durant takes to the floor in Charlotte, North Carolina on Sunday he'll be wearing pink Nike KD 11 Aunt Pearls shoes bearing the names of 59 cancer survivors with inspiring stories.Golden State Warriors teammate Stephen Curry decided to poke fun at his own mischievous nature with his shoe selection, unveiling the Under Armour Curry 6 "Coy Fish" colorway, which depicts the time he and a former college teammate found themselves in a little trouble for pulling a prank at a Japanese steakhouse.All-Star shoe fashion may not be as big as it once was, but it's still a real thing.For a loyal niche of fans in the basketball community known as "sneakerheads", the shoes players wear are still considered as big a deal as the All-Star Game itself - even though the overall market for basketball shoes may not be what it was a decade ago.Regardless, the stories behind them add meaning to the shoes.Curry's "Coy Fish" shoe ($130), for instance, resembles the vibrant koi fish - and the story of when Curry and former Davidson Wildcats teammate Steve Rossiter decided to jump into the koi fish pond at a local Japanese restaurant while out celebrating one night.Curry was the decoy in the escapade, distracting the hostess while Rossiter jumped in the water and tried to grab one of the fish.

                China starts implementing tougher vehicle emission standards
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - Several provincial-level regions on Monday started implementing the "China VI" vehicle emission standards ahead of schedule to ramp up efforts against a major source of air pollution.Sales and registrations of new vehicles in regions including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hebei province and Guangdong province now have to comply with what is believed to be one of the world's strictest rules on automobile pollutants.In Beijing, all new buses and other heavy-duty diesel vehicles shall follow the new emission rules, while all new vehicles are expected to follow suit starting Jan. 1, 2020.All existing vehicles on the roads are obliged to meet the previous "China V" emission standards.According to official data, emissions from some 6.2 million vehicles were responsible for 45 percent of Beijing's concentration of small, breathable particles known as PM2.5, a key indicator of air pollution.Compared with the "National V" standards, the new rules demand substantially fewer pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matters and introduce limits on particulate number and ammonia.The new emission standards were initially set to take effect nationwide from July 1, 2020. A three-year action plan on air pollution control released last July urged early implementation in major heavily-polluted areas, the Pearl River Delta region, Sichuan province and Chongqing municipality.Automakers and the market have been preparing for the tougher rules.Manufacturers have completed the development of most "China VI" models and have entered the stage of mass production and sales, said Liu Youbin, a spokesperson with the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.By June 20, 99 light vehicle makers had unveiled environmental protection information of 2,144 new models and 60 heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers unveiled information on 896 green models, Liu said."The market has basically accomplished a smooth transition," Liu said.Li Hong, an official with the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), said roll-outs of "China VI" vehicles as well as preferential tax and fee policies would boost China's auto market."The production and sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs) will continue its relatively fast growth," Li said.Car sales in China continued to drop in May, with about 1.913 million vehicles sold, down by 16.4 percent year on year, CAAM showed. Bucking the trend, sales of NEVs kept growing that month, edging up 1.8 percent year on year.China saw robust sales growth of NEVs in the first four months this year with 360,000 NEVs sold, surging by 59.8 percent from the same period a year earlier.Chinese authorities have announced that the tax exemptions on NEV purchases will continue through 2020 to boost the country's green development and retain a strong domestic market.

                Passing the torch of Pearl Buck’s brilliance
            </a>
            <p>
                If there is a Forbes list of richest American writers in China, Pearl S. Buck (1892-1973), Nobel Laureate and humanitarian, would be at the top, at least in estate value.Pearl Buck has "houses" in four cities: Suzhou, Anhui province; Zhenjiang, Jiangsu province; Nanjing, Jiangsu province; and Lushan, Jiangxi province.All of those cities have restored the residences that Pearl Buck once lived in as cultural heritage sites. The Pearl Buck residences in China are like pearls strung together to adorn the ongoing friendship between the Chinese and American people.On June 29, the city of Suzhou, Anhui province also added a Pearl Buck Research Society in China, following the cities of Zhenjiang and Nanjing, both of which have their own Pearl Buck societies.As the daughter of Christian missionaries Caroline Maude (Stulting) (1857–1921) and Absalom Sydenstricker (1852-1931), Pearl Buck grew up in Zhenjiang, where she freely mingled with the Chinese masses and deeply immersed herself in Chinese culture.She went with her husband John Lossing Buck to present-day Suzhou, where she made friends with the locals as a missionary wife. The experience became a setting for her masterpiece The Good Earth.She also taught at the University of Nanking (present-day Nanjing University). Her life was intricately interwoven with so many Chinese lives: She helped with a farmer's wife as she gave birth. She interacted with the Chinese literati, including Xu Zhimo. She ushered Chinese authors such as Lin Yutang to the world stage. She made speeches in America to win support for China in the Second World War. At the Nobel Prize ceremony, she paid tribute to the Chinese literary tradition.During the "cultural revolution" (1966-76), China rejected her application for a visa to revisit China, but neither history nor the Chinese people forgot those who have loved the good old earth of China, and the people who live on it.Today, China has returned the love of Pearl Buck with great enthusiasm by honoring her life through research activities, memorial events and even a public square in Zhenjiang.The Pearl Buck phenomenon in China testifies to the validity and vitality of the unscripted, free-flowing exchange of people from different cultural traditions.This is a time when China and the United States are having an ongoing trade dispute, which sometimes directed all attention to the interaction between the two governments.There is more to the Sino-US relationships than what political rhetoric has led us to see. The story between China and the United States will not be complete if we neglect the rich, dynamic and multilayered interactions of civil societies, including exchanges between individuals, schools, cities and provinces.Today, exchanges between the two countries face severe challenges. Scholars and students with different views are sometimes suspected as government agents, rather than cultural agents promoting goodwill.There should be thousands of Pearl Bucks who have full-life immersion in other cultures to help their compatriots see the best in other people, no matter which ways the political winds are blowing.The author is a US-based translator who has translated two biographies of Pearl S. Buck.
