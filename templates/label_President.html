In the first decade of the new millennium the relationship between the LAC and China was mainly marked by trade; whereas in this second decade energy and infrastructure investment sectors have gained in importance

There are many intertwined issues between China and the US (and the West in general) but the core issue is how the world (including China itself) should comprehend and cope with the rise of China and its technological giants
