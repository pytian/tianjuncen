                While the celebrations for Mid-Autumn Festival have evolved over the centuries, its origins can be traced back to the ancient tradition of making offerings to the moon to solicit good fortune.Since there was no night curfew in place during the Song Dynasty (960-1279), Mid-Autumn Festival was a time for grand celebrations for the nobility, government officials and ordinary people alike.People would dress up in their finery, visit night markets and stay up late to observe the moon while drinking alcohol and viewing colorful lanterns.

                    China condemns unsubstantiated claims of Huawei 'threat'

                China expressed opposition on Monday to fabricated claims telecoms giant Huawei's 5G poses a so-called security threat to others.Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily news briefing that Beijing opposes curbing Chinese companies undergoing normal telecommunication business and cooperation under the guise of "national security".The United States raised its concerns with Gulf allies over a possible security risk in using Huawei's technology for their 5G mobile infrastructure, Reuters quoted US officials as saying during their visits to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.However, according to a Bloomberg report on Friday, the US semiconductor industry urged US President Donald Trump to make good on his promise to ease the ban on sales to Huawei in a letter dated Sept 11 to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.The US has been abusing national power to suppress and smear certain Chinese enterprises recently, Hua noted, adding "such practices have violated market spirit and international rules, which are shady and immoral".Not a shred of evidence was presented by the US nor any other country, organization or individual to prove it faces threats from Huawei, the spokeswoman said.According to a Daily Mirror report in May no backdoors were found in Huawei's products, and 10 vulnerabilities were discovered in products made by US-based Cisco, Hua said, adding Facebook user accounts were also revealed to have backdoors."If all countries would like to ensure cybersecurity, it is US companies like Cisco and Apple they should be cautious about rather than Huawei," Hua said.Supply chain security issues are not unique to 5G or a single company; these always exist in information and communication technology, she said.She called on various countries to conduct in-depth discussions of security issues and propose feasible suggestions under the premise of fairness, justice and non-discrimination, and jointly safeguard the security of information technology products and services.
