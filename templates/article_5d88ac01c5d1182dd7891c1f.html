            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                RIO DE JANEIRO -- Inter Milan loanee Gabriel Barbosa continued his prolific scoring run with a goal in each half as Flamengo routed defending champions Palmeiras 3-0 in Brazil's Serie A championship on Sunday.Barbosa netted in the 11th minute at the Maracana stadium by deftly chipping over goalkeeper Weverton after Giorgian De Arrascaeta's slide rule pass.Uruguay international playmaker Arrascaeta then struck his eighth goal in 10 league matches by heading in a Bruno Henrique cross before Barbosa made it 3-0 by converting from the penalty spot.Barbosa has now scored 28 goals in 38 matches for Flamengo since joining the club in January.The result meant Flamengo remained top of the 20-team standings with 36 points from 17 matches, ahead of second-placed Santos on goal difference. The latter ended a three-match winless run with a 1-0 victory at Chapecoense on Saturday.Palmeiras have gone five league matches without a win and have slipped to fifth, six points off the pace.

                 Rich, rhythmic, harmonious, nostalgic, and unique – this is tango, a global byword for Latin passion, in the eyes of Giovanna Facchinelli, a Uruguayan tango singer, who is better known as the Red Lady of contemporary tango.With her signature flaming red hair and even redder lips, the singer clad in a low-cut black suit dress and stilettos of different colors, charmed the audience at Beijing's live bar Tango by Ala House on the evening of Aug 13, by performing the tango songs that originated from the slums of Montevideo and Buenos Aires over two centuries ago.Sitting on a chair onstage, Giovanna sipped wine and shut her eyes to summon her tango muse. When she began to sing, her voice, a powerhouse, became an excellent interpreter of human emotions.

                    Uruguay Week to cultivate closer trade ties with China
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Uruguay kicked off Uruguay Week with business seminar, products and show as part of a campaign to promote closer economic and trade relations with China.China is Uruguay's top trade partner and the latter was the first country of Mercosur, a South American trade bloc, to sign the memorandum of understanding on the joint building of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with China in 2018.At the launch of the week in Beijing on Monday, Guillermo Moncecchi, Uruguay's Minister of Industry, Energy and Mining, said his country is a great partner to China despite its small territory and geographical distance citing the countries advantages as a regional business hub and its role in the Belt and Road: the gateway to Mercosur and Latin America."We are complementary, we are reliable and we have a lot to offer to each other, in mutual benefit," Moncecchi said."Uruguay has positioned itself as a reliable and attractive destination for foreign investors. It is one of the Latin American countries with the best facilities for doing business," said Antonio Carámbula, president of Uruguay XXI, the country's investment, export and image promotion agency.Zheng Zeguang, Vice-Foreign Minister of China, attended the ceremony.The country is also a world leader in renewable energy and the most advanced in the development of communication and information technologies in Latin America.With 3.5 million inhabitants, the country uses 80 percent of its territory to raise cattle with beef as its main production.China is Uruguay's top beef importer with 60 percent of the beef export of the Latin American country coming to China in 2018. The country sees great potential market in China as Chinese only consume 5.5kg beef per head annually compared to 60kg in Uruguay.Uruguay's Week in China is organized by Uruguay XXI with the support of the Uruguayan Embassy in China and will travel to Tianjin and Shenzhen. In 2018 this activity was headed by the Uruguayan Minister of Foreign Affairs, Rodolfo Nin Novoa, and took place in Beijing, Chongqing and Guangzhou, where consulate general was also inaugurated.

                    Bolsonaro prepares to send army to contain Amazon fires
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                RIO DE JANEIRO — Under increasing international pressure to contain record numbers of fires in the Amazon, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said Friday he might send the military to battle the massive blazes."That's the plan," said Bolsonaro. He did not say when the armed forces would get involved but suggested that action could be imminent.Bolsonaro has previously described rainforest protections as an obstacle to economic development, sparring with critics who note that the Amazon produces vast amounts of oxygen and is considered crucial in efforts to contain global warming.Small numbers of demonstrators gathered outside Brazilian diplomatic missions in Paris, London and Geneva to urge Brazil to do more to fight the fires.Neighboring Bolivia and Paraguay have also struggled to contain fires that swept through woods and fields and, in many cases, got out of control in high winds after being set by residents clearing land for farming. About 7,500 square kilometers (2,900 square miles) of land has been affected in Bolivia, according to Defense Minister Javier Zavaleta.On Friday, a B747-400 SuperTanker arrived in Bolivia to help with the fire-fighting effort. The US-based aircraft can carry nearly 76,000 liters (20,000 gallons) of retardant, a substance used to stop fires.Some 370 square kilometers (140 square miles) have burned in northern Paraguay, near the borders with Brazil and Bolivia, said Joaquín Roa, a Paraguayan state emergency official. He said the situation has stabilized.In escalating tension over the fires, France accused Bolsonaro of having lied to French leader Emmanuel Macron and threatened to block a European Union trade deal with several South American states, including Brazil.The specter of possible economic repercussions for Brazil and its South American neighbors show how the Amazon is becoming a battleground between Bolsonaro and Western governments alarmed that vast swathes of the region are going up in smoke on his watch.Ahead of a Group of Seven summit in France this weekend, Macron's office issued a statement questioning Bolsonaro's trustworthiness.Brazilian statements and decisions indicate Bolsonaro "has decided to not respect his commitments on the climate, nor to involve himself on the issue of biodiversity," Macron's statement said.It added that France now opposes an EU trade deal "in its current state" with the Mercosur bloc of South American nations that includes Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.Finnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne also expressed concern, saying he is "truly worried about the attitude Brazil seems to have adopted right now regarding" fires in the Amazon."Brazilian rainforests are vital for the world's climate" and Brazil should do whatever it can to stop the blazes, said Rinne, whose country holds the European Union's rotating presidency.Bolsonaro has accused Macron of politicizing the issue, and his government said European countries are exaggerating Brazil's environmental problems in order to disrupt its commercial interests. Bolsonaro has said he wants to convert land for cattle pastures and soybean farms.Even so, Brazilian state experts have reported a record of nearly 77,000 wildfires across the country so far this year, up 85% over the same period in 2018. Brazil contains about 60% of the Amazon rainforest, whose degradation could have severe consequences for global climate and rainfall.AP

                    Cabo Polonio, Uruguay’s Shangri-La
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                In this day and age, urban dwellers are either cocooned in the digital world, minds boggled by a myriad of content online; or subconsciously tyrannized by the always-being-connected lifestyle, bombarded 24/7 by push notifications on ever-smarter phones.Buffeted and drained by the hustle and bustle in big cities, do you sometimes fancy zoning out a bit to go back to nature and regain peace and quiet within?Uruguay, a diamond embedded between Brazil and Argentina, now promises its Cabo Polonio, a hamlet many people call “Shangri-La” on the country’s eastern coast, can shelter and nourish weary souls in modern life.Dr. Leonardo Segalerba, 54, born in Uruguay’s capital, Montevideo, used to work as a lawyer in the capital city. Tired of hectic city life, he retired at 40, moved to Cabo Polonio and became one of its 120 permanent residents.“Basically every 20 seconds at night, you can spot a meteor shooting across the sky,” said Segalerba, press representative for Cabo Polonio at a promotional event held at the Cervantes Institute in Beijing.Cabo, meaning “cape” in English, is a peninsula infamous for its rocky shores and fierce seas that wrecked many ships. Polonio, a Spanish ship, was just one of those misfortunes. It crashed into the peninsula on a stormy night in 1735, leaving its name as a legacy to the place where it was destroyed.Isolated from surrounding cities by sand dunes and without roads directly leading to it, Cabo Polonio is geographically removed from urban civilization. The only way to get there is by taking a double-decker truck that routinely picks up tourists at a station and takes them on a 20-minute bumpy ride.Electricity, genesis of modern comfort and entertainment, isn’t available. But it is worth noting the iconic lighthouse erected in 1881 by the Uruguayan government is powered by the national grid to prevent shipwrecks.Moreover, there is no running water in the area, and villagers there rely on water from wells and collected rain water.Recognized as a national park in 2009 by the Uruguayan government, Cabo Polonio embraces a mix of natural environments, such as beaches, sand dunes, and wetland. Meanwhile, the park is home to Uruguay’s second-largest colony of sea lions, which number roughly 200,000.With its breathtaking natural beauty and primitiveness, Cabo Polonio strikes visitors as the Shangri-La of South America. Since the 1980s, the site has been sought after by American and European tourists who desire to escape suffocating city life and reconnect with the freshness and tranquility of nature.“Many writers live here around the year focusing on their books as it’s a place where they can disconnect themselves from the chaos of the modern world,” Segalerba said.“It is only in the last two years that Chinese tourists began to come to Cabo Polonio,” Segalerba told China Daily in an interview.Zhang Qi, 32, a travel enthusiast whose footsteps have been left in more than 60 countries, is among the first batch of Chinese tourists to the area.Zhang has traveled to Uruguay four times and to Cabo Polonio twice, in 2017 and 2018. He spent more than 20 days during his recent trip to the village with his brother and sister-in-law, who were on their honeymoon.Calling Cabo Polonio his favorite place in the world, the well-traveled man opened a café in Beijing’s always buzzing and alcohol-laden Sanlitun in May and named it “Cabo Coffee”, serving both excellent coffee and South Americans’ favorite drink, the mate tea, a caffeine-rich infused drink.“In Cabo, I saw the biggest-ever setting sun, the most beautiful sunset, and the most spectacular galaxy of the southern hemisphere,” Zhang fondly recalled, adding that “There is no electricity in Cabo, but it makes the place cooler and gives me a sense of primitiveness.”Like Zhang’s observation, Cabo Polonio is at its finest at night.As the lighthouse is the sole artificial light after sunset, the region is free from light pollution, making it a vantage point in the Southern Hemisphere for appreciating thousands of stars punctuating the night sky.Another night feast for the eye is watching the second-largest sea lion colony in Uruguay behind the iconic lighthouse, where the creatures can be seen singing and dancing.During the day, Cabo Polonio also has much fun to offer. Surfing, sunbathing on the beaches, running up and sliding down the sand dunes, or hiking along the shores are among the activities.The village, covering an area of about 26,000 hectares, is inhabited only by 120 permanent residents, with most engaged in tourism, running restaurants or renting their houses to tourists.During the peak season, from mid-December to mid-January, some 3,000 tourists will flock to Cabo Polonio and spend days or even weeks there. This has aroused the concern of many environmentalists, fearing swarms of tourists may pose a threat or even damage protected wildlife and the fragile ecosystem that the country values.“The isolation created by the surroundings prevents swarms of tourists from reaching Cabo, acting as a ‘natural shield’ that protects and preserves its culture and distinct way of life,” Segalerba explained.Segalerba also pointed out that planning, analyzing and monitoring tourists’ behavioral patterns can help achieve a fragile balance between environmental protection and the sustainable development of the area.In addition, the authority in charge of the site will adopt measures such as managing tourist flow of the year and involving the local community in environmental protection to handle problems that may arise with the arrival of more and more international tourists.Yang Xiaoyu contributed to the story
