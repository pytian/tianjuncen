                Building a better world for all is China's mission
            </a>
            <p>
                Bright prospects for the commons are what General Secretary Xi Jinping of the Communist Party of China Central Committee sought to convey in his keynote speech at the world political parties dialogue on Friday, in which he accentuated his proposal that countries work together to build a community of shared future for all mankind. Building such a community will remain an unrealistic prospect unless every country associates its own development with that of the world. Yet, despite two world wars and the Cold War, zero-sum thinking is still prevalent. As a result, the prosperity of some nations continues to be at the expense of the rest of the world. China and its ruling party are trying to blaze a new trail and are calling on countries to build a global community with a shared future that is inclusive of different countries, cultures and peoples.

                Xi's poverty alleviation work praised by UK academics
            </a>
            <p>
                UK academics have described President Xi Jinping’s vision for alleviating poverty, which he delivered at the Boao Forum for Asia, as “a worthy aim”.During the conference in South China’s Hainan province, Xi said: “The Chinese people have emerged from a life of shortages and poverty and are now enjoying abundant supply and a moderately prosperous life.”When the president launched his poverty-reduction campaign in 2015, he said there were still more than 70 million people living in poverty in China. This week, Xi vowed to end extreme poverty by 2020.China’s leader also noted that, according to a UN report, more than 700 million Chinese people were lifted out of poverty from 1978 to 2014, accounting for more than 70 percent of the global total.Chris Rowley, an Asia expert and professor at the University of Oxford’s Kellogg College, said the aim of ending extreme poverty is a worthy one but, given China’s massive and rapid economic development and growth since the 1980s, not something that is unexpected.“Also of importance are access to things like electricity and equality, where there are yawning gaps between the ‘haves and have nots’,” Rowley said. “It may be expected that wealth will trickle down to all and reduce poverty, but of importance is equality and inclusiveness between and within ethnic groups, regions, rural-urban areas.”Julian Beer, deputy vice-chancellor at Birmingham City University, said Xi’s speech “builds upon earlier commitments for greater market liberalization with tangible statements about seeking to enter the WTO Government Procurement Agreement” that he said “can only be seen as positive”.He added that the first China International Import Expo in Shanghai in November will be “a significant opportunity for the British government and British businesses to showcase in an imminent post-Brexit environment the best of British goods and services”.Beer noted that the creative industries and arts will benefit from strong Sino-UK relations in addition to the manufacturing industry.“The combined prowess of British and Chinese intellectual property and design working in tandem to shape and influence both culture and industry could be very powerful and I hope these opportunities are seized,” he said.

                Fuel tax hikes halted to calm protests
            </a>
            <p>
                Recent violence in France reveals social fracturePARIS - The French government on Tuesday announced the suspension of fuel tax increases for six months, in a bid to quell fierce protests which have ballooned into the deepest crisis of Emmanuel Macron's presidency."No tax merits putting the unity of the nation in danger," French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said, adding that the anger on the streets" originates from a profound injustice: of not being able to live with dignity from one's work".

                China willing to try and help US overcome its opioid crisis: China Daily editorial
            </a>
            <p>
                There is enough reason to welcome the consensus President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump reached on the control of fentanyl in their meeting in Argentina over the weekend. But it would be totally wrong to conclude from the agreement that China is to blame for the abuse of opioids in the United States.Fentanyl is said to be 100 times more powerful than morphine, and even 30-50 times more potent than heroin, and its abuse has become a serious social problem in the US. More than 72,000 people died of drug overdoses in the US last year, with fentanyl responsible for more than 29,000 of them, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.On the one hand, with the increasingly widening gap between the haves and have-nots in the US, an increasing number of poor people turn to opioids, including synthetic ones, to escape the harsh reality of their lives. On the other hand, the abuse of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has a lot to do with some US pharmaceutical companies, which manufacture and sell fentanyl-containing drugs as painkillers.As a result, many people get addicted to such prescription opioids and some die from an overdose.China has long exerted strict control over the production and sale of fentanyl substances. While there is no knowing whether there are any criminal gangs manufacturing fentanyl substances and smuggling them into the US, there are only five licensed pharmaceutical companies that manufacture fentanyl substances and related preparations. Their total output was 24.26 kilograms in 2017, none of which has been found to have fallen into illegal channels.All told, China has already put 25 variants of fentanyl, plus two precursor chemicals used to make the drug on its list of controlled substances. Now, the Foreign Ministry says that all fentanyl-like substances will be listed as controlled substances as the government starts working to adjust related regulations. This will prevent any chemical variants of fentanyl being produced faster than regulators can declare them illegal.The authorities will also further tighten their control on the manufacturing and sale of fentanyl substances and strengthen their efforts to prevent any illegal manufacturing and smuggling.But it is imperative the US do what it can to fight its opioid crisis, instead of just passing the buck to China.

                For friendly drinks, there's no place like the corner bar
            </a>
            <p>
                Pull up a seat, have a beer and let's talk. About proper neighborhood bars. And the lack of them in Beijing.As China's so-called drinking culture continues to evolve, it's my hope the corner bar will find its rightful niche in the social network.I'm not talking about the overstuffed clubs popular in every city, where blaring music and blinding lights make conversation impossibly difficult, and where the bartender doesn't know you from the proverbial Adam.

                Facial recognition in central London raises concerns
            </a>
            <p>
                A private developer's use of facial recognition technology at a 27.1-hectare commercial site in central London has raised questions from the public and the mayor of London. Mayor Sadiq Khan has written to the owner of a King's Cross development asking of the company believes its use of facial recognition software in its CCTV systems is legal. Google's British headquarters is located in one of the site's buildings. Property developer Argent said it was using the cameras "in the interests of public safety" in King's Cross, mostly in an area north of the railway station, but the precise uses of the technology remain unclear.
