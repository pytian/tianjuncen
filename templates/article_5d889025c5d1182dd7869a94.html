                Castle culture draws experts to Jincheng forum
            </p>
            <p>
                A forum where domestic and foreign attendees discuss how to better preserve and develop ancient castles wrapped up on Sunday in Shanxi province's Jincheng, a city hailed as "City of Ancient Castles".The city in North China is renowned as the location of the Taihang ancient castle clusters, composed of 117 castle sites, most of which can be traced back to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and Qing Dynasty (1644-1912).Held by the local culture and tourism bureau, the two-day 2019 Ancient Castle Dialogue Between East and West attracted officials and experts from France, Lithuania, Hungary, Ukraine, Ecuador and China to work out ways to protect cultural heritage, promote the ancient castles in Jincheng as popular tourist attractions and boost academic exchanges on castle culture between China and some European countries.

                HK demonstrators banging their heads on a brick wall
            </a>
            <p>
                Not content at building a "wall" dividing Hong Kong into a normal metropolis and an anarchic city, rabble-rouser Joshua Wong compared Hong Kong to Berlin during the Cold War. However, his remark may impress his Western backers, particularly the United States which has openly supported the rioters in Hong Kong, not those who see through the demonstrators' ploys. To add drama to his visit to Berlin on Monday, Wong climbed to the top of the Reichstag building, which contains the ruins of the Berlin Wall, to air his views. Despite his divisive views, however, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas chose to meet the troublemaker, sending all the wrong messages just days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel, accompanied by a large business delegation, concluded a productive visit to China.

                Andreescu 'not done yet' after Grand Slam breakthrough
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW YORK - Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu, who dominated legendary Serena Williams in the US Open final last Saturday to win her first Grand Slam title, says she's not done yet.Since claiming the title in her US Open main-draw debut, Andreescu has had a photo shoot with the trophy atop Rockefeller Center and appeared on several US television shows to discuss her historic win."I never thought it would be this hectic, but I'm not complaining," Andreescu, 19, said on Good Morning America."This is truly an amazing accomplishment, but I could definitely get used to this feeling. I'm not done yet."Andreescu produced a bold and brilliant performance to secure a 6-3, 7-5 win to deny former world No 1 Williams a record-tying 24th Grand Slam title.With the win, Andreescu has jumped to a career-high fifth in the world rankings a year after sitting outside the top 200.She also extended a 13-match unbeaten run, during which she won the Canadian Open.The first Canadian - male or female - to win a Grand Slam title, Andreescu will now have to get used to her celebrity status as she is headline news back home."It hasn't really sunk in," she said on Live With Kelly& Ryan. "I didn't really have the time to see what's happening in my life right now. It's been a crazy year for me, and being able to hold this trophy is pretty awesome."Andreescu, who also appeared on Today, The View and The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon to discuss her victory, said she has spent plenty of time reflecting on her journey to the US Open crown."I started playing tennis at the age of seven, and ever since then I've been dreaming of this moment," she told Good Morning America."I don't think I was ever as composed as I am now, or even a year ago. I would get really down on myself and have very negative thoughts going through my mind. I would smash rackets. I'd just yell at myself during matches."But I found that wasn't working to my advantage at all, so I started...seeking some advice from other people."Ever since then, I've been trying to have a very positive outlook on everything. I think that's really been helping me, even in tough situations."Barty back on topMeanwhile, Australia's Ashleigh Barty has reclaimed the No 1 spot in the WTA rankings less than a month after losing it while Andreescu has moved up to a career-high No 5.French Open champion Barty exited the US Open in the last 16 but regained the No 1 spot after last year's champion Naomi Osaka of Japan was also knocked out at the same stage.Osaka, who beat Williams in last year's final, slipped to fourth in the rankings with Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic and Ukraine's Elina Svitolina leapfrogging her to move up to second and third respectively.Wimbledon champion Simona Halep fell two places to sixth while Williams slipped one spot to ninth despite her run to the final.In the ATP rankings, there was no change in the top three with Novak Djokovic leading men's champion Rafa Nadal, who won his 19th Grand Slam on Sunday, and Roger Federer. This year's New York runner-up Daniil Medvedev moved up to a career-high fourth.Medvedev, a 6-foot-6 Russian, has had a stellar record since a third-round exit at Wimbledon, reaching the finals of his past four tournaments and winning the Cincinnati Masters last month.Reuters

                Zhengzhou aces its upgrade
            </a>
            <p>
                New Premier-level tournament impresses players, fans and WTAMission accomplished, but brace yourselves for next year.That was the message from organizers after the ICBC Credit Card Zhengzhou Open successfully completed its transformation into a WTA Premier 700 event.On Sunday, the $1.5 million tournament got a champion worthy of its lofty status-top seed and world No 2 Karolina Pliskova, who defeated Petra Martic 6-3, 6-2 in the rain-delayed final.Next year's winner will lift the trophy in more salubrious surroundings-a new state-of-the-art 5,000-seat stadium. But, for now, organizers were left to reflect on a job well done, given the event's face lift from 125K to Premier-level event was achieved in a relatively short time."We actually had only two months to prepare for the event," said tournament co-director Rong Chang'an. "We had a lot of help from partners to organize the tournament, but on the other hand, it's a tough job to coordinate all the different parties."Determination, great teamwork, experience and support, especially from the local government, were the key factors that made the impossible possible at the Zhengzhou Open. Still, there is a lot work to be done in the future."Fellow director Morgan Menahem also breathed a sigh of satisfaction after the tournament went off without a hitch."It was truly a challenge, because we got the tournament location so late and we started late with everything," said Menahem.
