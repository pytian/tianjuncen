                Xi's special envoy, Kenyan president meet on bilateral ties
            </p>
            <p>
                NAIROBI -- Chinese President Xi Jinping's special envoy Yang Jiechi and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta met here Wednesday to discuss bilateral ties.Yang, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, extended greetings to Kenyatta on behalf of Xi, saying the several meetings between the two leaders in recent years has led the comprehensive strategic partnership into a new era.He said China is committed to continue helping Kenya to achieve Vision 2030 and the Big Four Agenda, under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and by implementing agreements made at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC).He said the pragmatic cooperation between the two countries has achieved remarkable results. The Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway(SGR) has been running well and the Phase 1 of Nairobi-Malaba SGR is near completion.He added that China is willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with the Kenyan side in international and regional affairs and jointly safeguard multilateralism, international fairness and justice and the common interests of developing countries.For his part, Kenyatta asked Yang to convey his cordial greetings to President Xi and thanked China for its selfless help in Kenya's economic and social development.Hailing the rapidly developing cooperation, Kenyatta said Kenya and African countries are willing to work with China to implement the outcome of the Beijing Summit of FOCAC and further deepen pragmatic cooperation in various fields. Sino-African cooperation is mutually beneficial and is welcomed by African countries. Kenya is committed to firmly defend multilateralism, free trade as well as the international trade system.Yang also met with Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma on Wednesday and discussed bilateral ties.

                Growth plans for Kenya get put on track
            </a>
            <p>
                Chinese-supported major railway highlights growing bilateral relationsMany visitors to the imposing Nairobi Terminus, a major station of the Chinese-built Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway in Kenya's capital, marvel at the design of the complex.The imposing structure is steeped in symbolism. It seems to depict two trains coming together, with a bridge linking the carriages. One train is said to represent Kenya, while the other represents China－symbolizing the deep friendship between the two countries and their people.The railway stretches 480 km between Kenya's coastal city of Mombasa and its capital. It was built at a cost of $3.8 billion, with 90 percent of financing provided by China, and cuts travel time from 15 hours on a previous link built over a century ago to 4.5 hours now.Lindsay Kiptiness, deputy director of Asia, Australasia and Pacific Islands at Kenya's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said the railway highlights the growing relationship between China and Kenya.The ties between the two countries now encompass comprehensive strategic cooperation and Kenya is keen to leverage its relationship with China to boost its industrial sector, Kiptiness said.The railway is certainly the crystallization of China-Kenya cooperation, said Li Xuhang, the then-charge d'affaires at the Chinese embassy in Kenya."With the development of the whole industrial chain from railway transportation to the port economy and industrial parks, we have every reason to believe that the SGR will significantly boost Kenya's GDP growth," he said.The number of passengers served by the major transportation link has exceeded 2.5 million, with an average capacity of 99 percent, Li said, while the volume of cargo carried has amounted to 3.7 million tons.Kenyan employees of the rail are given top priority to completely master the skills needed to drive and operate the trains, so that the link can be handed over to Kenya as scheduled, Li said.Cavince Adhere, a researcher on China-Africa ties in Nairobi, said the railway is important in Kenya's regional repositioning as a trading gateway and economic hub, with the infrastructure connectivity key to Africa's Agenda 2063－a vision and commitment to a shared strategic framework for inclusive growth and sustainable development.Similarly, Charles Nzai, a lecturer at Kenyatta University's School of Economics, said the full benefits of the railway will be realized once Kenya achieves its Vision 2030, the country's economic blueprint that aims to transform it into a newly industrializing and middle-income country."When the economy grows by 10 percent as envisioned in Vision 2030, we will see the full benefits of the SGR," he said.Kenyans should now focus on the realization of the Vision 2030 agenda, Nzai said."Currently, containers leave Mombasa with cargo and they go back empty. Once we start exporting goods, ensuring containers have cargo when leaving both Mombasa and Nairobi, then we will realize the benefits of the SGR," he said.The railway is also seen as a beacon of green sustainability, with its reduced emissions helping to protect the environment, said Philip Mainga, acting managing director of the Kenya Railways Corporation national rail group.The railway's builders－China Road and Bridge Corporation and its parent company, the China Communications Construction Company－are committed to green construction.China Road and Bridge Corporation external communications officer Zhao Yang said an environmental management plan was strictly adhered to during its construction and proper green measures were adopted, such as solid waste and sewage disposal, shock absorption and sound insulation.Ecology rehabilitation measures were also carried out after the project was completed, particularly at the section passing through the Nairobi National Park, Zhao said.In partnership with the Kenya Wildlife Service, the China Communications Construction Company screened construction equipment of the rail to prevent the spread of invasive species such as Nicotiana glauca wild tobacco seeds, which can attach to road construction machinery.Acoustic barriers were also set up in the national park to ensure that noise levels did not rise above baselines, while special wildlife crossing designs were put in place to accommodate animal migrations and movements."We have been working with local environmental experts and consultants in environmental impact assessment, environment management planning and mitigation measures," Zhao said.As part of the railway's second building phase, the construction company is tapping volcanic rock of the country's Rift Valley region instead of harvesting supplies from riverbanks. The process is considered to lessen any impact on the environment as well as reduce transportation costs since the sand is produced on site.Training programs covering the environmental aspects of the project and social activities promoting environmental conservation are also offered to railway employees as part of the green measures, Zhao said.The project continues to roll out. Its Nairobi-Naivasha line, or Phase 2A, is now 90 percent complete, with May 31 set as the targeted completion date, according to the builders, and negotiations are ongoing for the financing of subsequent phases.

                Kenyans reap development rewards from new rail link
            </a>
            <p>
                When former cabin crew member Kennedy Mugo told his friends and relatives that he was leaving his familiar Kenya Airways job to join a new train services company in town, many of them questioned his decision.But Mugo was confident of his move. The services of the Chinese-operated Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway were due to start in a few months' time and he saw many opportunities in that rollout. He had worked in the airline industry for five years and was ready for a new challenge. He saw a bright future offered by the major rail link.Mugo now works at the Nairobi Terminus passenger service management office and he is proud that he made the decision. The job is more fulfilling and stable, Mugo said. He has also gained more skills and the opportunities for career development are immense, he said."I'm grateful to the Chinese government for the finance and construction of the railway, and for the China Road and Bridge Corporation for giving me an opportunity to work in the company. I'm happy that I was one of the pioneer employees of the Mandaraka Express," Mugo said, referring to the railway's passenger train service commissioned by Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta on June 1, 2017.Mugo himself is just one of the many Kenyans who have benefited from the railway project, one of the first major infrastructure achievements of the Belt and Road Initiative made in Africa. Besides helping them secure crucial jobs, the initiative has also helped locals acquire important skills.The railway has provided 46,000 job opportunities to local residents and contributed 1.5 percent to Kenya's gross domestic product, according to China Road and Bridge Corporation external communications officer Zhao Yang.The railway, stretching 480 km between Kenya's coastal city of Mombasa and its capital, was built at a cost of $3.8 billion, with 90 percent of financing provided by China. It shortens rail travel from 15 hours on an outdated railway built over a century ago to 4.5 hours.Zhao said 27,000 local employees have received training and 100 college students have attended programs in China under the project. All of them have received training in areas such as locomotive technology, rolling stock engineering, signaling, telecommunications, control and transport management.Mugo himself was trained at the Railway Training Institute in Nairobi, where he acquired skills such as passenger service and train scheduling management techniques, under the guidance of Chinese specialists.Peterson Gitonga, one of the team leaders of the passenger operations at the link's Nairobi Terminus, is also happy that he was offered an opportunity to work for the railway. Gitonga, who was previously employed at the management department in one of Nairobi's leading hotels, said he is particularly grateful for being part of the team that ushered in the era of the major railway in the country."Here, I interact with so many people on daily basis and I appreciate it. I have also learned a lot and acquired new skills," he said.Similar to Mugo's experience, Gitonga went through a three-month training program on train operations and customer service, among other subjects offered by the training institute."At the institute, I was appointed the team leader and when we joined the workplace, I was retained as a team leader. Working with SGR has been very exciting," he said.Concilia Owire, one of the railway's locomotive drivers, said 15 Kenyan drivers can independently drive the locomotive from Nairobi to Mombasa, with four of them being women."We have 24 intermediate drivers, 35 junior drivers and 128 trainees. To fully qualify as a locomotive driver, it takes five years of training," she said."It feels good to drive a locomotive. I'm grateful for the opportunity," she said.The railway is currently in a second phase of development. At the site of the latest construction, young men were busy working as they shared stories in Swahili, a language mostly spoken in East Africa. Many of them expressed gratitude for the opportunity to earn a living.Charles Maina, one of the workers at the construction site, said he was grateful for securing a job in the project."This job has helped me to feed my family. I have also gained skills on railway construction. Most of these people were previously jobless, we thank CRBC for employing us," he said.Kenyan passengers are also some of the major beneficiaries of the railway. Juma Maleve, who hails from the eastern part of Kenya and works in Mombasa, said that the train has become his favorite form of transportation."Prior to the launch of the SGR, I rarely traveled to my rural home in Kitui county because the journey by bus was long and tiresome. But now I travel frequently. The train is comfortable, convenient and secure, compared to motor vehicles," he said.Maleve said the journey that used to take him 8-10 hours by bus now takes him fours hours by train. The cost is also reasonable as its economy class ticket costs 1,000 Kenyan shillings ($10) compared to 1,500 Kenyan shillings for the bus trip."The first class ticket goes for 3,000 Kenyan shillings, which is still quite reasonable," he said.Sofia Hamisi, who runs small businesses in both Nairobi and Mombasa, said it is easier to travel to both cities to monitor her work, thanks to the railway."My businesses are currently doing well, because I give attention to both. Previously, I had to take flights, which were a bit expensive, or take a bus, which involved a long and tiring journey. But with the railway, I can travel even three times a month. I'm grateful to the Chinese government for giving us that," she said.

                Debt, trade, the Belt and Road Initiative and the Forum for China-Africa Cooperation, or FOCAC, were among topics that China's ambassador to Kenya addressed at a luncheon with the Kenya Editors' Guild Press Club in Nairobi."Public opinions differ due to various reasons, but on the Chinese side, we always cherish the China-Kenya partnership. China-Kenya diplomatic relations are more than five decades, and it is like a big tree, with deep roots and thick foliage," said Wu.He said no country has been trapped in a debt crisis due to its cooperation with China and added that loan agreements between China and Kenya are in line with international best practices."China's funding to Kenya, and other developing countries, is aimed at development. China always attaches high importance to debt sustainability and rigorous feasibility studies and evaluation have been undertaken before loans are disbursed," Wu said.He acknowledged concerns in the media about so-called secrecy clauses."None of Kenya's national assets has been mortgaged for the SGR loan (the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Rail), neither would any single Kenyan national asset be seized nor controlled by China, even in a situation of default," said Wu.Despite the significance of infrastructure in accelerating regional connectivity, the ambassador said funding of its extension was not part of the agenda during President Uhuru Kenyatta's recent visit to Beijing, during the BRI International forum. Discussions between China's President Xi Jinping and his Kenyan counterpart centered on construction of an industrial and economic zones, he disclosed.China is Kenya's leading trade partner with total exports to the country in 2018 at $3.7 billion.Economic cooperation between Kenya and China also has strengthened, with China providing technical and financial funding to the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Rail, the largest infrastructure since Kenya's independence.There are more than 400 Chinese companies in Kenya, which have created thousands of jobs, said the ambassador.Macharia Gaitho, a trustee of the Kenya Editors' Guild Press Club, urged leading media to establish presence in China to provide balanced coverage from both countries, he said. "China-Kenya conversation needs to be told by journalists, who deeply understand the different political, economic and cultural landscapes," said Macharia.

                Dimi Kimoni works in Voi as the regional chair of Athletics Kenya, Coast Region, but his family resides in Nairobi. His weekend reunion with his wife, Alice, daughter, Lisa and son, Erick, has become much easier and convenient since the launch of Madaraka express on May 31, 2017.Kimoni was recorded as the train's most frequent passenger, with 222 trips between Nairobi and Voi by Thursday. Kimoni prefers economy class as it is affordable, safe and clean, and has good customer care. His trips are not just about reaching his destination. He enjoys interacting with people, a characteristic that has seen him make at least six friends during each trip.At the two-year celebration ceremony held at the Nairobi Terminus on Friday, Concilia Owire and 10 colleagues were issued qualification certificates, becoming the first group of Kenya's SGR locomotive qualified drivers, meaning they can drive the train independently, without the help of Chinese drivers.Owire joined the Africa Star Railway Operation Company Ltd in 2016 and has studied hard to learn about locomotive principles, layout, electrical appliances and the brake system.She is thrilled that she passed the exam to become an SGR locomotive driver. "I will work together with my team to write a new chapter of the Mombasa-Nairobi SGR!" she said.James Macharia, cabinet secretary for the Ministry of Transport, Infrastructure, Housing and Urban Development and Public Works, hailed the two years of successful operations as having surpassed expectations to perform exceptionally well, with the future looking even brighter."The service has presented new opportunities for Kenyans through job creation and technology transfer while helping in navigating transport challenges which had partly hindered Kenya from fully realizing its domestic potential," Macharia said.According to Macharia, the construction of the Nairobi to Suswa section of the Standard Gauge Railway is at an advanced stage and is 98 percent complete. The launch of Phase 2A passenger service is scheduled to take place in August, and it's expected to further ease transportation of passengers and cargo in the nation. Notably, the SGR line will be heavily relied upon to offer transportation services to and from the upcoming Naivasha Industrial Park.The SGR service also has had a positive impact on the tourism sector, with an increased number of tourists to the coastal region recorded in the last two years. According to the Kenya Tourism Board, bed occupancy has increased to more than 90 percent up from the 50 percent recorded in previous years, a factor largely attributable to the Madaraka Express.Guo Ce, economic and commercial counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Kenya, highly praised the Mombasa-Nairobi SGR as a century infrastructural project and one of the benchmarks of BRI."This flagship project promotes the economic and social development of Kenya and brings along tangible benefits to the two countries, as well as showcasing their deepening friendship."Li Jiuping, general manager of Africa Star Railway Operation Company Ltd, said Mombasa-Nairobi SGR has been listed as "one of the 13 most remarkable rail tours for 2019" and the fifth of "20 Best Things to Do in Kenya".According to the general manager, two pairs of passenger trains operate daily, with average seat occupancy at above 90 percent. Additionally, nine pairs of freight trains operate daily."So far, we've offered service to 3 million passengers, transported a total of more than 382,000 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs), translating to more than 4.4 million tons of cargo and achieved safe operation for 731 days," Li said."We've also successfully completed the transportation tasks for key passengers, including President Uhuru Kenyatta, Yoweri Museveni, the president of Uganda and the delegation of 231 people, including Monica Azuba, the Uganda minister of transport, and World Bank officials."Li noted that Africa Star is gradually achieving the overall localization goal. Dispatch Center, as the core function of transportation, already has four Kenyan employees participating in dispatch command work. The transportation management of 25 stations out of 33 is fully handled by Kenyan employees. He added that the localization of nine passenger service stations, train service and passenger management has reached over 90 percent.Besides, Africa Star has actively fulfilled its responsibilities and given back to society. Since commencement, the total amount of taxes and levies paid amounts to $17,670,000.Both Nairobi and Mombasa Terminus have been identified as training bases. So far, 159 groups of primary and secondary school students, totaling almost 8,000, have visited stations along the corridor. The company has also invited primary school students for a train ride to allow them to enjoy the "new speed of Kenya" as their eye-opener."As the new starting point, we shall actively respond to the call of BRI aiming to deepen exchange and mutual learning among civilizations, as we stick to our vision 'to become the main driver for Kenya's economic and social development,' as well as adhere to our corporate core values," Li concluded.

            <p>
                Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday met with a special envoy sent by President Xi Jinping at the State House in Nairobi where they discussed infrastructure and trade between the two countries.Kenyatta and special representative Yang Jiechi, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, discussed bilateral ties between China and Kenya.The president said Kenya's partnership with China has enabled the country make great strides in development, and is helping Kenya and the region open up for more trade.He added that infrastructure projects jointly undertaken by China and Kenya are driving regional integration, attracting foreign investment and generating more jobs.Kenyatta noted the cordial relationship between the two countries and emphasized the need to stimulate private investment."We need to really now focus on how we can work together to get our private sector to work closer together – how we can attract Chinese investors, manufacturers, industrialists and other business people to Kenya," said the president.Yang Jiechi said that China is committed to continue helping Kenya achieve Vision 2030 and the Big Four Agenda, under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative and by implementing agreements made at the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.He said the pragmatic partnership between the two countries has achieved remarkable results. The Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) has been running well and phase one of the Nairobi-Malaba SGR is near completion."With the railway, we can have industrial parks stimulate comprehensive trading activities. With the railway, access has been improved in addition to enhanced efficiency in trade either in Africa or in China or in other countries," said Yang.On the trade imbalance between the two countries, the visiting Chinese official assured Kenyatta that his country was working on opening up the Chinese market to more Kenyan products.He added that China is willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with the Kenyan side in international and regional affairs and jointly safeguard multilateralism, international fairness and justice and the common interests of developing countries.Yang earlier met the Kenyan foreign affairs cabinet secretary, Monica Juma, at her office.PSCU (Presidential Strategic Comunication Unit) contributed to this story.
