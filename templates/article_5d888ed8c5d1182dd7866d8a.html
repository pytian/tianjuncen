                Train services partially resumed one day after derailment in Hong Kong
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                HONG KONG - Train services connecting Hong Kong's Hung Hom with neighboring Shenzhen on the mainland were partially resumed on Wednesday, a day after a train derailment left eight passengers injured.After overnight repair efforts, the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) Corp., operator of Hong Kong's train networks, reopened platform No. 4 for the MTR East Rail line at Hung Hom, where three carriages of a commuter train derailed Tuesday.Trains from Hung Hom station to Lo Wu station are running at seven-minute intervals, while trains leave Mong Kok East for Lo Wu every three and a half minutes. Passengers going to Lok Ma Chau must change at Tai Po Market station, where trains are running at 12-minute intervals.The wreckage of the derailed carriages had been removed from track Wednesday morning.The accident occurred at around 8:30 a.m. local time Tuesday when a train carrying hundreds of passengers came off track near the Hung Hom station, injuring at least eight people onboard.Five of the injured passengers, including one male and four females, were taken to the hospital for treatment.The cause of the derailment is still under investigation. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government and the MTR Corp. have vowed to carry out a "thorough investigation" and would not rule out any possibility.Over the past month, facilities of Hong Kong's train networks have become a major target of sabotage and vandalism by radical protesters amid prolonged chaos in the city.Train services of different MTR lines were forced to shut down time and again, as rioters threw iron sticks, bricks and stones on the rail, intruded into the tracks, set fires on exits of MTR stations, or smashed ticket machines and other facilities inside MTR stations.

                    China appreciates Kiribati's decision to sever 'diplomatic ties' with Taiwan
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                BEIJING - China highly appreciates the decision of the Kiribati government to recognize the one-China principle and break off so-called "diplomatic relations" with the Taiwan authorities, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang said Friday.The government of Kiribati announced earlier Friday its decision to recognize the one-China principle, sever "ties" with Taiwan and resume diplomatic relations with China, according to media reports."We support this important decision which Kiribati government has made on its own as an independent sovereign state," Geng said at a press briefing.Geng stressed that there is but one China in the world, that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government that represents the whole of China and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. "This is approved by United Nations resolutions and the universal consensus of the international community," Geng said."On the basis of the one-China principle, China has established official diplomatic relations with 178 countries around the world," Geng noted.The decisions of the Solomon Islands and Kiribati to recognize the one-China principle, cut "ties" with Taiwan and to establish or resume diplomatic relations with China in the last few days have again fully demonstrated that the one-China principle meets the shared aspiration of the people and constitutes an irresistible trend of the times, Geng added.Relations between China and Pacific island nations are maintaining rapid growth, he said. "Despite the twists and turns of China-Kiribati ties, people of the two countries hold amicable feelings towards each other all the time."China stands ready to work with Kiribati to open a new chapter of bilateral relations, said the spokesperson.

                    Wang sent tributes over death of patriotic businessman
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The central government's top official in Hong Kong on Friday expressed his deep sorrow over the passing of the patriotic business leader Tsang Hin-chi and extended his condolences to Tsang's family.Tsang, a respected entrepreneur and founder of the menswear manufacturer Goldlion Group, died on Friday in his hometown of Meizhou in Guangdong province. He was 85.Wang Zhimin, director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, in a statement on Friday, expressed condolences over the loss of "an elder of noble character and high prestige".The liaison chief praised Tsang as a dedicated patriot and prominent member of Hong Kong's business community. Tsang had taken the lead in contributing to the modernization of the Chinese mainland since the beginning of the country's reform and opening-up, Wang said.Tsang was awarded the medal of "reform pioneer" in 2018 for his contributions to the country, including generous donations in support of education, science and technology, sports, aerospace and public welfare.Wang recalled that before 1997, Tsang had firmly supported the central government in resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and contributed to the smooth transition and transfer of Hong Kong as it returned to China in 1997. Tsang gave full support to the chief executive and the SAR government in exercising law-based governance and contributed to the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.As a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress — the country's top legislature — from 1994 to 2008, Tsang actively performed his duties to promote democracy, the rule of law and the development of industry and commerce in the mainland, said Wang."Mr Tsang's great character will continue to shine a light for our future generations. He will always be remembered," he noted.
