                BEIJING - A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson has criticized the Dalai Lama's scheduled appearances at Britain's Glastonbury music festival and Aldershot army base as "conducting anti-China secessionist activities in the name of religion". The Dalai Lama is due to travel to Britain from Saturday to Tuesday. "We oppose any organization using any means to offer occasion for the Dalai Lama to conduct anti-China secessionist moves," spokesperson Lu Kang said Friday at a daily press briefing. "As a political exile, the Dalai Lama could use his addresses as chances to conduct anti-China secessionist activities in the name of religion," Lu claimed.

                British PM Cameron calls June 23 referendum on EU after clinching deal
            </a>
            <p>
                Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron speaks outside Downing Street in London, Britain February 20, 2016. Cameron met senior ministers on Saturday to endorse an EU deal he hopes will persuade voters to ratify Britain's membership of the world's largest trading bloc at a referendum likely to be held in June. Cameron hailed a deal clinched with other European Union leaders at a summit in Brussels as granting Britain special status, and said he would campaign hard to convince voters to stay in the bloc that Britain joined in 1973. [Photo/Agencies]LONDON - Prime Minister David Cameron called a June 23 referendum on membership of the European Union on Saturday as he sought to rally his divided Conservative Party behind a deal which he said would guarantee Britain's prosperity and security in the bloc. After spelling out detail of the deal - clinched at an EU summit in Brussels - to his senior ministers, Cameron said he had secured the cabinet's blessing to recommend to voters that Britain stay in the bloc it joined in 1973. "I believe that Britain will be safer, stronger and better off by remaining in a reformed European Union," Cameron said outside his Number 10 Downing Street residence in London. "Leaving Europe would threaten our economic and our national security," Cameron said, adding that he would propose to Parliament that the referendum be held on Thursday June 23, in the middle of the Glastonbury music festival and the Euro 2016 soccer championship. One of Cameron's closest political allies, Justice Secretary Michael Gove, and five other cabinet members will campaign to leave. They signed a poster for the Vote Leave out campaign saying "Let's take back control." While the rebellion illustrated the depth of the division over Europe within his ruling Conservative Party, Cameron's most senior ministers including interior minister Theresa May and finance minister George Osborne backed EU membership. London Mayor Boris Johnson, who has charmed some voters with a buffoonish persona that masks fierce ambition to succeed Cameron, has yet to make his position clear. A source told Reuters that Johnson might show his hand on Sunday. The agreement Cameron reached in Brussels granted Britain an explicit exemption from the founding goal of "ever closer union", offered concessions on the welfare rights of migrant workers and safeguards for the City of London. Though British voters are split over membership, betting odds have moved further in favor of Britain remaining in the EU after Cameron's deal, according to bookmaker Ladbrokes. A British exit from the EU would rock the Union - already shaken by differences over migration and the future of the euro zone - by ripping away its second-largest economy, one of its top two military powers and by far its richest financial center. Pro-Europeans warn an exit could also trigger the break-up of the United Kingdom by prompting another Scottish independence vote. The $2.9 trillion British economy would face years of uncertain negotiations over the terms of a divorce. Opponents of EU membership say Britain would prosper outside what they say is a doomed Germany-dominated bloc that punches way below its weight on the world stage. "This is a truly pathetic deal," Nigel Farage, the head of the UK Independence Party said. "Let's leave the EU, control our borders, run our own country and stop handing 55 million pounds every day to Brussels." CONSERVATIVES DIVIDED The issue of Europe has divided the Conservatives for three decades and played a major part in the downfall of Cameron's two Conservative predecessors, Margaret Thatcher and John Major. Opinion polls show that a significant number of Britons have yet to make up their mind, though perceptions that the EU has failed to deal with the migrant crisis may be turning some towards a 'Brexit'. Bookmaker Ladbrokes said however that betting odds indicated there was now a 69 percent chance of Britain remaining in the EU with a 31 percent chance of Britain leaving. Cameron is due to make a statement to parliament on Monday, triggering the start of the campaign for the referendum. The cabinet meeting, the first to be held on a Saturday since the 1982 Falklands War, will formalise government support for staying in the EU and Cameron has said ministers will then be free to campaign on whichever side they want. Cameron acknowledged that Gove would campaign to leave, saying he was disappointed but not surprised. He suggested other Conservatives may also join the "out" camp. Gove joined Christopher Grayling, leader of the House of Commons, Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative Party leader, employment minister Priti Patel, culture minister John Whittingdale and Northern Ireland minister Theresa Villiers in support the leaving camp. Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, an influential figure in Britain through his ownership of a clutch of U.K. newspapers, congratulated Gove. "Congratulations Michael Gove," Murdoch said on Twitter. "Friends always knew his principles would overcome his personal friendships." The message from the 84-year-old executive chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox Inc raises the prospect of some of the media tycoon's British newspapers possibly campaigning for an EU exit.

This year's Glastonbury produced an estimated 500,000 sacks of rubbish, including 57 tones of reusable items and 1,022 tones of recyclable waste. Started in 1970, the world-famous five-day music event attracted more than 135,000 people this year. [Photo/VCG]

                Chinese acts shine at Glastonbury Festival
            </a>
            <p>
                Buzzing and breathless, Rayray needed a minute to take it all in when she came down from the stage at Glastonbury Festival this past weekend.The DJ from Taiwan has been a mainstay of Asia's electronic dance music scene for more than a decade – her work week is a blurred montage of international flights, hard-partying crowds and marathon sets at nightclubs from Taipei to Tokyo – so she's no stranger to the lifestyle.But this set was different – this was Glastonbury, the largest festival in the United Kingdom and one of the most iconic music events on the planet."This was a dream come true," she shouted unnecessarily, her eardrums still adjusting. "Two years ago, I was playing here at the Blue Stage, and it was so much fun. But this year they moved me to the Sonic Stage, which is way bigger. It was my honor to represent Asia."The 28-year-old made her third-ever appearance at Glastonbury Festival over the weekend. For her, the continued invitations from the organizers represent something bigger than a vote of confidence in her individual ability. She is hopeful that now she has opened the door, more Chinese DJs will walk through it."In my production, I always have Chinese instruments, Chinese culture and a Chinese vibe. I want to bring that here and I hope people can appreciate it," she said. "I want to bring my music, the music from Asia, to the crowd in Europe, and make people understand what the difference is, and the different way we party."This year's event was hailed as the "best one yet" by organizer Emily Eavis, whose father Michael put on the first festival at Worthy Farm in Glastonbury in 1970. That year 1,500 fans came to see headlining act T.Rex – these days more than 200,000 people set up camp on the farm's green hillsides.Under clear sunny skies, Glastonbury 2019 produced a number of special moments. London grime-artist Stormzy became the first black British solo act to headline the festival, and staged a performance so epic organizers described it as a "one-man Olympic ceremony".Kylie Minogue finally got her chance to perform on the hallowed Pyramid Stage, after a cancer diagnosis forced her to cancel her set in 2005. It is estimated that the Australian pop legend drew the largest crowd in the festival's 48-year history.And teenage fan Alex Mann was catapulted into nationwide fame when British rapper Dave invited him on stage to perform a track, which the 15-year-old executed so flawlessly the crowd chanted his name for half a minute. Mann has since appeared on several major national radio and television shows and accrued almost 290,000 followers on social media.British rock royalty The Cure and United States band The Killers both headlined, and beyond musical acts the festival hosted hundreds of other performances, including dance, poetry, comedy, theatre, and circus.At the circus central stage, festival-goers were treated to a colorful spectacle of ancient Chinese culture when the Liverpool Chinese Martial Arts association performed a lion dance. The group has been coming to Glastonbury for the last 21 years, ever since they were first invited by festival co-founder Arabella Churchill."We are based in Liverpool which has got the oldest Chinatown in Europe, so we have a rich history of the two cultures mixing together," said James Roach, who heads the group of UK and British-Chinese performers."We try and represent Chinese culture as authentically as we can in the conditions that we've got. Glastonbury tries to represent all cultures, so we are kind of the Chinese slice that tries to keep that bit alive. It's important for us on two levels – one, it's the most important festival in the world, and two it's the best festival in the world. So, if you are going to do it, you have to do it properly."Comedian Phil Wang delivered a standup routine at the Cabaret Tent that was both disarmingly charming and brilliantly cutting. The son of a Chinese-Malaysian father and British mother, 29-year-old Wang opened by dissecting his full name (the product of a "cultural compromise"), setting the tone for a witty assault on white and Asian stereotypes."I find that the conversations about race lack nuance a lot of the time," said the comic, who hosts a comedy series on BBC Radio 4 called Wangsplaining."Either people are careless about it and hurt people's feelings, or they are overly cautious and patronizing," he added. "So I think the only way to get into that sensible middle ground between the two is to talk about it openly, about my experiences, about my thoughts and also to give people a break – people who always think they are on the edge of being culturally or racially insensitive – to kind of get on their side a little and show them they don't have to worry so much. So that's the line I am trying to tread."Glastonbury organizers themselves touched a nerve in 2017, when they were criticized for going with three white male headlining acts. But Stormzy's thrilling showing this year has been described as a big win for diversity at the festival, and with Rayray, Wang and members of Liverpool's Chinese community all performing strongly, China's profile at the festival now has a firm foundation on which to build.
