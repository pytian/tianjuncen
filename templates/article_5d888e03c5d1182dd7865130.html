                Renzi strains Italy coalition in bid for new party
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                ROME - Former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi announced on Tuesday that he was leaving the center-left Democratic Party, or PD, to form his own party, potentially destabilizing the days-old ruling coalition."I have decided to leave the PD and to build together with others a new house to do politics differently," Renzi wrote on Facebook, barely a week after the PD's coalition with the Five Star Movement won a confidence motion in parliament.Renzi is not himself part of the new government, formed through the unlikely alliance between PD and Five Star in order to thwart far-right leader and now ex-interior minister Matteo Salvini's bid to call snap elections he thought would make him premier.But Renzi, who was hailed as a reformer when he became Italy's youngest premier at the age of 39 in 2014, was a divisive figure within the PD, particularly for the party's left which is largely loyal to party leader Nicolas Zingaretti."After seven years of friendly fire I think we must take note that our values, our ideas, our dreams, cannot every day be the object of internal quarrels," Renzi wrote.He resigned as premier in 2016 and fraught relations within the PD prompted repeated speculation that Renzi would split to form his own, more politically centrist, party."The victory we got in parliament against populism and Salvini was important to save Italy, but it's not enough," Renzi wrote.Renzi said that around 30 lawmakers would announce loyalty to him but he said he would continue to support Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's government.He called Conte on Monday to reassure him that "I'm leaving the PD but (my) support for the government remains certain," the Corriere della Sera newspaper reported.Between 18 and 20 MPs will follow Renzi, out of the PD's 111 total. Twenty MPs are needed to form an autonomous parliamentary group. Around 10 senators out of the PD's 51 would also follow, the Corriere reported."Today the PD is a set of currents," Renzi told Tuesday's La Repubblica newspaper."And I fear that it will not be able on its own to respond to Salvini's attacks and to the difficult cohabitation with the M5S," he said, referring to Five Star."I believe that there is space for something new. Not from the center or the left, but from what has occupied the least-used space in Italian politics: the space of the future," he told the left-leaning daily."I won't tell you the name but it won't be a traditional party," Renzi said.PD leader Zingaretti lamented what he called "an error"."We are sorry. ... But now let's think about Italians' future, work, environment, business, education, investments. A new agenda and the need to rebuild hope with good governance and a new PD," Zingaretti tweeted.Agence France-Presse

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Italy looks set for an extended period of political instability after Sunday's general election resulted in a hung parliament, with anti-establishment and far-right groups claiming major victories at the expense of traditional parties. With around three-quarters of votes counted, it looks highly likely that none of the three main political groupings will be able to govern on their own. The largest bloc of votes belongs to an alliance of parties from the right, including former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, but it looks almost certain that the far-right League, which campaigned on a strongly anti-immigrant platform, will poll more votes than Forza Italia. It is thought the center-right coalition will poll around 37 percent, with the ruling center-left coalition led by Matteo Renzi's Democratic Party a distant third on 22 percent. The most successful individual party is likely to be the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, on 31 percent. The 5-Star party, formed by comedian and activist Beppe Grillo, is less than a decade old. Its popularity, largely fueled by public anger at economic hardship and corruption, has led officials to say the formation of a coalition government without it would be impossible. "We will ... (talk) with all the parties about what this country needs," said senior 5-Star member Riccardo Fraccaro. The economic chief of the euroskeptic League - like 5-Star, a newcomer to the political arena - has indicated there may be potential for an alliance of some kind. The two parties once shared a similarly strong anti-euro position, with the League still in favor of leaving the single currency, but 5-Star says the moment for taking such a major step has passed. Some political commentators, however, have questioned whether other parties could work with 5-Star. Its main electoral policy, which proved a huge vote-winner in the impoverished south, was a minimum monthly income of up to 780 euros ($960) for the poor. Voting in the richer north was largely split between the League (18 percent) and Forza Italia (14 percent), with the center-left having enjoyed most of its success in central regions. Parliament meets for the first time since the election on March 23, and President Sergio Mattarella is not expected to open formal talks on forming a new government until April. The euro dipped in reaction, with former chief economist of the Italian treasury Lorenzo Codogno commenting: "Italy is far from having sorted its long-standing problems, and now it will have new ones. Be prepared for long and complex negotiations." julian@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily 03/06/2018 page11)

                    Italy's defeated center-left Democrats ponder new life in the opposition

                ROME - Licking its wounds after a crushing electoral defeat in a March 4 general election that saw the advance of populists and rightwingers, Italy's center-left Democratic Party on Monday sought to redefine itself as an opposition force after five years in government.Former prime minister and resigning Democratic Party leader Matteo Renzi deserted an executive meeting at the party's Rome headquarters, where participants approved the new line laid out by deputy party chief and outgoing farms minister, Maurizio Martina."We have just one thing to say to the winners: now you no longer have an alibi... citizens voted for you to govern, now do it," Martina tweeted during the meeting, where the party's executive approved his motion for the Democrats to become an opposition party.This means it will be up to the two relative election winners -- the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and the rightwing League -- to cobble together a government coalition."Our defeat was clear-cut," Martina told Democratic leaders in a speech posted online. "We intend to deeply respect the vote of all Italians" by refusing to become a junior member of a rightwing or populist-led government.He was echoed by League leader Matteo Salvini, who told reporters in televised comments that "Italians didn't vote for us to bring Renzi back into the government" and that he wants to make sure that "workers can retire earlier, small businesses can pay fewer taxes, and illegal immigrants get thrown out".Meanwhile Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio continued to repeat, as he has since the election a week ago, that the Movement is "open to talks with all political forces" and that if in government, they will "cut waste and fight poverty".The populist Five Stars pledged to introduce universal income, and prevailed mostly in Italy's impoverished southern regions, where youth unemployment is over 30 percent.The League succeeded mostly in the wealthier north, where the economy is made up of heavily taxed small and medium businesses.Italy's head of state, President Sergio Mattarella, is set to broker talks between possible government partners at the beginning of April. This process could take weeks, meaning that Italy likely won't see a new government until the end of next month, if not beyond.

                    Standoff in Italy over choice of new economy minister
                </p>

                ROME - The political standoff in Italy continued on Saturday over President Sergio Mattarella's refusal to approve the euroskeptic coalition's choice for economy minister. Three days after being appointed by Mattarella as prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, 53, has still not been able to form a government. Writing on Facebook late on Friday, League chief Matteo Salvini, who insists on naming the noted euroskeptic Paolo Savona, 81, as economy minister, was blunt. "I am really very angry," he raged. Salvini doubled down on Saturday, tweeting images of cartoons in German media lampooning Italy, writing: "The newspapers and German politicians insult us: Italian beggars, idlers, tax evaders, freeloaders and ungrateful. "And we should choose an economy minister that suits them? No thanks!" Salvini reiterated his position later on Saturday after a meeting with party leaders, saying "the League has already taken enough backward steps". He added that he would give Conte the list of ministers the League wants on Saturday night. Salvini had nominated Conte for the premiership with the support of Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio, but officially it is the head of state and the premier alone who appoint ministers. And according to the Italian media, Mattarella will not bend for two reasons: to avoid isolating Italy in Europe and to protect the role of the president. Conte met the president late on Friday to report "informally" on the discussions, but without presenting his final list of ministers. Far from convinced of Conte's authority over the political heavyweights who will compose his team, Mattarella - elected by a parliament which at the time was dominated by the center-left - wants Italy to respect its European commitments. As guarantor of internationaltreaties, Mattarella has been more discrete since the standoff began on Thursday. But he was clear in denouncing the "unacceptability of diktats toward the prime minister and president" by political parties. The Democratic Party of former premier Matteo Renzi, however, did not pull its punches. "You are playing around at the expense of the country just to defend your miserable interests," party leader Maurizio Martina said in remarks addressed to Salvini on Saturday. There was no meeting scheduled for Saturday between Conte and the leaders of the League and Five Star, nor was there any indication that a solution could be found over the weekend. Conte did however receive the support of French President Emmanuel Macron during a phone call on Saturday. Macron gave the new Italian premier his best wishes for forming a government and said he would like to meet soon, Conte said on Facebook. The impasse has already started to make financial markets nervous, with the Milan Stock Exchange closing down 1.54 percent on Friday. Agence France-presse (China Daily 05/28/2018 page11)

                    Migration of early man clarified?

                It's been said that the scraps of fossil evidence for human evolution are so scant they would barely cover a pool table. The step-by-step footprints of how humans became humans may be buried for all time.But the "story" that connects the dots of all the fragments and shards seems to change every time a new piece of the puzzle is discovered and tries to fit in.The same is true of the trail the genus or evolutionary group Homo (of which we, as Homo sapiens, are part) followed when it left Africa and dispersed across Eurasia and beyond. Evidence of a humanlike creature discovered in the Georgian town of Dmanisi has been the crown jewel of that out-of-Africa story for years, pegging the estimated time of departure at 1.8 million years ago.The next oldest — two incisor teeth believed to be from a Homo erectus in Yuanmou in South China — are 1.7 million years old.Hominin (humans and close ancestors) fossil evidence from Gongwangling and the Sangiran dome in Java and artifacts from Majuangou and Shangshazui suggest that by 1.6 million years ago Asia probably had a robust and restless population of early humans.Now a newly announced collection of stone tools unearthed in the Loess Plateau, north of China's Qinling mountains, throws a monkey wrench in the story once again.The headline read: "Discovery in China hints that humanlike species left Africa 250,000 years earlier than suspected."The excavation site featured 17 layers of earth dating from 1.26 million to 2.12 million years ago, a veritable filing cabinet of prehistory.The 96 artifacts recovered — mostly chipped rocks and hammer stones — imply that "hominins left Africa earlier than indicated by the evidence from Dmanisi (Georgia)", the authors write in the journal Nature."We were very excited," expedition leader Zhaoyu Zhu, a professor at the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, told Time magazine. "One of my colleagues noticed a stone embedded in a steep outcrop. After a short while, more artifacts were found — one after another."Archaeologist and stone tool expert Sonia Harmand of Stony Brook University in New York said, "This could be, frankly, one of the most important sites in the world."This story is getting confusing. Almost 20 years ago, the fossil site at the Renzidong (Renzi Cave) in Anhui province yielded stone tools and animal bones dated 2.25 million years ago, suggesting that Homo erectus was roving out of Africa and across Asia 400,000 years earlier than earlier than previously thought.Some Chinese scientists at the time even theorized there might have been an evolution of H. erectus parallel to the one in Africa.After two years of digging at the Renzidong site, a steep fissure that, it's believed, animals were chased into then slaughtered, scientists had discovered remains of 60 species of animals, including the elephantlike Sinoamastadon, an ancient tapir and the monkey Procynocephalus, showing that "Renzidon was open briefly between 2.5 and 2 million years ago," University of Iowa professors Russell Ciochon and Roy Larick wrote in Archaeology at the time."Early hominins were ferociously migratory, and this led to the worldwide diaspora of our species, H. sapiens," they wrote, "Early humans repeatedly passed between Africa and Asia, and their movements correspond to those of other large mammals."If that doesn't muddy the waters enough, an anthropologist at William Paterson University cast a show of doubt on the new find. "I am skeptical," Geoffrey Pope told Time. "I suspect this discovery will change very little."Sometimes nature can shape stones in a way that makes them look handmade.Contact the writer at chrisdavis@chinadailyusa.com.

                The story of prehistoric man is a matrix of theories connecting a sparse body of evidence, usually scraps of fossils or artifacts.Each new piece of evidence should help fill in the story, not make it more complicated, right?That's why the new headline - "Discovery in China Hints that Human-like Species left Africa 250,000 Years Earlier than Suspected" - had me scratching my head.

                    BRI can help serve economic interests of Italy and its allies
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                President Xi Jinping's visit to Italy from March 21 to 24 elevated Sino-Italian relations to a new level.Since the beginning of diplomatic relations in the 1970s China and Italy have always framed their relations as an attempt to reinforce their independence in the international community and mutually strengthen their economies. The recent signing of the memorandum of understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative during President Xi's visit to Italy is in line with that trend.Most recently, Italy's traditional allies have turned more critical of China: the United States has labelled China as a threat while the European Commission used the term "systemic rival" to describe China. Italy's traditional allies are therefore interpreting Rome's proactive policy toward Beijing, especially the signing of the MoU on the BRI, as harmful to Western countries' interests.The signing of the MoU, however, conceptually follows Italy's continuous support to the Chinese initiative as seen in former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi's visit to China in 2014, Italy's participation in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, former prime minister Paolo Gentiloni's attendance at the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in 2017－the only head of state or government of a G7 country to do so－and Italian President Sergio Mattarella's visit to Beijing the same year.Contrary to what some Western countries claim, Italy is not biased toward China. Italian diplomats have joined their European colleagues in the past to criticize some of the Belt and Road elements that don't match European and Italian interests and values.Influenced by the deteriorating stability in the Mediterranean region, Italy's approach to the Belt and Road Initiative goes beyond its traditional and open attitude toward China. The combined effect of the global financial crisis and "Arab Spring" on Southern European countries has turned the Mediterranean region into an "arc of tension" marked by political instability, economic dislocation and sometimes extremist violence.These developments－illegal immigration, market disruptions and security threats－pose a direct risk to the trade and security interests of Italy and China both.It is therefore natural for Italy to take measures to mitigate the dangers created by instability across the South-North axis of the region, by pro-actively working with China to transform the maritime corridor of the BRI connecting Europe to Asia into one of peaceful development.In this context, Italy can prove to be a key partner for Beijing and a powerful agent for the promotion of stability and development in the Mediterranean region thanks to its traditional economic and political role in the Mediterranean.Five years after its birth, due to the new international situation, the BRI might now enter a new stage, a stage that will leave more room for more balanced, mutually beneficial and more transparent Sino-European cooperation.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently said: "China broadly presents a real opportunity, they are an economic powerhouse and there are lots of opportunities for countries to do business with China. When China behaves transparently, when China is engaged in real economic transactions, we are untroubled."The text of the Sino-Italian MoU on the Belt and Road Initiative, which seems in line with the "transparency" required by the EU and the US, could therefore be interpreted as a step forward, a progress that indicates the beginning of a new phase for the BRI. If Italy takes this process forward, it might build a new convergence point for its and its allies' national interests.The author is an associate professor at History Department, Peking University.The views don't necessarily represent those of China Daily.

                    Migrant standoff dominates Italian political crisis
                </p>
            </a>

                PM to face no confidence vote, while critics accuse Salvini of exploiting issue to trigger electionA migrant standoff has taken center stage in Italy's unfolding political crisis as Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte prepares to face a no-confidence vote in Parliament on Tuesday.Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini on Saturday agreed to let 27 unaccompanied teenagers leave a migrant rescue ship amid a political row between his far-right League party and its coalition partner, Five Star.The minors were allowed to disembark on the Italian island of Lampedusa after more than 16 days at sea, but more than 100 migrants remain on board the Spanish rescue ship Open Arms.The charity Open Arms said the remaining adults and two accompanied children on the boat were living in "untenable" conditions.Ministers on Friday refused to sign off Salvini's orders banning the Open Arms ship from docking in Lampedusa, and Conte has called Salvini "obsessed" with keeping migrants out of Italian ports.If Conte loses the confidence vote, the government would have to be dissolved by the president, Sergio Mattarella, and elections held within 45 to 70 days. Mattarella could also choose to install a technical government.On Aug 8, in an attempt to capitalize on his surging popularity, Salvini announced his alliance with Five Star was no longer workable and called for elections that could crown him as prime minister.The League put forward a motion of no-confidence in the government, but Five Star and the opposition Democratic Party refused to debate it and their politicians discussed forming a coalition among themselves to sideline Salvini.A potential alliance between factions from the center-left Democratic Party and Five Star could attempt to carve out a caretaker government in order to pass the 2020 budget, with a view of delaying elections until early next year.The move is being led by former prime minister Matteo Renzi of the Democratic Party but has been rejected by its leader, Nicola Zingaretti, and Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio. Renzi is pointing to the dire situation of the Italian economy and wants to see budget cuts before year's end to avoid a recession.Italy's anti-establishment Five Star said on Sunday that Salvini was no longer a credible partner, apparently closing the door on any possibility of resurrecting the ruling coalition established after elections last year.The Five Star Movement has been hurt by its tie-up with the League, halving its voter support since the two parties joined forces in June last year, according to opinion polls. The League has overtaken it to become Italy's most popular party.The ruling coalition has been on shaky ground for months, with the League and Five Star openly in dispute about everything from the political crisis in Venezuela, to infrastructure projects, to financial reforms.Prime Minister Conte is set to address Parliament on Tuesday before he faces the confidence vote.
