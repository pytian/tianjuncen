                SAN DIEGO - The San Diego Zoo in the US state of California held a special ceremony on Saturday to kick off a three-week farewell event for two giant pandas.Twenty-seven-year-old female giant panda Bai Yun and her son, six-year-old Xiao Liwu, will leave the zoo in late April and be sent back to China, as the zoo's conservation loan agreement with China has ended.According to the zoo, their staff are working with their colleagues in China on future panda conservation and research.The zoo's giant panda program is the first joint research program established between China and the United States as early as in 1994, said China's Consul General in Los Angeles Zhang Ping."Like other joint giant panda research and conservation programs in the United States, this program has not only promoted the friendship and understanding between the Chinese and American people, but also pushed forward the bilateral collaboration and joint research on protection and conservation of endangered species of wildlife and biodiversity," he said.Erica Kohler, director of operations of the San Diego Zoo, told Xinhua it is sad to see the two pandas leaving for China. However, it is also a time to celebrate the successful collaboration with China on the joint research of panda breeding and wild life protection.Dubbing the pandas "the friendship ambassadors" from China, she said Bai Yun and Xiao Liwu attracted about 2 million visitors to the zoo each year.As the first panda on loan, Bai Yun, arrived at the San Diego Zoo in 1996. The cuddly panda soon became an iconic image of the zoo and one of the most popular animals. The name of her son, Xiao Liwu, means Little Gift in English.Gaylene Thomas, animal care supervisor of the San Diego Zoo, told Xinhua that they learned a lot from the giant pandas and gathered data from them.Thomas said as a great mother of six baby pandas, Bai Yun has a very good character, is very easy-going."We are very proud to have the opportunity to be with them for the past 20-odd years," she said.Currently, the zoo is busy preparing for the pandas' travel back to China and trying its best to make them feel comfortable during the trip, Thomas added.Many zoo visitors lined up to say goodbye to the pandas, and wrote down their best wishes on cards and posted them on a friendship wall set up in front of the panda exhibition halls.The farewell celebration will run through April 27.The San Diego Zoo is globally recognized and a San Diego icon by hosting more than 4 million guests each year.

                    Panda protection creates billions of dollars
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The giant panda is both the most iconic animal native to China and a powerful symbol for the conservation of wildlife around the world – but the protection of the species continues to generate controversy.Some zoologists and journalists argue that the millions spent each year to conserve the vulnerable bear is a waste, partly because the creature’s highly selective feeding and breeding habits make it so challenging to protect.British naturalist Chris Packham infamously once said the panda had “gone down an evolutionary cul-de-sac” and that conservationists should “pull the plug and let them go”.But new research by a team of scientists from China, Britain, the United States, and Australia posits that panda protection efforts produce a significant return on investment.The study, which was published in the journal Current Biology, estimates that the value generated by panda reserves in China adds up to between $2.6 billion and $6.9 billion a year, or roughly 10 to 27 times the cost of maintaining the reserves.“Many detractors have argued that spending valuable resources on panda conservation is wasteful,” said lead author of the study Wei Fuwen of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. “Our analysis contradicts this view and demonstrates clearly the great value of the panda, both for its cultural and intrinsic value, and for the ecosystem services provided by panda reserves.”The study was conducted by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in China, the Australian National University and James Cook University in Australia, the University of Pittsburgh and San Diego Zoo in the US, and Cardiff University in the United Kingdom.The researchers looked at a range of variables before coming up with their estimates, including carbon storage and the production of resources.Giant panda reserves offer a variety of ecosystem services that are valued by local people, according to Wei. The reserves are used to grow crops, graze animals, procure water supplies, and harvest firewood.The reserves play a role in the management of water runoff, retention of sediments and nutrients, and in carbon sequestration. The research also factored in the cultural value of the panda.“Now, we know that the system of reserves and protections are working to reverse the panda’s decline and that these efforts have benefits for society and nature at large,” Wei said.Charlotte MacDonald, director of conservation and living collections at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, did not take part in the study but noted that the panda is an “umbrella species” and panda reserves provide protection for other animal and plant life.“Giant pandas are in many ways also a flagship for conservation,” MacDonald said. “Safeguarding their habitats also helps to protect many other animals they live alongside.”China has stepped up efforts in panda conservation since a survey 28 years ago showed a steep fall in the panda population and a dramatic loss of habitat.A national panda survey in 1990 showed the panda population had more than halved during a 10-year period, dropping to 1,112 individuals. Panda habitat had also sharply decreased, by two-thirds to 12,340 square kilometers.Since then, the government has protected 33,118 square kilometers of panda reserve and panda numbers have rebounded, to 1,864 individuals.In 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature downgraded the panda from “endangered” to “vulnerable”on the global list of species at risk of extinction.

                Un gardien déguisé en panda proposant de la nourriture à l’un des vrais pandas du zoo de Yunnan à Kunming, dans la province du Yunnan, le 2 juillet. [Liu Ranyang/China News Service]Le panda géant est à la fois l’animal originaire de Chine le plus emblématique et un puissant symbole du combat pour la conservation de la nature sur toute la planète, mais la protection de l’espèce continue de susciter la polémique.Certains zoologues et certains journalistes arguent que les millions dépensés chaque année pour préserver cet ours vulnérable est un gaspillage, en partie parce que les habitudes alimentaires et reproductives de la créature sont hautement sélectives et la rendent difficile à protéger.Un naturaliste britannique, Chris Packham, a prononcé un jour la formule tristement célèbre selon laquelle les pandas étaient « engagés dans un cul de sac évolutionnaire » et que les défenseurs de l’environnement feraient mieux de « débrancher la prise et les laisser partir ».Mais selon une nouvelle recherche par une équipe de scientifiques chinois, britanniques, américains et australiens, les efforts déployés pour la protection des pandas produisent un retour sensible sur l’investissement.L’étude, publiée dans la revue Current Biology, estime que la valeur générée par les réserves naturelles pour les pandas en Chine se situe entre 2,6 milliards de dollars (2,2 milliards d’euros) et 6,9 milliards de dollars par an, soit entre 10 et 27 fois le coût de l’entretien des réserves.« De nombreux détracteurs prétendent que la dépense de précieuses ressources pour la préservation des pandas est un gaspillage », note l’auteur principal de l’étude, Wei Fuwen, de l’académie chinoise des sciences. « Notre analyse contredit ce point de vue et démontre clairement la grande valeur du panda, à la fois par rapport à sa valeur culturelle et intrinsèque, et par rapport aux services écosystémiques fournis par les réserves de pandas ».L’étude a été effectuée par des chercheurs des établissements suivants : académie chinoise des sciences ; Australian National University à Canberra et James Cook University dans le Queensland ; Pittsburgh University et zoo de San Diego ; et Cardiff University au Pays de Galles.Les chercheurs ont observé une série de variables avant de parvenir à leurs estimations, notamment le stockage du carbone et la production des ressources.Les réserves destinées aux pandas géants offrent une variété de services écosystémiques appréciés de la population locale, indique M. Wei. Elles servent à cultiver des récoltes, faire paître du bétail, procurer de l’approvisionnement en eau et récolter du bois de chauffage. Elles jouent un rôle dans la gestion du ruissellement des eaux, dans la rétention des sédiments et des éléments nutritifs ainsi que dans la séquestration du carbone. La recherche a également pris en compte la valeur culturelle du panda.« Nous savons désormais que le système de réserves et de protections parvient à inverser le déclin du panda et que son action profite à la société et à la nature en général », commente M. Wei.Charlotte MacDonald, directrice de la conservation et des collections vivantes à la Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, n’a pas pris part à l’étude mais note que le panda est « une espèce parapluie » et que les réserves de pandas fournissent une protection à d’autres animaux et à la flore. « Les pandas géants sont de bien des façons un navire amiral pour la préservation », estime Mme MacDonald. « La sauvegarde de leur habitat contribue aussi à protéger de nombreux animaux au côté desquels ils vivent ».La Chine a intensifié ses efforts en faveur de la préservation du panda depuis qu’une étude a révélé il y a 28 ans une forte baisse du nombre d’animaux et une énorme perte de leur habitat. Selon l’enquête nationale menée en 1990, le nombre de pandas avait diminué de moitié en 10 ans, pour tomber à 1 112 animaux, et leur habitat avait baissé des deux tiers pour descendre à 12 340 kilomètres carrés.Depuis lors, le gouvernement a protégé 33 118 kilomètres carrés de réserves destinées aux pandas, et le nombre d’animaux a rebondi pour passer à 1 864.

                LOS ANGELES - The San Diego Zoo will return its last two giant pandas to China next month, said zoo officials Monday."In honoring the terms of the Zoo's conservation loan agreement with the People's Republic of China, 27-year-old female giant panda Bai Yun and her son, 6-year-old Xiao Liwu, will leave the San Diego Zoo in April and will be repatriated to their ancestral homeland," said zoo officials in a statement.As the first panda on loan, Bai Yun, or White Cloud in English, first arrived at the San Diego Zoo in 1996 from China. The cuddly panda soon became an iconic image of the zoo and one of the most popular animals. The name of her son, Xiao Liwu, means Little Gift in English."The San Diego Zoo was honored to be chosen by conservationists in China to work with them to develop a new model for species conservation," said Douglas G. Myers, president and CEO of San Diego Zoo Global."The panda program we began together demonstrates how powerful these collaborative efforts can be. We are extremely grateful to China for sharing the pandas with us and offering us the chance to serve this species in a leadership role," he added.Another panda at the San Diego Zoo, 28-year-old Gao Gao, returned to China in October. Gao Gao means High High in English.The San Diego Zoo started working with giant pandas more than two decades ago when the species was on the verge of extinction. The Zoo became part of an international collaboration that included the China Wildlife Conservation Association (CWCA), the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda (CCRCGP), the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other accredited zoos and conservation organizations, in an unprecedented international effort to prevent panda extinction.Zoo officials noted that over the past two decades, conservation scientists have been able to raise the awareness for the plight of pandas in their native habitat.Bai Yun, Gao Gao and Bai Yun's cubs -- including her sixth cub Xiao Liwu -- helped scientists learn a great deal about panda behavior, pregnancy, births, and maternal and geriatric care. This knowledge enabled them to help boost wild giant panda population in China to more than 2,000.The giant panda, a conservation-reliant vulnerable species, only lives in a few mountain ranges in central China. Thanks to continuous protection efforts, the number of wild giant pandas has increased from 1,114 in the 1970s to 1,864, reveals data released by China's State Forestry and Grassland Administration in 2018.San Diego Zoo Global staff, along with colleagues in China, are now working to determine and redefine the future of panda conservation and research, said the statement."Although we are sad to see these pandas go, we have great hopes for the future," said Shawn Dixon, chief operating officer of San Diego Zoo Global. "Working with our colleagues in China, San Diego Zoo Global is ready to make a commitment for the next stage of our panda program.""We understand that pandas are beloved around the world, including by our staff, volunteers and millions of annual guests," said Dwight Scott, director of the San Diego Zoo."We are planning a fitting celebration next month for Bai Yun and Xiao Liwu that includes a big thank you to the Chinese people for their continued partnership and our combined conservation accomplishments in helping to save this amazing species," the director said.Visitors can go to bid farewell to the giant pandas until April 27.The San Diego Zoo, located in Southern California, is globally recognized as a San Diego icon by hosting more than 4 million visitors each year.

                Favorite attractions are leaving for China as zoo's loan agreement with Beijing expires Garrett Sheetz has always seen pandas in picture books, but never in real life, so he was more than thrilled when his parents drove six hours from their San Jose house to the San Diego Zoo to see the chubby bears up close. "I like best how I get to see them in real life," the 7-year-old told China Daily on Friday as he and his family sat outside a photo booth at the Panda Canyon in the zoo, waiting patiently for staff to print photos of them and the pandas.  Visitors snap photos of Xiao Liwu, as the 6-year-old panda curls up for a nap at the San Diego Zoo on Friday. Liu Yinmeng / China DailyBut the boy's first encounter with the cuddly creatures turned out to be bittersweet. This spring, the zoo's two last remaining pandas, 27-year-old Bai Yun and her 6-yearold son, Xiao Liwu, which means little present in Chinese, are heading back to their homeland of China as the zoo's landmark conservation loan agreement with Beijing comes to an end. Decades ago, the zoo joined the China Wildlife Conservation Association, the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda, the US Fish and Wildlife Service and others in an effort to prevent pandas from going extinct. The collaboration resulted in Bai Yun and her partner Shi Shi arriving by jet in San Diego from China Conservation and Research Center for Giant Panda's Wolong base in 1996. Since then, the beloved bears, including Gao Gao, Bai Yun's second mate, and Bai Yun's cubs, have contributed significantly to scientists' study of panda biology and behavior. Kathy Hawk, senior mammal keeper at the San Diego Zoo, who has been with the animals since they first arrived from China, said pandas historically have been one of the world's most beloved animals and people tend to identify with them. "We have thousands and thousands of people coming to the zoo to see our pandas," she said. "Let's hope through that learning and the conservation messages that we send ... they would like to know what they can do to help save the species." When the pandas first arrived in San Diego, the species was on the verge of extinction, the zoo said. Decades of conservation efforts by the team of scientists have helped bring the wild panda population in China to nearly 2,000. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the latest count in 2014 found that there were 1,864 pandas living in the wild. Although the number is still low, it is considered a great improvement, the organization said, because the animals numbered about 1,000 in the late 1970s. The policies put in place by the Chinese government have resulted in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species to "downlist" the giant panda's status from "endangered" to "vulnerable". Hawk said that by working together, US and Chinese researchers were able to learn more about the giant panda's biology and behavior. "What we've learned from them will help them in the wild," she said. It is not clear at this point when pandas will live in the zoo again, but the staff said they are working with their Chinese colleagues to determine what is next. "I'd like to think that we are just going to be on a hiatus for a while," said Hawk, "but I don't think our work is going to stop just because we don't have pandas at our institution." Her eyes welled up a bit as she continued. "Currently, our director and our executive team are in discussions with the Chinese right now, working out a future research permit at this time," she said. Panda lovers have until April 27 to view them at the zoo and many have traveled from all over the state for a last look at the black-and-white bamboo-eaters. San Diego resident Erick Andino and Gem Riegg said the pandas reminded them of their children because they were one of their favorite attractions at the zoo when they were growing up. "We wanted to come see them for one more time," said Riegg. They said they first saw the pandas when they arrived in San Diego more than 20 years ago. "They have been a part of the community for a long, long time, but it is good that they are going home," Andino said. Courtney Cowen, a dance instructor who was at the zoo with her family on Friday, said it was sad to see the pandas leave. Bai Yun - Chinese for white cloud - had one cub with Shi Shi and five cubs with Gao Gao. Bai Yun and Gao Gao, who was sent back to China in 2018, are considered a "power couple" who have contributed significantly to the scientists' efforts. Pandas are the property of China, even those born on US soil. All six of Bai Yun's cubs were born in the US. The other five have all returned to China. People crowded around the panda enclosure on April 12 and snapped photos of Xiao Liwu, who was curled up in a fuzzy ball chomping on a stalk of bamboo. Not far from the panda's enclosure was a panda friendship wall as part of the zoo's three-week farewell celebration of the pandas. Even though the wall had been up for less than a week, it was almost completely filled with messages of well wishes to Bai Yun and Xiao Liwu. Besides the San Diego Zoo, there are only three other places in the US with pandas: the National Zoo in Washington, Zoo Atlanta in Georgia and the Memphis Zoo in Tennessee. In honor of the partnership and deep friendship between China and San Diego, the zoo held a ceremony on April 6, which was attended by Chinese Consul General in Los Angeles Zhang Ping. "I think it's a very successful program, and it helps the cause of giant panda conservation in China, and helps the population to grow. So this is very significant," Zhang said. "Giant pandas are popular here, many people love them and they have become a symbol of China, and they become a special envoy to bring our two peoples together, so I think this is also wonderful as far as our bilateral relations are concerned," he said. "The San Diego Zoo was honored to be chosen by conservationists in China to work with them to develop a new model for species conservation," said Douglas G. Myers, president of San Diego Zoo Global. "The panda program we began together demonstrates how powerful these collaborative efforts can be," Myers said. "We are extremely grateful to China for sharing the pandas with us and offering us the chance to serve this species in a leadership role." teresaliu@chinadailyusa.com (China Daily 04/17/2019 page3)

                Garrett Sheetz has always seen giant pandas in picture books, but never in real life, so he was more than thrilled when his parents drove six hours from their home in San Jose, California, to the San Diego Zoo to see the chubby bears up close."I like best how I get to see them in real life," the 7-year-old said on Friday as he and his family sat outside a photo booth in the Panda Canyon at the zoo, waiting patiently for staff to print photos of them and the pandas.Garrett's encounter with the cuddly creatures turned out to be timely. This spring, the zoo's two last remaining pandas, 27-year-old Baiyun and her 6-year-old son, Xiao Liwu, are heading back to China as the zoo's landmark conservation loan agreement with Beijing comes to an end.
