                Chinese Nike factories rapidly reducing carbon footprint
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Nike has seen a rapid reduction in it's carbon footprint during manufacturing and transportation, as China leads the way in utilizing alternative energy, said the group's chief sustainability officer.During his recent visit to China, Noel Kinder said brands like Nike play a key role in driving positive change, as the company has replaced 75 percent of its energy consumption with renewable energy across its global operations this year alone.The company is also vowing to help its partners become more efficient and sustainable, and in China, such efforts have paid off, with factories reducing waste by 12 percent from the 2016 to 2018 fiscal year. From the 2015 to 2018 fiscal year, its strategic footwear suppliers in China reduced energy consumption used per pair of shoes by 19 percent."At Nike, we build long-term relationships with our contract manufacturing suppliers because we know having trust and mutual respect supports our ability to create products more responsibly," he said.As China has been accelerating its pace in adopting electrical vehicles to help lower environmental manufacturing impacts recent years, Kinder said the country has been leading the way in the use of alternative energy, giving Nike certain advantages in reducing its carbon footprint during transportation."Logistically, we have worked with some tracking companies that were thinking of adopting e-vehicles, so our carbon footprint would go down very quickly," he said.According to Nike, the company has been utilizing LNG (liquefied natural gas) for long-haul transportation in China on about 30 percent of its cross-province routes. Continuous efforts have also been placed on electric vans for in-city deliveries such as in Zhengzhou, where e-van deliveries have successfully reached 100 percent."With increasing emphasis placed on alternative energy in China, Nike has been motivated to adjust its focus in this aspect of moving our products," he said.

                    Nike to expand in Chinese market despite trade row
                </p>

                While some US corporations are diversifying their supply chains and moving operations from China to avoid tariffs, Nike Inc will expand its operations in the Asian economic powerhouse, which it sees as a growing consumer market for US companies, a top executive of the footwear giant told China Daily."We are super excited about our prospects in greater China, and we are just grateful for an economy that is growing, and consumers that are passionate about our brand. I think a government that wants to facilitate growth is a good thing," Sean O'Hollaren, senior vice-president of government and public affairs at Nike said on the sideline of the 9th Oregon-China Economic Forum, an event organized by Oregon China Council on Friday.O'Hollaren expressed cautious optimism as Chinese and US negotiators prepare to meet again next week in Shanghai for trade talks, noting that the world's two largest economies have built extensive business and commercial ties with each other."I am confident that we can address our issues if we not only look at what we need to do, but how we do it," he said.Nike has operated in China for 35 years, O'Hollaren said. It employs more than 8,000 people directly in its Shanghai headquarters and Taicang Distribution Center. It also hires 40,000 people in its partner stores and another 145,000 in its supplier base.Sales in China grew 24 percent last year to $6.5 billion last year, the company's highest rate of global growth.With an eye toward attracting digitally-savvy younger Chinese consumers, the sneakers mammoth last year unveiled a House of Innovation on Nanjing East Road in Shanghai, which provides consumers with a personalized and digitally-integrated shopping experience.In addition to expanding its headquarters for greater China in Shanghai, Nike announced it would spend $100 million on its new logistics facility in Taicang, Jiangsu province, in January. It also renewed its contract as a sponsor for Shanghai International Marathon."We are doing more, not less, the market is blooming, and we hope to continue to fuel the passion for sports in China," he said.Nike's growth in China supports job creation in the United States, O'Hollaren said. It also allows the company to develop new ideas and expand new markets, he added.According to Portland Business Journal, the sportswear retailer employed 12,000 people locally in 2017. 2018 revenue for Nike surpassed $39.1 billion according to its fiscal 2018 fourth quarter report, released at the end of June.Nike is among the more than 170 footwear companies in the US that penned a letter to the Trump administration this May, urging it to reconsider its latest tariff on shoes made in China.The Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, which represents the brands, estimated that the additional tariffs would cost US customers an additional $7 billion per year.If the trade war continues for a long time, US consumers will ultimately be the ones footing the bill, O'Hollaren stressed."At the end of the day, it's not companies who are going to be punished. It's the consumers," he said.

                Senior executive: 'Super excited about our prospects in China; consumers 'passionate'While some American corporations are diversifying their supply chains and pulling away from China to avoid tariffs, Nike Inc is looking to expand operations in the Asian economic powerhouse, which it sees as a growing consumer market for US companies, a top executive of the footwear giant told China Daily."We are super excited about our prospects in Greater China, and we are just grateful for an economy that is growing, and consumers that are passionate about our brand. I think a government that wants to facilitate growth is a good thing," Sean O'Hollaren, senior vice-president of government and public affairs at Nike, said on the sidelines Friday of the ninth Oregon-China Economic Forum, an event organized by the Oregon China Council.O'Hollaren expressed careful optimism as Chinese and American negotiators prepare to meet again this week in Shanghai for trade talks, noting that the world's two largest economies have built extensive business and commercial ties with each other."I am confident that we can address our issues if we not only look at what we need to do, but how we do it," he said.Nike has operated in China for 35 years, O'Hollaren said.

It also hires 40,000 people in its partner stores and another 145,000 in its supplier base.The Beaverton, Oregon based company grew its business in China by 24 percent last year to $6.5 billion in sales.With an eye toward attracting digitally savvy, younger Chinese consumers, the sneaker mammoth last year unveiled a House of Innovation on Nanjing East Road in Shanghai, which provides consumers with a personalized and digitally integrated shopping experience.In addition to expanding its headquarters for Greater China in Shanghai, Nike announced the allocation of $100 million to its new logistics facility in Taichang, Jiangsu province, in January.

The full-year revenue for Nike tops $39.1 billion, according to its fiscal quarterly report, released at the end of June."Our production in China not only benefits consumers, but also enhances our ability to innovate and support high-quality jobs in the United States," O'Hollaren said.Nike is among the more than 170 leading footwear companies in the US that wrote a letter to the Trump administration in May, urging it to reconsider its latest tariffs on shoes made in China.The Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, which represents the brands, estimated that the additional tariffs would cost US customers $7 billion more per year.If the trade war continues for a long time, American consumers will ultimately be the ones footing the bill, O'Hollaren stressed."At the end of the day, it's not companies who are going to be punished, it's the consumers, and they are going to have less choices, and higher prices, and that's not good for their income," he said.Blaming China has become popular politically because it gives politicians someone to point to for the slump of good middle class jobs in the US."Maybe people are understandably concerned about the future and the ability to get a good job and earn a decent wage. It's easy to blame trade for this anxiety, but there are many other more important factors. At the top of the list is technology, which allows companies to produce more output with fewer workers," he said."Protectionism is not the answer. Even if the US imposed a 100 percent tariff on all products coming from China, relatively little manufacturing would return to the US. It may leave China, but it's unlikely to come back here," O'Hollaren added."China owns more than 35 percent of the US debt held by foreigners, but this uncertainty is pushing China to look for ways to diversify its investment away from the dollar. Why on earth would we want to incentivize diversification away from the dollar?" O'Hollaren asked. "The more our economies are interconnected, the less likely we are to take actions that will hurt each other's interests."

                Skateboarding is thriving now, but it's taken the hard work of dedicated and bruised practitioners to build up momentum, Xing Wen reports.A low rumble, punctuated by the rhythmic "click, click, click" caused by the grouting between paving slabs. A scrape, a sharp "CLACK", silence, and a clatter, followed by the return of that monotonous rumble… It's a soundtrack heard on nearly every street in almost every corner of the world.It is the music of defiance and rebellion, of freedom and youth. It's a song that parents hate and that evokes dollar signs in the minds of osteopathic doctors.Yet, in Tokyo next year, it will be one of the loudest played pieces in the concerto of the Summer Olympics. Skateboarding has finally arrived on the biggest stage in the world-and China is looking for a front-row seat.These days, young people skateboarding wherever the street furniture forms ramps, bumps, rails and ledges may be common-along with hearing slang terms like "lock in" and "drop in"-but, the development of skating culture in China is a 30-year story.

                    Localization vital cog in Nike's expansion strategy in China
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Sportswear brand's push beyond metros, sneaker event herald market growthUS sportswear maker Nike is testing market potential of Chinese cities beyond Beijing and Shanghai. It believes localization as a strategy in China will help the brand better present itself to the whole world.It opened Nike Jordan, its basketball brand's flagship shop, in Xiamen. It is the first Jordan shop in Fujian province.Dong Wei, vice-president of Nike Inc, said the decision to set up the store in Xiamen was shaped by the city's stature as the economic and cultural center of Fujian that can support the growth of a mature sportswear industry."Xiamen boasts a mature commercial environment," said Dong. "As a relatively small city, it has over 80 million tourists coming from the whole world. Plus, there are many local sports brands in Xiamen, building a solid foundation in business environment for sports brands."As for Nike Jordan's business blueprint in China, she said first-tier cities like Shanghai and Beijing were merely a beginning. The brand is looking to expand into more second-tier cities to "get in touch with more consumers".By now, young Chinese consumers have gotten used to e-commerce and are able to buy goods basically from any city online. Hence, offline shops no longer limit themselves to selling products. They also provide customized service and experiences of the basketball culture, which are new growth points for brick-and-mortar stores, Dong said.China has proved to be the fastest-growing market where Jordan has achieved double-digit growth, according to the company's 2018-19 financial report.Eric So, general manager of Jordan China, said the brand will accelerate its pace of opening more shops in China, in line with its rapid development in the Chinese market so far.Dong said through localization in the Chinese market, Nike will draw inspiration to develop a stronger and competitive edge in the global market."Since the earlier '80s, we have been building close relations with Chinese consumers, no matter if they are athletes or sports lovers," she said. "Localization is bringing more contributions to the product design aspects. As the company has gained more inspiration from Chinese elements, it can bring better products to global consumers."China's growing sneaker market in cities beyond metros has attracted the attention of other brands too. In May, Sneaker Con, one of the biggest sneaker exhibitions of the world, was held in Shanghai for the first time. Over 20,000 visitors made it to the three-day event.Ma Xiaofei, CEO of Endeavor, which organized the exhibition, said the event came about after efforts over 10 years. This year's event proved the timing was just right.After the success in Shanghai, Endeavor is planning to hold more Sneaker Con events in China, at least three times a year. It said it hopes to attract 30,000 visitors to each event."If one visitor makes one purchase during the event, there will be at least 90,000 purchases made each year. There are at least five Chinese cities capable of supporting that level of purchases each year," Ma said.
