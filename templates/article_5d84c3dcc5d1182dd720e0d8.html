                Gansu investing in historical sites and beauty spots to attract crowds of visitors Gansu, a province rich in historical and cultural resources, has promoted cultural tourism in recent years to help benefit the region. Cultural relics are among the top priorities of the promotion as Gansu highlights the value of the relics in a scientific and well-arranged way, local officials said. Chen Weizhong, head at Gansu's culture and tourism department, said: "We need to protect Mogao Grottoes, Jiayu Pass and the Great Wall and inherit excellent traditional culture." Zhao Shengliang, head at the Dunhuang Academy, which manages and studies Mogao, said the institute always puts heritage protection first and uses technology to offer a better visitor experience. Before entering the caves, visitors can watch documentaries in the Mogao Grottoes' Digital Demonstration Center, to learn about the destination's natural environment, history and cultural background and see digital cave scenes. After nearly three decades of exploration and practice, the academy has finished the data collection of 206 caves and the three-dimensional scanning of 140 caves and produced virtual roaming programs. The digital Dunhuang resource library launched its English and Chinese versions globally in 2017. Jiayu Pass is a famed part of the Great Wall in Jiayuguan city. Local authorities have employed conservators and daily maintenance staff in recent years. In 2018, the greater Jiayu Pass scenic area received 1.6 million visits. Zhao Shumin, director at the Jiayuguan city's culture and tourism bureau, said: "We should increase protection and adopt diverse advanced protection technologies." The bureau should also use cultural heritage to launch unique tour routes and services, Zhao said. Ecological traveling is another priority in Gansu's tourism development. Shandan Horse Ranch under the Qilian Mountains has focused on ecological protection for years, closing hillsides to aid forestation and return grazing land to grassland. The horse ranch is on grassland with an elevation of about 2,850 meters and crosses Gansu and Qinghai provinces. It covers an area of about 219,333 hectares, including more than 125,333 hectares of grassland. On summer days, the vast grassland boasts its most beautiful season, with yellow oilseed rape and a sea of flowers under a blue sky with white clouds. Related authorities have formulated an overall plan for ecological tourism of the horse ranch. On the banks of the Yellow River in Lanzhou, capital of Gansu, flowers, grasses and trees thrive. They benefit from a dam-reinforcing project and the environmental improvement of rivers. A pump station has been transformed into a venue for local people to enjoy leisure time. "Ecology plus culture" traveling has gradually become a powerful driver for economic and social development in many regions in Gansu, local officials said. In Zhangye city, a wetland museum has opened with an investment of 120 million yuan ($16.71 million). Meanwhile, a national geological museum with an investment worth 100 million yuan is arranging exhibitions in the city. Li Zonghai, director at the culture, sports, broadcasting and tourism bureau of Gulang county, said ecological tourism is development trend. The county of Wuwei city will focus on forestation, desertification control and desert tourism. Gansu is also developing "red tourism", which features visits to sites with significant revolutionary history. A memorial hall of the West Route Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army is one such tourism spot. Huo Ming, office director from the hall, said: "On red culture inheritance, red tourism development and revolution education, we use methods such as sound, images, animation and digital interaction to display revolutionary life and historical sites." It allows visitors to learn about red culture in interactive participation and make red tourism more attractive, Huo said. Gaotai county, where the hall is located, will launch tourism services where travelers can be clad in Red Army uniforms, have similar meals the army ate and walk the roads they walked.  As an area prioritized for biodiversity conservation in China, the Qilian Mountains are an extremely important landscape for glacier and water conservation.Photos Provided To China Daily(China Daily 09/05/2019 page12)

                Region transformed by tourism, preservation efforts
            </a>
            <p>
                Northwest China's Gansu province saw robust growth and development in its tourism industry in the first half of 2019, according to local officials. During that period, Gansu received 160 million visits and generated 113.43 billion yuan ($16 billion) in tourism revenue. It represents a year-on-year increase of 25.6 percent and 31 percent, respectively. It joined with some areas from the Tibet autonomous region, provinces of Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunnan and the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region to host promotions of tourism products and traveling routes. Rural tourism has been a major focus in the province. Small villages have transformed their economies to provide better tourism facilities, such as hotels and homestays, as well as shopping and activities. The Gansu government invited colleges, media organizations and enterprises to send a team to evaluate the performance of 104 rural tourism demonstration villages, which are piloting the new economic model. The team will evaluate and provide consultation services to a further 100 villages wishing to become demonstration villages this year. In the first six months, the provincial government earmarked 71.06 million yuan for impoverished regions to develop their tourism industries. The government invited a design team headed by Mi Qiu, a noted architect and artist, to Bulenggou village in the Linxia Hui autonomous prefecture to assist with planning and design. Gansu also explored cooperation with eastern regions on developing tourism and signed a partnership agreement with the Tianjin culture and tourism bureau earlier this year. Together they will promote cultural tourism projects and train related professionals. Additionally, Gansu increased investment efficiency and promoted major cultural tourism projects during the six-month period. Local authorities earmarked 5 million yuan to support an overall plan for the greater Dunhuang cultural tourism economic circle. It centers on Dunhuang, known for its Mogao Grottoes, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The government has supported Dunhuang Academy in speeding up the construction of the Mogao Grottoes' tourist service center. A more versatile connection among scenic areas along the Yellow River has been urged, with night tours and live performances taking place on the river. Financial support is a major factor behind the sustainable growth of local tourism. The authorities cooperated with the Bank of China and China Development Bank, and encouraged financial institutions to support cultural tourism. Thanks to the cooperation, the Guanegou scenic area in Longnan city secured a loan of 225 million yuan from the Gansu branch of the China Development Bank. Out of that, 150 million yuan has been given to the tourism development company. The authorities have also called on local businesses to increase collaboration with other regions in China. Five cultural tourism companies from Gansu attended a Gansu-Hong Kong entrepreneurs' matchmaking event held in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, in June. There they sought cooperation opportunities for investment and projects. Local officials said that they paid attention to projects that big conglomerates, such as Wanda, intend to invest in. The Silk Road (Dunhuang) International Cultural Expo and the Dunhuang Tour Silk Road International Tourism Festival, which ended on Aug 31, saw the signing of 50 Silk Road cultural tourism projects. Gansu has been able to capitalize on opportunities brought by the Belt and Road Initiative. This allowed it to be prepared for the expo and the festival. Foreign guests, international tourism industry insiders and media representatives joined the events. The province is also celebrating the artistry and creativity of its residents by holding many cultural activities from opera to art exhibitions. The Gansu government organized for two large opera houses to perform in impoverished regions to inspire preservation of local culture, creativity and heritage. Additionally, more stringent regulations have been introduced with regard to Gansu's sections of the Great Wall, as well as a policy on strengthening reform on the protection and use of cultural relics. The government has launched projects to better protect statues and murals at Mogao Grottoes and the ruins of Yumen Pass, a strategic point on the ancient Silk Road. (China Daily 09/05/2019 page12)

                Xi: National Library helps preserve culture
            </a>
            <p>
                President writes to hail institute on its 110th anniversaryFor the 110th birthday of the National Library of China on Monday, President Xi Jinping wrote a reply to a letter from eight experts from the library to express his greetings and the high value he places on the library's contributions to the country's cultural development.Xi said that the library, based in Beijing, has a major role in preserving Chinese civilization, improving people's cultivation and bolstering social and economic development. He also urged the library to make use of continuous creativity in its service, better meet people's psychological needs and make new contributions to enhance the country's cultural strength.The national library was founded in 1909 in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). It now houses nearly 40 million books and annually logs over 5 million visits.Also on Monday, more than 200 library experts and administrators from around the nation and more than 10 countries gathered at the library to explore positive signs in the future development of libraries.The two-day symposium, using the theme "Keeping Pace with the Times", is among a series of events celebrating the national library's birthday.Those in attendance included experts from such prestigious institutions as the British Library, the United States' Library of Congress and Egypt's New Library of Alexandria.Topics include improved services for readers, promotion of humanities, digitization and cross-border communication to encourage sharing of resources.Gerald Leitner, secretary-general of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions, said at the symposium that the world's libraries face many new challenges, but those challenges also bring new opportunities."Some of our roles have never changed. ... The need to preserve the past for the benefit of the future, to create access to information and to provide space for learning and discovery are constant," he said.Leitner praised the significant role of Chinese libraries in global cooperation.The national library has established publication exchange ties with 550 institutions in more than 110 countries and regions and signed cooperation agreements with 52 libraries around the world, according to Rao Quan, the library's director."Libraries are 'gene banks' for the cultures of different countries," Rao said. "An inclusive and open attitude will help us make contributions to multicultural exchanges and mutual learning."He said bilateral and multilateral cooperative platforms involving China - such as the China-North America Library Conference, the United Kingdom-China Library Forum and the China-Arab Library and Information Science Professionals Conference - have enabled Chinese librarians to get their voices better heard worldwide as well as gain operational experiences from others.The national library also set up the Silk Road International Library Alliance in 2018.Such cooperation has contributed to the public's knowledge and academic studies, Rao said. Exhibitions of national library treasures such as ancient books and oracle bones - which have China's earliest known written characters - have toured the world in recent years. The library also has worked with the British Library to exhibit manuscripts from key British authors at the Beijing institution.The national libraries of China, the UK and France, among others, have also closely coordinated in digitization and preservation of the Dunhuang manuscripts, important documents from the Mogao Caves of Dunhuang, Gansu province, dating from the 4th to 14th centuries, many of which were taken out of China.For the anniversary, an exhibition showcasing more than 300 precious ancient books from around the country started at the National Museum of Classic Books in Beijing on Saturday. It is the largest and highest-level display of ancient books in China since 1949.Xinhua contributed to this story.

                Nothing artificial in a new age of intelligence
            </a>
            <p>
                There have been different ages for mankind, stone and bronze to name just two. We are now, as a species, on the foothills of a new age, that of artificial intelligence and as the name implies, it is helping us solve various quandaries as shown in a documentary.Hello AI is a cheerful welcome to a new guest in our lives. Spanning five episodes, the series on the online streaming media platform Youku showcases how AI can make our lives better.From restoration of the Great Wall, protection of the Siberian Tiger and raising yaks to space exploration, Hello AI takes audiences to travel around the world with touching stories involving AI. The crew spent 18 months interviewing 77 people."We did not want another production of 'hard' scientific technology," Chen Yi, director of Hello AI, says at a pre-screening of the documentary in Beijing on Thursday. "We wanted to create something warm to highlight AI's benefits for humanity."The documentary focuses on the technology's many uses, not least on the Great Wall on the outskirts of Beijing. Restorers used to have to climb treacherous cliffs to survey a "wild and very dangerous" section of the structure. But drones are now being utilized.And with help of an AI algorithm, co-processed by tech company Intel and Wuhan University, engineers can easily detect cracks on the wall, and are able to accurately calculate how many bricks are needed for restoration through virtual modeling.Another example shows the UNESCO World Heritage site at Mogao Caves, a collection of 735 grottoes spanning more than a millennium in Dunhuang, Gansu province. Wu Jian, a researcher who has spent decades taking high-definition pictures of the frescoes, once worried his team's work was not fast enough to digitally record the gradually fading pieces of art.It was painstaking work. His team had to take 300 pictures of a square-meter area, and put the "puzzles "together in postproduction. It often took one month to finish the digitization of just one cave. Time was of the essence and an AI team from Zhejiang University was able to instantly build a picture mosaic. This digital exhibition of the treasure of Mogao Caves has toured the country.AI, the film shows, also helps NASA scientists in compiling information on moon craters.The common theme running through the series is "Tech for good".Liu Yile, an executive director of the documentary, says they only choose cases that can "reflect the relationship between scientific technology and people".It is not just ancient structures or outer space where AI benefits us all. In culture too, it can play a vital role. Deng Chunlei, an IT engineer who is of the Manchu ethnic group, regrets that he cannot fluently speak the Manchu language. Just about 20 people, he claims, can speak it throughout China. To help preserve it, he has recorded a 10-hour discussion with a 91-year-old Manchu woman. His team, with tech company iFly Tek, uses AI to analyze the woman's voice and gather 2,500 basic sentences of the language.AI will enhance people's daily lives, according to Song Jiqiang, managing director of Intel Labs China."Technology is at its best when it is widely and cheaply accessible," he says. "A boom time for AI has just started, but has room for improvement to meet our expectations. That needs our continuous exploration."According to Zhang Yanli, a scholar with Doc China, the sector's leading association of documentary production companies, the new series is the first Chinese documentary with 8k ultra high definition and the first such production in China that totally focuses on AI. He also says that Hello AI will be broadcast through TV stations nationwide later this year.Speaking on whether AI will be used to produce documentaries in the future, Liu smiles: "It's just like comparing a handicraft or product from an assembly line. No matter how exquisite the industrial product is, people will prefer a handmade art piece."AI will assist us, but not replace us."That is also probably why director Chen decides to invite her college classmate Ji Guanlin, rather than use AI dubbing, as the voice-over in the documentary. Ji is best known for the voice of lead actress in the popular historical drama Empresses in the Palace. Some things, humans are still better at.

                Silk Road hub takes cultural lead
            </a>
            <p>
                Dunhuang Academy director looks to iconic Mogao Caves art in renewed global role for Chinese culture, Alexis Hooi and Wang Linyan report.They are often depicted drifting through the air, descending from the heavens among wisps of clouds and wearing silken robes that convey the lightness of their flight.The apsaras, angel-like beings known as feitian in Chinese, are a symbol of the historic Silk Road oasis of Dunhuang in Gansu province. Common motifs in the city range from towering sculptures of ethereal musicians clutching Chinese pipa lutes at crossroads, to intricate drawings of winsome beauties bearing floral tributes enameled on mugs.For Dunhuang Academy director Zhao Shengliang, the feitian also offer an important way to "brand "traditional Chinese culture and help spread an appreciation of it across the world."When people think about traditional Chinese culture, they'll think about the Dunhuang feitian, about the beauty of its art."Zhao, 55, was speaking to China Daily on the grounds of the academy in one of his first major interviews since he took up the position earlier this year.The leading research institute manages and studies the nearby Mogao Caves, one of the greatest repositories of ancient Buddhist art dating back to the 4th century, covering the golden age of the Tang (618-907) and other seminal dynasties. The monumental impact of the murals, sculptures, scripts and other major artifacts discovered in the 500 or so caves at the UNESCO World Heritage Site on the outskirts of the oasis in the early 20th century continues to be felt beyond the cultural, historical and religious spheres.Zhao lists tapping Dunhuang art and its legacy to promote Chinese culture to the world as a top priority for the academy.The academy has grown over the seven decades since the establishment of the People's Republic of China and "our development, our direction, has essentially remained unchanged", says Zhao, who is the fifth person to head the institution. His predecessor, Wang Xudong, is the current director of the Palace Museum in Beijing."Our main responsibility is to protect, research and promote. These are still what we do because first, you need to effectively protect the cultural relics. Then you need to research them well. It's only after researching them well that we are able to understand what they are, what they are composed of, what their value is," Zhao says."Finally, we can properly develop and promote the value of these priceless treasures."

                Zhejiang University Press published a book to further promote exchanges between China's Mogao Grottoes and Cambodia's Angkor Wat in late August.As a major highlight of the closing ceremony of the fourth Silk Road (Dunhuang) International Cultural Expo held in Dunhuang, Northwest China's Gansu province, the book Mogao Grottoes Meet Angkor Wat introduced the development of the land Silk Road and the Maritime Silk Road, the history of the Mogao Grottoes and Angkor Wat, and the rise and fall of the Dunhuang and Angkor civilizations."The publication aims to promote cultural exchanges between China and Cambodia, and raise people's awareness about protecting world heritage. It, as a successor to the ancient Silk Road, also opens a new window to friendly exchanges between countries," said Wu Jian, chief editor of the book and also the director of the Heritage Digitization Institute of the Dunhuang Academy.
