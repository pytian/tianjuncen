                    Chinese firm progressing with Padma Bridge project
                </p>

                Steel piling work on the $3.12 billion Padma Bridge project, a multipurpose road-rail bridge across the Padma River in Bangladesh, was completed recently and the bridge is expected to be opened by 2022, according to a Chinese contractor working on the project.The milestone marks an important progress in the construction of the two-level steel truss bridge, as the construction was often challenged by severe weather conditions like storms. The soft riverbed filled with silt and sand also made the construction challenging as it had higher requirements for stability.According to the Wuhan-based China Railway Major Bridge Engineering Group Co Ltd, the bridge construction used some of the world's top-level equipment for hammering. The team also invented new technologies to increase steel pipes' carrying capacity, and designs to enhance the overall stability.The construction was much harder than expected and many construction plans at certain phases even came out days before being put into action, said Shen Tao, deputy general manager of the project.Upon completion, the bridge will have two levels, with the upper tier having a four-lane highway and the lower tier a single track railway. The 6.15-kilometer bridge will connect southwestern Bangladesh's 21 districts with the country's capital Dhaka, and become a vital link between southwest Bangladesh and the northeast of the country.According to project manager Liu Jianhua, the completion of the Padma Bridge project will strengthen economic ties between the southwest and the northeast regions of Bangladesh."The bridge is likely to become an important trade artery linking southwest Bangladesh and the northeast of the country, and also a valuable addition to the current shipping routes," Liu said.Till now, goods are mainly transported between southern and northern Bangladesh via shipping.Md Shafiqul Islam, a director of the project, said the bridge will offer an alternative and important way of transportation aside from shipping, and the connection will facilitate trade and economic development, especially in less developed areas.According to news reports from Bangladesh, the bridge is expected to boost the local GDP by 1.2 percent when completed. The project has already created over 5,000 jobs for local people, according to China Railway Major Bridge Engineering Group.Wang Xiaosong, a professor in economics at Renmin University of China, said the project is likely to become a vital transportation artery for Bangladesh, and marks an important part of State-owned companies' contributions to the Belt and Road Initiative.

                    Tokyo ranks as world's safest city, Hong Kong falls to 20th
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                LONDON -- Tokyo was named the world's safest city for the third time in a row, while Hong Kong plummeted to the 20th place, said a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).Overall, six Asia-Pacific cities are among the top ten, but geographic region does not have a statistical link with results, according to the EIU's 2019 Safe Cities index released on Thursday.The index ranks 60 cities across 57 indicators covering digital security, health security, infrastructure security and personal security.Other cities in the top ten include Singapore, Osaka, Amsterdam, Sydney, Toronto and Washington.Singapore was the best performer in infrastructure and personal security, but Tokyo and Osaka were the front runners in digital and health security respectively.Hong Kong, on the other hand, plummeted to 20th after ranking 11th in 2015 and 9th in 2017.Urban management will play a fundamental role in defining the quality of life of most human beings in the coming years. A key element of this will be the ability of cities to provide security for their residents, businesses and visitors, the report said.The results in individual index pillars show the importance of getting the basics right. A look at the top five cities in each pillar yields a similar message."In each area, leading cities got the basics right, be it easy access to high-quality healthcare, dedicated cyber-security teams, community-based police patrolling or disaster continuity planning," researchers said.Tokyo, Singapore and Osaka lead because of their specific strengths, not because they happen to be in Asia."The research highlights how different types of safety are thoroughly intertwined ... it is rare to find a city with very good results in one safety pillar and lagging in others," said Naka Kondo, senior editor of the EIU.At the other end of the spectrum, Lagos, Caracas, Yangon, Karachi and Dhaka were the five least safe cities, according to the index.
