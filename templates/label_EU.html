                             If Osborne stays on as chancellor or moves to another important position within the government, like foreign secretary, then Britain's continued fostering of the China relationship is highly likely. Now that the ice has been broken between Britain, which remains one of the West's most influential societies, and China, the main Asian power and leader of the newly emerging world, the Sino-British relationship will probably continue to be of real economic and strategic significance to both sides, with or without British membership in the EU. The answer will depend largely on two things: first, the departure terms agreed by Britain with the EU, particularly regarding Britain's post-Brexit access to the single European market and the ease with which London-based financial institutions can continue to operate inside the EU; and second, Britain's longer-term success in creating a global economic footprint, based on developing trade relationships with important countries outside Europe like India and, yes, China

Especially in the context of the rising anti-globalization sentiment in many EU countries and North America, it is now time for East Asia to shoulder the historical responsibility of leading the global trend of regional cooperation. Although there have been some cooperation achievements at the financial level, such as the establishment of the East Asian foreign exchange reserve, it has not been able to initiate free trade negotiations under this framework even till now

                             In particular, since a large part of Johnson's leadership campaign focused on the possible post-Brexit deals with non-EU economies, it is possible that under his prime ministership, Britain will become the first European country to sign a free trade agreement with China.As an ideal opposition party leader, Corbyn didn't waste time in reminding the members of Parliament on Thursday that Johnson backed May's Brexit deal, saying: "Can he explain this flip-flopping?" And quoting US President Donald Trump's remark that Johnson was "Britain's Trump", Corbyn said that the failure to "take back control" ("Vote Leave" slogan during the Brexit referendum) could make the United Kingdom "a vassal state of Trump's America". "In the 98 days that remain to us, we must turbo-charge our preparations to make sure there is as little disruption as possible to our national life," Johnson said, referring to the Brexit deadline of Oct 31

                            So, given the remote possibility of a large-scale compromise on either side, what the EU could do is to count on the May government's political acumen to get the new Brexit deal through the British parliament. Plus, the failure of May's initial Brexit plan meant the deal with the EU would face strong resistance from British members of parliament. Ironically, it also means Britain which decided to leave the EU has to take part in the European Parliament elections on May 23

The cabinet meeting, the first to be held on a Saturday since the 1982 Falklands War, will formalise government support for staying in the EU and Cameron has said ministers will then be free to campaign on whichever side they want. Cameron hailed a deal clinched with other European Union leaders at a summit in Brussels as granting Britain special status, and said he would campaign hard to convince voters to stay in the bloc that Britain joined in 1973

Even then, it will continue to be prevented from selling its products to US companies and to those in nations supporting the US-led boycott

                             Trump announced on Friday that his country is withdrawing from an international arms trade treaty signed by the Obama administration, marking Washington's latest move to quit an international pact, Xinhua News Agency reported. A senior US government official told reporters on Friday that Washington is also concerned that the treaty is opening for amendment in 2020. Since Trump took office in 2017, the US has retreated from several global treaties, including the landmark Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal

                             If the UK left without a deal, showing it was unable to have constructive conversations with close trading partners [the EU], it would not be a great incentive for third parties," says Simon Usherwood, a reader in politics at the University of Surrey. In fact, most economists and business groups believe "no deal" would lead to economic harm, and the Office for Budget Responsibility - which provides independent analysis of the UK's public finances - believes a no-deal Brexit would lead to a UK recession. What is also worth mentioning is the fact that a "no deal" scenario poses a serious threat to the Union, bearing in mind that Scotland didn't vote for Brexit in the first place, and both Scotland and Northern Ireland feel their national interests are better served within the EU framework

She said that the EU and its member states are fully determined to do all they can and will use all their instruments to implement in full their part of the agreement as long as Iran remains compliant with the nuclear deal

                            RIO DE JANEIRO — Under increasing international pressure to contain record numbers of fires in the Amazon, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said Friday he might send the military to battle the massive blazes.In escalating tension over the fires, France accused Bolsonaro of having lied to French leader Emmanuel Macron and threatened to block a European Union trade deal with several South American states, including Brazil."Brazilian rainforests are vital for the world's climate" and Brazil should do whatever it can to stop the blazes, said Rinne, whose country holds the European Union's rotating presidency

                             In the near future, as the UK leaves the EU and China further engages with Europe, what rules to play by and how China and the UK understand and approach the rules-based international system will be fundamental to bilateral ties.A United Kingdom out of the EU will need to maintain a friendly and stable bilateral relationship with China as one of the guarantees to safeguard its national interests and international status British diplomatic tradition and Boris Johnson's experience and character all hint at London exercising "principled pragmatism" in its China policy during his tenure as prime minister. Johnson is fully aware of this and is likely to continue Britain's positive attitude toward China's Belt and Road Initiative and related proposals
