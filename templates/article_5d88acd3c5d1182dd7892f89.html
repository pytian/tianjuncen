                Lao govt sends emergency supplies to flood-hit areas
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                VIENTIANE - Lao officials and military personnel last week used aircraft and trucks of the Lao People's Army to deliver emergency supplies including drinking water, food, boats, tents and household essentials to six southern provinces devastated by floods.Tropical depression Podul and other weather systems that have passed over southern and central Laos since the end of August unleashed torrential rain, causing widespread flooding in southern Lao provinces of Khammuan, Savannakhet, Attapeu, Salavan, Champasak and Sekong, local daily Vientiane Times reported on Monday.Director General of the Social Welfare Department under Lao Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, Vilayphong Sysomvang, told local media on Friday that they were working with the Lao People's Army to rush emergency supplies to Salavan province, some 670 km southeast of Lao capital Vientiane, Champasak province, 484 km south of Lao capital Vientiane, and Savannakhet province, some 410 km east of the Lao capital Vientiane.Two aircraft and trucks are delivering 35 rescue boats, 130 tents and over 2,000 packages of supplies."We will use helicopters to deliver supplies to people in flooded areas which trucks cannot access because of flooded roads. Many families are staying in temporary accommodation on higher ground in Champasak, Salavan and Sekong provinces," Vilayphong said.Last week, vehicles travelling to the south had to stop when they reached Savannakhet because the road was cut off by floodwater, the President of Vientiane's Southern Bus Association, Khamsaen Thammavong, said.This week, people wanting to take supplies to flooded areas should check the road conditions with the Southern Bus Association before travelling.Lao Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare is mobilizing funding and essential supplies and is calling on state organizations and private businesses to assist the flood victims. Meanwhile, the Foundation for Assisting Poor People of Laos Rescue is accepting donations of food, drinking water and essential supplies from members of the public for distribution to flood victims in Savannakhet and Salavan provinces.Authorities in flooded areas say the most urgent need is for food, including dried and instant goods and rice, as well as drinking water and clean water for daily use, and other essential items.The floods have resulted in the death of one person in Savannakhet and another in Champasak, while two people are missing in Champasak province, according to the Social Welfare Department.In Khammuan, Savannakhet, Attapeu, Salavan, Champasak and Sekong provinces, 54,207 families in 788 villages of 37 districts have been affected. More than 130,500 hectares of rice fields, 251 hectares of vegetable plots and 953 fishponds have been damaged, according to the report.Many districts in six provinces are still affected by flooding. Authorities and members of rescue teams are continuing to move people in at-risk areas to safe locations.

                    Bahamians begin rescue efforts as Dorian moves on toward US coast
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                FREEPORT, Bahamas - Bahamians rescued victims of Hurricane Dorian with jet skis and a bulldozer as the US Coast Guard, Britain's Royal Navy and a handful of aid groups tried to get food and medicine to survivors and take the most desperate people to safety.Airports were flooded and roads impassable after the most powerful storm to hit the Bahamas in recorded history stopped over Abaco and Grand Bahama islands, pounding them with winds up to 185 kilometers per hour and torrential rain before finally moving into open waters on Tuesday on a course toward Florida.People on the US southeastern coast made final preparations for a storm with winds at a still-dangerous 175 km/h, making it a Category 2 storm.At least seven deaths were reported in the Bahamas, with the full scope of the disaster still unknown.The storm's punishing winds and muddy brown floodwaters destroyed or severely damaged thousands of homes, crippled hospitals and trapped people in attics."It's total devastation. It's decimated. Apocalyptic," said Lia Head-Rigby, who helps run a local hurricane relief group and flew over the Bahamas' hard-hit Abaco Islands. "It's not rebuilding something that was there; we have to start again."She said her representative on Abaco told her there were "a lot more dead", though she had no numbers as bodies being gathered.Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Minnis also expected more deaths and predicted that rebuilding would require "a massive, coordinated effort"."We are in the midst of one of the greatest national crises in our country's history," the prime minister said at a news conference. "No effort or resources will be held back."Five Coast Guard helicopters ran near-hourly flights to the stricken Abaco, flying more than 20 injured people to the capital's main hospital. British sailors were also rushing in aid. A few private aid groups also tried to reach the battered islands in the northern Bahamas."We don't want people thinking we've forgotten them. ... We know what your conditions are," Tammy Mitchell of the Bahamas' National Emergency Management Agency told ZNS Bahamas radio station.With their heads bowed against heavy wind and rain, rescuers began evacuating people from the storm's aftermath across Grand Bahama island late on Tuesday, using jet skis, boats and even a huge bulldozer that cradled children and adults in its digger as it churned through deep waters and carried them to safety.One rescuer gently scooped up an elderly man in his arms and walked toward a pickup truck waiting to evacuate him and others to higher ground.Meanwhile, in the United States, more than 2 million people along the coast in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina were warned to evacuate. While the threat of a direct hit on Florida had all but evaporated, Dorian was expected to pass dangerously close to Georgia and South Carolina - and perhaps strike North Carolina - on Thursday or Friday. The hurricane's eye passed to the east of Cape Canaveral, Florida, early on Wednesday.Walt Disney World and Sea-World in Orlando planned to close.Even if landfall does not occur, the system is likely to cause storm surge and severe flooding, the US National Hurricane Center said."Don't tough it out. Get out," said US Federal Emergency Management Agency official Carlos Castillo.In the Bahamas, the United Nations said more than 60,000 people on the islands will need food, and the Red Cross said that 62,000 will need clean drinking water.Agencies - China DailyBelinda Robinson in New York contributed to this story.

                    Northwest area sees increasing precipitation
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Some experts believe the changing climate is good for agriculture and environmental restorationLANZHOU - Northwest China, which used to be cold and dry, is now getting warmer and wetter.As early as the 1980s, academics noticed increasing rainfall in the northwestern region and speculated that the climate would become warm and wet."The speculation about climate change in Northwest China in the next 30 years has been confirmed," said Ding Yihui, an expert with the China Meteorological Administration.Chen Baofu works for an airport in Gansu province. As an experienced shuttle bus driver, Chen said he has noticed the changes on the road linking the airport and capital city Lanzhou over the past few years."The 70-kilometer-long road was built on barren mountains. But there is more rainfall here, and more plants grow on the mountains nowadays," Chen said.The arid climate is a major reason that the Mogao Grottoes, a UNESCO World Heritage site, have been preserved for thousands of years. However, as rainfall increased in the summer, the tourist attraction in Gansu was temporarily shut down, while the Gobi Desert nearby has also seen grass growing."We used global climate models to predict that this trend will last until the mid-21st century," Ding added.Statistics from the meteorological departments of northwestern provinces Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai and Ningxia Hui autonomous region showed these areas have seen climate warming and increasing precipitation since 1961, while the trend of warming and humidification has risen since 2000.In Gansu alone, the temperature has risen steadily at a rate of 0.29 C every 10 years from 1961 to 2015.Last year, the average temperature in Gansu was 0.7 C higher, and average precipitation increased by 27.7 percent as well.
