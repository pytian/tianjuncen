                             Besides promises of dovetailing their respective key development strategies, the Beijing-proposed Belt and Road Initiative and Moscow's Eurasian Economic Union, they have pledged to make joint efforts to address current issues, from collaboration on soy production to avoiding risks of sanctions from the West.While making their partnership true to its comprehensive nature, China and Russia have made it clear in the joint communiqué that their cooperation is not limited to bilateral affairs. Not least because the document literally instills the idea of comprehensive strategic partnership into all aspects of bilateral relations, showcasing the two sides' shared commitment to formulating a new kind of Sino-Russian partnership in global governance

                            A record number of foreigners living in Japan were stripped of their residency status in 2018, data from the country's Immigration Services Agency showed, even as Japan is widening its doors to foreign workers. According to the Japanese Justice Ministry, the most affected were people on student visas who quit their studies yet continued to work in Japan and technical trainees who abandoned their assigned jobs and were working elsewhere.However, with an increasing number of technical interns quitting jobs due to long-criticized "grim working conditions for foreigners", the government has also applied stricter standards for revoking visas since January 2017

And we should stop using Republican talking points in order to talk with each other about how to best provide that healthcare."Delaney earlier suggested that it was "bad policies like universal healthcare that got Trump elected"
