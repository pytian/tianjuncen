                    Cambodian FM to visit Laos, discuss border issue

            <p class="style-content">
                PHNOM PENH - Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn will pay a working visit to Laos on Sept 5-6, during which he will discuss border issue with his Lao counterpart Saleumxay Kommasith, said a foreign ministry's statement on Wednesday."This visit aims at strengthening and expanding the scope and depth of bilateral cooperation, including border issue as well as cooperation within regional and international fora of shared interest," the statement said.Cambodia and Laos withdrew last week their respective troops from a yet-to-be demarcated border area in northwest Cambodia's Preah Vihear province.The troop withdrawal came five days after Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen and Lao Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith spoke on telephone to ease the border tension. After their conversation, both leaders agreed to withdraw soldiers from the disputed area.Border dispute between Cambodia and Laos began in April, 2017 when Cambodia accused Laos of sending about 30 soldiers to occupy the areas of O Alay and O Ta Ngav in Stung Treng province bordering Laos' Attapeu province; however, all Lao soldiers pulled back from the areas three months later after a meeting between the two prime ministers.

                    China ready to usher in new era for ties with Solomon Islands: FM spokesperson
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                BEIJING - China is ready to work jointly with the Solomon Islands to usher in a new era for developing bilateral ties, a foreign ministry spokesperson said Tuesday.Spokesperson Hua Chunying's remarks came after the Solomon Islands decided at a cabinet meeting Monday to sever "diplomatic ties" with Taiwan and establish diplomatic relations with China."The decision of the Solomon Islands to recognize the one-China principle and establish diplomatic ties with China once again testifies to the fact that the one-China principle meets the shared aspirations of people around the world and constitutes an irresistible trend of the times," Hua said at a press briefing.Establishing and developing diplomatic ties with China, the world's second largest economy with a population of nearly 1.4 billion, will definitely bring unprecedented development opportunities to the Solomon Islands, she said.In response to a question concerning economic aid to the Solomon Islands, Hua said that those accustomed to "using money to buy diplomacy" might not understand that neither principles nor trust can be bought.As for the exact date for establishing formal diplomatic relations with the Solomon Islands, Hua said the decision will be made when conditions are ripe."We welcome the Solomon Islands' step in making a historically right choice and look forward to the country joining cooperation projects between China and other Pacific island countries on the basis of the one-China principle in the near future," she said.
