                The mountain cat's status has been upgraded in the world from 'endangered' to 'vulnerable', but its future remains uncertain, as Cui Jia reports from Urumqi, Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, with Yang Yang in Yushu, Qinghai.When Huang Yahui saw a snow leopard sitting in the snow-covered Tianshan Mountains in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, glancing down at her like an emperor trying to decide if the unexpected guest was actually worth his valuable time, she suddenly understood why the big cat is known as the "king of the snowy mountains".About 90 seconds later, the snow leopard turned and vanished. He was obviously not interested in Huang or the other volunteers from Wilderness Xinjiang, an NGO based in Urumqi, the regional capital, which monitors local wildlife, especially the famously elusive snow leopards which are gradually becoming less mysterious to Chinese naturalists.

                The mountain cat's status has been upgraded in the world from 'endangered' to 'vulnerable', but its future remains uncertain, as Cui Jia reports from Urumqi, Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, with Yang Yang in Yushu, Qinghai.When Huang Yahui saw a snow leopard sitting in the snow-covered Tianshan Mountains in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, glancing down at her like an emperor trying to decide if the unexpected guest was actually worth his valuable time, she suddenly understood why the big cat is known as the "king of the snowy mountains".About 90 seconds later, the snow leopard turned and vanished. He was obviously not interested in Huang or the other volunteers from Wilderness Xinjiang, an NGO based in Urumqi, the regional capital, which monitors local wildlife, especially the famously elusive snow leopards which are gradually becoming less mysterious to Chinese naturalists.In recent years, a growing number of these big cats have been captured on film as camera traps have been set up in habitats around the country by volunteers from several different NGOs.The hope is that the entire ecosystem will benefit from greater protection of this flagship species which is becoming increasingly popular, as evidenced by the animal's co-starring role with pandas and golden monkeys in the Disneynature documentary Born in China, which premiered in August last year.Despite their growing exposure, it is still unusual to encounter a snow leopard in the wild. Huang never fails to experience feelings of unreality when she views footage of the magical meeting in January 2015.Close neighbors"What shocked me most at the time was that we saw him just 60 kilometers from downtown Urumqi. We didn't know they lived so close to us," the 33-year-old said.Since 2014, with help from the local forestry department and partner NGOs, Wilderness Xinjiang has installed 100 camera traps across an area of 300 square kilometers in the mountains south of Urumqi.Footage from the cameras has enabled the team to identify 27 snow leopards based on the unique patterns on their fur. They estimate that more than 100 snow leopards are living near Urumqi. The motion-triggered cameras have captured a female teaching her cubs how to hunt and the cubs' attempts to play with the equipment.The density of snow leopards in the Tianshan Mountains is much higher than on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau - the animal's best-known habitat in China - but their home ranges are relatively smaller, according to Huang.The big cat hadn't been seen in the area since the 1960s until one triggered a camera set up by Wilderness Xinjiang in the mountains near Urumqi in 2014. News of the sighting spread quickly because people couldn't believe the mountain's dominant predators were living so close to their favorite weekend barbecue spots."I think they have always been there. We just didn't look for them," Huang said. The cameras also captured images of ibexes - a major prey species of the big cats that are built to hunt in the mountains.Snow leopards have short, strong front limbs and longer hind limbs, which help them to cover about 10 meters in a single leap. Their extra-long tails help the cats to maintain balance and also provide extra warmth when wrapped around the body.Listed as a Class A protected species in China, snow leopards can mainly be seen in high-altitude areas in the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu and Sichuan, plus the Xinjiang, Ningxia Hui and Tibet autonomous regions. China is also home to as much as 60 percent of the world's snow leopard habitats.

                TOKYO -- A ceremony was held on Monday at Tokyo's Ueno Zoological Gardens to mark the upcoming public debut of giant panda cub Xiang Xiang.Some 130 special guests, a group of local school children as well as some selected media were invited to watch the panda cub through a glass shield after the ceremony."Xiang Xiang's birth coincided with the 45th anniversary of the normalization of the diplomatic relationship between China and Japan. I hope she will grow in good health and become an envoy of peace and friendship," Wang Wan, wife of Chinese Ambassador to Japan Cheng Yonghua, said at the ceremony."I also hope that children in areas affected by the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake will have the opportunity to meet Xiang Xiang," she said, adding that she hopes the female panda cub will bring joy to those children.She also presented a gift of a panda figurine made by a Chinese artist to Yutaka Fukuda, head of the Ueno Zoological Gardens.Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said that Xiang Xiang has been growing with the loving nurturing by her mother, and the panda cub is "a new treasure of Tokyo."Some 30 pupils from a nearby primary school celebrated the panda cub's birth with musical performances at the ceremony."She is so cute, and we were so lucky to be able to see her before most of the people do," said a pupil after watching Xiang Xiang.Xiang Xiang, born at the Ueno Zoological Gardens on June 12, was the first giant panda cub born at the zoo since 2012.

                Visits to a Japanese streaming website for Xiang Xiang, a giant panda cub, surpassed 1.15 million when the panda met the public for the first time last Tuesday, making the cub an internet celebrity. The stock price of J-Stream, the video service provider, rose by the daily limit the next day, though the website is free of charge, Japanese media reported.Xiang Xiang, who was born in June at Tokyo's Uneo Zoological Gardens, made her first public appearance Dec 19. Visitors were chosen at random from among those who applied, and people who did not get the chance were also able to watch her live videos online.J-Stream broadcast a real-time feed of Xiang Xiang through the video website Ueno Panda Live.jp. People were able to see and observe her, as well as her mom Shin Shin and dad Ri Ri, through eight video cameras.The website's sponsor, KDDI, planned to post news independently on its own data app "Dejira App". Footage of Xiang Xiang eating and sleeping will be shown in order to promote the app utilizing Xiang Xiang's popularity.

            <p class="style-content">
                Xiang Xiang, the female giant panda born in Japan last year, will have to "work" four more hours to meet the fanatical Japanese fans as Ueno Zoo in Tokyo extended the cub's viewing sessions to accommodate more public.The cub has been put on display for five 30-minute sessions daily between 9:45 am - 12:15 pm. The zoo decided to extend the viewing hours to 16:45 pm from February, after judging that the animal was getting more accustomed to the crowd.After the time adjustment, the zoo is expected to receive close to 10,000 panda viewers each day, fivefold that of the current daily figure. Currently, it accepts 80 groups of up to five people per session, or up to 400 visitors in total.To avoid congestion, each visitor will get a look at the cub - along with her 12-year-old mother Shin Shin - for around two minutes. There are no limits on viewing Xiang Xiang’s father Ri Ri.Xiang Xiang made her first public appearance on Dec 19, becoming the zoo’s first cub to debut in 29 years.
