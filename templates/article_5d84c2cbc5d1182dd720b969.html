                Hangzhou firm looks to safeguard China's heritage and expertise in ancient craftFor thousands of years, the ancient Chinese started fires like other ancient cultures - they used small pieces of wood or twisted rope as kindling; struck flint against rocks containing iron pyrite or steel; or used coals kept burning in shells, bone or horn.It was in the middle of the 18th century that wooden matches were first introduced to China, thus becoming an essential part of Chinese people's everyday lives."Few people are using matches now, but I will keep working as I believe this industry is still promising," Hu Wuyin, director of Hangzhou Match Factory, which stands at a turning point after 110 years of development, told China Daily.Hu handed in an application for the factory's entrance into the list of intangible cultural heritages in Shangcheng district, Hangzhou in June, embarking on a new journey to rejuvenate the traditional business. He believes the making of matches is part of the national industry and is something that needs to be preserved for the young generation."Preserving the techniques of making matches by applying for the official recognition will let more people learn about the cultural charm behind the small wooden sticks," Hu said.Founded in 1909, Hangzhou Match Factory thrived in the 1980s. At that time, there were more than 1,400 workers and annual sales surpassed 800,000 boxes."My family is closely connected with the factory. My grandmother, mother and siblings all worked there at different times," said Hu, adding that his family has strong feelings toward the factory's development.However, with the popularization of lighters, the business went from bad to worse in the following years.Hu took over the factory in 2006 after being a worker there for three years. According to the director, the first few years of his administration saw a plunge in the match business nationwide. In 2008, the production volume of Hangzhou Match Factory shrunk to 250,000 boxes due to the global economic crisis and the number got smaller and smaller.The worsening situation urged Hu to find a way out."I talked with peers in the industry and finally realized we should integrate resources and play the game together." The director proposed to choose some trusted factories, especially in the less-developed regions, to be the production bases for brand holders in a bid to create space for factories' business and to support the brand development.

                New series set to explore nation’s cultural treasures
            </a>
            <p>
                A new six-episode series exploring the history behind some of the most treasured Chinese artifacts, traditions and their connection to modern China was launched at a showcasing event in London on Wednesday.The documentary series, China's Greatest Treasures, is a joint China-UK production between China's CCTV Documentary International Media Co Ltd and UK company Mustang Films, and the series will be shown on BBC World News in October.China's Greatest Treasures follows British art critic Alastair Sooke as he travels through modern China accessing some of the country's most prestigious museums and exploring precious objects as each episode looks into themes such as family, food, and technology."Hands down this is the most exciting project I've worked on for the BBC, and I was lucky enough to spend the best part of three months earlier this year traveling around China in three different extraordinary filming blocks," Sooke said. "We visited eight cities, we had a privilege behind-the-scenes access to some of China's famous museums and not only that but we got to meet a lot of people outside museums. I spent a night up Mount Hua, one of the sacred Taoist peaks in China, which I'll remember for the rest of my life."Viewers will be taken on a journey of Chinese art and culture, from a rare painting considered so delicate that it can only be viewed for 30 minutes at Liaoning Provincial Museum to a 3,000-year-old ceremonial bronze cauldron in Shanghai, and, at the Zhejiang Provincial Museum, an elaborate Wangong sedan chair that took 10,000 hours to create.Speaking at the showcase, Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador to the UK, said while the show introduces Chinese culture and history, it also tells the story of the Chinese nation and promotes exchanges between civilizations."The history of the Chinese nation is like a book that tells stories of a magnificent scale and profound meaning," Liu said, adding that the documentary offers a "glimpse into the life, joy, sorrow and relentless efforts of the Chinese people through thousands of years."It also demonstrates how the Chinese art excels at being inclusive and drawing on others' successful experience. Viewers could begin to understand why and how the time-honored history is having a profound impact on today's China and China in the future," he said.

                Secluded clifftop village Guoliang digs out success
            </a>
            <p>
                ZHENGZHOU－Surrounded by the mist of early morning, a motorized tricycle carrying fresh vegetables runs slowly through a steep and rugged man-made tunnel toward Guoliang, a small village perched atop a cliff.As the sun begins to peek over the horizon, the view becomes truly breathtaking. And so begins another day for Guoliang. Owners of rural family inns rush to the vegetable peddler, selecting produce to prepare delicacies for upcoming tourists.Attracted by the village's breathtaking scenery and Guoliang Tunnel, a death-defying road dug through the side of the mountain by hand, around 1.4 million tourists from home and abroad visited the village last year.Guoliang sits on a cliff at an elevation of 1.7 kilometers in the Taihang Mountains, Henan province. For a long while, hardly anyone knew about this small village with its 300-plus residents because of its inaccessibility.The only way anyone could reach it then was by climbing 720 steep, narrow stairs embedded in the mountainside named the "Sky Ladder", which was built during the Song Dynasty (960-1279)."It was a tough life. Commodities from the outside world could not reach the village, and our fresh farm products could not be transported to other places," said 72-year-old villager Song Baoqun."We had to limit the weight of pigs to 50 or 60 kg, otherwise it would be difficult to carry them down the mountain," Song recalled.The biggest challenge was posed by medical treatment. If a villager fell ill, eight people were needed to carry a stretcher down the mountain during a treacherous four-hour journey to the nearest hospital.Many villagers died en route to hospital, while those with connections moved out of the mountains.However, all this changed in 1972 when the village officials decided to build a tunnel through the mountains to connect Guoliang with the outside world. With little engineering knowledge, 13 of the strongest villagers volunteered to take on the difficult mission. Lacking large machinery, they used hand tools such as hammers and chisels and suspended themselves in the air with ropes to carve the roadway inch by inch.As more villagers joined the team, a 1,250-meter-long Guoliang Tunnel road was completed five years later. The tunnel, with over 30 rock windows of various sizes and shapes, was honored as the "eighth world wonder".Isolation, once the very thing that locked people into endless poverty, has turned secluded Guoliang into a tourist attraction since the 1990s. The area, far from the hustle and bustle of modern cities, has also been used as a film location and a site for painting and photography."We have seen growth in tourists every year. Last year, our entrance ticket sales reached 120 million yuan ($17 million)," said Li Haiyan, manager of the tourist resort where Guoliang village is located.Walking through the village, the centuries-old stone walls stand in stark contrast to modern buildings. Li said every household in Guoliang has gotten involved in the tourism industry, running restaurants, hotels and souvenir shops."Today's village is quite different from the village of old. Clever minds can put their ideas into practice now," said 32-year-old Shen Hongqi, who owns a rural family inn in Guoliang.Shen is among a dozen university graduates who have returned to their hometown of Guoliang in recent years and started their own businesses.For Shen Heshan, a local village official, the biggest change lies in the people."In the past, hungry villagers envied those living on the plains. Now nobody wants to leave this clifftop village," he said. "We feel good about our home."Xinhua

                Time to stop making China a bogeyman
            </a>
            <p>
                As a foreign correspondent, I have paid close attention to criticism of China by other countries. After all, honest and sincere criticism, whether of China's politics, economy or society, will help make China a better country. While such criticisms are precious, they are often overwhelmed by the irresponsible and groundless accusations by politicians and so-called opinion leaders. At the plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Monday, a number of EP members pointed the finger at the Chinese central government and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government and justified, even eulogized Hong Kong's violent mobs that stormed the Legislative Council building, blocked the airport departure terminal, vandalized the Mass Transit Railway stations and trains and threw petrol bombs at police. If the Hong Kong rioters' actions are justified, why have they criticized the Yellow Vest protests that have continued since November? On Sept 14, just two days before the plenary session, Yellow Vest protests were held across French cities, from Paris, Marseille, Rouen and Dijon to Bordeaux, Toulouse and Strasbourg. In Nantes, police used tear gas and water cannons after some protesters threw projectiles. Twenty people were arrested. One of the most ridiculous accusations against China this past week probably came from Gordon G. Chang, a frequent commentator on Fox News and CNN. In his response to Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke's remarks on gun control, Chang said on his Twitter:"Hey, @BetoORourke, do you know what happens when citizens don't have guns? You get#China." Chang is notorious for his 2001 book The Coming Collapse of China, a laughing stock for almost all China watchers. Contrary to his prediction, China has in the past 18 years become the world's second-largest economy, the largest trading nation and the largest retail market, and has built the longest high-speed rail and subway systems. His criticism of China relating to gun ownership is easy to dismiss because China's neighbors, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Singapore all have much lower gun ownership than China. I don't know why Chang is so proud of the United States having the highest gun ownership in the world. A Gallup poll released on Sept 10 showed that almost half (48 percent) of US adults say they are "very" or "somewhat" worried about being a victim of mass shooting. Like most China watchers, I normally don't take Chang seriously. But the fact that he is a frequent commentator on influential US cable news networks, more frequent than those honest scholars from Washington think tanks such as Brookings Institution and Peterson Institute, is deeply disturbing. It literally means that he has been offered a platform to mislead US public by spreading misinformation, even making hate speeches against China. Therefore, the rising unfavorable opinion of China among the US public in a Pew Center survey in August can be largely attributed to the opinions of US politicians, from the president to lawmakers like Senator Marco Rubio to TV commentators such as Chang, who have been filling the airwave with anti-China rhetoric. For many years, China has been the favorite bogeyman for US politicians. And as the race for the 2020 US presidential election heats up, China bashing will again become a favorite pastime for both Republican and Democratic candidates. Talking tough against China, regardless of facts, would sadly make them look both "politically correct" and "apt presidential" candidates in today's US. We should all call out those lies. Factchecking outlets, which have grown rapidly in recent years, have a big responsibility to call out those politicians and TV commentators so they dare not to repeat the lies in front of the public time and time again.

                Time to listen to the youth on climate change
            </a>
            <p>
                Climate change is not a far-away problem — it is causing huge damage right now in the Asia-Pacific region and around the world. From air pollution choking many major cities, to more extreme heat and natural disasters, to 1 million species at risk, the urgent need for climate action is clear.We are all paying the price today, but unless we take action immediately to limit the impacts of climate change, it is young people who will be living with the ever-increasing consequences of global warming. So it is no surprise that young people are at the frontline of efforts do something about it.We cannot afford to ignore the voices of young people. We cannot afford to trivialize their demands. What they say matters.Today, 1.8 billion people in the world are between the ages of 10 and 24 years, and 1.2 billion of them are in the 15-24 age group. Young people can drive agendas. This is the most interconnected generation in history. And together, what they purchase determines what sells.Young people are telling us we need to change. The world is on an unsustainable path, and as climate impacts increase, the opportunities for today’s young people will diminish. They are demanding nothing short of a transformation of the economy to a green economy.Political, business and civil society leaders in every country are taking notice. To ignore the voices of the youth is to ignore the urgency with which we must act.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is convening the Climate Action Summit in New York next week to spark this transformation. He has made clear that we must value the voices and welcome to the global stage the young climate champions who have been setting the agenda and inspiring climate solutions.That’s why I’m working with Secretary-General Guterres to convene the first-ever UN Youth Climate Summit in New York City on Saturday.The Youth Climate Summit will feature a full day of programs that will bring together young activists, innovators, entrepreneurs and change-makers who are committed to combating climate change at the pace and scale needed to meet the challenge. It will be action oriented, and inclusive, with equitable representation of young leaders from all walks of life and every region of the globe.More than 7,000 young people between the ages of 18 and 29 answered our call to apply to attend the Youth Climate Summit. While only slightly more than 500 can attend, an effort has been made to ensure wide and inclusive representation. A hundred young leaders from the Global South have been awarded a UN sponsorship or “Green Ticket” — funded, carbon-neutral travel to New York City — to participate in the summit.These outstanding young leaders have been selected based on their demonstrated commitment to addressing the climate crisis and advancing solutions. Given the impacts of climate change in the Asia-Pacific, including increased disaster risk, inequality and harm to the environment, and the leadership of young people in communities here — I’m pleased that several young people from the Asia-Pacific region have been selected to participate in the summit.I look forward to joining the selected young climate leaders in this historic moment and hearing from them about potential solutions that can help meet the challenges posed by climate change. But their work, and our work, does not end there.It is imperative that all of us — individuals, business leaders, heads of state — draw inspiration from these young leaders.Secretary-General Guterres has called on world leaders to come to the Climate Action Summit on Monday with concrete plans, not beautiful speeches. Leaders would do well to hear the calls from young people to protect their communities today and safeguard their futures.Businesses must step up and follow young entrepreneur’s lead in the transition to a low-carbon economy that provides inclusive and sustainable economic growth. And everyone in civil society can join the young climate champions by following along on the Youth Climate Summit live stream and making choices that have less harmful effects on the environment through “Act Now”.I urge young people to continue taking positive climate action now and holding leaders, businesses and their communities to account. By doing so, you will continue to push us forward in this race we cannot afford to lose.The author is the UN secretary-general’s special envoy for the Climate Action Summit.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.
