                Esper 'most likely' to run Pentagon
            </a>
            <p>
                Mark Esper will be taking command of the Pentagon at a tenuous time in the world. Esper, 55, whom US President Donald Trump named acting secretary of defense on Tuesday, is a graduate of the US Military Academy at West Point and a veteran of the first Gulf War. He is a member of the West Point Class of 1986, as is current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Esper will replace acting Pentagon chief Patrick Shanahan, who withdrew his name for consideration for the permanent post after news reports emerged of a domestic violence incident in 2010. Trump also said on Tuesday that it was "most likely" Esper would be given the job permanently. Esper, who had been serving as secretary of the US Army, will take over at the Department of Defense amid a tense situation in the Middle East, where two oil tankers, one from Japan and one from Norway, hit mines in the Gulf of Oman on June 13. Pompeo has blamed Iran for the incidents, but Teheran has denied responsibility. In an interview with Time on Monday, Trump called the incidents "very minor". Esper, in an interview with the Washington Examiner newspaper in May, discussed what the US Army faces in current times. "The army I grew up in was focused on high-intensity conflict against a peer competitor called the Soviet Union. That's what we're going back to in many ways. We now know that we're in an era of great power competition. China and Russia are our principal concerns," he told the Examiner. "And so we need to be able to fight high-intensity conflict against a Russia or China.... That's the type of combat we need to be ready for." The term "great power competition" has been used in the United States to describe the US-China bilateral relationship. It is that competition that is seen as a factor in the ongoing trade dispute between the two nations. Esper, who has worked on nuclear nonproliferation and arms control, said that the least likely military event is a "global nuclear war", with terrorism incidents more probable. Esper received a master's degree in public administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in 1995, and a doctorate in political science from George Washington University in 2008. He served as an infantry officer with the 101st Airborne Division and deployed with the "Screaming Eagles" during the 1990-91 Gulf War. Esper has moved frequently among military, political and business circles. He was chief of staff at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, from 1996 to 1998. From 1998 to 2002, Esper served as a senior staffer for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. He has been a policy director for the House Armed Services Committee and worked in the George W. Bush administration as deputy assistant secretary of defense for negotiations policy, where he was responsible for nonproliferation, arms control and international security issues. Esper was a director for national security affairs in the office of Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist from 2004 to 2006. He was executive vice-president at the Aerospace Industries Association and later served as national policy director in Senator Fred Thompson's 2008 presidential campaign. From 2008-2010, Esper served as executive vice-president for the US Chamber of Commerce's Global Intellectual Property Center and as vice-president for Europe and Eurasian Affairs. He was hired as vice-president of government relations at defense contractor Raytheon in July 2010. hengweili@chinadailyusa.com (China Daily Global 06/20/2019 page7)

                US Congress moves to address migrant crisis on border
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON — With the surge in migration at the United States' southern border again capturing global attention, the Senate on Wednesday approved a $4.6 billion bill to address the crisis, setting up negotiations with the House and President Donald Trump over how the funds should be used.A photograph distributed around the world this week of Oscar Alberto Martinez and his toddler daughter Valeria lying dead, face down on the banks of the Rio Grande river, renewed debate about the plight of Central American migrants."Ever since he first told me that they wanted to go, I told him not to," Rosa Ramirez, Oscar's mother, said in El Salvador. "I had a feeling, it was such an ugly premonition. As a mother, I sensed that something could happen."Congressional leaders must choose between a bill from the Republican-controlled Senate and a more restrictive $4.5 billion bill passed by the Democratic-led House on Tuesday night. They also could reach a compromise and send that to Trump.Trump, who spoke with Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday, told reporters he believed Pelosi "wants to get something done". Pelosi called Trump on Wednesday to "try to reconcile" the House and Senate bill, a senior Democratic aide said. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Pelosi suggested a few changes, but Schumer did not outline them.The issue of immigration is a divisive one in American politics. Trump made it a centerpiece of his election campaign in 2016. At his campaign rallies, he frequently hears a chant of "Build the Wall", which so far he has largely been restrained by Congress from doing so.He may have had his best opportunity in 2017 and 2018, when Republicans controlled the House and Senate. The Democrats took control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections.Trump has faced grumbling in his political base because the number of people apprehended at the border with Mexico has reached record highs.According to a June 5 news release by US Customs and Border Patrol, enforcement actions on the Southwest border reached 676,315 through May 2019, up 99 percent over last year at this time. Total apprehensions on the Southwest border reached 593,507. In the previous seven years, the highest fiscal year total of apprehensions was 479, 371 in 2014."We are experiencing a systemwide emergency that is severely impacting our workforce, facilities and resources," acting CBP chief John Sanders said in the release. Sanders has said he will resign, effective July 5.The Trump administration has faced criticism recently over conditions inside a Border Patrol facility in Clint, Texas, for inadequate food, lack of medical care, and older children trying to care for toddlers, The Associated Press reported.Any solution reached in Washington will require compromise on both sides because of the wide political gulf on the issue.Some Republicans argue that the Democrats don't want to take strong action because they are looking to gain an electoral advantage through migration.Democrats and immigrant rights groups have accused the administration of opposing the immigrants for demographic reasons, because they are largely from Spanish-speaking nations in Central America, such as El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Many of the migrants say that they are fleeing violence and poverty in their home nations.Some Republicans contend that the surge of migrants can overwhelm schools, hospitals and law enforcement. Still, some business groups welcome the immigrants to the workforce.Democrats argue that the US has always been a nation of immigrants, whose presence is a net plus for the country.The issue of "sanctuary cities" and states also has been a contentious one, with such jurisdictions refusing to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) when the agency attempts to enforce deportation orders.ICE has become a target of some Democratic presidential candidates, who opened the 2020 political season in Miami on Wednesday with the first of two debates this week.Trump has been accused by opponents of "manufacturing a crisis" on the border for political reasons. His declaration of a national emergency on the border in February was opposed by members of both parties.But the stark photos of thousands of men, women and children making their way through Mexico en route to the US is compelling Washington to act on a bipartisan basis.Trump recently threatened Mexico with escalating tariffs if the country didn't help stem the flow of migrants through its land."We've got Border Patrol agents right now pulling money out of their own pockets to pay for diapers for these kids," Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, told reporters.The House-passed bill contains health and nutrition standards for migrants in custody as well as other controls on US immigration agencies following reports of poor conditions facing children at overcrowded facilities. Trump has threatened to veto that approach, and the Senate rejected it on Tuesday.The Senate then passed its own proposal, which has fewer restrictions than the House version, but includes money — left out by the House — to pay overtime for ICE employees. It also includes $145 million to help the Defense Department cover costs for Pentagon operations at the border ordered by Trump.Mark Morgan, acting director of ICE, is expected to take over for Sanders at CBP and to take a tough approach on migration.Morgan worked at the FBI under then-Director James Comey and moved to the CBP in 2014. He rose to the leadership of CBP at the end of President Barack Obama's second term, but was removed from the job when Trump took office.The Houston Chronicle reported that Morgan "worked his way into Trump's good graces through appearances on Fox News, where he praised the president".Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez dismissed the Senate's measure. "The Senate bill is not a humanitarian bill by any stretch of the imagination," she told reporters.Reuters contributed to this story.

                Iran urges release of seized oil tanker
            </a>
            <p>
                Washington plans naval escort ops in Persian Gulf region after latest escalationTEHERAN/DUBAI - Iran called on the United States on Friday to immediately release an oil tanker that British Royal Marines seized last week on suspicion it was breaking European sanctions by taking oil to Syria, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman told state news agency IRNA."This is a dangerous game and has consequences, ... the legal pretexts for the capture are not valid, ... the release of the tanker is in all countries' interest," spokesman Abbas Mousavi said.Iran has warned of reciprocal measures if the tanker is not released.Britain said on Thursday that three Iranian vessels tried to block a British-owned tanker passing through the Strait of Hormuz, which controls the flow of Middle East oil to the world, but backed off when confronted by a Royal Navy warship.Iran denied that its vessels had done any such thing.Tension between Iran and the West has increased a week after Britain seized the tanker Grace 1 and London said the British Heritage, operated by oil company BP, had been approached in the strait between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula.Mousavi accused Britain of seizing the tanker under US pressure. "Such illegal measures could increase tensions in the Persian Gulf," he told IRNA.For decades, Shiite-led Iran and its US-backed Sunni Gulf Arab rivals have been locked in proxy battles for predominance in the Middle East, from Syria to Yemen.Britain is among European parties to Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six major powers, which US President Donald Trump pulled out of it last year, reimposing sanctions on Teheran.Washington tightened sanctions from the start of May, ordering all countries and companies to halt imports of Iranian oil or be banished from the global financial system.In retaliation to Washington's mounting pressure, Iran has decreased its commitments to the nuclear pact, in defiance of a warning by European countries.The United States blames Teheran for a series of attacks on shipping in the world's most important oil artery since mid-May, accusations that Teheran rejects.Recent confrontationThe capture of the Iranian tanker also came at a time of sharply increased US-Iranian confrontation in recent weeks. Washington has also dispatched extra troops to the region to counter what it describes as Iranian threats."Foreign powers should leave the region because Iran and other regional countries are capable of securing regional security," Mousavi said."Iran has repeatedly expressed its readiness to hold talks with its neighbors to resolve disputes."On Thursday, the Pentagon said it was discussing military escorts for vessels in the Persian Gulf region.The White House's nominee to become chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, said Washington was attempting to put together a coalition "in terms of providing military escort, naval escort to commercial shipping", he said."I think that will be developing over the next couple weeks," Milley told the Senate Armed Services Committee, after London accused Teheran on Thursday of deploying three military vessels to "impede the passage" of a 274-meter BP tanker, the British Heritage.Iran's Revolutionary Guards denied involvement but also warned both the US and Britain that they would "strongly regret" the British detention of a fully-loaded Iranian tanker off Gibraltar last week for allegedly violating sanctions on Iran.Officials in Britain and France would not confirm the discussions on a tanker escort operation, which comes amid heightened tensions in the Persian Gulf region.The US, Britain and France all maintain a naval presence in the Gulf.Britain said on Friday that it would deploy the destroyer HMS Duncan warship to the Persian Gulf region to replace HMS Montrose, maintaining a continuous presence there.But in France, a government official said that they were not planning for the moment to expand their presence in the Gulf."France is on a course of de-escalation," the official said."Sending additional military assets to the region does not seem useful to us."Agencies-Xinhua

                No basis for trilateral arms talks, China says
            </a>
            <p>
                There is no basis for China to participate in trilateral arms control negotiations with the United States and Russia at present, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Tuesday. At a regular news conference, Geng called on Russia and the US to continue drastically reducing their nuclear weapons in a verifiable, irreversible and legally binding manner, which he said would create conditions for realizing final and full nuclear disarmament. Representatives from Russia and the US were to meet in Geneva on Wednesday to explore a new accord to limit nuclear arms that could eventually include China, according to Reuters, which cited senior US officials who requested anonymity. US President Donald Trump has said he would like to see a next generation arms control deal with Russia and China to cover all types of nuclear weapons, according to US media reports. US Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan will lead the US delegation in Geneva, which will include Tim Morrison, a top aide at the White House National Security Council, and representatives from the Pentagon, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Security Agency. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov will lead the Russian delegation. Geng said he hopes the negotiations will send a positive message to the world. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty between Russia and the United States is set to expire on Aug 2. The US has said the INF Treaty was already dead because, it contends, Russia had for years violated it, in part by developing and fielding the nuclear-capable SSC-8 ground-based cruise missile. In February, Washington suspended its participation in the treaty, saying it would quit the deal on August 2 if Russia does not return to compliance. Moscow has denied the allegation it violated the treaty and accused Washington of breaking the accord, which the US likewise denied. On July 3, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a bill that suspends the country's participation in the treaty. The decree was passed by the Russian parliament last month. The INF Treaty, which was signed by US president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987, has been considered a landmark arms control agreement. It bans Russia and the US from possessing, producing or conducting test flights of ground-launched cruise missiles and ballistic missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers. The treaty caps the number of deployed warheads at 1,550 for each side. In an article in Arms Control Today, a monthly magazine on nonproliferation and global security, Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the US-based Arms Control Association, suggested that the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, also known as New START, be extended for five years in order "to provide a foundation for a more ambitious successor agreement". "Without New START, there would be no legally binding, verifiable limits on the US or Russian nuclear arsenals for the first time in nearly half a century," Kimball said. New START was signed by Russia and the US in 2010 and took effect in 2011. It replaced the 1991 START I treaty, which expired in 2009, and superseded the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, which was terminated when New START took effect. New START limits the US and Russia to 1,550 deployed warheads on 700 deployed delivery vehicles for long-range, strategic nuclear warheads. Both sides have reduced their forces, meeting the mandated limits in February last year. If Moscow and Washington don't come to an agreement on an extension, the agreement could die in 2021. Analysts worry about the impact the demise of the INF Treaty would have on arms control, and some says its termination could spark a new arms race, according to Canadian media outlet Global News. Kimball, of the Arms Control Association, wrote that "if Trump continues to listen to (US National Security Advisor John) Bolton's advice and allows New START to expire, he will likely become the first president since John Kennedy to fail to conclude at least one agreement with Russia to reduce nuclear dangers, and he will have opened the door to a new and dangerous nuclear arms race". Russia does not plan to deploy new weapon systems on the European part of its territory after the US withdrawal from the INF Treaty, unless new US missiles are installed in Europe, the Russian Permanent Mission to NATO announced after a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council in Brussels on July 5. "We did confirm that, when planning measures for Russia's military security within the context of US withdrawal from the INF Treaty, we did not intend to deploy similar missile systems in Europe and other regions, unless short-range missiles are deployed there," Russia's announcement said. Chen Yu, a researcher at the Institute of Eurasian Studies at the Beijing-based China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said there has been a letup in the competition between Russia and the US in recent years in geopolitical hot spots such as Syria, Ukraine and Venezuela. "If the INF Treaty is allowed to expire, there are more possibilities that the two nuclear powers will come to a conflict accidentally," Chen said. "If Russia and the US freed themselves from the treaty, there would be no limitations on developing and deploying new short-and medium-range missiles. And if the two put a lot of these missiles on the demarcating areas in East and Central Europe between NATO and Russia, Russian missiles would strike the whole of Europe, and US missiles would pose a threat to Russia," Chen said. Shen Jiru, a researcher with the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the US withdrawal from the INF Treaty is aimed at developing medium-range missiles as the country's strategic attention has extended to the Middle East and Western Pacific, in addition to Europe. Russia had tried to keep the INF Treaty. In December, by a vote of 46 opposed and 43 in favor, with 78 abstentions, the United Nations General Assembly rejected a Russian proposal calling for strengthening Russian-US compliance with the treaty. Therefore, Shen said, Russia has no choice but to suspend participation in the treaty. "The treaty has long served as a stabilizer for Europe. Once it is terminated, the consequences are serious," Shen warned. "There will be a new round of arms race, for example." According to a New START declaration in March, Russia deployed 1,461 strategic warheads on 524 intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and strategic bombers. The Federation of American Scientists estimates that Russia had approximately 4,490 stockpiled warheads and 2,000 retired warheads as of early 2019. The US deployed 1,365 strategic nuclear warheads on 656 intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and strategic bombers.

            <p>
                China's Air Force conducted a joint air patrol exercise with its Russian counterpart in the East China Sea and Sea of Japan on Tuesday, and did not violate any international regulations or any country's airspace, Ministry of National Defense spokesman Wu Qian said on Wednesday.Senior Colonel Wu told a news briefing in Beijing that China had sent two H-6K bombers to fly alongside two Russian Tu-95 bombers in the first joint air patrol exercise between the two militaries in Northeastern Asia.The scheduled exercise was held to improve combat coordination and joint operation capabilities to help maintain global strategic stability, Wu said, adding that it had not targeted any third party.On Tuesday, the defense ministries of South Korean and Japan said a Russian A-50 Mainstay airborne early warning aircraft had violated the airspace around disputed islands that Seoul calls Dokdo and Tokyo calls Takeshima.South Korea and Japan both claim sovereignty over the islands and both countries said they had scrambled fighters to intercept the Russian aircraft. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said its fighters had fired warning shots at the Russian aircraft.Moscow denied Seoul's account of the encounter and any violation of South Korean airspace, saying the South Korean fighters had dangerously intercepted two Russian bombers during a planned flight over international waters.Wu also told the briefing China hopes new United States Secretary of Defense Mark Esper will facilitate the healthy and stable of development of China-US military-to-military relations.Wu said China congratulated the former US army secretary for being confirmed and sworn in as the next Pentagon chief on Tuesday night, ending a nearly seven-month period in which it operated without a permanent head.

                US finally gets new chief for Pentagon
            </a>

                Esper brings ballast to the department after Mattis' shock departure last year WASHINGTON - Former soldier Mark Esper was sworn in as US secretary of defense on Tuesday after earning Senate confirmation, filling the country's longest Pentagon leadership vacuum as Washington faces mounting tensions with Iran and struggles to end the long-running Afghanistan war. US President Donald Trump's second Defense Department chief takes over nearly seven months after the shock departure of former Marine Corps general Jim Mattis, who broke with Trump over policy on the Middle East and Afghanistan. Two other men served as acting defense secretary this year to fill the void - including former Boeing executive Patrick Shanahan, who served a six-month temporary stint but resigned for family reasons in June and withdrew from consideration for the full-time top post. Esper sailed through the confirmation process at lightning speed. He earned broad bipartisan support and was confirmed by a vote of 90 to 8. Later on Tuesday, he was sworn in at an Oval Office ceremony attended by several Senate Republicans and Trump, who called it "a very important day" for the nation. "There is no one more qualified to lead the Department of Defense," Trump said. Esper's confirmation brought ballast to a Pentagon destabilized by the leadership revolving door since late December, and came as the world's strongest military power is engaged in conflicts in countries including Afghanistan and is being tested by Teheran. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in Congress, hailed Esper, who served a two-year stint as secretary of the US Army beginning in 2017, as "a thoroughly well prepared nominee" who has the respect of the national security community and can hit the ground running. "The world is full of serious threats to America, to our allies and to our interests, not least among them obviously is Iran's insistence on continuing to ratchet up tensions in the Middle East," McConnell said in a Senate floor speech on Monday. "Having a Senate-confirmed secretary of defense, especially one of this quality, could not come a moment too soon." Combat experience Esper has significant Middle East experience. He fought in Iraq during the Gulf War in 1991, and was part of the US Army's famed 101st Airborne Division known as the "Screaming Eagles". He is also close to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, with whom he studied at the prestigious West Point Military Academy. Both men graduated in 1986. On the political front, he served as an adviser to several lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including Republican senator Chuck Hagel, who later became secretary of defense under former president Barack Obama. But his links with the defense industry drew criticism during his confirmation process. All eight senators who voted against Esper's nomination are Democrats. They include Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, who has sharply criticized Esper for declining to recuse himself from all matters involving his former employer Raytheon, for the duration of his time as defense secretary. Carl Tobias, a professor of law at the University of Richmond, said he believes that in the months since Mattis left, the Pentagon's sway within the administration has weakened. "This seems to be the primary challenge that Esper confronts: regaining the power to set the Defense Department agenda and defend it by doing what is best for the nation and the world, not what advances the president's political agenda," Tobias said by e-mail. Trump raised eyebrows recently with a series of imprudent comments. Afghanistan's leaders sought clarification from the White House after Trump said on Monday could easily and swiftly win a war in which "Afghanistan would be wiped off the face of the Earth." He also told reporters he was feeling less inclined to deal with Iran because "they behave very badly", and that Washington was "ready for the absolute worst" with the Islamic republic.
