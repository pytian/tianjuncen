                The United States and China must work together to advance mutual interests and, more importantly, to promote world stability and prosperity, Xu Chen, chairman of the China General Chamber of Commerce-USA, also president and CEO of Bank of China USA, said on Tuesday at the Vision China forum in New York.By working together and sharing "state social responsibilities", the world's two largest economies can promote growth in the context of a "community of shared future", he said at the event, held at the Asia Society and co-hosted by China Daily and Bank of China.Xu disagreed with those who argue that China's growing economic strength poses a threat to the US and therefore should be contained.

                AI drives evolution of China-ASEAN Free Trade Area
            </a>
            <p>
                NANNING - Attendees at the recent China-ASEAN AI Summit said artificial intelligence is a driving force to promote better development of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area. China has maintained its position as the largest trading partner of ASEAN for 10 consecutive years. And in the first half of 2019, ASEAN became China's second largest trading partner for the first time, with the bilateral trade volumes reaching $291.85 billion, a rise of 4.2 percent year-on-year. This robust trade has benefited from the wide application of AI technology. For example, the owner of a chain of outlets selling fresh melons in Zhengzhou, Central China's Henan province, can directly track the growth of its produce, the brand and dosage of the pesticides used in the orchards in Thailand, through the use of cameras installed there.

                Bangkok again ranks as the No 1 destination
            </a>
            <p>
                BANGKOK - Thailand's capital, Bangkok, edged out Paris and London as the world's most-popular city to visit, according to a recent survey - welcome news for Thailand after worries over a drop in foreign arrivals. Bangkok was named the most-visited city for the fourth consecutive year, with about 22.8 million visitors reported in the annual rankings by MasterCard Inc. Paris and London were ranked second and third, each with about 19.1 million arrivals, trailed by Dubai with 15.9 million. The Southeast Asian cities Singapore and Kuala Lumpur were fourth and fifth in the rankings, based on third-party research, proprietary analysis and public data across 200 destination cities. New York, Istanbul, Tokyo and Antalya, Turkey, rounded out the top 10. The number of international visitors across the 200 cities grew by 76 percent in the last 10 years. Despite Bangkok's longtime reign atop the list, the Thai tourism industry has faced headwinds, with arrivals dropping 1.03 percent year-onyear in May before recovering to grow 0.89 percent in June from a year earlier. Tourism accounts for about 12 percent of Thailand's economy. However, weaker Chinese economic growth and a boat accident last year led to a drop-off in Chinese arrivals in Thailand in the first half of this year. The downturn in the number of visitors from China was partially offset by Indian arrivals. Thailand expects to welcome 2 million Indian tourists in 2019, the governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, Yuthasak Supasorn, says, adding this was one year earlier than its target. In August, the government extended a waiver of a 2,000 baht ($65) fee for visas-on-arrival for tourists from 18 countries, including those from China and India. A growing middle class and increasing wealth in populations and the rise of low-cost airlines will make travel more accessible, says Minor Hotels chief executive, Dilip Rajakrier. "Given that only less than 10 percent of China's total population have passports today, the potential of the Chinese market will never fade," he says. Reuters (China Daily Global 09/18/2019 page15)

                China chamber heads calls for more Sino-US cooperation
            </a>
            <p>
                The United States and China must work together to advance mutual interests and, more importantly, to promote world stability and prosperity, Xu Chen, chairman of China General Chamber of Commerce-USA (CGCC), said Tuesday at the Vison China forum in New York.By working together and sharing "state social responsibilities", the world's two largest economies can promote growth in the context of a "community of shared future", he said at the event held at the Asia Society and co-hosted by China Daily and the CGCC.Xu disagreed with those who argue that China's growing economic strength poses a threat to the US and therefore should be contained."China's remarkable growth has offered great opportunities to the US, for China is now capable of sharing more ‘social responsibilities' on the world stage and has become a stronger partner for the US," he said. "Our two countries can take the world's challenges and risks and contribute more to global economic growth, political stability and social progress."Xu said China stood with the US during financial crises, benefiting both nations and the world.In 1997, the Thai baht fell sharply and financial markets in Japan and Hong Kong were threatened with collapse. The Japanese yen fell to about 150-to-1 against the US dollar and that threatened other economies in the region. Had the Chinese yuan depreciated as sharply as the yen, the global economy probably would have fallen into recession, he said."China withstood the pressure of depreciation and even narrowed the floating range of the yuan against the US dollar," Xu said. "China's move helped East Asian countries stabilize financially and avoided the spillover of a current crisis."The result, he said, was that the US and European economies escaped major fallout from the Asian crisis.In 2008, the collapse of the subprime mortgage market hammered the US economy and the Federal Reserve adopted Quantitative Easing to avoid a looming liquidity crisis, a problem China did not face, he explained."China had every reason not to echo America's easy monetary policy," Xu said. "At that crucial time, China worked in concert with the quantitative easing measures of the United States by adopting a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent and moderately easing monetary policy from the standpoint of maintaining a stable global economic ecosystem."Cooperation between the world's economic giants helped to stabilize the world's economy while "vicious competition" would have deepened the crisis and damaged both nations, he said.Citing a pertinent Chinese saying that "No eggs could stay intact under an overturned nest", Xu said no one would have benefited from confrontation rather than cooperation during past financial crises."If China and the US see each other as a threat and refuse to work with each other, to the degree as the extremist voices had wished, then whoever is the winner, the downfall of the global economy would be the ‘overturned nest' where no single country in the world would escape," he said.Xu concluded, "I believe that China will gladly work hand-in-hand with the US and jointly promote a more peaceful, stable and prosperous global economy."

                Chinese firms lead e-payment drive in region
            </a>
            <p>
                Tech giants like JD, Alibaba help build cashless society in Southeast AsiaChinese financial technology companies are beefing up their presence in the digital payment sector of Southeast Asia to help build a cashless society, fueled by the rapidly growing demand for e-payment from people in the region.Central JD Fintech Holding, a joint venture owned by Chinese fintech company JD Digits and Central Group, Thailand's largest retailer, rolled out a financial services app to promote e-wallet services in Thailand.The e-wallet app Dolfin can support eKYC or electronic Know Your Customer technology for verifying user identities during the registration process. It features money transfers, payments and other digital wallet functions, JD Digits said in a statement.Online credit, digital wealth management, online insurance, digital marketing and other functions will be offered through the app. Nearly 3,000 offline retail outlets, including department stores, supermarkets, and the Family Mart convenience stores owned by the Central Group, will start to support Dolfin payment.Dolfin also supports JD Central, a Thai online retail platform jointly created by JD and Central Group. The app provides artificial intelligence and big data analytics precision marketing services to merchants so they can understand consumer behavior and preferences, helping reduce management costs and improve operational efficiency.Global consulting firm Ernst and Young said Thailand has the market and potential to become a fintech hub in Southeast Asia due to its large unbanked population which has high rates of mobile usage, internet penetration, and strong macroeconomic growth.JD Digits has accelerated its global expansion by going into overseas markets such as Thailand and Indonesia. It first entered the Thai market in 2017 in cooperation with Central Group to start a joint venture serving Thailand's fintech market.Other Chinese fintech companies have jumped onto the mobile payments bandwagon to tap the Southeast Asia market. Ant Financial Services Group, the company behind the popular payment app Alipay, acquired Singaporean payment service helloPay Group. It also invested in Ascend Money in Thailand and digital financial company Mynt in the Philippines.Tencent's WeChat Pay, another popular payments app, launched its e-wallet in Malaysia. It also offers e-payment services for Thai sellers."The demand for fintech services and technologies is very high in Southeast Asian countries. The number of Chinese tourists visiting these countries is also increasing and this has given a boost to the development of digital payments," said Wang Pengbo, an analyst at Beijing-based consultancy Analysys.He added compared with Europe and the United States, financial infrastructure is relatively inadequate in Southeast Asia, providing promising opportunities for Chinese companies.He noted China has now become a leading exporter of mobile payment technologies."China's mobile payment is leading the world in both market size and user numbers and Chinese mobile payment companies have stepped up efforts to expand their presence in overseas markets,"Wang said.

                Thai PM floats idea of moving capital to prevent overcrowding
            </a>
            <p>
                BANGKOK - Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said on Wednesday that moving the capital is a possibility to prevent overcrowding.At a seminar entitled "Connecting Thailand with the World" in Bangkok, Prayut cited two possibilities in moving the capital."The first is to find a city that's neither too far nor too expensive to move to," said Prayut. "The second is to de-centralize the urban area to outer Bangkok to reduce crowding."Prayut said that the second approach could contribute to Bangkok preserving its key landmarks, while the government and business facilities could be relocated to the city's perimeter.The second approach would reduce the need for so many people to travel in and out of the city center, thus easing traffic jams, said Prayut.Moving the capital is just an idea and would require extensive research as to the economic and social impacts but it is a possibility under his administration, Prayut said."The Past governments were never able to pull this off, fearing it would cause irreparable conflict in society," Prayut said. "The first priority now is to establish mutual understanding among the people to ensure that the people and the government agree to similar issues."

                Appreciating the great contributions: China Daily editorial
            </a>
            <p>
                 The air raid siren across Shenyang, Liaoning province, at 9:18 am on Wednesday was a reminder of the pain and humiliation foreign invaders heaped on the Chinese people for more than a century before the founding of New China in 1949. The siren to mark the 88th anniversary of the Mukden Incident the Japanese invaders staged on Sept 18, 1931, to launch a full-scale invasion of China recalled not only the atrocities committed by the foreign invaders on the Chinese people but also the heroic battles the Chinese people have fought throughout China's recent history.While the outstanding contributions of the Chinese people as well as foreign friends before and in the early days of New China are well recorded and appreciated, there was also a need to recognize individuals' contributions to the development of the nation in recent decades.President Xi Jinping fulfilled that need on Tuesday by signing a decree to award 36 Chinese citizens and six foreign nationals, including some posthumously, national medals and honorary titles for their excellent contributions to the country's development and world peace.That the presidential decree came after the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a resolution to confer the medals and titles shows the great importance China attaches to their contributions and, more importantly, to their spirit.The Chinese awardees, as representatives of the countless unsung heroes, exemplify the contributions ordinary people have made to the country's development.Tragically, the two youngest heroes were only 29 years old when they died in 2016 — one in the line of duty as a UN peacekeeper in Somalia, and the other while performing a task for the naval air force of the People's Liberation Army.The awarding of the Friendship Medal to six foreigners — former Cuban president Raul Castro, Thai princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, former Tanzanian prime minister Salim Ahmed Salim, first vice-president of Russia-China Friendship Association Galina Kulikova, former French prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin and Canadian educator Isabel Crook — shows the Chinese people not only recognize foreigners' contributions but are also grateful to them for promoting cooperation between China and other countries and supporting China's socialist modernization.Thanks partly to such individuals' efforts, China has become the biggest supporter of economic globalization, which advances the common good and benefits the whole world.And the excellent examples these individuals have set should inspire the Chinese people to emulate them in order to realize the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

                Over 20,000 flood victims remain trapped in northeast Thailand: government
            </a>
            <p>
                BANGKOK - The Thai Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (DDPM) confirmed on Thursday that 20,620 victims in four northeastern provinces are still awaiting evacuations from floods caused by tropical storms that have so far killed 34 people.Chayaphol Thitisak, the director-general of DDPM said at a press conference in Bangkok that 32 provinces have suffered the effects of tropical storms "Podul" and "Kajiki," as well as the southwest monsoon in the Andaman Sea and Gulf of Thailand since Aug 29.He also said that other factors including flash floods, runoff and landslides have hit 182 districts and 7,115 villages in the north, northeast and east of the country."These storms and monsoon have affected 418,549 households, resulting in 34 deaths and many injuries," said Chayaphol.He also said that DDPM is collaborating with military and local offices to evacuate the 20,620 people who remain stuck in flooded provinces including Yasothon, Ubon Ratchathani, Roi Et and Si Sa Ket, all in the northeast provinces."State agencies are assisting flood victims by deploying military trucks to help evacuate villagers from their homes along with their belongings," said Chayaphol, "we have also installed several water pumps to help divert floodwater from critical areas, as well as providing food, drinking water and survival kits to flood victims."At the same time, the Thai Finance Ministry has launched a fundraising program to assist flood victims in north, northeast and central Thailand.
