                Xu Beihong's artistic legacy lives on in new book
            </p>
            <p>
                For those who missed last year's widely-acclaimed retrospective exhibition at the art museum of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, a new book offers a second chance to appreciate the work of Xu Beihong.Xu Beihong: Living Art Forever, published by the CITIC Press Group in August, provides pictorial access to the late artist's prominent collections, as well as presenting the latest developments in the study of his work.Cataloging all of the pieces shown at the eponymous CAFA exhibition in 2018, it features Xu's sketches, drawings, personal letters with family and friends and old photos, as well as articles by art historians from home and abroad. It traces the dramatic life and career of the master artist, through which the reader can envision a wider view of the transformation of Chinese art in the 20th-century.The book not only includes iconic work from Xu Beihong's oeuvre, much of which can be found hanging in State-level museums-representing the serious outlook on art for which he is known-as well as featuring famous pieces from his personal art collection, such as the Scroll of Eighty-seven Immortals.While Xu Qingping, the artist's son, recalls how excited people were to see his father's paintings, noting that many visitors flew in to Beijing to visit last year's exhibition at CAFA's art museum-an institution Xu Beihong headed from the late 1940s until his death in 1953-he concedes that some people were especially driven to catch a rare glimpse of the eighth-century painting, presumably drawn by the great Wu Daozi, that was also on display.The painting features the baimiao-or "plain drawing"-brush technique found in classical Chinese painting, in which painters produce carefully controlled ink outlines and use no color. It is primarily used in paintings of people and figures.Xu Beihong spotted the painting in Hong Kong in 1937 among the belongings of a German woman who had passed away and bought it for a great sum of money. However, the painting was later stolen, but when it reappeared on the market years later, he bought it for a second time.The painting, which is now in the collection of the Xu Beihong Memorial Hall in Beijing, bears a seal stamp that reads, "Beihong's life", showing the artist's deep love of it. He always carried the painting with him wherever he traveled, so that he could study it whenever he wanted.

                A snapshot of life as the end looms
            </a>
            <p>
                Doctor takes photos of patients and their families to help them negotiate the final journey, Li Yingxue reports.One doctor's medicine is more than prescribing painkillers or drugs, vital though they are.As the day shift at his hospital ends at 6 pm, Yao Shuai picks up a piece of equipment few other physicians would use. The office he uses has been converted into a simple photo studio. He takes pictures of patients set to embark on their final journey, often with family members close at hand.Before he takes photos of his patients or their families, he asks a question that may seem at first glance insensitive but in actual fact is of immense benefit: "Are you afraid of death?"Yao, a resident doctor in the department of cardiology at Tongzhou district hospital of traditional Chinese medicine in Nantong, Jiangsu province, believes the direct approach is more humane and truthful.Since Aug 2016, Yao has taken portraits of his patients and their families in his spare time. So far, he has taken more than 10,000 photos of more than 400 people. He plans to hold a photo exhibition or publish an album to record their stories.His images depict his patients' deep, or shallow, wrinkles, their facial expressions, messy hair or even their fleeting delicate smiles.He invites patients and their families to the studio, which is actually a corner of his boss' office where Yao quickly sets up a light, reflector and unfolds a screen to give a white background.Before taking the photos, Yao talks with each of his patients, but instead of talking about their fatal illness, they talk about a subject that is too often ignored: The end of their days."Are you terrified of mortality?" he asks."Sad, helpless, frank, happy, or indifferent, each patient has a unique state of mind to deal with it differently," says Yao."Many people say they are not afraid of death, but when it's coming, they often are."Yao realizes mortality is part of life. He thinks Chinese people lack sufficient education or understanding of this and know little about how to face it."Especially medical staff. We confront death often, but we haven't actually been taught how to deal with it."I still don't know how to prepare to face death, but I know it will come," Yao says.
