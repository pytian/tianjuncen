                Use of concentrated laundry detergents promoted
            </p>
            <p>
                Several ministry-level departments, including those responsible for industry and information technology, public security, and market regulation, have responded recently to issues of public concern.Green laundry 'more effective', less wasteful China will promote the use of concentrated laundry detergents to encourage green consumption among the general public, an official said on Sept 10.Xin Guobin, vice-minister of industry and information technology, said during a meeting in Beijing that the promotion of concentrated detergents will make laundry more effective by reducing the usage of ineffective chemicals and water.China has set a target of increasing the use of concentrated detergents to 20 percent of all laundry detergents next year, up from less than 5 percent at present.Wang Minyan, president of the China Cleaning Industry Association, said the association will encourage the certification of concentrated detergent products and urge consumers to choose the right products for a low-carbon lifestyle.Vehicle retailers to offer registration services The Ministry of Public Security said on Sept 10 that it will allow motor vehicle retailers to provide license plate number selection and car registration services.The measure will be piloted from Friday in a number of big and medium-sized cities including Beijing, Shanghai and provincial capitals before being extended across the country by the end of this year, ministry official Li Jiangping told a news conference.Part of a reform to facilitate easier vehicle registration, it will enable car buyers to choose license plate numbers and receive their vehicle licenses directly after purchase.Chinese motorists have previously had to register their newly purchased cars at a vehicle administration office to obtain a vehicle license.Campaign launched to boost food safety China will launch a campaign targeting illegal food producers and misconduct during food production and marketing, an official statement released on Wednesday said.The campaign, jointly launched by the State Administration for Market Regulation and three other departments, will also target wrongdoing such as false publicity claims and illegal sales in the health food sector.The rectification of food safety problems in schools and kindergartens will also be prioritized, the statement said.Ensuring the safety and quality of agricultural products will also be a priority, with efforts focusing on the safety of vegetables, eggs, pork and aquatic products, it added. The use of banned pesticides and veterinary drugs will also be targeted.Xiao Yaqing, the minister of market regulation, said the campaign will be completed before the end of November.He urged the authorities to accept public supervision, enable better public participation and step up services to the public.Checkups can reduce incidence of birth defects On China's Birth Defect Prevention Day, Sept 12, an official with the National Health Commission called on couples of childbearing age to undergo necessary checks and screenings to prevent birth defects.Qin Geng, head of the commission's department of maternal and infant health, said couples of childbearing age must go through premarital and pre-pregnancy checks, prenatal screening and diagnosis and newborn disease screening.He was speaking at an event aimed at raising awareness about birth defects prevention and treatment held by the NHC and the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation of China.Qin highlighted the importance of promoting health knowledge and improving public health expertise to prevent birth defects, saying that children under the age of 6 must receive regular health services.Expectant mothers must avoid harmful chemicals such as lead, mercury, benzene and formaldehyde, and stay away from radiation, he said.The foundation has established and promoted a birth defects intervention and treatment service system that involves 594 institutions and bases.Data from the China Disabled Persons' Federation suggests that about 900,000 babies are born with birth defects every year.

                China makes public candidates for role models of dedication
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - China has made public a total of 300 candidates recognized for their outstanding performance over the past seven decades since the founding of the People's Republic of China.The nominees were selected from all walks of life across the nation, including 278 individuals and 22 units.Starting in mid-June, the candidates went through the process of being recommended by local governments, voted for online by the public and consultation and deliberation by the organizing committee.Candidates on the list range from wartime heroes such as Huang Jiguang and Qiu Shaoyun to outstanding figures from various fields in the new era including late geophysicist Huang Danian and island guardian Wang Jicai.Huang Danian, known for his expertise in deep earth exploration technology, made great contributions to China's deep earth exploration and national defense after returning to China from Britain in 2009.Wang Jicai, former head of the militia post on Kaishan Island in East China's Jiangsu province, spent 32 years guarding the island post with his wife since 1986. They dedicated all their youth to the lonely strategic outpost in the Yellow Sea. Wang died of a sudden illness while on duty at the age of 58 in 2018.The honorees' merits and accomplishments have been released online and are open to public feedback from Sept 15 to 20.

                Environment must survive Sino-US tensions
            </a>
            <p>
                Despite many ups and downs, the two countries have always set differences aside for a greener world, except in the past two years For the past 40 years, environmental protection has been an important and indispensable part of Sino-US ties. One can say without doubt that the world's environmental problems will not get solved without the cooperation of these two great nations. Since environmental cooperation was covered by the 1979 Sino-US science communique, environmental studies became a popular subject of academic exchange for overseas students pursuing advanced degrees. In the early 1980s, one of my professors at Tsinghua University got his PhD in air pollution control from Cincinnati University, which later became the alma mater for many of his fellow students. My professor later became a "godfather" in this field and many of his students and the students of his students are now playing key roles in the on-going "war on air pollution". They are also making significant contribution to environmental advancement in China. In 1992, I helped found and managed the first professional joint-venture environmental consulting firm in China and later on served as China program adviser for the Air and Waste Management Association, implementing the government-sponsored but privately run Sino-US environmental cooperation project in the field of cleaner production from 1997 to 1999. Corporate environmental practice was transferred to China through investment activities, primarily through Sino-US joint ventures. It also became a golden era for US environmental technology and service providers because of the increased awareness of both the government and public. Since 1999, I have joined the Environmental Defense Fund, a US environmental NGO helping implement the first official US-China joint environmental cooperation project between the two environmental ministries: the US Environmental Protection Agency and China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment. In the presence of then Chinese premier Zhu Rongji and then US vice-president Al Gore, China and the United States signed a letter of intent on a feasibility study on reducing sulfur dioxide emissions through market mechanism in China, opening a new era of official cooperation between the two countries. This marked the beginning of the long standing cooperation between the two countries, which later became the Joint Committee on Environmental Cooperation. Innumerable activities have taken place under the committee's umbrella and the cooperation continues. Climate change became a global focus during the eight years of the Barack Obama administration. The US and China put their other differences aside and joined hands to take on this global challenge. Climate change was not only featured in every strategic and economic dialogue, but also occupied a major part of the three "joint presidential statements". Cooperation between the US and China led to carbon mitigation commitments by both countries, serving as the keystone for the Paris Agreement. It also enabled both countries to step up ways to achieve higher ambitions. The US started to enforce regulations on methane, a powerful global warming gas, and China announced it would launch the largest carbon market in the world by 2020. The Environmental Defense Fund and myself have been fortunate to have participated in this process and played a key role on different occasions. But multinational cooperation for an eco-friendly planet has become increasingly challenging since the US withdrew from the Paris Agreement and other international mechanisms in the past two years. It is undeniable that the US used to be the world leader in responding to climate change and will continue to play an important role in the fight, since dozens of its states and cities have promised to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at local levels. The good news is, China and the US are still working together to some extent: in December last year, the two parties held a high-level regional dialogue on climate change, while Chinese and US business communities - who are highly sensitive to market variations - maintained cooperation in energy innovation. As the Convention on Biological Diversity 15, with the theme Ecological Civilization - Building a Shared Future for All Life on Earth, is coming up in Southwest China's Yunnan province next year, the world may take another step forward. For the past decades, I have witnessed the ups and downs in Sino-US relations but there have always been the "ups" in environmental cooperation, except in the past two years. However, I still believe the two countries will find their global positions to help shape the world for the better in the decades to come, because there is only one Earth and because I am just one of many in both the US and China who believe in environment and are willing to devote themselves to the cause while putting other differences aside.
