                China commodities prices fall in August
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                BEIJING - The overall average price of commodities in China shrank by 2 percent in August from the previous month and by 6 percent from the same period last year, according to the China Logistics Information Center.The average price in the January-August period went down 2.7 percent from the same period last year. The decline was 0.6 percentage points larger than that in January-July.According to the center, the downward pressure of the domestic economy was obvious and the commodity market continued to be depressed in August.The market demand failed to meet expectations, influenced by high temperatures, rain and typhoons, and the real estate regulation policy showed a tightening trend, which further restrained demand, it said.The market supply is still increasing and the pressure on commodities continues to rise, leading to a renewed decline in commodity market prices.From an industrial perspective, the five major industries monitored reported drops in prices. Among them, the prices of chemical products and ferrous metals fell the most in August from the previous month, by 4.2 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively.In addition, the prices of refined oil shrank by 1.9 percent, raw coal dropped by 0.9 percent and non-ferrous metals fell by 0.4 percent in August from the previous month.

                    Watchdog warns of graft acts ahead of holidays
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China's top anti-graft watchdog will attach great importance to investigating public officers who violate the Party's eight-point frugality code during the Mid-Autumn Festival from Sept 13 to 15 and National Day holidays from Oct 1 to Oct 7.With the two holidays approaching, the anti-graft department at each level will take every precaution and strengthen education for the officials to prevent them from violating the disciplines of the Communist Party of China or laws, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC Central Committee said in a statement on Tuesday."Once we discover such cases, we will immediately investigate the involved officials and expose their alleged corruption cases in a timely manner to warn others, securing a clean atmosphere to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China," the statement said.Fighting corruption and tightening self-supervision to rule out luxurious lifestyles and excess bureaucracy on the part of officials have been priorities of the Party since the 18th CPC National Congress in late 2012.On Dec 4, 2012, the CPC released its "eight-point frugality code", requiring officials to strictly practice frugality and clean up undesirable work styles, including bureaucratism, hedonism and extravagance. Practices such as the use of public funds to buy gifts, hold banquets and pay for holidays have since been strictly banned.Figures provided by the CCDI showed that, last year, the anti-graft authority nationwide investigated 92,215 officials who violated the Party's eight-point code, an increase of 27.5 percent compared with the number in 2017.Between January and the end of June this year, 37,207 officials involved in 26,341 cases were put under investigation for violation of the eight-point frugality code.Also on Tuesday, the CCDI exposed six typical cases of the violation of such codes involving officials that were found accepting bribes and using public funds for banquets and traveling. Their punishments ranged from a serious intraparty warning to dismissal.In one case, Huang Jun, deputy head of Pingtang county in Southwest China's Guizhou province, was given a serious intraparty warning and a serious administrative demerit for receiving 30 bottles of expensive liquor, 17 cartons of premium cigarettes and money from 2014 to 2018 when he was in office in the counties of Sandu and Pingtang.In another case, Wang Ling, general manager of a sales center at the Shanghai branch of China Unicom, one of the country's leading telecom operators, was given a serious intraparty warning and an administrative demerit for reimbursing 3,280 yuan ($460) of dinner and public bath bills. Wang was also found to have committed other disciplinary offenses.According to the CCDI, anti-graft departments at all levels will beef up supervision and encourage the public to report more clues about the public officials who act with bureaucracy, hedonism or extravagance during the holidays.Moreover, they will pay attention to cases that involve those who don't restrain themselves and still violate the Party's eight-point rules, or even abuse their power to get involved in graft, especially after the 18th CPC National Congress.Xinhua contributed to this story.zhangyan1@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily 09/12/2019 page4)

                    Balancing of budgets seen as key task
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Total fiscal spending increased at a fast pace of 8.8% by AugustChina is taking measures to maintain balance of fiscal income and spending, to counter economic downside risks and tighten the budget management of local governments, according to the Ministry of Finance on Tuesday."From the current circumstance that we know, some provinces, cities and counties have implemented, or planned to implement budget adjustments" to achieve the budgeted income and offset negative impacts, such as slower profit growth in some key industries and industrial restructuring, according to a statement from the ministry.If certain conditions that can trigger the budget adjustment process could be met, the local governments can conduct the budget adjustment plan in accordance with the Budget Law, the statement said."Whether or not to adjust the budget is determined by local governments according to local conditions."For the central government, the balance of fiscal income and spending can be secured, as the 2019 budget plan has considered the influences of tax and fee cuts, said the ministry.The government's general budgetary revenue rose by 3.2 percent in the first eight months, well below the 9.4 percent growth in the same period last year, which was also lower than the full-year target of 4.9 percent, the Ministry of Finance said on Tuesday.The slower income growth was mainly affected by the tax and fee reduction policy and economic growth slowdown pressure, according to the ministry.Total fiscal spending, in the meantime, increased at a fast pace of 8.8 percent by August, up from 6.9 percent in the January to August period in 2018, it said.Local governments' income growth is expected to maintain a relatively lower rate over the rest of 2019, mainly due to the moderated GDP growth and further tax and fee reductions, Amanda Du, a senior analyst with Moody's, wrote in an earlier research. The Chinese government targeted to make tax and fee cuts of 2 trillion yuan ($282 billion) this year.To implement the policy, the nation's tax income reached a total of 11.71 trillion yuan by August, a decrease of 0.1 percent compared with the same period last year, said the Ministry of Finance.In order to cover the operating deficits of local governments, the central government is expected to strengthen its transfer payments to local governments and accelerate bond issuance, said Chang Xin, a senior researcher with the National Institution for Finance and Development, a national finance think tank.Economists expected that the moderated economic growth in August, indicated by a series of key indicator released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday, may require a more proactive fiscal policy, along with a highly accommodative monetary policy.Stabilizing economic growth by using counter-cyclical measures, such as accelerating the local government bond issuance by using the next year's quota in advance, could take the center stage of government work in the coming months amid rising external headwinds, Fu Linghui, a spokesman with the NBS, said on Monday.

                    Brand value of Chinese real estate firms rises in 2019
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The brand value of Chinese real estate companies, especially top ones, saw significant growth in 2019, which shows the stronger influence of Chinese brands and the tendency of centralization in the property market, a study from the China Index Academy showed.Growth for domestic property companies' brand value reached 37 percent this year, outperforming the growth of their sales up to 26.5 percent, according to a recent report released by the China Real Estate Top 10 Research, which belongs to China Index Academy.The average value of property brands reached 34.6 billion yuan ($4.87 billion). The brand value of China Overseas Property and China Vanke, two leading companies, surpassed 90 billion yuan, it said."The assets and brand value for Chinese property companies grew rapidly amid the 16 years of development. The role of brand has also become more and more important amid the expansion of enterprises and the fierce market competition. Brands bring trust to clients," said Li Jianqiao, corporate research director for the R&D center of the China Index Academy.Enterprises enhanced their brands by providing high-quality residences, which have also increased their market share in certain regions, he said.Besides, the centralization of the property industry in China has become more obvious. It's easier for companies with strong brand influence to get financing from the capital market and get projects with lower cost and good location, as the whole market tends to cool down because of tightened government regulation, according to the report.Brand recognition, reputation and loyalty for leading real estate companies in China reached 70.52 percent, 70.84 percent and 58.92 percent, respectively, much higher than other companies, which showed the strong influence of top companies among customers, it said.
