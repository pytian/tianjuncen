                G20 can be booster for African economy
            </p>
            <p>
                China can lead way for group of leading economies to support the continent's industrialization There is still one area that cries out for greater G20 coordination. Trade. Global trade has evolved significantly in the past few decades, in particular, since the launch of China's opening-up and reform process more than 40 years ago. But the future of global trade is not China. It's Africa. The African continent today has the same conditions China did 40 years ago - a large, 1.2 billion strong population - many of whom are young and hungry for jobs, small-holder farmers trying to move up the value chain, and abundant land. Africans are also increasingly technology savvy and urban, which can propel the process. In addition, African governments are taking four huge steps to accelerate this vision, just as China did. From those in smaller countries such as Rwanda and Senegal to larger countries such as Nigeria and Egypt - the governments of African countries are creating industrial parks and special economic zones. They are taking up loans and creating public private partnerships to upgrade their infrastructure - new roads, rail, airports, and ports - many of which are aiming to be "green" in order to avoid the same kinds of pollution problems that China has suffered. They are also competing fiercely to climb up the World Bank's "Ease of Doing Business Index", by reducing their taxes and bureaucracy in the hope of attracting new foreign investors. And last but not least, African leaders have boldly come together to create the world's largest Free Trade Area, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which came into force in May 2019. The general agreement has been signed by 54 of the African Union's 55 members. They are thus doing a great deal to ensure the future of global trade is in Africa. Yet, on the other hand, exclusive data released this week by my firm, Development Reimagined, reveals that the G20 is not yet creating an enabling environment for African trade. But the 55 African countries together account for only 3 percent of the G20's imports. Of this 3 percent total, 29 countries account for less than 1 percent each. These 29 countries, include countries such as Rwanda and Senegal, which are investing millions to get ahead in trade and investment competitiveness. Even Ethiopia, the African country that Chinese factories tend to know best, only exports 2 percent of the overall 3 percent going to the G20. Indeed, it is countries extractive, natural resources, such as Nigeria and Angola, that dominate imports to the G20. Indeed, for every $1 of goods the G20 countries purchase from Africa, they sell and export $1.4 of goods back to African countries. Even Japan, the G20 host this year, exports more to 37 African countries than it imports from them. However, this relationship is improving, albeit slowly and not consistently. Back in 2000, the G20 sold 39 times more products to Africa than it received back from Africa. Now, the G20 sells 36 times more. Egypt - a relatively more developed, manufacturing country - has the continent's largest trade deficit with the G20. These patterns suggest that without further support from the outside - to complement the internal African efforts I have outlined above - the vision will not become a reality. Trade is - by its very nature - a two-way process. Given their economic influence, there is a very strong case for the G20 to do more to disrupt these patterns, and an even stronger case for China to lead this effort. Why China? Since 2008, China has been Africa's No 1 bilateral trade partner. However, like many other G20 countries, over 70 percent of African countries have trade deficits with China, and this affects investment prospects for African countries. In addition, in the context of the US-China trade war, an agenda to diversify away from imports from the United States or China makes a great deal of sense, and African countries can benefit. Further, if Africa is going to trade more and better, the world's current manufacturing hub needs to shift to the future manufacturing hub. In other words, it is primarily the thousands of Chinese factories producing for the world's consumer markets and the Chinese market that need to shift to African countries. China could itself promote exports from Africa to China. For instance, the first China Africa Trade Expo was recently held in Changsha, and China has also recently opened up the market for cut and frozen avocados from Kenya; beef from Namibia and Botswana; citrus fruit from South Africa, and more. This can and should continue, but China should also focus on opening up markets for finished and value-added products, as a means to support Africa to innovate, attract investment and effective technology transfer. But China doing this on its own will not be enough. The rest of the G20 also need to act, for instance with three complementary actions. First, the G20 should accelerate the landmark agreement made in Kenya in 2018 to reduce domestic agricultural subsidies in favor of poorer countries. This will help to generate incentives to improve agricultural yields, which will drive incomes up to invest in education and health - all necessary requirements for development, as China experienced. Second, the G20 should use their aid, other cooperation tools like training and marketing in innovative ways to create incentives to actively shift global supply chains toward the African continent in a green and sustainable manner. And third, the G20 could itself explore a G20-wide Africa preferential trade agreement that recognizes the AfCFTA. African countries are working hard to get a larger piece of the trade pie. It is in the world's interest that they do, and China is getting on board. The question is how and when other large, powerful countries will also do the same. G20 - the time is now.

                Shenzhen offers lesson to global cities
            </a>
            <p>
                The Shenzhen's transformation journey from a small fishing village into a global economic powerhouse in just over 40 years offers lessons for cities across the globe, experts said.The experts speaking at the launch of a book on Shenzhen, on the sidelines of the UN-Habitat Assembly, said the city in Guangdong province has experienced rapid economic and environmental transformation, leading to its recognition as innovative, inclusive, young and high-tech.Aloysius Mosha, professor and dean of the Faculty of the Built Environment, Ba Isago University in Gabon, Botswana, termed the book as a clear recipe or blue print of how to handle fast urbanization through adoption of innovative financing strategies.Mosha said while fast urbanization is inevitable, its consequences and adverse impacts can be managed through integrated and sustainable urban planning."There is need for good governance, appropriate policies, regular reforms and innovative approaches. Countries should move from normal city financing to innovative financing," he said.Mosha said Shenzhen has been encouraging and financing entrepreneurs who are interested in industrial development."Shenzhen has also provided many incentives to woo local and international investors. Today the city can pick and choose whichever foreign direct investment or FDI it wants," he said.The dean said Shenzhen has gone beyond the traditional funding streams to venture into innovative strategies, such as land value capture, as issuance of municipal bonds.This is in addition to FDIs, project finance, use of local government platforms, public private partnerships, special purpose vehicles and tax incentive financing."The future is extremely bright for Shenzhen city and it remains a role model in the adoption of innovative financial models for city development," he said.Raffaele Scuderi, professor of Applied Economics at Kore University of Enna, Italy, said the transformation of the city within such a short period of time makes it a unique case of urban development.Scuderi attributed the city's impressive dynamic of both the population and economy to peculiar and successful process that has been promoted, sustained and regulated by governmental planning."The open door policy set up Shenzhen as a window on the new trends in economics, a training ground for talents in mainland, and an experimenting ground for reforms in China," he said.Scuderi said urban planning played a central role in sustaining and driving the city's economic growth and the transformation of urban landscape.He said the main novelty in Shenzhen was the use of socioeconomic and spatial planning in a new way, specifically facilitating and promoting economic growth and market development.Werner Lang, professor of Energy-Efficient and Sustainable Design and Building at the department of architecture at the Technical University of Munich, said Shenzhen is one of the sustainable cities in China."By further improving its public transport system and intensifying its green urban infrastructure, Shenzhen might serve as a role model for its neighbors and other cities," he said.Lawrence Scott, a foreign expert at Nanjing University, said Shenzhen offers abundant cultural resources with museums, theatres, concert halls with symphony orchestra, a complex, integrated library system, as well as art galleries and art spaces."In Shenzhen, the overseas Chinese town or OCT has established clusters of cultural creative industries such as OCT-Loft, where small and medium enterprises flourish, such as design industries, alongside other relatively youth-oriented creative programs," he said.Scott said Shenzhen boasts as the first city in China and globally to use electric powered public buses for 100 percent of its fleet in 2017.In the foreword to the book, Maimunah Sharif, the executive director of UN-Habitat, said Shenzhen's remarkable economic and social development had been built on high-tech, manufacturing and service industries."Shenzhen is truly a remarkable success story. Many growing cities, special economic zones and new cities can learn a lot from its experience," she said.Sharif said Shenzhen's economic output is ranked third highest among 659 Chinese cities and according to the 2017 Global Financial Centers Index, Shenzhen is the 22nd most competitive financial center in the world.In 2016, the city's contribution to the national GDP was $303 billion, surpassed only by Shanghai and Beijing, Sharif noted.

                New book on Shenzhen highlights role of innovation
            </a>
            <p>
                NAIROBI - Shenzhen's rise in the last four decades has much to do with its knowledge-based industry, said an urban development expert in Africa who has co-authored a new book on the city in Guangdong province in South China.Aloysius Mosha, professor and dean at the faculty of the Built Environment, Ba Isago University in Botswana, said Shenzhen has attained the status following its decision to disregard the "business as usual" management approach."The city is a clear blue print of how to handle fast urbanization through the adoption of innovative financing strategies," Mosha said on May 27 during the launch of a book titled The Story of Shenzhen-Its Economic, Social and Environmental Transformation that is published by UN Habitat.

                Wildlife economy summit to launch African-led conservation
            </a>
            <p>
                Heads of state, business leaders, technical experts and community representatives are gathering in Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls on June 23-25 for the Africa wildlife economy summit, which aims to radically change the way the continent's nature-based economy is managed.Convened by the United Nations Environment Program and the African Union and hosted by Emmerson Mnangagwa, the president of Zimbabwe, the summit will launch the African Wildlife Economy Initiative.The initiative is an African-led vision of conservation that links the private sector with national authorities and local communities to design and finance conservation-compatible investments that deliver sustainable economic and ecological benefits to countries, people and the environment.At least 12 ministerial delegations from Angola, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Gambia, Zambia, Chad and South Sudan are attending the summit, as well as private sector tourism and conservation investors, representatives from communities, conservation scientists and policymakers. Representatives from at least 30 countries are expected to attend the event.Businesses built on Africa's natural landscapes and wildlife -- including tourism; the harvesting of plants and natural products for food, cosmetics or medicines; and wildlife credit schemes -- employ millions of people and earn governments billions of dollars in revenue. Alongside commercial rewards, conserved habitats drive local, regional and global environmental benefits.A working paper by Space for Giants, supported by UNEP and the World Conservation Monitoring Center, will be released at the summit. According to the paper, consumer spending on tourism, hospitality and recreation in Africa, estimated at $124 billion in 2015, is expected to reach $262 billion by 2030. But even as economies built on wildlife continue to grow, they must take into account economic, social and ecological sustainability.Key to social sustainability is ensuring local communities are co-investors in the nature-based economy. The people living with nature must be at the center of transactions, and communities must be treated as equal partners, with their own conservation and development aspirations similarly valued alongside important interventions to conserve species."To save wildlife and preserve livelihoods, we must ensure that wild spaces remain a legitimate and competitive land-use option," said Joyce Msuya, deputy executive director of UNEP. "We must create a new and effective wildlife economy.""Africa has made significant headway in protecting natural spaces and conserving wildlife and ecosystems," said Josefa Correia Sacko, AU commissioner for rural economy and agriculture.Sacko added, "It is high time to boost economies through Africa-led public-private partnerships that place communities at the heart of investment, while taking into account the need to continue the conservation pathway."

                Sino-African ties, with help from BRI, growing stronger than ever
            </a>
            <p>
                Green energy, culture, education and poverty reduction among ways China is collaborating with continent China has maintained friendly ties with Africa for thousands of years and relations are growing ever stronger across all fields. According to Chinese history books, Africa was one of the destinations of the ancient Silk Road during the Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220), as China-made silk was sold to Africa and African spices were sold in China. During the Tang Dynasty (618-907), porcelain took the place of silk to become the bulk of trade between China and Africa.  Clockwise from left: Delegates from African diplomatic missions in China pay a visit to Shaoshan, the birthplace of Chairman Mao Zedong, in 2015. African women learn porcelain-making skills in Liling, Hunan province. African artists pose for a picture before their performance in Hecun Cultural Park in the suburbs of Changsha. Photos Provided to China DailyLarge quantities of porcelain wares were sold to East Africa and North Africa and it was a fashion among the noble people there to collect and use exquisite China-made porcelain, according to Chinese history books. During the same period, Africa's spices and ivory tusks were exported to China and the images of African people were on the wall paintings of the renowned Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang in Northwest China's Gansu province. In the early Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), famed Chinese navigator Zheng He visited Africa four times. Zheng's goodwill trips marked the beginning of closer China-Africa exchanges, especially in the fields of economics and culture. His fleet delivered large quantities of porcelain, lacquer, silk and tea products to Africa, while the produce and cultures of Africa were brought back to China. According to history books, Zheng even brought home giraffes and zebras, giving many Chinese people a chance to see these African animals for the first time. Relations reached a height in recent years with the implemention of the Belt and Road Initiative and the convening of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. During the summit held in Beijing in September 2018, an action plan was reached by participating delegates for strengthening all-around cooperation in the fields of politics, economics, social development, cultural and people-to-people exchanges and beyond. During the event, eight major initiatives were announced for China's collaboration with Africa in industrial promotion, infrastructure connectivity, trade facilitation, green development, capacity building, healthcare, people-to-people exchange, and peace and security. The announcement outlined the blueprint for China-Africa relations in the new era and opened an ambitious chapter in China-Africa cooperation. Xu Jinghu, special representative of the Chinese government on African affairs, told People's Daily that the eight initiatives are practical as they are scheduled to be applied through concrete projects and the willingness of all concerned parties are strong to realize win-win development and shared prosperity. Green energy A number of Chinese enterprises have participated in the development of clean energies in Africa. Hebei-based Yingli Group, for instance, has been engaged in the development of solar power systems in East Africa in cooperation with local partners since 2007. The company has sold its photovoltaic products to such countries as Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, Rwanda, Ethiopia and South Sudan. "With the advancement of the BRI, we now have a strong presence in more than 20 countries involved in the BRI," said Song Dengyuan, chief scientist at Yingli. He added that his company has trained about 400 people in those countries, most of them in Africa, on photovoltaic technologies and transferred its technologies to more than 10 countries. Zhejiang-based Chint New Energy Development is one of the major investors in a large photovoltaic industrial park in Benban, Egypt. The company contracted the construction of 165.5-megawatt solar power station and provided nearly 50 percent of photovoltaic panels for the project. Zhang Lei, a Chint executive responsible for the solar power project, said his company has held many training sessions for local personnel. "As the designed service life of photovoltaic panels can reach 25 years, it is important for the operators' staff members to master knowledge on installation, maintenance and repair," Zhang said. World Bank President David Malpass praised the photovoltaic project as a successful example for Egypt to use its local advantages for investment cooperation and the experience is applicable in other sectors, according to Xinhua News Agency's report. Xinhua quoted Sahar Nasr, Egypt's minister of investment and international cooperation, saying that "Benban Solar Park comes as the country is taking unprecedented steps to create a modern legislative framework to attract foreign investment". The solar park will help bolster Egypt's use of renewable energy to meet 22 percent of the country's domestic energy needs by 2020, according to Xinhua. Culture, education Along with improving economic ties, cultural and educational exchanges between China and Africa have also reached a peak in recent years. The Chinese language is becoming more popular in Africa with the establishment of more Confucius Institutes on the continent. Ma Jianfei, Party chief of the Confucius Institutes' headquarters, said a total of 54 such institutes and 30 Confucius classrooms had been established in Africa, training more than 1.4 million students through the end of May 2018. Many African students view the Confucius Institutes as an effective channel to learn Chinese language and culture. Anthony Ekewensi, who studies at the Confucius Institute at Nnamdi Azikiwe University in Nigeria, said: "Through learning the Chinese language, I want to become an ambassador to promote Africa-China cooperation." Holding a Chinese level-5 certificate, Ekewensi said he spends two hours a day learning the language. Through various online apps, the Nigerian is helping his relatives and friends learn more about China - food, tourist attractions and sciences and technologies. "I just want to show my people a modernized country with long history and brilliant culture," Ekewensi said. Thanks to his proficiency in Chinese, Ekewensi entered the finals of the 17th Chinese Bridge Chinese Proficiency Competition for Foreign College Students and became the champion of the Africa group. Nan Gengxu is a Chinese immigrant in Botswana. He thinks the media is an important source for the Chinese and African peoples to know each other. He founded two media companies in Africa, operating a number of newspapers, magazines, TV stations and movie production, with services covering the entire continent. Nan is especially fond of movies so he is now promoting Chinese movies to Africa, especially in local schools. "The young people are set to be the major force to boost and consolidate China-Africa relations," he said. He is planning to invest in a number of mobile cinemas in Africa to show both Chinese and African movies. Poverty reduction China is willing to share its experience with Africa and offer its nations a helping hand. Zuo Changsheng, head of the International Poverty Reduction Center in China, said: "We want to enhance poverty relief cooperation with Africa under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative." "We are planning to develop a number of pilot poverty reduction programs in communities, sharing the Chinese experience with the locals," Zuo added. According to a CCTV report, China had launched poverty reduction-related training programs in 52 African countries for 2,122 trainees by August 2018. The trainees included officials, scholars and other industry insiders. During a UNESCO forum on the development of world heritage in China and Africa, held on June 4 in Paris, Chinese tourism expert Zhang Chaozhi shared the unique poverty reduction experience of Zhangjiajie city in Hunan province. Zhang said in Zhangjiajie, heritage protection has been integrated with tourism development and involved the wide participation of local residents, communities, governments and enterprises. Residents have increasingly benefited from the tourism industry bolstered by heritage protection.  Clockwise from top left: Farmers and farming technicians in Nigeria learn from Chinese experts on growing vegetables.

                Experts hail Sino-US agreement during G20
            </a>
            <p>
                The agreement reached by the leaders of China and the United States during the G20 summit will not only contribute to the economic development of both countries, but also have positive effects on the world economy and multilateralism, said foreign officials.President Xi Jinping met with his US counterpart Donald Trump on Saturday during the G20 summit in Japan. Both agreed that the two countries will restart trade talks based on mutual respect and equal footing.Burhan Kayaturk, deputy chairman of Foreign Affairs Department of the Justice and Development Party of Turkey, said any conflict between China and the US will affect the whole world, and the two leaders have taken on important responsibility for peaceful coexistence.Mpho Balopi, secretary-general of the Botswana Democratic Party, said his country is very happy to see the goodwill and sincerity between Beijing and Washington. He quoted a local proverb "when two elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers most", and said if the two "elephants" can maintain a harmonious relationship, they are creating a better environment for the world.Claudio Puty, an associate professor at the Federal University of Para in Brazil, said a trade friction leads to no winner but to negative impact on the global economy.An expert on economics, Puty also said the current confrontation has already affected the global economic growth as the International Monetary Fund cut the projected growth rate of 2019 to 3.3 percent in April.The rate was down from the 3.5 percent the IMF had forecast in January, which would be the weakest since 2009. IMF said the growth could slow further due to trade tensions.Boris Shmelev, director of the Department for Political Studies at the Institute of Economics of Russian Academy of Sciences, said the result of the friction has "very negative impact on the world trade".He called on the international community to safeguard multilateralism to protect their interests, and said the BRICS, an acronym of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, is a part of the global governance as well as the implementation of multilateralism."BRICS is not an organization nor a movement, but a kind of form that has united some of the biggest countries in the world ... to step-by-step influence the process of decision-making and global governance with multilateralism."

                Trade in wild African elephant to be heavily regulated
            </a>
            <p>
                Trade in wild African elephant will now be heavily regulated and only allowed in "exceptional" circumstances across the globe.This follows a vote to adopt the new regulation at the 18th Meeting of the State Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, also referred to as CITES, on August 17-28 in Geneva, Switzerland.Representatives voted to adopt a proposal banning export of elephants by Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa to overseas zoos and entertainment venues.The vote obtained the required two-third majority after being approved by 87 votes in favor, 29 against and 25 abstentions.Zimbabwe and Botswana, which have the largest elephant population, will only be allowed to export the wild animals in "exceptional circumstances", in consultation with relevant CITES and International Union for Conservation of Nature bodies, and only if they provide "conservation benefits."Although animal welfare groups and conservation organizations lauded the decision, some southern African countries objected to the vote, while the United States and European zoo associations expressed reservations.The Humane Society International, an animal protection charity, applauded the decision saying it will save countless elephants from being snatched from their families and natural environment.Audrey Delsink, wildlife director at Humane Society International, said even though the decision is not an outright ban on trade in live elephants, it adds vital independent oversight and scrutiny."Speaking personally as an elephant field biologist, I am jubilant that we have secured this victory for all the elephants who will now be spared the ordeal of being ripped away from their families," Delsink said.He said the capture of wild African elephants for export to zoos and other captive facilities is incredibly traumatizing for individual elephants as well as their social groups.African elephants in Zimbabwe and Botswana are currently listed in the second appendix of CITES with an annotation that allows live elephants to be exported to "appropriate and acceptable" destinations.Under the definition, Delsink said Zimbabwe has been capturing live baby African elephants in the wild and exporting them to zoos in other countries.He said the practice has been highly controversial, drawing the condemnation of animal protection and conservation groups as well as elephant scientists who note that elephants are complex creatures who suffer both physically and psychologically as a result of captivity.He said the definition of what is an appropriate destination is key, and independent oversight by elephant specialists is critical."We will remain vigilant as that discussion develops and fight against any attempts to justify or prolong trade in live baby elephants for captive purposes. We are extremely grateful to Kenya and the African Elephant Coalition for their efforts to protect wild African elephants," he said.Dr Jane Goodall, founder of the Jane Goodall Institute, a global wildlife and conservation organization, said that the thought of capturing young elephants, taking them from their families, and sending them off to a future that will inevitably involve a great deal of trauma and suffering, is shocking.She said the bonds between infant elephants and their mothers are as strong and enduring as those between human children and their mothers."To break that bond is cruel and inhumane. I cannot imagine any caring person agreeing to such an unethical proposal and I hope with all my heart that the EU will not vote against the provisional decision taken in CITES with a two-thirds majority," she said.Ian Redmond, a tropical field biologist and conservationist who is renowned for his work with great apes and elephants, also expressed his opposition to the live elephant trade."Having studied elephants, I know how important an elephant's childhood is. Every elephant child learns how to thrive in their family's habitat and that habitat benefits from the elephants," he said.He said to separate a young elephant from his or her family for a life of social and sensory deprivation in captivity is bad for the captive as well as the grieving family left behind.
