            </p>

                China has seen a significant drop of casualties from workplace accidents and natural disasters in recent years, and efforts will be beefed up in major high-risk sectors such as the chemical industry to further improve the situation, according to a senior emergency management official.After a continuous decline of both the number of workplace accidents and their casualties for 16 consecutive years, "the annual death toll of workplace accidents in the country plummeted from a peak of almost 140,000 in 2002 to 34,000 last year," Sun Huashan, vice-minister of emergency management, said at a news conference organized by the State Council Information Office on Wednesday.The country also experienced a great drop in casualties from natural disasters. On average, about 7,200 people were killed or left missing in disasters annually in the initial years after the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949.Last year, fewer than 1,000 people succumbed to natural disasters, he added.He also said, however, that the country still faces challenges in further enhancing safety in the coal mine sector, and the safety control situation remains grim in the country's chemical industry.Since 1949, among workplace accidents that claimed more than 30 lives, 40 percent occurred in the coal mine sector. With increasingly bigger government investment to strengthen management, the country has established a national team of more than 3,000 members focusing on coal mine safety administration and has enacted a series of laws and regulations."Marked progress has been made" in improving the situation, Sun said.A lot of small coal mines with inadequate safety conditions have been shut down. The number of coal mines across the country dropped from more than 30,000 in 1999 to 5,700 last year despite the fact that coal output shot up from about 1.2 billion to almost 3.7 billion metric tons during that period, he noted.The annual death toll declined to only 333 last year from a peak during the period of 8,000, he added."The safety situation in the coal mine sector has been stable with a trend toward good, but there are still many factors that could result in disasters," Sun said without elaborating on those factors."The situation is still fragile."While the coal mine industry is showing promise, major accidents in the country's giant chemical sector have been trending upward, he said.Two major accidents occurred in the sector in 2017 and another two in 2018, claiming 63 lives in total. This year, three major accidents occurred from January to August, leaving 103 dead, Sun said.He said 80 percent of companies in the country's chemical sector are medium-and small-sized firms with outdated equipment and inadequate safety control capabilities.According to the ministry, there are now more than 210,000 chemical companies across the country. The output value of the sector stood at 14.8 trillion yuan ($2.1 trillion) last year, amounting to 13.8 percent of the country's GDP.The ministry will continue to dispatch experts to guide companies in the sector to address their challenges in safety management and roll out special law enforcement campaigns to remove safety hazards, he said.

                    SDSC inks tanker charter deal with Shell

            <p class="style-content">
                Shandong Shipping Corp signed tanker charter contracts on Tuesday with Royal Dutch Shell Plc to provide shipping and logistic services for the European company's oil and chemical products around the world.The deal was reached in Jinan, capital city of East China's Shandong province. It involves eight 50,000 dead weight ton tankers.With the move, total shipping capacity of ships run by Shandong Marine Group reached 9.43 million DWT, ranking the company third in the shipping sector in China, said Bao Jianying, chairman of Shandong Marine Group, the controlling shareholder of SDSC.SDSC is a State-owned company founded in 2010 with a registered capital of 3 billion yuan ($422.7 million). The number of ships operated by the company grew to 72 currently from only one in 2010, a sign of the rapid growth of the firm's business. The capacity of ships operated by SDSC in the last year rose 36.05 percent compared with the level in 2017.Statistics showed the gross income of SDSC in 2018 reached 6.2 billion yuan, a report by the China Business Network said.More than two-thirds of the world's trade is shipped and over 90 percent of the total export and import volume generated in China is completed by shipping.The Belt and Road Initiative has brought opportunities to the shipping industry, said SDSC Chairman Yu Bing. More than 3 billion people in more than 60 countries and regions are involved in the BRI, presenting huge potential in economic development, Yu said."Connections among these countries and regions have generated increasing demands for the international shipping industry," said Yu.He said SDSC is integrating the resources of cargo owners, financial organizations and ship builders to develop the industry.SDSC also signed on Tuesday cooperation agreements with ICBC Financial Leasing Co Ltd, DNV GL(Det Norske Veritas Germanischer Lloyd), China Classification Society and Bunge Ltd.
