                The Leticia Amazon Pact promises to be the strongest international effort so far to combat Amazon fires and guard the environment. Signed by delegates from seven of the nine countries with Amazon rainforests this past weekend, the covenant aims to coordinate the governments' efforts to fight deforestation, illegal mining and destructive fires. The delegates gathered in Leticia, a town in the south of Colombia on the border with Brazil. The presidents of Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador attended the summit, as well as Suriname's vice president and Guyana's natural resource minister. The meeting was hosted by Colombian President Ivan Duque. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, recovering from surgery, could not be there in person but was represented by the Foreign Ministry. To many people in the region, the seven are aiming for fresh start for the Amazon amid international criticism. "It is first and foremost a political response to the global outcry about the current emergency that the Amazon region is suffering," said Isabel Cavelier, director of vision at Transforma, an environmental consultancy in Bogota, Colombia. " (This is) a pact that obliges us, commits us and motivates us to protect our Amazon. To do prevention, mitigation, care work, when we have risks or when there are also forest fires," said the Colombian president during the summit. Colombia is the third-largest site of Amazon rainforests, behind Peru and Brazil. Meanwhile, new satellite images published on Monday by the European Space Agency show an increase in air pollution in the Brazilian Amazon while fires burned in the region last month. Several maps showed more carbon monoxide and other pollutants in August than in the previous month, when there were fewer fires. The agency said fires released carbon dioxide once stored in the Amazon forests back into the atmosphere, potentially having an impact on the global climate and health. Burning continues in the Amazon despite a 60-day ban on land-clearing fires that was announced last month by Brazil's Bolsonaro. Data from Brazil's National Institute for Space Research showed the number of fires in all of Brazil has surpassed 100,000 so far this year, up 45 percent compared to the same period in 2018.

                Editor's note: This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.On Sept 11, 2001, Beijing Jiaotong University introduced an e-commerce course, becoming one of the first 13 colleges to set up such a major. The Ministry of Education said the new major aimed to meet the surging demand for talent in the booming e-commerce market.E-commerce is now a major driver of China's retail economy, accounting for almost one-fifth of the country's total retail sales last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.The number of internet users has surged to 830 million last year from 620,000 in 1997.Of them, 610 million shopped online.China is also home to Alibaba, one of the world's leading e-trade businesses, which is bigger than eBay and Amazon combined in terms of sales.Meanwhile, the country's cross-border e-commerce sector has been growing exponentially over the past few years, as demand from the country's middle-income shoppers is becoming increasingly diversified and personalized.China's cross-border e-commerce has also grown remarkably. Last year, the total volume of retail import and export commodities through the customs cross-border e-commerce management platform surged by 50 percent year-on-year to 134 billion yuan ($19 billion), with exports up 67 percent to 56 billion yuan.Many e-commerce giants have been seeking to bolster efforts to cater to local demand for quality products from abroad.This month, Alibaba announced that it has acquired NetEase Kaola, the cross-border e-commerce platform of NetEase, for $2 billion.In 2017, Shanghai Zhenhua Foreign Trade Professional School and Shanghai Sipo Polytechnic launched a pilot major in cross-border e-commerce. The major is designed to help students develop skills required by the cross-border e-commerce industry.In June, cross-border e-commerce was officially listed as one of the 46 new majors at secondary schools.

                BEIJING - China's cloud infrastructure services market grew rapidly in the second quarter of 2019, according to a report by global technology market research firm Canalys.Total spending on cloud infrastructure services surged 58 percent year-on-year to $2.3 billion in Q2, the report said.Chinese organizations, particularly startups, government agencies and enterprises, have become more ambitious in growing their digital capabilities to capture opportunities in the country's massive internet and mobile-based consumer market, said Canalys research analyst Daniel Liu."The Chinese cloud market is just at the initial stage of growth," Liu told Xinhua. "Cloud projects in such fields as internet, videos, smart cities and big data have kept expanding."Competition is becoming more intense, with major cloud service providers investing aggressively in their market presence, according to the report.Alibaba Cloud remained the dominant cloud service provider, as its sales accounted for 43 percent of the market in Q2 with a year-on-year growth of 47 percent, the report said.Sales of Tencent Cloud grew by 88 percent in Q2, while those of Amazon Web Services and Baidu AI Cloud rose 48 percent and 92 percent, respectively, the report showed.
