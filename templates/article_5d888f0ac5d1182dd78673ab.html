                China's rise has paved the way to global peace
            </p>
            <p>
                On Oct 1, the People's Republic of China will celebrate the 70th anniversary of its founding. There will be a grand ceremony in Beijing and many other places in the country. The rest of the world is also watching China, expecting contributions as a significant global stakeholder. Similarly, the great challenge before China is how to address and accommodate these expectations from the global community.Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, China has made historical achievements, particularly in domestic reform and presenting China as a responsible world stakeholder. The Belt and Road Initiative is one such program initiated by China to build a comprehensive global platform to harness multiple levers of cooperation and accommodate the Chinese dream with the dreams of the rest of the world. This means making the world a better, safer place for human beings. Xi formally describes this with the term "Community of Shared Future for Mankind."Developing countries like Nepal have a positive perspective on China's rise and achievement. By formally signing onto the BRI framework, now Nepali and Chinese officials are working very closely on specific projects like railway connectivity, which will enhance ties not just between Nepal and China, but also China and South Asia. Nepal could serve as a dynamic bridge between China and South Asia, becoming a regional hub if Nepali policymakers plan and implement related agreements and understanding with China seriously.When we look back on the history of the two nations, Nepal Prime Minister B.P. Koirala and Chairman Mao Zedong had already shared thoughts on building more connectivity and cooperation between two nations in March 1960. There is no doubt that if the right environment is created, Nepal can attract Chinese assistance, investments, technologies and tourists. Professor Liu Jirong of International Trade and Finance at Leshan Normal University, an expert on Nepal-China affairs, said he has seen great possibilities for tangible cooperation between two nations, but to avoid delays Nepal should clarify its priorities and interests.At many conferences and forums over the last three years, I asked experts from around the world their views on the BRI and China's achievements. I found China has many true friends in the world now and her role and stand is also increasing with her strength. One common view was China needs to enhance its global role to contribute to peace and development.China has augmented multiple efforts to contribute to international peace and development via comprehensive dialogue and deliberate communication. From the Middle East to Africa, climate change and piracy, China's role is being recognized and appreciated. Other powers also need to take a more realistic approach and rational position if they want to make the world a better place.At the G20 meeting held in Osaka, Japan in June, Xi clearly put forward views on China's further opening-up and the significance of high-quality development. He assured the world community China will further open up and expand imports and exports while improving the business environment. In the same month, China released its two revised negative lists for foreign investment access, easing restrictions in agriculture, mining and manufacturing. In March China released its first Foreign Investment Law, which will take effect on Jan 1. This shows China is firmly committed to make the global arena suitable for cooperation. Professor Su Hao of China Foreign Affairs University opined China is not just boasting about further opening-up but is taking concrete steps to open its market wider to foreign investment and build an open world economy.Due to the protectionism and unilateralist policies of the Donald Trump administration in the US, the world is facing some financial difficulties. But on the other hand, China has a clear vision of opening up and taking reasonable measures to counter US action and contribute to the rest of the world. Chinese efforts are stabilizing the global market and financial order.With 70 years since the founding of the PRC, China must make new commitments to the nation and the rest of the world at large. As a powerful country, China should harness its role and contribute pragmatically to global peace and development. China's peaceful path of development supports global and regional cooperation, and will ultimately help fulfill the global dream. The global community wishes for China's further prosperity and increasing responsibility in the internal and external spheres.Dr. Buddhi Prasad Sharma is an associate professor at Leshan Normal University and a senior research fellow at the Center for Trans-Himalaya Studies.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                Visitors met with local people and toured training and religious facilitiesAmbassadors and envoys from seven countries visited the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region from Aug 19 to 21 at the invitation of the regional government.The diplomats - from Laos, Cambodia, the Philippines, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bahrain and Nigeria - visited the cities of Urumqi and Turpan to get a firsthand view of the region's economic and social development.They gave a positive evaluation of the central government's efforts in promoting local economic development and improving people's livelihoods, safeguarding freedom of religious belief, as well as combating and preventing terrorism in accordance with the law, saying the successful development of Xinjiang has been noteworthy.Xinjiang is a key battlefield in the fight against terrorism and extremism in China. For a long time, the "three forces" of terrorism, separatism and extremism, both at home and abroad, have plotted and organized thousands of violent terrorist activities, which have gravely damaged the stability, solidarity and progress of Xinjiang, trampling on the basic human rights of the people in the region to life, health, property and development.

                Indian moon mission suffers setback
            </a>
            <p>
                India had been over the moon, as it were, preparing to celebrate a historic feat.Instead, contact was lost with spacecraft Chandrayaan-2 moments before its Vikram module was to make a soft landing on the moon in the early hours of Sunday.Kailasavadivoo Sivan, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation, or ISRO, said on Sunday afternoon that his agency had managed to locate the lander, Xinhua News Agency reported.The spacecraft managed to shoot a thermal image of the lander on surface of the moon, media reports quoted him as saying.By press time, the lander's condition was yet to be ascertained.On Sunday morning, he was quoted as saying that the descent had gone "as planned and normal performance was observed till the altitude of 2.1 kilometers".Contact was then lost between the control room in India's southern metropolis of Bangalore and the spacecraft 384,400 kilometers away.The first words of consolation came from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was at the tracking center to witness the final moments of the lander's scheduled descent. "In life, there are ups and downs. ... You have served the country well and served science and humanity well," Modi was quoted by local media as saying.Launched July 22, the unmanned Chandrayaan-2 was India's chance to become fourth country to land a craft on the moon, following Russia, the United States and China. It intended to accomplish the first soft landing in the moon's south polar region.Most importantly, analysts said, the failure denied the country a rare opportunity to search for water and minerals, and also explore minerals such as magnesium, ion and, importantly, helium. The technology of the spacecraft was 100 percent India-made and cost roughly $150 million.Had the soft landing been successful, the landing module's Rover may have helped to solve the country's energy needs, according to a former ISRO scientist. "It could help bring helium-3 which is in abundance on the moon. The moon can become our one and only savior by meeting all the energy needs on Earth," Arup Dasgupta said.Sandip Chakrabarti, director at the Indian Centre for Space Physics, said that the ISRO is still a powerful space agency.Despite its current setback, India became the first Asian country to send an orbiter around Mars on May 5. It also has several ambitious space programs lined up.Chakrabarti said that the ISRO has the potential to generate funds through commercial ventures.Asked how India measured up to other countries boasting advanced space technologies, Chakrabarti said: "R&D in India is the weakest compared to the countries with strong space programs. Unless India strengthens R&D, it will be difficult to compete with China and other countries in the long run."He said Chandrayaan-2 is doing what NASA did more than 50 years ago and China did by sending Chang'e 4, a robotic spacecraft mission to the moon in January this year.Better engines According to him, India needs to have better engines and rockets similar to Falcon of the US or Long March of China." (India's) missions are cheaper, but that cannot be the only criterion for winning the race. It must have a solid manned program. In this, China is also well ahead," Chakrabarti said.He said if India wants to have a space station, manned missions must become routine. However, he does not foresee India having such a capability in the next few decades.The country has planned to send a mission to study the sun in 2019-20, a second mission to Mars in 2022-23 and a Venus mission in 2023. It will also attempt to send astronauts to space on a spacecraft in 2022.New Delhi-based electrical engineer Prasun Dutta said the ISRO deserves appreciation for contributing to the socio-economic development of people as well. "Many of ISRO's space programs are integral to (India's) essential needs and national development," he said.He said ISRO's satellites provide nationwide connectivity in terms of voice and data communication. The country's space agency has launched programs such as telemedicine which network remotely located rural medical facilities to super specialty hospitals in big cities, Dutta said.Satellite-based weather monitoring and warning system is of immense importance in a country where agriculture, a sector which provides livelihood to millions of people in rural segment but is still critically dependent on the vagaries of nature."ISRO's sensing satellites provide realistic data of India's land, surface water, ground water, forest and biological resources as inputs to policymaking for governmental authorities," he said.Dutta added that the ISRO's disaster management support program provides space-based inputs which help in management and control of disasters like flood, cyclone, earthquake, forest fire, not only in India but also a few other countries.Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, distinguished fellow and head of the Nuclear & Space Policy Initiative at the Observer Research Foundation, said India's space explorations had positive implications beyond its borders.India launched the first South Asian satellite to enhance communication channels and improve disaster links for its neighbors: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.The author is a freelancer for China Daily.

                A home away from home
            </a>
            <p>
                From city to seaside, or mountain to prairie, a growing number of Chinese tourists from a diverse range of ages and backgrounds are enjoying a wide variety of homestays and bed & breakfasts that are springing up all over the country.Courtyard hotel offers cultural haven"Let us provide an exquisite experience of ancient China with a contemporary flair," says Li Jin, 50, a local Beijing entrepreneur who manages a luxury boutique hotel in the capital's downtown.Located within Beijing's Second Ring Road in Weijia Hutong, Dongcheng district, the Cours et Pavillons Hotel is a little hard to find thanks to its low-key entrance.But after being greeted by one of the butlers, guests will be able to take in the hotel's unique ambience, its traditional Chinese architectural style and its exquisite attention to detail.Entering the courtyard, visitors can't help but notice two large ceramic goldfish ponds decorated in the lustrous blue glaze of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) style. In one of the hotel rooms, a beautiful antique carpet imported from Nepal around 150 years old adorns the floor.In the same room, sits a table made from a precious wood dating back to the Qing Dynasty. Most importantly, these objects are not just decorations or historical relics put on display-they are actually there to be used by the guests.The hotel lobby serves afternoon tea while the restaurant provides French cuisine."Our hotel is a perfect mixture of Chinese and Western cultures," Li, the general manager of the hotel says. "I love travel and have been to many European countries, which made me believe that the beauty of history-no matter whether it is Chinese or Western-is something we all have in common."
