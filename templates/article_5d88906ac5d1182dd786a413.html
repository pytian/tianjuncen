                While some US corporations are diversifying their supply chains and moving operations from China to avoid tariffs, Nike Inc will expand its operations in the Asian economic powerhouse, which it sees as a growing consumer market for US companies, a top executive of the footwear giant told China Daily."We are super excited about our prospects in greater China, and we are just grateful for an economy that is growing, and consumers that are passionate about our brand. I think a government that wants to facilitate growth is a good thing," Sean O'Hollaren, senior vice-president of government and public affairs at Nike said on the sideline of the 9th Oregon-China Economic Forum, an event organized by Oregon China Council on Friday.O'Hollaren expressed cautious optimism as Chinese and US negotiators prepare to meet again next week in Shanghai for trade talks, noting that the world's two largest economies have built extensive business and commercial ties with each other."I am confident that we can address our issues if we not only look at what we need to do, but how we do it," he said.Nike has operated in China for 35 years, O'Hollaren said. It employs more than 8,000 people directly in its Shanghai headquarters and Taicang Distribution Center. It also hires 40,000 people in its partner stores and another 145,000 in its supplier base.Sales in China grew 24 percent last year to $6.5 billion last year, the company's highest rate of global growth.With an eye toward attracting digitally-savvy younger Chinese consumers, the sneakers mammoth last year unveiled a House of Innovation on Nanjing East Road in Shanghai, which provides consumers with a personalized and digitally-integrated shopping experience.In addition to expanding its headquarters for greater China in Shanghai, Nike announced it would spend $100 million on its new logistics facility in Taicang, Jiangsu province, in January. It also renewed its contract as a sponsor for Shanghai International Marathon."We are doing more, not less, the market is blooming, and we hope to continue to fuel the passion for sports in China," he said.Nike's growth in China supports job creation in the United States, O'Hollaren said. It also allows the company to develop new ideas and expand new markets, he added.According to Portland Business Journal, the sportswear retailer employed 12,000 people locally in 2017. 2018 revenue for Nike surpassed $39.1 billion according to its fiscal 2018 fourth quarter report, released at the end of June.Nike is among the more than 170 footwear companies in the US that penned a letter to the Trump administration this May, urging it to reconsider its latest tariff on shoes made in China.The Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, which represents the brands, estimated that the additional tariffs would cost US customers an additional $7 billion per year.If the trade war continues for a long time, US consumers will ultimately be the ones footing the bill, O'Hollaren stressed."At the end of the day, it's not companies who are going to be punished. It's the consumers," he said.

I think a government that wants to facilitate growth is a good thing," Sean O'Hollaren, senior vice-president of government and public affairs at Nike, said on the sidelines Friday of the ninth Oregon-China Economic Forum, an event organized by the Oregon China Council.O'Hollaren expressed careful optimism as Chinese and American negotiators prepare to meet again this week in Shanghai for trade talks, noting that the world's two largest economies have built extensive business and commercial ties with each other."I am confident that we can address our issues if we not only look at what we need to do, but how we do it," he said.Nike has operated in China for 35 years, O'Hollaren said. It employs more than 8,000 people in its Shanghai Headquarters and Taicang Distribution Center. It also hires 40,000 people in its partner stores and another 145,000 in its supplier base.The Beaverton, Oregon based company grew its business in China by 24 percent last year to $6.5 billion in sales.With an eye toward attracting digitally savvy, younger Chinese consumers, the sneaker mammoth last year unveiled a House of Innovation on Nanjing East Road in Shanghai, which provides consumers with a personalized and digitally integrated shopping experience.In addition to expanding its headquarters for Greater China in Shanghai, Nike announced the allocation of $100 million to its new logistics facility in Taichang, Jiangsu province, in January. It also renewed its contract as a sponsor for the Shanghai International Marathon."We are doing more, not less; the market is blooming, and we hope to continue to fuel the passion for sports in China," he said.According to the Portland Business Journal, the sportswear retailer employed 12,000 people locally in 2017. The full-year revenue for Nike tops $39.1 billion, according to its fiscal quarterly report, released at the end of June."Our production in China not only benefits consumers, but also enhances our ability to innovate and support high-quality jobs in the United States," O'Hollaren said.Nike is among the more than 170 leading footwear companies in the US that wrote a letter to the Trump administration in May, urging it to reconsider its latest tariffs on shoes made in China.The Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, which represents the brands, estimated that the additional tariffs would cost US customers $7 billion more per year.If the trade war continues for a long time, American consumers will ultimately be the ones footing the bill, O'Hollaren stressed."At the end of the day, it's not companies who are going to be punished, it's the consumers, and they are going to have less choices, and higher prices, and that's not good for their income," he said.Blaming China has become popular politically because it gives politicians someone to point to for the slump of good middle class jobs in the US."Maybe people are understandably concerned about the future and the ability to get a good job and earn a decent wage. It's easy to blame trade for this anxiety, but there are many other more important factors. At the top of the list is technology, which allows companies to produce more output with fewer workers," he said."Protectionism is not the answer. Even if the US imposed a 100 percent tariff on all products coming from China, relatively little manufacturing would return to the US. It may leave China, but it's unlikely to come back here," O'Hollaren added."China owns more than 35 percent of the US debt held by foreigners, but this uncertainty is pushing China to look for ways to diversify its investment away from the dollar. Why on earth would we want to incentivize diversification away from the dollar?" O'Hollaren asked. "The more our economies are interconnected, the less likely we are to take actions that will hurt each other's interests."

                Skateboarding is thriving now, but it's taken the hard work of dedicated and bruised practitioners to build up momentum, Xing Wen reports.A low rumble, punctuated by the rhythmic "click, click, click" caused by the grouting between paving slabs. A scrape, a sharp "CLACK", silence, and a clatter, followed by the return of that monotonous rumble… It's a soundtrack heard on nearly every street in almost every corner of the world.It is the music of defiance and rebellion, of freedom and youth. It's a song that parents hate and that evokes dollar signs in the minds of osteopathic doctors.Yet, in Tokyo next year, it will be one of the loudest played pieces in the concerto of the Summer Olympics. Skateboarding has finally arrived on the biggest stage in the world-and China is looking for a front-row seat.These days, young people skateboarding wherever the street furniture forms ramps, bumps, rails and ledges may be common-along with hearing slang terms like "lock in" and "drop in"-but, the development of skating culture in China is a 30-year story.

                Coach Li cautious about sacrificing height to adapt to modern gameSize still matters for Team China. That's the message from the host squad as it looks to adapt to basketball's ever-quickening evolution ahead of the forthcoming FIBA World Cup.With the so-called small-ball style speeding up the game and tending to favor shorter, more agile players, China head coach Li Nan remains reluctant to sacrifice height in pursuit of the latest tactical trends."I think our strength is still our size under the rim, although we don't have a dominant force like we did in the past when we had Yao Ming as our backbone," said Li at a Nike event in Beijing on Thursday to unveil China's new jersey for the tournament."I believe our post players are still among the best in the world and that we need to play them in the right way to maximize their performance," added Li, who was a member of the Yao-led Chinese team which finished eighth at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.With Yao now a keen spectator from the sidelines as chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association, it's left to former NBA players Yi Jianlian and Zhou Qi as well as Wang Zhelin, the Memphis Grizzlies' second-round pick in the 2016 draft, to collectively try and fill the great man's sizable shoes.The smooth shooting, mobility and defensive stretch of the three big men, although not quite up to NBA standards, can help make China more competitive in the modern game, where transition offense dictates play and zone defense make traditional post-ups in the paint nearly impossible."Playing stretch fours and even stretch fives has become a new trend internationally, and I think talent-wise we have the ingredients to adapt to the style. It just depends on if we can get the best out of them," said Li.The 32-team FIBA World Cup, formerly the world championships, will run from Aug 31-Sept 15 in eight Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.Drawn in Group A with Cote d'Ivoire, Poland and Venezuela at west Beijing's Wukesong Arena, Team China has targeted reaching the quarterfinals and qualifying for next year's Tokyo Olympics as the best Asian performer.The rise of big-yet-versatile NBA players from overseas, such as the Denver Nuggets' play-making center Nikola Jokic of Serbia and the Milwaukee Bucks' 'Greek Feak' Giannis Antetokounmpo, pose a threat to the United States' traditional dominance at the tournament.Speaking at the Nike event as a brand ambassador, NBA legend Scottie Pippen expects the World Cup to be an intensive showcase of the new game."I see it as a new trend … I like the word position-less," said the 53-year-old, who was Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls wingman and was on the USA's 1992 Olympic champion Dream Team."The game is different now. There are no big centers blocking in the lane. Guys are not playing in the traditional way of throwing the ball inside and cutting. It's a faster game, it's an outside game and it's a shooter's game."One big concern for China is how quickly veteran forward Yi can get up to speed following a three-month ankle injury layoff.Yi, the only member of the 2008 Games squad on the current roster, officially made his comeback for China in Saturday's 73-62 victory over Angola in Kunshan, Jiangsu province.After representing five different NBA teams since being drafted by Milwaukee sixth overall in 2007, Yi returned home in 2016 and led the Guangdong Southern Tigers to their ninth CBA title in May."Physically, I feel just fine. I just have to figure out how I can fit in smoothly and communicate better with the others as quickly as possible," said Yi, who contributed 10 points and seven rebounds in his 20-minute run-out against the Angolans.Asked what his expectations are for China at the Cup, the 31-year-old replied: "I hope we can at least equal our national team's best result (eighth place in 2008) this time and leave a legacy for the next decade."

                    Localization vital cog in Nike's expansion strategy in China

                Sportswear brand's push beyond metros, sneaker event herald market growthUS sportswear maker Nike is testing market potential of Chinese cities beyond Beijing and Shanghai. It believes localization as a strategy in China will help the brand better present itself to the whole world.It opened Nike Jordan, its basketball brand's flagship shop, in Xiamen. It is the first Jordan shop in Fujian province.Dong Wei, vice-president of Nike Inc, said the decision to set up the store in Xiamen was shaped by the city's stature as the economic and cultural center of Fujian that can support the growth of a mature sportswear industry."Xiamen boasts a mature commercial environment," said Dong. "As a relatively small city, it has over 80 million tourists coming from the whole world. Plus, there are many local sports brands in Xiamen, building a solid foundation in business environment for sports brands."As for Nike Jordan's business blueprint in China, she said first-tier cities like Shanghai and Beijing were merely a beginning. The brand is looking to expand into more second-tier cities to "get in touch with more consumers".By now, young Chinese consumers have gotten used to e-commerce and are able to buy goods basically from any city online. Hence, offline shops no longer limit themselves to selling products. They also provide customized service and experiences of the basketball culture, which are new growth points for brick-and-mortar stores, Dong said.China has proved to be the fastest-growing market where Jordan has achieved double-digit growth, according to the company's 2018-19 financial report.Eric So, general manager of Jordan China, said the brand will accelerate its pace of opening more shops in China, in line with its rapid development in the Chinese market so far.Dong said through localization in the Chinese market, Nike will draw inspiration to develop a stronger and competitive edge in the global market."Since the earlier '80s, we have been building close relations with Chinese consumers, no matter if they are athletes or sports lovers," she said. "Localization is bringing more contributions to the product design aspects. As the company has gained more inspiration from Chinese elements, it can bring better products to global consumers."China's growing sneaker market in cities beyond metros has attracted the attention of other brands too. In May, Sneaker Con, one of the biggest sneaker exhibitions of the world, was held in Shanghai for the first time. Over 20,000 visitors made it to the three-day event.Ma Xiaofei, CEO of Endeavor, which organized the exhibition, said the event came about after efforts over 10 years. This year's event proved the timing was just right.After the success in Shanghai, Endeavor is planning to hold more Sneaker Con events in China, at least three times a year. It said it hopes to attract 30,000 visitors to each event."If one visitor makes one purchase during the event, there will be at least 90,000 purchases made each year. There are at least five Chinese cities capable of supporting that level of purchases each year," Ma said.
