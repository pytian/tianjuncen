                Consumer spend on high-quality and paid digital content witnesses steady growthZhang Zixuan, 27, a middle school teacher in Beijing, loves reading romantic books on her mobile phone app - WeChat Read. She has downloaded 15 books, and usually reads for one hour each day through the app."It is convenient for me to use in my spare time. I also listen to audio books through Ximalaya, a popular audio sharing platform, before I go to sleep, and spend money on programs I like," said Zhang, adding that she has paid 208 yuan ($29.5) for a one-year membership fee for the platform.Zhang is among the millions of Chinese citizens who are willing to pay for online publications. With the improvement of copyright protection awareness in China, the number of people who spend money on digital paid content such as audio, video, social networking, live broadcasting, games and music, has been increasing every year.China's digital reading market hit 25.45 billion yuan last year, up 19.6 percent year-on-year, with the number of Chinese citizens who read digital publications rising to 432 million, according to a report by the China Audio-Video and Digital Publishing Association.The report said an average of 12.4 digital publications were read per person in 2018, with each person spending an average of 71.3 minutes on each read. About 66.4 percent of the readers said they were willing to pay for online publications, and nearly 70 percent confirmed that the content quality has improved.Moreover, people aged between 14 and 18 spent more time on e-reading overall, while those aged between 25 and 30 read an average of 13.22 digital publications last year, higher than the average figure.China Literature Ltd, a leading online literature platform in the country, is ramping up its efforts in online paid reading services, as reading via mobile phone apps has become one of the most important channels for people to gain information."The content offered to readers for free is often of low quality, while the paid services concentrate on high-quality content. Currently, the free reading and paid reading continue to exist side by side," said Wu Wenhui, co-CEO of China Literature.Wu said there are still some pirate websites in the market, which earn advertising revenue by providing free reading services, although some websites have increased the purchase of copyrights since last year.China Literature, which has Tencent as its shareholder and strategic partner, distributes its content via the mobile QQ app, QQ browser, WeChat Reading, Tencent News and Tencent Video.The company monetizes its vast and proprietary content library through online paid reading and content adaptations for a variety of entertainment formats. Its diverse and high-quality content library is a significant competitive advantage that lies at the core of its business model, according to Wu.According to China Literature, more than 70 percent of mobile digital readers are aged below 26, with the post-90s generation accounting for 42 percent. Among the paid users, the post-90s account for 43 percent, with an average annual payment of 80 yuan, which is much higher than other age groups.Wu explained that compared with the post-80s generation, the post-90s generation has more leisure time and greater demand for mobile reading apps and content. He believes that the post-90s generation, who grew up in a relatively relaxing material and spiritual environment, have two major consumption capacities."They have immediate consumption capacity, and great potential to become the core consumer group who favor paid reading services in the future."As of Dec 31, 2018, the company had 7.7 million writers and 11.2 million online literary works, covering over 200 genres and reaching millions of readers."At present, more and more white-collar workers, college students and other young groups pay more attention to personal development under the existing material conditions, so they have greater willingness to pay for what they read and accept such kind of consumption patterns," said Huang Guofeng, an analyst at Beijing-based internet consultancy Analysys.Huang said the paid reading model should be based on user demand and application scenarios. "As the same content can't meet the needs of all people, we must differentiate the targeted readers."Liu Xin, general manager of Migu Co Ltd, China Mobile's entertainment content subsidiary, said with advantages of low latency, high reliability and wide bandwidth, technologies like 5G will bring about unprecedented opportunities for the digital reading industry and enhance readers' reading experience.Liu said the combination of 5G wireless technology with big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and the internet of things will expand the application space and scenarios of digital reading."The integration of digital reading with virtual reality, augmented reality, games, audio and video will allow reading to become more vivid and offer readers an immersive experience."

                Film and TV industry has much to learn on merchandising business
            </a>
            <p>
                China is riding high in the film and television merchandise business but facing challenges, industry insiders said at a recent forum.The fourth forum on online dispute resolution and movie merchandise development and protection was held in Beijing in July.Film and television merchandising has seen rapid growth in the country. Among the successes, Monkey King: Hero is Back - an animation hit loosely adapted from the 16th century novel Journey to the West - earned more than 10 million yuan ($1.42 million) on the first day of its derivatives' sales in 2015.Another animated fantasy Big Fish & Begonia sold merchandise worth more than 50 million yuan in 2016. In 2017, the fantasy romance movie Once Upon a Time, starring high-profile actors, saw its merchandise sales surpass 300 million yuan.Chinese animated cartoon brand Boonie Bears, which has spawned TV shows and films, sold merchandise worth 2.5 billion yuan by May 2018.According to an expert, the merchandise of global sci-fi hit The Wandering Earth has an 8 billion yuan market.Yet China's emerging merchandise business has yet to fill in some gaps when compared with their mature foreign counterparts, experts said."Research showed that in Europe, the United States and Japan, movie-based products account for as much as 70 percent of total film revenue, with the other 30 percent coming from box office grosses," Lang Guimei, a judge of the Supreme People's Court, said at the forum."But in China, most revenue still comes from the box office and the proportion generated by merchandises is low," Lang noted.The judge added that Hollywood movie-based toys earned $5.7 billion in 2016, equivalent to 85 percent of China's total box office revenue in 2015.Disney has made a pretty penny from its 2013 hit Frozen - it sold 3 million Elsa and Anna role-play dresses in North America, which helped it earn $4.5 billion, exceeding the amount garnered from domestic box office.This year, the international sales of Lion King merchandises totaled 8 billion yuan.The development of the domestic merchandising business is constrained by copyright piracy, said She Yinbin, editor-in-chief of the children's channel at the Tencent video animation center.She cited the cartoon series Super BOOMi as an example. After it was broadcast on Tencent Video and other platforms, pirated merchandise, including toys, phone cases and T-shirts, appeared on e-commerce platforms. So far, Tencent Video has tackled 282 kinds of pirated goods."Aside from copyright infringement, there are many other problems to solve, including a short life cycle of merchandise and a shortage of professionals," said Yan Bo, deputy director of IP and legal affairs office at State broadcaster China Central Television.Yan added that though The Wandering Earth has performed well at the box office, its merchandise sales have lagged. This is because filmmakers didn't consider merchandising until the movie was screened. Merchandising design should have been done before or simultaneously with the film's release, she said."Propelled by current demand from the market and investors, as well as incentive policies, the domestic film and television merchandise business will prosper," said Luo Man, deputy head of the intellectual property division of the Beijing Chaoyang District People's Court. She added that the Ministry of Finance also encourages the market expansion of films' derivatives and provides a policy guarantee for the industry.yinruowei@chinadaily.com.cn(China Daily 08/08/2019 page17)

                China's talent has Small thinking big
            </a>
            <p>
                MLB executive says schools are key to growing the domestic gameThe next big thing for Major League Baseball's initiative in China is to get more youngsters to put on gloves and pick up bats."One of the things we're working on is a much broader schools initiative," Jim Small, senior vice-president of MLB's international business, said in Beijing on Saturday."Instead of 180 schools, how can we get into a thousand schools? How do we build a broader base of kids playing baseball in China? I think that's the next big thing for us," added Small, who was attending the MLB Experience carnival and exchanged gifts with Dong Zheng, general manager of Chinese Super League Co Ltd, which has partnered with MLB in charity activities nationwide.On the question of expanding MLB's Development Centers to other parts of the country, Small is cautious."We're not sure yet. We're going through that now, because we don't know if we need more DCs," said the 57-year-old American, who was deeply involved with baseball development in China as early as 10 years ago when he was president of MLB Asia-Pacific."We think we need more grassroots programs to get more players for the three existing DCs. We want a funnel to bring more kids to the current DCs. We don't need more DCs, we just need a deeper talent pool from which to choose."If we get more kids into the current system, that might be enough - but we haven't ruled out more DCs. We are just going through a process to determine our best course of action."Small said last week's launch of a domestic professional league is a big step in the right direction."Having a pro league in China is really important. It's another step on the ladder ... and we're working at the top of that ladder," he said."We now have seven players from the DCs signed to pro contracts in the US, and we are working with the national team. We are working with the grassroots, getting more kids to play at schools. What was missing until now was a strong professional league."Some kids here might one day play in MLB, but they can also play for pro teams in China. That's important."We want to create heroes - and sometimes those heroes are going to be here in Beijing, not necessarily in Los Angeles or New York. Having a Chinese pro league is a big step on that ladder."Since MLB established its first DC at Dongbeitang Middle School in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, seven graduates have signed with MLB clubs - Xu Guiyuan (Baltimore Orioles), Gong Haicheng (Pittsburgh Pirates), Qiangbarenzeng (Boston Red Sox), Wang Yang (Philadelphia Phillies), Zhao Lun, Yin Jian and Kou Yongkang (all with the Milwaukee Brewers).Small is pleasantly surprised by the success of the DC program."We have graduated about 70 players from the academy, and seven of them are playing in the US; that's 10 percent. That rate of success is unheard of. There are no American schools that have 10 percent of their kids signing up to play professional baseball," he said."That's testament to the quality of athletes in this country. We see Chinese athletes dominating in other non-traditional sports, like track and field, swimming, tennis... so why not baseball?"We know how to build young Chinese men into professional athletes, but I'm almost more proud of our grads who are pursuing other options, either playing college ball in the US or China or playing in China's new domestic league. We have also hired some of them as coaches. The future of baseball in China is going to be led by them."Baseball, which is returning to the Olympics next summer in Tokyo, was last played at the 2008 Beijing Games, when South Korea won gold."Next year's Olympic inclusion is very important, but we really want to work on making it permanent," said Small."If we can work with the World Baseball and Softball Confederation and other organizations to get baseball back in the Olympics on a permanent basis, that will really benefit the game. Money will flow from Olympic organizing committees down to the national federations, and that funding will help grow baseball worldwide."Small said MLB is in talks with the WBSC to see how they can work together."I had a meeting with them in June, and we're going to continue to talk with them to see what we can do together to help keep baseball in the Olympic Games," he said.

                No Chinese nationals among foreign sailors abducted off Cameroon: embassy
            </a>
            <p>
                YAOUNDE -- No Chinese nationals were among the foreign sailors abducted off Cameroon, according to the Chinese embassy to Cameroon, contrarily to an early report by some media speaking of 9 Chinese hostages.According to cross-checked information obtained by the Chinese embassy on Friday, unknown gunmen attacked two foreign cargos in Cameroon waters at 11:10 pm Wednesday local time, and kidnapped a dozen of sailors, none of them were Chinese.The attack took place off the southern Cameroonian port city of Douala by "likely Nigerian pirates", a Cameroonian Navy source told Xinhua. Earlier on Friday, AFP quoted a Douala official as saying that a total of 17 people had been abducted, including "nine Chinese civilian sailors"."The Cameroon navy is conducting a thorough search and rescue mission to secure the safe release of those kidnapped," a senior official of Douala Port Authority, who asked not to be named, told Xinhua.

                League of our own looking to long term
            </a>
            <p>
                Revamped pro competition off to encouraging start as fresh MLB input offers extra hopeWere it not for the sharp crack of the bat, the raucous cheers and drumrolls emanating from Tuanpo Sports Center in Tianjin on Thursday could easily have been mistaken for the noise of a top professional soccer match.To the surprise of media and even the players, nearly 3,000 fans turned up for the opening match of the China National Baseball League's new season－a welcome boost for everyone involved with the sport here."Today the vibe in the stadium was electrifying, making us so nervous but in a good way," said Tianjin Lions' pitcher Du Xiaoci after helping the host beat the Beijing Tigers 3-2 in the opener."For athletes like us playing baseball in China, we've been used to playing with little attention, but the new league gives us a stage and a spotlight that we never imagined we could have before," added the 27-year-old national team member.The revamped four-club league has stepped up to the plate for a third swing at becoming a fully fledged pro program.Originally established in 2002, the competition was suspended in 2011 and 2017 due to a lack of funding and exposure.Now there is renewed hope a partnership between the CNBL and Major League Baseball can make the difference this time around."For any sport aspiring for long-term growth, it's necessary to have a pro league system established on the top for kids to look up to and to aim for," CNBL commissioner Qin Xiaowen said at the signing ceremony for the agreement in Tianjin on Thursday. "Even though we are far off the professional standards set by the MLB, we are optimistic that with their help we can grow our league into a solid component of our pyramid system."The new partnership will see the MLB lend its expertise on league management, talent development, competition operation, marketing and broadcasting."We share the same understanding that a pro league is essential if China is to become a baseball-playing nation," said Jim Small, senior vice-president of the MLB's international business."What we've done is to share the information on how we are set up and how the MLB is operated. From the league standpoint, we've given them some information that we don't share with a lot of people because of the trust we have in China."We also share the best practice when it comes to how to market, how to sell tickets and how to show a baseball game on television－things that will make fans' experience more enjoyable."The goal is to enable the league to stand on its own two feet, without the help of the State-run sports system.Turning this dream into a reality, however, will not be easy.Despite the establishment of a league company encompassing the Chinese Baseball Association and its operating partner, Shougang Sports, the competition still features the same four original teams－Beijing, Tianjin, Guangdong and Jiangsu－from 2002, underlining a degree of stagnancy in terms of the sport's development in China.The four teams will play home and away for 18 rounds over seven weeks before the top two clubs square off in a best-of-five final in late October."Although understaffed at the moment, to keep a league running smoothly is critical for motivating youth to stay in the sport to feed the league with talent in the long run," said Chen Xu, president of the CBA.At grassroots level, the MLB, which established a Beijing office in 2007, has helped cultivate a domestic talent pool through its three development centers in East China's Jiangsu province.Since the first DC opened in Wuxi in 2009, a total of seven Chinese prospects have graduated through the system to sign tryout or minor-league contracts with MLB clubs, including 'Itchy' Xu Guiyuan (with the Baltimore Orioles in 2015) and 'Sea' Gong Haicheng (with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2017).While none of the Chinese prospects have seen MLB action, around 20 have suited up for teams in the CNBL this season.The MLB's help in better identifying the right sort of talent to nurture will be vital, said Kim Ng, a senior vice-president of baseball operations with the league."We also help advising on the scouting side, such as how to look for specific characteristics in players and profile them in who will be able to succeed in the league later on," she said.With the CNBL relaunched and the sport included in the Olympics again at next year's Tokyo Games, baseball is on its way to joining the sports mainstream in China, reckons Small."I am absolutely convinced that everybody in China is a baseball fan and they just don't know it yet," said the 57-year-old.

                Now stop piracy, on the high seas
            </a>
            <p>
                Need for the UN to take lead role, than leave it all on China, the UK and the US Piracy has been an intractable international problem for thousands of years. Indeed, 2,000 years ago as a young man, Julius Caesar was taken hostage by a gang of pirates. After his hefty ransom was paid, and he was released, he later tracked them down and executed them. The recent kidnapping of Chinese ship crews from two vessels, off Cameroon, reminds us that the problem remains. A couple of centuries ago, Britain's Royal Navy led the armed opposition to pirates on the high seas, eventually reducing that maritime threat to life and international trade to a negligible level. Ruthless methods were adopted. The Royal Navy sank as many pirate vessels as it could. Those (pirates) who made an illegal living by violently attacking merchant shipping were violently attacked. The navy even took the fight to the pirates on land, destroying village ports where they were based. Sadly, the scourge of piracy has continued off-and-on, and is today a very real threat to lives and cargoes, particularly in certain regions, such as off the coasts of Africa and Southern Arabia. It is not limited to those areas. It also continues to be a threat around the numerous islands of East Asian countries, such as Malaysia and the Philippines. Several warships from various national navies, including the Chinese, US and British sea powers, have been deployed in these dangerous areas in a bid to eliminate the pirates. But these areas are so large, the passage of commercial shipping so busy, and the pirate ships so numerous, that so far the scourge of piracy remains a dire threat. The European Union's first maritime force provides counter-piracy patrols in some of the areas most infested with pirates. This is of some help in addressing the problem, but those anti-piracy resources are stretched pretty thinly across vast oceans. More - much more needs to be done to wipe out piracy effectively. Sometimes a ship's cargo is simply stolen, or held to ransom. Sometimes the crew members are kidnapped and held to ransom against a threat to their lives, and sometimes both. Unfortunately, in some cases enormous ransom demands of the pirates are paid, thus solving one immediate problem but thereby encouraging more kidnappings from pirates in the future. The International Bureau's Piracy Reporting Centre records a growth in the number of pirate attacks, up from 180 incidents in 2017 to 201 last year. The United Nations' international enforcement efforts have always generated a mixed report-card. Some of their organizations, such as the World Health Organization, achieve much that is good. But when looking at certain other areas where strong UN action could be more effective, such as when combating the illegal narcotics trade, or limiting human trafficking, we can see clearly that the UN has not yet realized its full potential. Piracy puts civilian ships of all nations at risk, and makes being a sailor on a civilian vessel a dangerous occupation. Since all nations face the potential disruption of their imports and exports, including the vital sea transport of their food and energy resources (i.e. oil), they should come together to fight piracy through UN-arranged anti-piracy military measures. It is simply not good enough for countries to leave it to the few, such as to China, Britain and the US, to combat piracy by deploying their warships whilst most countries contribute nothing to the battle. The UN could take the lead in suppressing piracy. A UN-arranged, and UN-led naval task force, made up of warships provided on loan by many more UN countries, should be established. Scores, perhaps hundreds, of naval vessels, would have to be involved to provide more concentrated coverage to vast areas of sea that most badly need to be patrolled. And the rules of engagement should be extended, that pirate ships are blown out of the water on sight. There should be a UN set-up international court to try suspected pirates from anywhere, and impose the death penalty as a deterrent on those who are convicted. Online videos can be viewed of several foolhardy pirate vessels attempting to attack patrolling warships. Any warship under attack from pirates is likely to fire back, with vastly superior gunfire, to make short work of sinking the attacking pirate ships. The proposed UN-led naval task force should deploy warships in greater numbers, and with more wide-ranging patrols, and these should be tasked with shooting at pirate vessels as soon as they can be located. Civilian ships under pirate attack could whistle up a nearby UN warship, if these patrols are expanded widely enough, to come to their aid and rescue them from such attack - preferably by swiftly sinking the pirate ships. China receives a large proportion of its oil needs from the Gulf, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Oman etc. This vital fuel is carried by ship through the Straits of Hormuz; altogether 20 percent of the world's oil passes through that restricted area. Recently, there have been attacks upon passing oil tankers in this area: it remains a matter of debate whether such attacks are conducted by pirates or are state-sponsored operations from a nearby country. Again, having more international warships patrolling that area, to protect passing oil tankers, is something that a UN-led naval task force could provide. Oil-producing countries, such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, which depend on oil sales for a large part of their economy, should contribute more money to help provide this UN-led naval task force protection. And the old wartime skills of arranging convoys, escorted by warships, could be reintroduced, to make shipping safer for all concerned.

                Navy sends its most capable combat ship on escort mission
            </a>
            <p>
                One of the most moving episodes in the Chinese blockbuster Wolf Warrior 2 is the one in which the captain of a Type 052D guided-missile destroyer shouts "Fire!" to order the launch of supersonic cruise missiles to hit rebel troops in an imaginary African nation holding Chinese hostages.However, this scenario could not have happened in real life because in the Gulf of Aden there have been no Type 052D destroyers－now considered the most capable combat ship in the People's Liberation Army Navy.Instead, the Navy has sent other vessels to the once pirate-plagued waters to protect civilian vessels for nearly 11 years.That is about to change, as the Navy has decided to dispatch a Type 052D to take part in its latest escort mission. The CNS Xining, the fifth in the Type 052D class, is sailing toward the Gulf of Aden.The Xining, with the number 117 on its hull, was commissioned in January 2017. It is part of the PLA Navy's 33rd escort flotilla, together with CNS Weifang, a Type 054A guided-missile frigate and CNS Hoh Xil Hu, a Type 903A supply ship. All of the ships belong to the naval force of the PLA Northern Theater Command, known as the North Sea Fleet.The flotilla set sail from a naval base in Qingdao, Shandong province, on Aug 29. It will travel at least 11,000 kilometers before reaching the Gulf of Aden in the next two weeks.A Type 052D destroyer has a standard displacement of 6,300 metric tons, according to the Navy. It carries a wide range of weapons, including a single-barrel 130 mm naval gun, a close-in weapon system, 64 HHQ-9 long-range antiaircraft missiles and YJ-18 or YJ-83 cruise missiles.The vessel uses a host of cutting-edge technologies. The Navy said that the Type 052D destroyer has a stealth design and can act as a flagship for a strike group.It is capable of conducting anti-ship, anti-submarine and air defense operations, and has been described by some Western observers as a "carrier killer".The first Type 052D destroyer, CNS Kunming, joined the Navy in March 2014. The Navy has built at least 17 Type 052Ds and 11 of them are in service, according to military observers who follow the weapons' development of the PLA Navy.The 33rd escort flotilla has more than 600 officers and sailors, including dozens of special operations troops.The Navy began to carry out escort missions in the Gulf of Aden and the waters off Somalia in December 2008. In the past decade, it has sent 106 ships and more than 28,000 naval personnel to escort at least 6,700 Chinese and foreign ships, according to the Navy.
