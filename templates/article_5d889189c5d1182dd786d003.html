                Scottish Conservative leader Davidson quits, citing Brexit and family
            </p>
            <p>
                LONDON - Ruth Davidson quit as leader of the Conservative Party in Scotland on Thursday, saying she could no longer juggle the demands of being a politician with family life and suggesting she would no longer stand as a politician in 2021.The 40-year-old led a resurgence of the Conservatives in Scotland during her eight years in charge, providing a counterweight to Nicola Sturgeon's Scottish National Party and winning key seats to help the party retain power in Westminster.Davidson, who had backed Remain in the 2016 European Union referendum, said she would continue to support the party, the prime minister and Scotland's place in the United Kingdom."I fear that having tried to be a good leader over the years, I have proved a poor daughter, sister, partner and friend," she said in a letter to the chairman of the Scottish party.Reuters

                Apple to shift Mac Pro production to China from US: report
            </a>
            <p>
                Apple will manufacture its new Mac Pro computer in China, shifting the production of its only major device assembled in the US to China, according to The Wall Street Journal on Friday.The tech giant is working with contractor Quanta Computer to assemble the Mac Pro and aims to increase production at a factory near Shanghai, which can help reduce shipping costs with Apple's other suppliers in China, the report said.An Apple spokesman said, "the new Mac Pro is designed and engineered in California and includes components from several countries including the United States", and "final assembly is only one part of the manufacturing process", Reuters reported.By the end of March, Apple earned about 18 percent of its total revenue from Greater China, and China is both a key market and a major production center for Apple.The previous Mac Pro model, released in 2013, was assembled in the US.But when Apple began to make the computer in its plant in Austin, Texas, it struggled to find enough screws, according to a previous New York Times report, and the company had to order screws from China for mass production."Relative to the US, manufacturing in China remains a lower-cost alternative and benefits from an existing infrastructure, versus having to, potentially, rebuild one in the US," Tom Forte, an analyst at DA Davidson, was quoted as saying by Reuters.

                US House passes 2-year budget deal to raise spending, suspend debt ceiling
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - US House passed a budget deal Thursday that will boost overall spending levels and suspend the federal debt ceiling for the next two years.The agreement, struck between the White House and Congress in a bipartisan fashion Monday, covers fiscal years 2020 and 2021, and would raise overall spending levels by $320 billion above the strict limits set in 2011.It would also suspend the federal debt ceiling until July 31, 2021, preventing the United States from defaulting on its payment obligations. The Treasury Department has estimated that a potential default could have happened as soon as early September.The passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 in the House by a vote of 284-149 came one day before lawmakers in the chamber leave town for the summer recess."This agreement was reached and it will meet the needs of the people whom we are honored to represent," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as she advocated the passage of the bill during a debate before lawmakers cast their votes. The Democratic congresswoman led the Congress in negotiating the deal with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who represents the administration in the talks.The Senate's recess starts on Aug 2, giving the upper chamber additional time to vote on the measure. If passed by the Senate, the proposed bill will be sent to President Donald Trump's desk for signature.Trump tweeted earlier in the day urging House Republicans to support the deal, which is not yet a law until the president signs on it. Trump applauded the agreement, saying it "greatly helps our Military and our Vets."Representing a significant bipartisan compromise, the bill will see the budget cap for discretionary spending rise to $1.37 trillion in 2020 and $1.375 trillion in 2021. It includes parity between increases in defense spending and domestic, non-defense outlays, a priority for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat.While Democrats managed to clinch $77.4 billion in "offsets" for spending increases -- down from the original White House proposal asking for $150 billion -- Republicans can boast the victory of securing more defense spending in the agreement -- $738 billion in 2020 and $741 billion in 2021.Meanwhile, the $320-billion rise in overall spending levels for the next two years is $30 billion less than what the Democrats have sought.Non-defense spending for fiscal 2020 would total $632 billion, up nearly 4.5 percent above the comparable fiscal 2019 numbers. For 2021, spending in domestic programs would be further boosted to $635 billion."We are securing robust funding for crucial domestic priorities," Pelosi said. "We have always insisted on parity in increases between defence and non-defense."In addition, the legislation would avoid the automatic cuts looming in January that would have reduced $55 billion in domestic spending and shrank military spending by $71 billion compared with 2019 levels.The automatic across-the-board cuts, known as "sequester," were established in the Budget Control Act of 2011. It intends to cut spending for federal agencies totaling $1.2 trillion during the decade ending 2021, when the law is set to expire.With the spending levels being raised, the agreement would permanently end the sequester, a move hailed by Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in a joint statement Monday as an important win for Democrats."Importantly, Democrats have achieved an agreement that permanently ends the threat of the sequester," they said. "We are pleased that the Administration has finally agreed to join Democrats in ending these devastating cuts."The deal, however, has met with opposition from fractions on Capitol Hill. The conservative House Freedom Caucus in an op-ed published Thursday in USA Today criticized the bill, saying it is "deeply flawed.""With the national debt rapidly approaching an astonishing $23 trillion, it's obvious what Congress should be focused on," wrote Republican Representatives Mark Meadows, Jody Hice and Warren Davidson, who are all members of the conservative group. "We should be working around the clock, canceling Congressional recess if necessary, to hammer out a budget agreement that responsibly cuts spending and sets the country on a track to fiscal solvency."Yet, House Republican leaders and House Democrats by and large are supportive of the deal. While calling the agreement "not a perfect deal by any means," Congressional Progressive Caucus, a progressive group in the House, said in a statement Wednesday that "with this agreement, we can finally begin to end this harmful chapter of self-inflicted austerity."The group added that the deal "will allow for major, long-overdue investments in domestic priorities -- including housing assistance, food aid, education and job training."

                New British PM to visit Scotland amid disagreement on no-deal Brexit
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON -- Britain's new Prime Minister Boris Johnson will make his first official visit to Scotland on Monday amid opposition to his insistence on pulling the country out of the European Union (EU) even without a deal.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said last week that Scotland, which voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, needed an "alternative option" to Johnson's Brexit strategy, as local media reported.Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also refused to back a no-deal Brexit.In his first speech as prime minister on July 24, Johnson pledged to bring Britain out of the EU by Oct 31, saying "no ifs, no buts." He warned that there would be a hard Brexit if the EU refused to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.Johnson will announce on Monday a 300-million-pound (about $371 million) investment to drive economic growth in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

                Scotland's first minister says PM favors no-deal Brexit
            </a>
            <p>
                Scotland's first minister has accused the United Kingdom's new leader of intentionally pushing the nations in the union toward the cliff edge of a no-deal Brexit.Nicola Sturgeon, who heads the devolved Scottish government, said Boris Johnson, is insincere in his declared intention of working with European Union leaders on finding a divorce deal that is acceptable to both sides.After sitting down with Johnson at her official residence in Edinburgh on Monday, Sturgeon said he is pursuing a "dangerous" hardline strategy in which he is asking for difficult-to-deliver concessions in order to ensure a no-deal Brexit is the only option, a scenario that would see the introduction of trading tariffs on goods shipped between the UK and the EU and one that would likely cool the British economy."The only strategy you can get from him is that he thinks the EU is going to blink," she said. "But the EU has been very consistent in the position it's taken … (Johnson's strategy is) doomed to failure, or it's a strategy that's destined to fail because you actually want the alternative, which is a no-deal Brexit."Johnson had earlier told reporters that no one should assume he wants the UK to leave the EU without a deal on Oct 31. His comments were in contrast to those of his spokeswoman and his cabinet office minister, Michael Gove, who had earlier said the government was working on the assumption that the EU will not reopen negotiations and that the UK was therefore preparing for a no-deal Brexit.Sturgeon said: "This is a government that is pursuing a no-deal strategy however much they might deny that in public. Behind all of the bluff and bluster, this is a government that is dangerous."Johnson faced choruses of boos while in Scotland, from both pro Scottish independence groups and those wanting the UK to remain in the EU.Ahead of the trip, Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish branch of Johnson's Conservative Party, said she will not support him if he pursues a no-deal Brexit.After also meeting Johnson in Edinburgh, Davidson said their talks had been "incredibly constructive" and that they share the goal of making sure they "can get a deal across the line".Johnson said he and Davidson both want to avoid a no-deal Brexit.While touring the Faslane military base, Johnson elaborated, telling reporters the proposed divorce deal negotiated by his predecessor Theresa May is unacceptable to the British Parliament because of the so-called Irish backstop, which would, in order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, commit the UK to continue trading with the EU as if it were still a member of the bloc until a replacement trade deal can be found. Critics fear the backstop could trap the UK as effectively an EU member in perpetuity."The backstop is no good. It's dead. It has got to go," Johnson said. "The withdrawal agreement is dead, it's got to go. But there is scope to do a new deal."

                US toy prices may rise due to additional tariff
            </a>
            <p>
                Experts warn it would damage small companies as consumers pay for the hitFor the US toy industry, President Donald Trump's threatened 10 percent tariff on an additional $300 billion worth of Chinese goods starting from Sept 1 would come during the peak holiday shipping month, when many Chinese toy manufacturers send their products to the United States.Though some US toy companies have come up with contingency plans, like lowering their reliance on manufacturing in China, many will still make the US consumer pay more if the tariffs hit."Hasbro will have no choice but to pass along the increased costs to our US customers," said Brian Goldner, CEO of toy company Hasbro. He said the Pawtucket, Rhode Islandbased company, the maker of popular products such as Monopoly and GI Joe, was working to reduce its reliance on manufacturers in China, but he also said it has built up extra inventory, incurring additional storage costs, as it braces for tariffs.It's hard to tell whether companies will alleviate the impact of a new tariff before the holiday season arrives, Linda Bolton Weiser, a senior research analyst at financial services firm D.A. Davidson Companies, told China Daily.But she said that they will try to find alternative suppliers, and work with their procurement teams to optimize product mix and sourcing options. Many also will continue to move manufacturing from China to countries like Vietnam."They will do as much as they can to mitigate or offset the impact of the tariffs through all the different measures, but it's uncertain now to what extent they will be able to either partially or fully offset the impact," Weiser said."The good news is that the tariff is only 10 percent, so a product-price increase of 5 percent is needed to keep gross profit dollars unchanged. However, the gross margin would decline," she said.Reeling industryAround 85 percent of the toys sold in the US are manufactured in China. Major players, such as Hasbro and El Segundo, California-based Mattel, will bear less of a tariff burden then the rest of the industry because only two-thirds of their products are manufactured in China. For many smaller companies, however, almost all of their products are made in China, Weiser said.The US toy industry is still reeling from last year's liquidation of the major retailer chain Toys R Us. After four straight years of growth, toy sales in the US in 2018 fell 2 percent to $21.6 billion, from $22 billion in 2017, according to market researcher NPD Group."This is supposed to be the year of recovery. To continue to play this guessing game of whether there's going to be a cost increase, how much that cost increase is going to be, when is it going to go into effect, has been a really troubling environment for companies to try to make business decisions that are long term," said Rebecca Mond, vice-president of federal government affairs at the New York-based Toy Association.The US toy industry supports more than 680,000 US workers, and it accounts for $110 billion in economic value, according to data from the association.Overall, tariffs on the toy industry would reduce its economic impact on the US economy by approximately 10 percent, or $10.8 billion.The new tariff would be in addition to the 25 percent tariff that Trump levied on a separate $250 billion worth of Chinese imports over the past year.While the previous tariffs affect inputs, components and raw materials for domestic toy production, the latest tariff will likely hit finished toys and other toy-related items not yet subject to tariffs.With the tariffs implemented, the retailers would want to avoid paying the tariffs themselves, which would in turn force toymakers like Hasbro or Mattel to bring in more imports, Weiser said."It changes the nature of the business, and it changes the makeup of the revenue, so it's going to put more burden for more shipping capacity onto the toymaker," she said.

                Expect the unexpected, without surprise, in Tibet
            </a>
            <p>
                Craft beer. Red wine. Pineapples.Yak burgers. Burger King. Harley-Davidson.Most folks would find at least many of these prospects enjoyable.But few would immediately associate them with the Tibet autonomous region.Many people instead envision herders guiding yaks to graze beneath snowcaps. And they wouldn't be wrong. Such traditions not only survive but also thrive in Tibet.Yet they do so at intersections with such dimensions of development as advancing infrastructure, accelerating innovation and enhanced economic growth.That's not to mention internationalization.You can order a yak burger from at least one of Lhasa's five-star hotels, where a Harley Davidson shop stocked with a fleet of top-end choppers greets visitors immediately inside the main entrance.Their engines are off. But their very presence rumbles.Or you can eat at a Burger King next to — but, importantly, not on — Bakor Street.The hogs and burgers beg questions about how Tibet's past and future intersect in terms of the region's place in time in the world today, especially within its key position within the Belt and Road Initiative's potential for tomorrow.Speaking of time, I didn't have enough to eat any of these sandwiches there.But I did buy bags of yak jerky and milk candy to give to friends and family when I make my summer visit to my US hometown.I did so last time, too, using cash. This time I paid using WeChat.Indeed, the autonomous region is modernizing and internationalizing while sustaining local traditions — in sometimes surprising ways.It's not a land where the ancient and contemporary collide, like a time-machine fender bender.Rather, it's a place where they coexist and work in synchrony, like the various parts of a vehicle steering forward on the road toward tomorrow.Tibet is a place to expect the unexpected — and when you least expect it. It's a destination that surprises, especially as its development accelerates.This is what I've learned while exploring its vast territory during the Forum on the Development of Tibet, China, first in 2016 and again earlier this summer.I was particularly impressed by an agricultural-innovation project in which tropical fruits — yes, like pineapples — were being grown on what's often described as the "planet's third pole", during my first visit.This year, I was intrigued by the opportunity to sample locally produced microbrews and red wine.It's not that Tibet isn't known for beer. Its mass-produced varieties, typically flaunting highland barley as its main ingredient, are popular around the country.I like them. I sometimes buy them in Beijing.The craft brewer, who sources most ingredients internationally, told me his young company is the first to enter the sector in Tibet. Two other entrepreneurs penetrated the regional market soon after.Their unique concoctions are currently only available in Tibet.But I'd buy them in Beijing. And I think many people in cities around the country and world would, too.The region certainly isn't known for its wine. Few would think of vineyard-to-bottle production if they even ever thought of Tibet in vino terms.It's perhaps time to start. Grapes do grow on the plateau. And their potential is being bottled locally only to be uncorked globally.That said, traditional — consequently, more conventional — local products are also not only making inroads into the travel sector but also project their trade viability through trans-Himalayan exchanges in such areas as traditional medicine.Three years ago, I learned a tremendous amount about how such poverty-alleviation measures as urbanization, vocational training and climate-change mitigation are transforming the Tibet autonomous region.This year, I also learned about how Tibet's increasing prosperity and accelerated innovation are mutually reinforcing China's exchanges with other countries and regions, and how it is becoming a major node of the Belt and Road Initiative.I listened as Nepalese participants, in particular, explained why they enthusiastically support plans for a cross-border railway from Tibet to Kathmandu agreed upon within the BRI framework. And I heard other participants voice hopes for their particular countries.That was not only during onstage speeches and in discussion groups.I perhaps learned the most about the reasons why they applaud their homelands' involvement in the initiative when we informally discussed it between swills of the local microbreweries' pale ales, stouts and lagers during an informal dinner.The journey through Tibet also offered opportunities to visit villages and small towns in Nyingchi city to witness the region's rural development firsthand.Many people in the countryside told us they've swapped herding and farming for tourism, and earn multiplications of what they could previously, producing food.One family we visited in a village owned six cars and two cargo trucks. They earn about 400,000 yuan ($58,000) a year from their transport business, tourism, farming and herding, construction materials and such products as wild herbs.Indeed, it seems some rural Tibetans today realize the value of diversifying their business portfolios. And rapid development means they can.The spacious homes of such entrepreneurs we met offer contemporary conveniences, yet are built according to traditional architectural styles.They stand as a testimony to, and perhaps a metaphor for, Tibet's best-of-all-worlds approach to development of blending times over time.Such rural homestays, indeed, may be the kind of place worth riding a Harley to after a yak burger in Lhasa.The author is an American journalist who currently works as a senior reporter and editor at China Daily.

                  Rollable OLED TV R9, LGIf there's one TV that everybody's talking about, it's LG's rollable OLED TV – an impossibly thin flexible screen that magically appears and disappears into a svelte aluminium enclosure the company calls Zero View. Designed to appeal to decor-conscious homeowners who don't want a big black screen dominating the room, tap a button on the remote and a hidden mechanism slowly unfurls to make the 65-inch screen disappear. It also features Alexa voice control and a 4.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system.
