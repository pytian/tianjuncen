                Hawkish rhetoric does not help narrow differences
            </p>
            <p>
                Diplomats are supposed to be able to speak softly, because hawkish rhetoric, especially against the host during an official visit, does not help narrow differences and maximize mutual interests.Based on this, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not do a decent job restoring relations with Russia.Rather than elaborate on their "overlapping interests", Pompeo clung to a thorny issue that has long prevented bilateral relations from improving."Interference in American elections is unacceptable. If Russia engaged in that in 2020, it would put our relationship in an even worse place than it has been," he told his Russian host, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, at a joint news conference during his visit to Sochi, Russia, on Tuesday.Accusations of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election have long been a major stumbling block toward better ties. Moscow has vehemently denied the allegations.In repeating that claim, especially without any substantive supporting evidence, the top US diplomat refused to vindicate Russia in an effort to rebuild trust.Election meddling isn't a welcome topic for the US leader either, given that his critics have often use it to imply he has been a beneficiary of the alleged Russian interference. Pompeo should have shown better judgement and not dwelled on the topic.There are many areas that Washington and Moscow can cooperate with each other. "I would very much like your visit to Russia to benefit Russia-US relations and promote their development", as Russian President Vladimir Putin told Pompeo on Tuesday.Cooperation both in Afghanistan and on counterterrorism are among their shared goals, along with maintaining the Korean Peninsula nuclear free. Pompeo should prioritize these issues rather than the far-fetched claim of election meddling.But he doesn't seem likely to be able to accomplish much, let alone put US-Russian ties back on track, if he continues with his aggression.During his visit to the United Kingdom last week, he angered many British by humiliating Prime Minister Theresa May, comparing her with Margaret Thatcher, whom he said would have snubbed Chinese telecom giant Huawei.Maybe Pompeo should start by learning to be a good guest, before he becomes a good diplomat.

                Putin: Strategic partnership with Beijing is a priority
            </a>
            <p>
                Russian leader says he looks forward to President Xi's state visit next monthRussian President Vladimir Putin has said that developing a comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination with China is the priority of his country's external relations.Putin made the remarks when meeting Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday in the Black Sea city of Sochi."I met with President Xi Jinping last month, and we reached new agreements over the coordination between the Belt and Road Initiative and Eurasian Economic Union," Putin said.Putin said the two leaders also talked about major international and regional issues. "I am looking forward to meeting President Xi in June during his state visit to Russia, and jointly celebrating the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations," he said.Wang said Putin's visit to China last month as well as his participation at the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation has made important contribution to the forum in Beijing.He said the relation between the two countries has reached the highest level in history under the leadership of the two presidents.Wang, who is also a State Councilor, met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov earlier on Monday during his two-day visit to Russia.He said the first meeting between the two presidents this year pointed out the developing direction of the Sino-Russian relations, and made a good start for the neighbors to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties.Wang said the Sino-Russian relationship have withstood various international and domestic challenges.The comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination between the two countries, which is built on strong political mutual trust and firm mutual support, has no intention of sowing discord with any third country, Wang said.No matter what changes occur in the world, China and Russia will deepen cooperation and strengthen their strategic partnership, he said.Wang said Xi is visiting Russia next month, and the two leaders will make a comprehensive summary of the development experience of China-Russian ties in the past 70 years and make strategic plans for the future development.Wang said he was glad to see the Sino-Russian political relationship has converted into practical cooperation results, and the bilateral trading volume reached $100 billion last year, the highest in history.In the current international community, unilateralism has been crashing the existing system and some basic rules of international relations, and rumors and discredit have been tools to attack other countries.Under this international situation, China and Russia as two powers with responsibilities should enhance strategic coordination to safeguard the mutual interests of both countries as well as maintaining the peace and stability of the world, Wang stressed.Lavrov agreed with Wang, saying this year is remarkable for the Sino-Russian relations, as the leaders meet frequently and the two countries have close communication in different levels and in various fields.He said Russia is seeing its relationship with China is the priority in its diplomacy, which meets the long-term interests of Russia.China and Russia are key partners on the international stage and have established a close and efficient communication mechanism in many multilateral frameworks such as in the United Nations, G20, Shanghai Cooperation Organization and many others, and two countries will maintain communication in various platforms, said the Russian diplomat.

                War between US and Iran less likely
            </a>
            <p>
                Disputes involving Teheran not always military related, expert saysIt is unlikely the United States will start a war with Iran, although the tension has escalated between the two sides and the international community worries that the US is sliding toward war with Iran.Yin Gang, a researcher from the Institute of West-Asian and African Studies of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, argued that neither Washington nor Teheran is willing to spark a war in the Middle East as the issues related to Iran "are not always about military actions".Instead of military strike, he said the US has decided to target Iran with economic measures as the former has enacted more sanctions.The comment came after the US military said that the US forces are on high alert in Iraq and Syria over fears of "imminent threats" from Iran-backed forces in the region, according to Xinhua News Agency."US Central Command, in coordination with Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), has increased the force posture level for all service members assigned to OIR in Iraq and Syria," US Central Command spokesman Bill Urban said in a statement.OIR, responsible for the US military assistance in fighting the Islamic State militant group, "is now at a high level of alert as we continue to closely monitor credible and possibly imminent threats to US forces in Iraq", Urban added.The high alert was based on "credible threats available to intelligence from US and allies regarding Iranian-backed forces in the region", the spokesman noted.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly argued for avoiding long-term conflicts in the Middle East, discounted a New York Times report that the US has updated plans that could send up to 120,000 troops to counter Iran if it attacked US forces.Reinforcing Trump's denial, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US "do not seek war with Iran" at a joint news conference in Sochi with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, according to The Associated Press.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also said on Tuesday that Teheran does not seek war with the US, despite mounting tensions between the two archenemies over Iranian nuclear capabilities and its missile program, according to Iran's Press TV.As tensions in the region started to surge, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said his nation was worried about the risk of accidental conflict "with an escalation that is unintended really on either side", according to AP."What we need is a period of calm to make sure that everyone understands what the other side is thinking," Hunt said.The US military move came amid the tense situation in the region after Trump decided not to reissue the sanctions waivers for major importers to continue buying Iran's oil when they expired in early May.However, Yin said in the future the US and Iran will come back to the negotiation table as this might be the only choice for Iran. The Iran side has already started to "set the table" by giving a 60-day time limit.If no new nuclear deal is in place, Teheran recently threatened to resume higher enrichment in 60 days. This would be enrichment beyond the 3.67 percent permitted by the current nuclear deal signed in 2015 between Teheran and world powers. The US has withdrew from the deal last year.The European Union and the foreign ministers of Germany, France and Britain said they were still committed to the deal but would not accept ultimatums from Teheran.

                Europe urges Iran to stick to troubled deal
            </a>
            <p>
                TEHERAN - European powers urged Iran on Tuesday to reverse its move to increase uranium enrichment "without delay", as a French envoy arrived in Teheran to boost efforts to save a landmark 2015 nuclear accord.French President Emmanuel Macron sent top diplomatic adviser Emmanuel Bonne to the Iranian capital after Iran announced on Monday that it had passed 4.5 percent uranium enrichment level - above the 3.67 percent limit set under the agreement, though still far below the 90 percent necessary for military purposes.Bonne was scheduled to meet with Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, on Wednesday.Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi on Wednesday welcomed Bonne's visit, saying "the French are part of efforts... to keep the nuclear deal alive".This is the latest move of the European Union to salvage the shattered nuclear deal.The accord between Iran and world powers promised sanctions relief, economic benefits and an end to international isolation of the Islamic republic in return for stringent curbs on its nuclear program.But after the United States withdrew last year and reimposed stinging sanctions on Iran, especially on its banking and oil sectors, the future of the accord became uncertain.As the Iranian economy went into free fall, Teheran demanded that the other parties to the deal, especially France, Germany and Britain, deliver the promised economic benefits and help it bypass US sanctions.However, it gradually became clear that this was no simple task, and Iran changed tack and said it would reshape its policy of "strategic patience".On Monday, Iran announced its breach of the 3.67-percent limit set by the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, and threatened to restart deactivated centrifuges and ramp up enrichment of uranium to 20 percent purity in a move away from the accord.The deal was signed by Iran, China, Britain, France, Germany, the European Union and the US.Meanwhile, the international community has stepped up efforts to ease the escalating tensions between Teheran and Washington, calling on Iran to reverse breaches of the agreement.France, Britain and Germany said they planned to convene a meeting of the signatories to address Iran's compliance with the nuclear deal, but they did not say when that would happen.In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Tuesday that Russia is ready to hold a ministerial meeting on fulfilling the terms of the deal.Lavrov also blamed the deteriorating situation around the Iranian nuclear deal on the US."The United States has withdrawn from the plan and is not fulfilling the resolution of the Security Council, which approved the JCPOA and also barred others from implementing this resolution, pointing fingers at Iran," he said."This is a wrong approach. We want to search for solutions."Ren Qi in Moscow contributed to this story.Agencies - China Daily

                Chinese FM says BRICS cooperation a strategic choice, urges bigger BRICS role in world affairs
            </a>
            <p>
                 RIO DE JANEIRO - The rise of emerging markets and developing countries, represented by the BRICS countries, has bolstered a more multi-polar world, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said here on Friday.At the Formal Meeting of the BRICS Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Wang also said BRICS cooperation is not a band-aid solution for the five countries but a strategic choice that focuses on common and long-term development and harbors bright prospects.The five countries are Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.Wang said no matter how the international landscape changes, the direction of the BRICS cooperation must not change. Faced with new challenges, the five countries should let their voices be heard, offer more solutions to pressing global issues and play a greater role in world affairs.Wang pointed out that unilateralism undermines international rules and challenges the international rule of law, which exacerbates the instability and uncertainty of the world.The BRICS countries must take the lead in maintaining multilateralism and safeguarding the global governance system with the UN as its core and under international law.Furthermore, the bloc should safeguard the multilateral trading system represented by the WTO and protect the common interests and development space of emerging market and developing countries, he said.The five countries together must continue to integrate the interests of other emerging market countries and developing countries through flexible and diverse platforms such as "BRICS Plus."At the meeting, the five foreign ministers all agreed to safeguard the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, defend multilateralism and free trade, oppose unilateralism and protectionism, strengthen global governance, and build a community with a shared future for humankind.They agreed that regional hotspot issues should be resolved through dialogue and consultation and that BRICS cooperation should work to benefit the peoples of the five countries.The foreign ministers also agreed to maintain vigilance on cybersecurity issues and expressed opposition to the use of cybersecurity to suppress the development of science and technology in other countries. They agreed to strive toward an open and non-discriminatory environment for the application of information technology.The foreign ministers were tasked with preparing for the BRICS summit to be held in Brasilia in November.

                Lavrov highly appreciates the idea on regular organization of the Caspian economic forum
            </a>
            <p>
                Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov has highly appreciated the idea of president of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdymuhamedov on conduction of the Caspian economic forum on a regular basis.In an interview to the magazine "Foreign policy and diplomacy of Turkmenistan", the head of the Russian foreign policy office has noticed that the decision of the problem of economic development of the Caspian region on a rational and mutually beneficial basis assumes a special significance after signing of the Convention on legal status of Caspian sea in August 2018.As he said, the document meets interests of all coastal states not only because its positions accurately define their mutual rights and obligations on use of the given reservoir, confidence-building measure and safety in this area of the world as a whole. Lavrov considers that the value of the given international contract also entails that it creates necessary legal conditions for enhancement of cooperation in trade, investment and transport spheres.According to the Russian minister, under current conditions the necessity of creation of a specialised platform for direct contacts between the governments, profile economic departments and business structures interested in the work on the Caspian sea, has objectively ripened."Thereupon the idea on regular organization of the Caspian economic forum, put forward by president of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdymuhamedov is rather well-timed," the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia has underlined.He expressed hope that the First Caspian Economic Forum will give additional impulse to the collaboration in such spheres as trade, investments and tourism that will contribute among others to the transformation of the Caspian into one of the world’s largest transport and transit hubs.In conclusion Sergey Lavrov has especially underlined that Russia attaches great importance to this event. The level of the Russian delegation to be headed by the Head of the Government of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev serves as a vivid proof of this.These days, the centre of political and economic life of the states of the Caspian basin and the neighbouring regions of Eurasia shifts to the Turkmen coast of the Caspian sea. On August 12 in Avaza national tourist zone starts the first Caspian economic forum, called to become a permanent platform for negotiations for the countries of the Caspian region and other states, wishing to develop the international economic cooperation in the Caspian Sea.Very much depends on how the first Caspian economic forum will take place and what standards of its organization will be established in Avaza. Ashkhabad is known for carefulness of organisation and scale of conduction of international forums on the Turkmen land. We will hope that the first Caspian economic forum will bring countries of the region closer and will begin realization of enormous economic potential of the Caspian Sea for the benefit of all peoples of the Caspian littoral states.Please view the original article at orient.tm.
