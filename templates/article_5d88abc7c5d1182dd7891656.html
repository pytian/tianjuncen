                    Demand from China and India buoys LNG
                </p>
            </a>

                SHANGHAI - Global natural gas market is undergoing substantial changes as demand from emerging economies such as China and India is increasing at a rapid pace, according to industry observers.At the 19th International Conference and Exhibition on Liquefied Natural Gas in Shanghai earlier this month, industry experts said rising LNG supply and growing demand are injecting dynamism into the market.The LNG conference, first held in 1968, is a triennial industry-event. This year marks the first time that the conference was held in China, the world's fastest-growing LNG market."Natural gas is playing a crucial role in global energy transition. As an efficient and clean fossil fuel, natural gas is considered an important 'bridge energy' toward low-carbon world," said Yang Hua, chairman of China National Offshore Oil Corporation, the largest offshore oil and gas producer in China.As countries around the world are pushing ahead with energy transition policies to reduce carbon emissions, many institutions forecast that the global LNG demand will continue to rise.By 2040, global natural gas demand will increase more than 40 percent from the 2017 level, according to the International Energy Agency. By that time, natural gas will become the second largest energy source in global energy mix, and its share in global primary energy demand will increase to about 25 percent from less than 23 percent in 2017."Most of this rising demand for natural gas will come from fast-growing economies whose energy systems still rely heavily on coal, such as China, India and other Asian countries," Patrick Pouyanne, chairman and chief executive officer of Total, said."One of the most striking examples is the massive promotion of natural gas by the Chinese government within the framework of the 'Beautiful China' development plan," Pouyanne said.The IEA predicted that from 2017 to 2023, China alone would account for a third of global gas demand growth, thanks in part to the country's "Blue Skies" policy and the strong drive to improve air quality.In 2018, China's natural gas consumption totaled 280.3 billion cubic meters, a robust growth of 18 percent from a year ago. Driven by the growing gas consumption, China imported 90 million metric tons of natural gas in 2018, a year-on-year growth of almost 32 percent. The growth rate was higher than the 27-percent increase in 2017."Global LNG industry is undergoing substantial changes," Yang said, adding that with the rising LNG production capacity, the global LNG trade is expected to exceed 500 billion cubic meters by 2030, an increase of about 30 percent from 2017.Within the next five years, the global natural gas liquefaction capacity is expected to increase by 50 percent from the 2015 level as new LNG development and expansion projects in the United States, Australia, Qatar and Russia become operational, according to Young-Doo Kim, acting president of Korea Gas Corporation, one of the world's largest LNG importers.With the rising supply, fierce competition is expected in the global LNG market, which will offer more options for buyers and foster more flexible ways for LNG trade."With more market players and increased market liquidity, the global LNG market is expanding and taking on some positive changes, such as the emergence of new and flexible business modes and contract terms," said Wang Yilin, chairman of China National Petroleum Corporation.However, Wang said the flexibility of LNG trade should be further enhanced. "More flexible contract terms and business modes could inject more liquidity into the market."

                HOUSTON - China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) is committed to strengthen international technology interchange and collaboration to be more competitive in the global market, a Chinese energy industry insider said Tuesday in Houston, Texas, the United States.Zhou Jianliang, deputy general manager of CNOOC Sci&Tech Development Dept, made the remarks at the Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) that kicked off in Houston on Monday.Interviewed by Xinhua, Zhou said the core competitiveness of energy companies mainly depends on resources, technology and market with technology as the most important aspect."No matter innovation or independent R&D, all technologies need to be integrated so that we can achieve what others cannot or perform better than others," he said.Aiming to be one of the world's top energy enterprises, CNOOC attaches great importance to international interchange and collaboration. "Through cooperation projects, we can develop oil and gas fields in China and abroad, and at the same time export our advanced technologies to the world," Zhou noted.OTC, the world's largest annual oil and gas trade show, is held in Houston from Monday through Thursday. Chinese participants in the event include state-run leading companies as well as private enterprises from across the country.The technological program of the four-day event includes more than 80 technical sessions, industry breakfasts and themed luncheons covering a wide range of topics.This year's new program, Around the World Series, features global industry leaders from Australia, Canada, France, Ghana, Guyana, Israel, Mexico, Norway, and Britain to discuss new licensing and business opportunities, as well as recently introduced technologies.Founded in 1969, OTC provides a platform for energy professionals to exchange thoughts to advance scientific and technological knowledge on offshore resources and environmental matters.CNOOC is the largest offshore oil and gas producer in China. The five main business segments of the company are oil & gas exploration and development, engineering and technical services, refining and marketing, natural gas and power generation and financial services. The company was ranked 87th in 2018 Fortune Global 500 and 31th in Petroleum Intelligence Weekly's World's Top 50 Oil Companies.

                    Grim days ahead for US LNG sector as market shutout looms

                China's move to raise tariffs on liquefied natural gas imports from the United States will crimp shipments to the world's fastest growing importer of the fuel and hurt US companies, experts said.Despite surging demand for natural gas in China, the higher tariffs will have a limited impact on the domestic market but hurt the US LNG export sector badly, according to the resource and environment research center of Sinolink Securities.China imported 54 million metric tons of LNG in 2018, a year-on-year increase of 42 percent. LNG imports from the US stood at 2.1 million tons, accounting for 4 percent of the total, it said.Figures from Reuters also show that only two LNG vessels have gone from the United States to China so far this year, including one in January and one in February, compared with 14 during the first four months of 2018 before the start of the trade dispute.While the LNG China imported from the US increased by more than 40 percent in 2018, the increase was mostly in the first half of last year. LNG Imports from the US from last October to March witnessed a six-month year-on-year negative growth since the Chinese government announced a 10 percent tariff on US LNG imports last September, it said.The recent heating season witnessed an 82 percent decrease in LNG imports from the US compared with the same period a year ago. China still went through the heating season peacefully without experiencing any major gas shortage, thanks to the oil and gas majors' efforts to diversify gas imports and undertake domestic gas exploration, it said.While natural gas has witnessed massive growth in sales in recent years in China, which is trying to reduce its dependence on coal, the US has become the fastest-growing LNG exporter worldwide and is expected to rank third in exports this year behind Qatar and Australia."For the heating season this year, as there is still several months to go, we believe the national oil and gas majors, including CNPC, Sinopec and CNOOC, will have sufficient time to ensure gas supply. With the China-Russian gas pipeline to be completed by the end of this year, China's gas supply will become more diversified," the center said in a note.With no LNG imported from the US in October, December and March, the center expects Chinese buyers will reduce or suspend spot purchases of US LNG due to the higher tariffs in the ensuing months.Some experts from the LNG sector expressed concern that the trade friction would have a long-term impact on the US LNG industry, making it more challenging for developers to sign commercial deals and secure financing.According to Ira Joseph, head of global gas and power analytics at S&P Global Platts, the tariff is "the knockout blow"."I expect they will have a hard time landing a tanker carrying US LNG in China if they impose a 25 percent tariff on it," Jack Weixel, senior director at IHS Markit's Point-Logic analytics arm, was quoted by Reuters as saying.Li Li, energy research director at ICIS China, a think tank focusing on energy trends, said the higher tariffs could price US LNG out of the Chinese market, and make long-term contracts more difficult to negotiate.China has imported 4.6 million tons of LNG from the US since 2016, becoming the third largest buyer of US LNG, accounting for 10 percent of US total LNG exports."While in the short term the US could sell its LNG to other regions to reduce the impact of losing Chinese buyers, losing China, the third largest LNG importer for the US market and the second largest LNG importer worldwide, will harm its LNG sector and delay the country's export facility construction," according to the center.Jack Fusco, president and CEO of US natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy Inc, said on May 9 that the trade dispute is "unproductive and creates added costs for Chinese consumers".

                    Mixed fortunes for oil, gas giants in first half

                The first half of 2019 has witnessed different profit outcomes among China's top three oil and gas companies, which experts said was mainly due to the profit plunge in downstream refining and chemicals sector dragged by overcapacity and waning demand.According to their recently released semiannual reports, Petro-China Co Ltd and CNOOC Ltd posted rises in first-half earnings, while that for China Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec) was 24 percent down year-on-year.Total revenue of PetroChina over the first six months of 2019 hit 1.2 trillion yuan ($167.39 billion), rising 6.8 percent from the first half of last year. Its earnings were 28.42 billion yuan, up from 27.44 billion yuan from a year earlier.Sinopec's revenue in the first half of 2019 rose 15.3 percent year-on-year to 1.5 trillion yuan, with earnings being only 32.2 billion yuan.For CNOOC Ltd, total oil and gas sales rose 4.4 percent to 94.28 billion yuan in the first half, and net profit hit 30.25 billion yuan.Li Li, energy research director at ICIS China, a firm providing analysis of China's energy market, said increased crude oil prices in the first half, against a sharp decline in profit margins of downstream oil refining and chemicals, influenced the profitability of the three companies in opposite ways."Higher prices of crude oil boosted the profit margins of PetroChina and CNOOC Ltd in the first half, as upstream exploration and production of crude oil are the main business of the two companies," she said."On the contrary, gross margins in both oil refining and chemicals declined sharply during the period, and that led to Sinopec's profit drop."Operating income of PetroChina's upstream exploration and production sector, the largest contributor to its net profit, was 53.63 billion yuan in the first half of 2019, up 23.74 billion yuan from that in 2018, but that in refining and chemicals was 4.97 billion yuan, a decline of 19.72 billion yuan year-on-year.Despite increased output, Sinopec's earnings before interest and taxes were only 18.61 billion yuan in its oil refining business, down 52.8 percent year-over-year from 39.43 billion yuan due to higher crude procurement expenses. That in chemicals dropped 27.2 percent year-on-year from 18.91 billion yuan in the first half of 2018 to 13.78 billion yuan in the first half of this year.Li said as competition in downstream is getting fiercer with growing new capacities, the second half will remain tough for Sinopec if it does not update its product portfolio to better meet market demand, such as increasing supplies of low sulphur fuel oil for ship use and boosting refined oil exports.Lin Boqiang, head of the China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy at Xiamen University, said: "Overcapacity in oil-refining and chemicals, accounting for up to 20 to 30 percent of the total capacity, has been a long-time problem for the healthy development of the industry, and the problem is getting worse with a torrent of large private capacities planned to be completed next year."According to him, overcapacity in the downstream sector is flared up by some companies' thirsty for expansion and local governments' desire for more tax and employment, but ultimately disrupts the balance of market supply and demand, especially against the background of rising uncertainties in the global economy.The way out comes from the authorities' better industry policy designs, including drawing up reasonable industry development plans, refining the related tax structure, and strengthening tax supervision to avoid tax evasion, he said, adding that it is very important to tax downstream products rather than refined oil sales.Zheng Xin contributed to this story.

                    China to raise retail fuel prices

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                BEIJING -- China will raise the retail prices of gasoline and diesel from Wednesday, the country's top economic planner said Tuesday.As international oil prices have risen, the retail prices of gasoline and diesel will rise by 115 yuan (about $16.22) and 105 yuan per tonne, respectively, according to the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).Under the current pricing mechanism, if international crude oil prices change by more than 50 yuan per tonne and remain at that level for 10 working days, the prices of refined oil products such as gasoline and diesel in China will be adjusted accordingly.China's three biggest oil companies -- Sinopec, PetroChina and CNOOC -- have been asked to maintain oil production and facilitate transportation to ensure stable supplies, the NDRC said.Global crude supply remained sufficient, the NDRC said, expecting the international oil prices to continue to fluctuate in the short term.

                With the fast growth in China's new energy vehicle industry, it is inevitable that traditional oil and gas companies will enter the charging market, industry experts said.An arm of Sinopec in Hainan province announced on Aug 13 it had built 40 charging piles in eight highway service stations and its 10 oil stations in urban areas of Haikou and Sanya cities.The charging piles, designed to be able to provide charging and parking services for 80 electric vehicles at the same time, are expected to meet fast charging demand from commercial EVs such as electric buses and online ride-hailing electric cars, as well as private EVs, the company said in a news release.It will later build integrated energy supply stations offering oil and gas refueling, EV recharging, and hydrogen refueling at suitable places across the province, starting in Haikou, the company said.Liu Yongdong, director of the center of standardization under the China Electricity Council, said it is natural for traditional energy companies to enter the new energy sector, as end terminal use of energy is relying less on oil and more on electricity generated from new energy sources."As the EV charging market matures with clear business models and increased profitability, it is highly possible that the top three Chinese oil and gas companies - PetroChina, Sinopec and CNOOC Ltd - will alter their oil and gas stations to include more charging piles," Liu said.So far, their attempts to tap the EV charging market have been limited, mainly due to lower profitability in the area compared to their traditional oil and gas services, Liu explained.Liu also said the three companies had the potential to be competitive operators in the charging market compared with existing service providers, because they have ample low-cost land resources, which could significantly reduce their charging pile operating costs, especially in downtown areas of cities and highway service stations.Qiu Kaijun, an industry observer and founder of Evobserver, an influential social media platform in the NEV industry, said traditional energy companies have noticed the promising future of the charging market, and it is only a matter of time before they invest more in the sector.The new energy branch of CNOOC is a shareholder in Potevio New Energy Co Ltd, one of the oldest and most successful players in China's charging market, he added.Liu said despite the competitive advantages traditional energy companies have, such as from funds and loans, they are less sensitive to subtle changes in the charging market than existing service providers.Besides, established players have a firm grip on their share of the market, and it is difficult for newcomers to shake it up, he said.
