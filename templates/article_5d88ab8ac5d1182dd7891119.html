                Tanzanian police say 62 killed when siphoned tanker explodes
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania — A damaged tanker truck exploded in eastern Tanzania as people were trying to siphon fuel out of it Saturday, killing at least 62 in one of the worst incidents of its kind in the East African country.Tanzanian state broadcaster TBC, citing police figures, said at least 70 more people were injured during the explosion in the town of Morogoro, located about 120 miles (200 kilometers) from the economic hub of Dar es Salaam.Regional commissioner Steven Kebwe told the local Azam TV that many suffered serious burns.Witnesses told The Associated Press that a crowd had gathered around the fuel tanker after it was involved in an accident early Saturday and some people were trying to siphon away fuel when the truck burst into flames.Video footage posted on social media showed people collecting fuel into jerry cans before the fire incident.In a statement expressing condolences, Tanzanian President John Magufuli said he was dismayed people attacked vehicles involved in accidents instead of offering help.Residents are routinely killed by explosions while stealing fuel from incapacitated tankers in East Africa. Those who steal the fuel usually hope to be able to sell it cheaply to motorists.In 2013, at least 29 people were killed on the outskirts of the Ugandan capital, Kampala, as scores swarmed around the scene of an accident.There is limited awareness about the danger of explosions of damaged fuel tankers, said Henry Bantu, a road safety expert who runs the Tanzania-based Safe Speed Foundation. Local leaders need to do more to educate people on the risks, he said.This story has been corrected to show the official who spoke to Azam TV is regional commissioner Steven Kebwe, not a police commissioner whose surname is Kabwe.AP

                    Uganda looks to China for tourism and investment boost

            <p class="style-content">
                Uganda recently held an event to promote tourism and investment opportunities at the ongoing International Horticultural Exhibition in Yanqing district, Beijing.Attendees enjoyed traditional dancing by Ugandan performers and visited stalls selling coffee, nuts and tourism souvenirs produced by the country.Official data shows that China's outbound tourist visits last year reached around 150 million, making it the world's biggest market for outbound travelers and a priority for many overseas destinations looking to attract tourists.The United Kingdom's former prime minister Winston Churchill once called Uganda "The Pearl of Africa" in response to its unique landscape and natural beauty.Uganda is home to lakes, mountains, valleys and a great diversity of wildlife. The source of the 6,650-kilometer-long Nile River, the longest waterway in Africa with a basin spread across 11 countries, is Lake Victoria in Uganda.Tourists to the African nation can indulge in local cultural events, embrace nature, and go on safari to observe elephants, chimpanzees and numerous bird species in the wild.There are also organized treks into the ominously-named Bwindi Impenetrable National Park to get up close and personal with the majestic mountain gorillas in one of the few remaining natural habitats of the critically endangered primate.Uganda offers accommodation to satisfy the requirements of all kinds of tourist, from luxury hotels and campsites to homestays, and it welcomes more than 1.3 million global tourists every year.Meanwhile, the country is striving to attract Chinese investors with preferential policies in the fields of agriculture, infrastructure, tourism, minerals, energy and health.

                    Ebola outbreak in Congo declared a global health emergency
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                GENEVA — The deadly Ebola outbreak in Congo is now an international health emergency, the World Health Organization announced on Wednesday after the virus spread this week to a city of two million people.A WHO expert committee had declined on three previous occasions to advise the United Nations health agency to make the declaration for this outbreak, which other experts say has long met the conditions. More than 1,600 people have died since August in the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history, which is unfolding in a region described as a war zone.This week the first Ebola case was confirmed in Goma, a major regional crossroads in northeastern Congo on the Rwandan border with an international airport. Health experts have feared this scenario for months.A declaration of a global health emergency often brings greater international attention and aid, along with concerns that nervous governments might overreact with border closures.While the risk of regional spread remains high the risk outside the region remains low, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said after the announcement in Geneva. "The (international emergency) should not be used to stigmatize or penalize the very people who are most in need of our help," he said.This is the fifth such declaration in history. Previous emergencies were declared for the devastating 2014-16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people, the emergence of Zika in the Americas, the swine flu pandemic and polio eradication.WHO defines a global emergency as an "extraordinary event" which constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response. Last month this outbreak spilled across the border for the first time when a family brought the virus into Uganda after attending the burial in Congo of an infected relative. Even then, the expert committee advised against a declaration.Alexandra Phelan, a global health expert at Georgetown University Law Center, said Wednesday's declaration was long overdue."This essentially serves as a call to the international community that they have to step up appropriate financial and technical support," she said but warned that countries should be wary of imposing travel or trade restrictions."Those restrictions would actually restrict the flow of goods and health care workers into affected countries so they are counter-productive," she said. Future emergency declarations might be perceived as punishment and "might result in other countries not reporting outbreaks in the future, which puts us all at greater risk."The current outbreak is spreading in a turbulent Congo border region where dozens of rebel groups are active and where Ebola had not been experienced before. Efforts to contain the virus have been hurt by mistrust by wary locals that has prompted deadly attacks on health workers. Some infected people have deliberately evaded health authorities.The pastor who brought Ebola to Goma used several fake names to conceal his identity on his way to the city, Congolese officials said. WHO on Tuesday said the man had died and health workers were scrambling to trace dozens of his contacts, including those who had traveled on the same bus.There was no immediate reaction to WHO's emergency declaration from Congo's health ministry, which had lobbied against it."Calling for a (global emergency) to raise funds while ignoring the negative consequences for (Congo) is reckless," the ministry tweeted following an editorial by Britain's secretary of state for international development in favor of a declaration. Rory Stewart announced earlier this week that Britain would donate up to another $63 million for the Ebola response and called for other countries, especially Francophone ones, to increase their support.At a UN meeting on Ebola in Geneva on Tuesday, Congo's health minister, Dr. Oly Ilunga, said the outbreak was "not a humanitarian crisis" and that the risk of Ebola spreading to other cities or regions in Congo remained the same."Ebola is not rocket science, it's very simple," he said.WHO has long called the regional Ebola risk "very high."Earlier this week, Ugandan health officials said a Congolese fish trader had traveled to Uganda while sick and vomited several times at a local market. The woman returned to Congo last week and died after testing positive for Ebola. Ugandan officials estimate almost 600 people could be targeted for vaccination and follow-up.Those working in the field say the outbreak is clearly taking a turn for the worse despite advances in this outbreak that include the widespread use of an experimental but effective Ebola vaccine.Dr. Maurice Kakule was one of the first people to survive the current outbreak after he fell ill while treating a woman last July before the outbreak had even been declared."What is clear is that Ebola is an emergency because the epidemic persists despite every possible effort to educate people," he told the Geneva meeting. "We have sufficiently informed them about the existence of this disease but there are still people who don't want to believe that it does."AP

                    Legions of volunteers lend a hand at Beijing expo

            <p class="style-content">
                Around 4,000 university students have provided or will provide professional services to visitors on a volunteer basis at the ongoing International Horticultural Exhibition in Beijing’s Yanqing district during their summer break, Beijing Youth Daily reported.These students from Beijing and Zhangjiakou, North China’s Hebei province, do their work in groups at the Beijing expo, where temperatures can easily exceed 30 C during the summer.Volunteers have little time to spend under the umbrellas, and keep busy giving directions to visitors under the sun. When it rains, they line up on both sides of the road to lead tourists to the nearest cover.Zhao Yihan worked as a hostess. She and her partner held a 10-hour post split into two shifts every day. Standing in the scorching sun, volunteers need to make sure their posture and manner of speaking present the image of volunteers in the best possible way."The happiest moment for me every day is to give answers to tourists' questions." Zhao said. It makes her feel her hard work is worth it, she added.For indoor volunteers who work in pavilions, walking 30,000 steps a day is not unheard of. Many have become excellent "tour guides" — they always give visitors recommendations on the best activities and places to go.Xu Bizeng, a college student from the Beijing Institute of Technology who works at the Uganda Pavilion, has established himself as an outstanding interpreter. After several days of practice, he is able to tell the background stories of each traditional Ugandan handicraft accurately and skillfully.

                    Saudi Arabia prepares for hajj as Gulf tensions simmer
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                MECCA, Saudi Arabia - More than 2.5 million Muslims on Friday will begin the hajj pilgrimage to the Islamic holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, against a backdrop of tensions in the Gulf.Crowds of worshippers have already begun to gather in Mecca in the days ahead of the hajj, the annual focal point of the Islamic calendar."It's the first time I've felt something so strongly - It's striking," said 40-year-old Indonesian pilgrim Sobar in rudimentary Arabic.More than 1.8 million visitors had arrived by midday local time on Tuesday, authorities said.The faithful from across the world wore flowing white robes as they descended on the holy city located in the west of Saudi Arabia.The pilgrims will undertake religious rites that have remained unchanged since the founding of Islam 14 centuries ago."Islam united us. We are all together, ... so that's why I'm very happy," said Leku Abibu, 46, a Ugandan mechanic who wore a beige salwar kameez, an outfit of loosefitting pants and tunic."I'm enjoying it here."This year's hajj takes place amid strains in the Gulf region exacerbated by a series of attacks on oil tankers, drone strikes and interceptions of maritime traffic on the high seas.Saudi, the Gulf's leading power, and its ally Washington accuse Iran of being behind the attacks and sabotage operations against commercial shipping. Teheran has repeatedly denied those accusations.Despite the tensions in the region, around 88,550 Iranian pilgrims are due to take part in the hajj this year, according to Iran's Tasnim News Agency.The hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and Muslims must perform it at least once in their lives if they can afford to."There are all nations of the world, all languages. There are no differences between us," said Nurul Jamal, a 61-year-old pilgrim from India.While waiting for the beginning of the hajj, worshippers roam the esplanade or pray in the mosque in stifling heat.Temperatures can surpass 40 C and some pilgrims carry sun shades.Large misting machines installed at the holy sites help to make the heat more bearable.Guards in khaki fastidiously lead worshippers to their five daily prayers.Traffic in the city is extremely heavy and the air quality is poor.The odor of exhaust fumes mixes with the smell of bitumen emitted by the heated road surface. Many pilgrims wear face masks.Away from prayers, many of the faithful visit the innumerable shops that speckle the holy city. Even though the hajj lasts only five days, many pilgrims arrive weeks before and linger in the city.Religious tourism brings in revenues worth billions of dollars.But the vast gathering also presents major logistical and safety challenges.In 2015, about 2,300 worshippers were killed in the worst stampede in the history of the hajj.Since then, Saudi Arabia has sought to reassure pilgrims, deploying tens of thousands of security officers and installing cameras to oversee every corner of the holy sites.The total number of arrivals is limited, however, as each Muslim country receives a pilgrim quota.Some worshippers have spent years on waiting lists - sometimes as long as a decade - just to perform their religious duty.Agence France-Presse
