                Profilic Japanese photographer showcases iconic flower series in Beijing
            </p>
            <p>
                Tokyo-born Nobuyoshi Araki, now 79, is one of the most prolific and prominent living photographers in Japan. His photos of flowers are considered as iconic and highly personal and his artistic output has moved a lot of people around the world.Araki, although visually impaired in his right eye and often illness-ridden, keeps photographing these subtle, intimate moments of daily life through which he shares thoughts on love and desire, life and death.He believes that the older one gets, the better his photos become."People, in the end, will walk to the sky and flowers. I'm aging. I'm also in that state of walking to the sky and flowers," he says."One will never get bored of seeing the sky... and I will keep photographing flowers till they wither and die."

                Chinese ballet, inspired by the wartime contribution of the local women of East China, will premiere in April, Chen Nan reports.The National Ballet of China premiered its production of Ode to the Yimeng Mountains in Beijing in May 1973, as a tribute to the residents of Yinan county in East China's Shandong province who supported Communist troops during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45) and the following civil war (1945-49).The local women, known as the "Red Sisters", not only helped these soldiers by making shoes and clothes for them, but sometimes even sacrificed their lives to protect them.Ode to the Yimeng Mountains was adapted into a film in 1975 by August First Film Studio of the People's Liberation Army.The ballet piece has been part of the National Ballet of China's repertoire for decades.With this year marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the National Ballet of China has revised the classic into another production, titled Yimeng - A Ballet in Three Chapters, which will premiere in Beijing on April 19 and run for three days after that.

                Historical threads: Morocco's last brocade master
            </a>
            <p>
                FEZ, Morocco - Abdelkader Ouazzani, the last of Morocco's brocade master weavers, has been repeating the same gestures for 63 years in his dilapidated workshop in the heart of the old city of Fez. "This profession is vanishing. ... There were many craftsmen in Fez, but they all died and only memories remain," said the 79-year-old weaver, the last witness of a bygone era. His skillful hands intricately create shimmering silk fabrics, enhanced with gold or silver thread, for bridal jewelry, designer creations or high-end furnishings. His entire body engages in the delicate job, using a complex draw-loom mechanism made up of a large wooden frame topped with beams, rafters, blades, pulleys and counterweights. His feet rest on the wooden pedals, his shoulders are bent forward, his arms move apart with each launch of the wooden shuttle. "It's all a question of calculation, each thread takes its path: It's like mathematics," the old man said. His work is both physical and meticulous: It takes an entire day to weave a meter of brocade. "Not everybody is allowed to see that, it's very special. He is the last man working like that," explained a tour guide who has led a group of Thai tourists. They are visiting on the recommendation of the wife of the head of a major Moroccan bank, herself a client of the workshop. An article in the historical journal Hesperis, published in 1950 by the Institute of Higher Moroccan Studies, described the weaving of brocades from Fez as a tradition that "disappeared everywhere else in North Africa". It said that the ancestral knowhow had its roots in the era of the Merinid sultans of the 13th century. "In the 1950s, there were still four or five workshops left," said Mohamed Akhda, the guide in charge of the Thai guests. "You are now in the last one left in the country." Ouazzani said he can't find a young apprentice to take over his workshop. "People no longer want to learn this profession. No one cares," he said. As fashions have changed, the wide, colorful belts that for centuries were the pride of the master weavers of Fes gradually stopped selling. In the age of globalization, the final blow came with industrial-scale competition. In Fez, as elsewhere, some souvenir shops now sell low-end products that are machine woven abroad. Ouazzani, on the other hand, works on commission for a clientele he describes as "the elite of the elite". His rare fabrics cost up to 5,000 dirhams per meter ($560), depending on the complexity of the patterns. Agence France-Presse (China Daily 05/01/2019 page4)

                'Easy Rider' star Peter Fonda dies at 79
            </a>
            <p>
                LOS ANGELES (AP) — Actor Peter Fonda, the son of a Hollywood legend who became a movie star in his own right after both writing and starring in the counter-culture classic "Easy Rider," has died. His family said in a statement that Fonda died Friday morning at his home in Los Angeles. He was 79.The official cause of death was respiratory failure due to lung cancer."I am very sad," Jane Fonda said in a statement. "He was my sweet-hearted baby brother. The talker of the family. I have had beautiful alone time with him these last days. He went out laughing."Born into Hollywood royalty as Henry Fonda's only son, Peter Fonda carved his own path with his non-conformist tendencies and earned an Oscar nomination for co-writing the psychedelic road trip movie "Easy Rider." He would never win that golden statuette, but would later be nominated for his leading performance as a Vietnam veteran and widowed beekeeper in "Ulee's Gold."Fonda was born in New York in 1940 to parents whose personas were the very opposite of the rebellious images their kids would cultivate. Father Henry Fonda was already a Hollywood giant, known for playing straight-shooting cowboys and soldiers. Mother Frances Ford Seymour was a Canadian-born US socialite.He was only 10 years old when his mother died. She had a nervous breakdown after learning of her husband's affair and was confined to a hospital. In 1950 she killed herself, slashing her throat with a razor. It would be about five years before Peter Fonda learned the truth behind her death.Fonda accidentally shot himself and nearly died on his 11th birthday. It was a story he told often, including during an acid trip with members of The Beatles and The Byrds during which Fonda reportedly said, "I know what it's like to be dead."John Lennon would use the line in the Beatles song "She Said She Said."Fonda went to private schools in Massachusetts and Connecticut as a child, moving on to the University of Nebraska in his father's home state, joining the same acting group — the Omaha Community Playhouse — where Henry Fonda got his start.He then returned to New York and joined the Cecilwood Theatre, getting small roles on Broadway and guest parts on television shows including "Naked City" and "Wagon Train."Fonda had an estranged relationship with his father throughout most of his life, but said that they grew closer over the years before Henry Fonda died in 1982."Peter is all deep sweetness, kind and sensitive to his core. He would never intentionally harm anything or anyone. In fact, he once argued with me that vegetables had souls (it was the '60s)," his sister Jane Fonda said in her 2005 memoir. "He has a strange, complex mind that grasps and hangs on to details ranging from the minutiae of his childhood to cosmic matters, with a staggering amount in between. Dad couldn't appreciate and nurture Peter's sensitivity, couldn't see him as he was. Instead he tried to shame Peter into his own image of stoic independence."Although Peter never achieved the status of his father or even his older sister, the impact of "Easy Rider," which just celebrated its 50th anniversary, was enough to cement his place in popular culture.Fonda collaborated with another struggling young actor, Dennis Hopper, on the script about two weed-smoking, drug-slinging bikers on a trip through the Southwest as they made their way to New Orleans for Mardi Gras.On the way, Fonda and Hopper befriend a drunken young lawyer — Jack Nicholson in a breakout role — but raise the dander of Southern rednecks and are murdered before they can return home.Fonda's character Wyatt wore a stars-and-stripes helmet and rode a motorcycle called "Captain America," re-purposing traditional images for the counter-culture.Actress Illeana Douglas tweeted her condolences Friday with the hashtag "RIPCaptainAmerica.""'Easy Rider' depicted the rise of hippie culture, condemned the establishment, and celebrated freedom," Douglas wrote. "Peter Fonda embodied those values and instilled them in a generation."Fonda had played bikers before "Easy Rider." In the 1966 Roger Corman-directed "Wild Angels," in which he plays Heavenly Blues, leader of a band of Hells Angels, Fonda delivers a speech that could've served as both a personal mantra and a manifesto for the youth of the '60s."We wanna be free!" Fonda tells a preacher in the film. "We wanna be free to do what we wanna do. We wanna be free to ride. We wanna be free to ride our machines without being hassled by the man! And we wanna get loaded!"Fonda produced "Easy Rider" and Hopper directed it for a meager $380,000. It went on to gross $40 million worldwide, a substantial sum for its time.The film was a hit at Cannes, netted a best-screenplay Oscar nomination for Fonda, Hopper and Terry Southern, and has since been listed on the American Film Institute's ranking of the top 100 American films. The establishment gave its official blessing in 1998 when "Easy Rider" was included in the United States National Film Registry for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."In 1969, he told The Associated Press that, "As for my generation, it was time they started doing their own speaking. There has been too much of the 'silent majority' — at both ends of the generation gap."Although he did reflect later in a 2015 interview with The Hollywood Reporter that it may have impacted his career prospects: "It certainly put a nail in the coffin of 'the next Dean Jones at Disney.'"Fonda's output may have been prolific, but was not always well-regarded which he was acutely aware of. But he said that "Ulee's Gold," which came out in 1997, was the "most fun" he'd ever had making a movie. He wore the same wire-rimmed glasses his father wore in "On Golden Pond," although he said beyond that he was not channeling Henry Fonda in the performance. He lost out on the Oscar to Nicholson, who won for "As Good as It Gets."Nicholson said in his acceptance speech that it as an honor to be nominated alongside "my old bike pal Fonda."He remained prolific for the rest of his life with notable performances performances as the heel in Steven Soderbergh's "The Limey," from 1999, and in James Mangold's 2007 update of "3:10 to Yuma." He'd even play himself in an episode of the spoof documentary series "Documentary Now!" about life as "an Oscar Bridesmaid."Fonda is survived by his third wife, Margaret DeVogelaere, his daughter, actress Bridget Fonda and son, Justin, both from his first marriage to Susan Brewer."In one of the saddest moments of our lives, we are not able to find the appropriate words to express the pain in our hearts," the family said in a statement. "As we grieve, we ask that you respect our privacy."AP
