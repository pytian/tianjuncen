                Chinese personnel offer help in conflict zones Shen Yun watched her patient's heart rate drop significantly, from 60 beats per minute to 30 and even lower. Then, an oximeter - an instrument used to measure oxygen saturation in the blood - showed that the reading was 0, indicating that the patient's heart had stopped. "We've lost her," one of the nurses said. For a short while, Shen was too astonished to speak. The pregnant woman was her first patient at Abs Hospital in northwestern Yemen. "We've lost her?" a doubtful Shen asked a few seconds later. As a highly experienced obstetrician and gynecologist, Shen knew that the patient had pregnancy-induced hypertension, a condition that can put the life of mother and child at risk. In Beijing, where Shen, 46, usually works, equipment such as cardiograms, monitors and ventilators is available to support surgery. But in Yemen, where medical supplies are limited and the security situation dangerous, births that teeter between life and death are commonplace. Shen quickly decided that the woman needed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR. After working on the patient for 20 minutes, her heart started to beat on its own again. Another weak heartbeat was detected, showing that the baby was also still alive. An anesthetist quickly carried the woman to the operating theater. Shen said it took her less than 30 seconds to rush to her office and change into surgical attire. The next sound she heard was the baby boy crying after a Caesarean section. After four hours' surgery, the mother also emerged from danger. Shen worked at the Yemeni hospital from November 2017 to the following January. She was one of the volunteer doctors from the international medical and humanitarian aid organization Medecins Sans Frontieres, or Doctors Without Borders. When Shen arrived at the hospital, she was the only expatriate obstetrician and gynecologist there. On average, she received 800 to 900 patients a month, performing two to three cesarean sections a day. Most of Shen's patients in Yemen were pregnant women who were critically ill. In China, the maternal mortality rate is about 19.6 per 100,000. However, in Yemen, where the health system is in a chronic state, the rate is 385 per 100,000. "In most Chinese cities, hospital facilities today are constantly improving and upgrading, but in Yemen it's a totally different story," Shen said. She described Abs Hospital as resembling a "countryside clinic", with floors made of sand and stones. With limited room and beds, it was not unusual to see two patients sharing a bed, and sometimes a mat was used in place of a bed. Years of armed conflict in Yemen have led to numerous deaths and injuries. According to UN estimates, more than 22 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in the country. Supplies disrupted The Doctors Without Borders' aid program at Abs Hospital began in July 2015. That year, a coalition led by Saudi Arabia launched a military campaign against the Houthi rebels in Yemen, and the local medical system was paralyzed due to the increasing casualties and malnutrition resulting from the violence. Health facilities were hit by bombs, grenades and artillery fire from the warring parties, with services devastated, medical supplies disrupted and staff members forced to flee. MSF was trying to transform the local medical center at Abs Hospital into a general hospital. But within a month, aid was suspended after an airstrike hit the facility, killing 19 people, including a worker from the organization, which resumed its work in November 2015. "We wouldn't be sacrificing our money and vacations and risking our lives to save others in these dangerous places if we didn't believe in the values that Doctors Without Borders promotes," Shen said. Since it was established in 1971, the organization's mission has been to provide impartial medical relief to victims of war, disease and natural or man-made disasters, irrespective of gender, race, religion, creed or political convictions. Its teams work in some of the most difficult and dangerous places in the world. According to the organization's annual report last year, about one-third of the humanitarian medical assistance it provided was for communities caught in armed conflict. During Shen's two-month stay in Yemen, she often heard the sound of helicopters flying over the hospital. According to the Yemen Data Project, an independent monitoring group, there were 16,749 air raids in Yemen from 2015 to last year, an average of 15 a day. When Shen arrived in 2017, Doctors Without Borders opened 13 cholera treatment centers in Yemen, receiving 100,000 patients. Last year, one of the centers was bombed in airstrikes. Li Xuefeng, an anesthetist from Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, recently returned from Mosul, Iraq, his fourth assignment with Doctors Without Borders, where he provided medical care to people displaced by conflict. "As a doctor working on the frontline of conflicts, there are always many people on hand to ensure our safety," Li said. Since joining the organization in 2015, Li has carried out missions in Pakistan, South Sudan, Syria and Iraq. Similar to his work at a public hospital in Urumqi, where he needs to punch in his arrival and departure times, working on the frontline also requires him to report his working hours, not to his boss, but to a logistics manager. "Each program has at least one safety manager to deal with such work," Li said, adding that while they are working, doctors send messages to the managers to keep them abreast of their location. In addition, a "safety room" is set up for every program. "A safety room is usually built with thick bricks as protection against stray bullets. When there is a dangerous situation, all staff members enter the room and lock the door. With plenty of water, food and medical supplies inside, the organization's workers can temporarily escape from the situation outside," Li said. Although Li has been trained many times to face emergency situations, he considers himself lucky never to have had to use a safety room. But for his patients, every day is a challenge. He recalled a patient in Mosul in her thirties - around his age - with several bullet wounds to her arms and legs who needed to stay in hospital for a series of complicated surgeries. "I cannot imagine how much pain she has suffered and will suffer. The surgeries are painful. She lost her family in the conflict, including her husband, her husband's parents, and two children, one of them only 2 years old, the other 10. As the only survivor of her family, she is facing an uncertain future." To have more free time to take part in the work of Doctors Without Borders, Li resigned from the public hospital he worked for. "My next stop is Gaza, where there may be people who need me," he said. Wei Baozhu, communications officer for Doctors Without Borders in China, said, "A growing number of medical professionals in China are offering their services to aid those most in need." There are more than 40 aid workers with the organization on the Chinese mainland, and over 100 in total in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Twenty years ago, when Doctors Without Borders was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its contribution to humanitarian aid, China was on the organization's "target list". Quake support Doctors Without Borders has worked in China since 1988, initially to provide emergency assistance to people affected by natural disasters. In the decade that followed, it responded to more than 20 cases of flooding, earthquakes, snowstorms and typhoons nationwide - bringing help to tens of millions of people. In the mid-1990s, China's disaster response, management and emergency preparedness capacity, as well as the availability and quality of relief supplies, improved significantly. The organization was able to focus on the treatment of medical and infectious diseases in remote areas of the country. In 2003, it helped control the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, in Hebei province and started to give free comprehensive care and treatment to HIV-positive patients in Xiangfan, Hubei province, and Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, in partnership with Chinese health authorities. These two projects have since been handed over to the two local governments. In 2008, after the devastating earthquake in Wenchuan, Sichuan province, Doctors Without Borders provided emergency relief and psychological support to the victims. Since 2014, it has not carried out rescue projects in China. Wei said, "China's contribution to global health has largely improved in recent years, This can not only be seen in the government's continuous medical aid to regions such as Africa; more and more civilian forces and individuals are also actively engaged in international humanitarian aid." In 2007, the organization established an office on the Chinese mainland in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province. In 2004, during the Indian Ocean tsunami, its office in Hong Kong received many calls from people on the mainland, Wei said. "These people offered help and asked how they could join our organization. We felt it was time to expand our work on the mainland," Wei said. The first mainland staff member to join the organization's mission abroad was Pan Yuan, a logistics employee from Yunnan province. Pan acted as an interpreter for the organization's doctors and other employees when it responded to flooding in Hunan province in 1998. Pan was able to work for Doctors Without Borders as he can speak English, but this has proved to be a hurdle for other applicants. According to the organization's website, applicants should have at least two years' relevant professional experience and the ability to speak English or French fluently, including medical terminology. Zhang Meiwen, an epidemiologist who works for the organization's program in Cambodia, thinks the multinational environment it provides is a bonus for its workers. "The best thing about working for an international humanitarian aid agency is that background or nationality become less important," Zhang said. "Just like our mission, we treat patients impartially; thus doctors and staff members with different cultural backgrounds are also treated in this way in the organization, as we all come together with the same goal of saving lives." Zhang used to work in Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, on an HIV/AIDS program, where she found the true meaning of "without borders". During the day, she and her colleagues from different countries treated HIV/AIDS patients, regardless of whether they were sex workers, drug addicts or prison inmates. After work, the international team treated each other as family, with different colleagues always preparing dinner during weekends. "It's been almost two years since I returned from Kinshasa, but I still remember we practiced boxing every Tuesday night. We always came off duty from the hospital early and gathered in our dormitory's yard. Our boxing instructor, who was a big guy, was a driver for the emergency rescue program. Every time we trained, our muscles were sore until the following Tuesday," Zhang said. "Medical ethics, independence, impartiality and neutrality," are the principles that define the mission of Doctors Without Borders, but it is hard to put those principles into practice. Wei, the communications officer, said the organization is able to gain access to conflict-stricken areas in remote parts of the world by convincing various authorities that it is neutral and can guarantee the safety of its workers. This process can be frustrating, as the organization's workers always have to tell people - regardless of whether they are extremist or local forces - that they are neutral. There are also risks, as the doctors are unarmed. Despite this, Wei said the negotiating process is "inevitable", as it is what keeps them safe. To ensure that it operates independently, the organization collects funding largely from individuals donating small amounts. Last year, more than 6.3 million individual donors, private companies and foundations provided 95 percent of the �1.54 billion ($1.71 billion) the organization raised. "Operating independently is the quality that every member of our organization cherishes. Neutrality is the best tool to ensure our colleagues' and patients' safety. In every hospital established or supported by Doctors Without Borders, there is a large and clear sign saying that no weapons are allowed on the premises. "If a wounded soldier carrying a gun wants to enter one of our hospitals, he must leave his weapon outside. Soldiers who enter our hospitals are treated like any other patients. Whether they return to fight again, we have no right to judge. As a medical humanitarian organization, we try our best to treat the patients most in need," Wei said. panmengqi@chinadaily.com.cn   A group of migrants is transferred to the MV Aquarius off the Libyan coast on May 12 last year.

                Military and opposition sign transition deal
            </a>
            <p>
                KHARTOUM, Sudan - Sudan's Transitional Military Council and the opposition Freedom and Change Alliance signed the political and constitutional declarations on Saturday at a ceremony in the capital, Khartoum, after weeks of tortuous negotiations. The historic deal paves the way for a transition to a civilian-led government after the ouster of Sudan's former President Omar al-Bashir months ago. The political declaration determines the structures of the transitional period, including a sovereignty council, the council of ministers and the transitional legislative council. The constitutional declaration determines the powers of the transitional-period structures and members of the transitional government which will last for 39 months. A representative of the Freedom and Change Alliance, Mohamed Naji El Asam said, "Thanks to blood and sacrifices, this day has become a reality after it was a distant dream." He added that signing the documents marks a new phase, vowing that comprehensive peace is a priority. Sadiq al-Mahdi, leader of Sudan's opposition National Umma Party, said the signing of the documents constitutes "a day for entering the civilian rule which will place peace as a priority and then institutes for democracy". Earlier this month, the two sides initialed a constitutional document in the wake of international pressure amid growing concerns that the political crisis that followed Bashir's ouster. Before the beginning of the signing ceremony, Sudanese folkloric bands performed traditional songs and dances in front of the Friendship Hall, the ceremony site, to welcome the guests participating in the event. Outside the Friendship Hall, hundreds of citizens gathered on a bridge overlooking the hall, raising Sudan's flags and signs bearing "Sudan's Joy" which is the motto of the celebration. At Freedom Square, about 15 kilometers southeast of the hall, thousands of Sudanese citizens gathered to follow the signing ceremony of the two documents through giant screens inside the square. Justice and judicial accountability are also among top priorities of the coming transitional government and the judicial institutions, he noted. The coming phase is a test where there would be no exclusion with the doors open for everybody to participate in building the Sudan, he added. The TMC's Chairman Abdel-Fattah al-Burhan stressed the importance for all components of the community to work together to achieve the goals of the revolution. "Now we have surpassed the phase of preparation and are heading toward the phase of construction," said Burhan. He vowed that the Sudanese Armed Forces and other regular forces would protect the revolution and ensure the civilian transition. Members of the mediation team have also been honored during the signing ceremony.

                Appointment of chief justice, attorney general in Sudan delayed to allow for consensus
            </a>
            <p>
                KHARTOUM - A member of Sudan's new Sovereign Council said on Wednesday that appointment of chief justice and attorney general has been delayed to allow for consensus within the opposition Freedom and Change Alliance."There is disagreement over candidates of the Freedom and Change Alliance for the posts of chief justice and attorney general," Mohamed Al-Faki Suleiman told reporters after the oath-taking ceremony for members of the sovereign council."Because there are different view points, the decision over the two posts has been delayed," he added.Meanwhile, Aisha Mousa Al-Saeed, another member of the sovereign council, vowed to work to achieve aspirations of the Sudanese people and preserve the goals of the Sudanese revolution.Earlier in the day, members of Sudan's newly-formed sovereign council took the constitutional oath in the capital Khartoum, except one who would be sworn in later.Under the deal recently signed by Sudan's Transitional Military Council (TMC) and the opposition Freedom and Change Alliance, the sovereign council comprises 11 members: five military members chosen by the TMC, five civilian members chosen by the opposition alliance, and one civilian selected through consultation by the two sides.A constitutional decree is expected to be issued later on Wednesday to dissolve the TMC, which has been running Sudan's affairs since the ouster of former President Omar al-Bashir on April 11.

                Sharing the fruits of China's knowledge
            </a>

                Medardo Sanchez, an agriculture expert from El Salvador, traveled with 10 of his compatriots for nearly 50 hours to reach Hainan Island on July 15-the longest journey of his life.The contingent had come to find solutions for agricultural problems in their homeland."As a tropical country, it is a shame we have to import many lichees every year because of the low yield of local fruit trees. To our dismay, some only grow flowers and bear no fruit," said Sanchez, an adviser to El Salvador's Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry.The 25-day training course on production technology of tropical fruits for developing countries held in Hainan, China's only subtropical province, made his long journey worthwhile."I believe with the new skills learned in Hainan, lichee trees in my country will be able to bear more fruit and the output of pitaya (dragon fruit) is likely to grow 10 times from the current yield," Sanchez said at the closing ceremony on Aug 9 in Haikou, the capital of the province.Judy Ngina, an agriculture expert from Kenya, said the course, which included lectures and practical classes from academics from the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Science at Hainan University was enlightening. Subjects covered included tropical crop cultivation, propagation, fertilization, pest management and processing of tropical fruits, she said."We will take home a wealth of deeper knowledge on planting, harvesting and post-harvesting technology of tropical fruits and cannot wait to put it into practice," she said.The training course involved 28 participants from seven developing countries: El Salvador, Ghana, Kenya, the Philippines, South Africa, South Sudan and Uganda.Over the past 15 years, with support from the central and Hainan governments, CATAS has organized more than 100 training courses for 4,000 participants from 95 countries.The academy was established in 1958 and has played a major role in developing China's tropical agriculture industry, said Liu Guodao, vice-president of CATAS.
