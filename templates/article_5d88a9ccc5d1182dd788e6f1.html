                    Trump to revoke Calif. emission rules
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                US President Donald Trump has moved to revoke California's right to set its own vehicle-emissions standards, drawing criticism from state officials who said such a move is an attack on states' right and a blow to the global warming fight."This will lead to more production because of this pricing and safety advantage, but also due to the fact that older, highly polluting cars, will be replaced by new, extremely environmentally friendly cars. There will be very little difference in emissions between the California Standard and the new US Standard, but the cars will be far safer and much less expensive," Trump wrote in a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday."Many more cars will be produced under the new and uniform standard, meaning significantly more JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to California, you will be out of business," he added.The Trump administration's decision to formally revoke California's car emissions rules authority is expected to be made on Thursday morning.Andrew Wheeler, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary, are expected to announce the formal abolition of the waiver at Environmental Protection Agency headquarters.Trump made the announcement while on a trip in the Golden State. He arrived in California on Tuesday and made stops in Palo Alto, Beverly Hills and San Diego for campaign fundraising.Some California lawmakers vowed to take legal action to block Trump's move."I'm confident we will prevail eventually. It will take years and years and years, more uncertainty, more anxiety. But California will prevail because we're leaders in this space," the Los Angeles Times quoted California Governor Gavin Newsom as saying during a news conference Wednesday.California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols said the measure will have dire consequences."Millions of people in California and other states that follow our standards will be breathing dirtier air. They will suffer from more pollution, more asthma cases, more hospitalizations, more premature deaths," Nichols said.Former California governor Jerry Brown joined the fray. Responding to Trump's tweets, he said: "Your toxic tweets are insufferable, but your pillaging of our clean air is criminal."California's authority to set its own tougher emissions standards was enabled by a waiver issued by Congress during the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970.California's tighter emissions standards are followed by 13 other states, which represents roughly a third of the national auto market, according to The New York Times.If the Trump administration's move is upheld in court, it could permanently block states from regulating vehicle greenhouse gas pollution. If it were rejected by the Supreme Court, it would allow states to set their own emissions standards.On Wednesday, Trump showed off a section of wall along the U.S. border with Mexico in a bid to illustrate his commitment to crack down on illegal border crossings.The Republican president, who is on a three-day swing through the US West that has included a rally in New Mexico and a number of fundraisers in California, also used his trip to criticize the homelessness problem in Los Angeles and San Francisco, two heavily Democratic cities.Trump traveled to Otay Mesa, a community in San Diego, to view the construction of a 30-foot-high (9-meter-high) steel and concrete barrier that is replacing existing border fencing. Trump said the wall goes deep into the ground, making it difficult to tunnel underneath, and is topped with heat-absorbing material to deter climbers.Reuters contributed to this story.

                    Jinan's springs soak up global attention
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Region's famous natural assets remain top priority for preservation As the sun rose on a warm September morning at Black Tiger Spring in Jinan, East China's Shandong province, groups of people wait in line to fill their buckets with fresh spring water gushing out from the rocks. Using spring water to cook, wash and drink is the local way in Jinan, which makes the "city of springs" so special to visitors from home and abroad. Jinan has more than 800 springs, including 72 famous ones such as Baotu Spring, Black Tiger Spring, Moquan Spring and Shuyu Spring. Black Tiger Spring is located below a steep cliff in the city's Lixia district. The water laps the rocks, creating a sound like a tiger's growl. The water outflow reaches up to 41,000 cubic meters per day, less only than the nearby Baotu Spring. In June 2019, the cultural landscape of springs in Jinan was included on a tentative list of new Chinese World Heritage sites. "For hundreds of years, people have lived with springs. The city is energized by springs," said Sun Shutao, mayor of Jinan, at the 2019 International Spring Cultural Landscape City Alliance Conference held earlier this month. "The unique natural landscape and culture is an example of humans respecting nature and realizing sustainable development," he said. Jinan is also home to Daming Lake, which is formed solely by springs, and home to the spring water city moat. In olden times, residents even had springs in their own yards. Long Yongtu, former vice-minister of the then Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said at the conference that Jinan reminds him of the French town of Evian, where residents and tourists happily fill up empty bottles with water from springs. Nowadays, people ask for cleaner water, clearer skies, safer food and more convenient transport, in seeking a higher quality of life. That's why Jinan puts so much effort into preserving its springs, as historical heritage and urban cultural landscape, Long added. The city also considers the protection of its springs while planning and constructing its subway system and renovating old communities, according to Sun. Rick Jennings, a councilor from the city of Sacramento in California, said at the event: "I've watched the children and old people in Jinan. They take pride in how they continue to take advantage of the city's resources. I've seen so many people visiting the parks and being able to use the water. That's a memory I will have for the rest of my life." The conference coincided with the seventh Jinan international springs festival, held from Sept 6 to 11, and was accompanied by a series of activities, including a spring worshipping ceremony, a music festival, a folk arts week, a night tour and float parade. During the festival, journalists from 12 media agencies in countries including the United States, Russia, Cambodia, Mongolia, Laos, South Korea and Japan toured the city as participants of the Discover Jinan media trip, co-organized by the foreign affairs office of the Jinan municipal people's government and China Daily. The group visited the 648-year-old Mingfucheng Historical Area, which has over 100 springs, and Baihuazhou Historical and Cultural Block, which features some of the 126 intangible cultural heritage and traditional handicrafts of the city, as well as about 100 inheritors, including those of shadow puppetry, paper-cutting, wood carving and clay rabbit figurine making. Li Juan, an inheritor of shadow puppetry, said the art form remains popular even in the digital age, with children learning and taking courses. She said that the government has supported her work with its effort to preserve traditional culture. Kristina Zorkina, an editor from ITAR-TASS news agency in Russia, said in her country they have a similar art form, but the puppets are made from different materials. Muhammad Imran, a reporter from Dawn News in Pakistan, said he had also seen similar puppetry when he was younger, but it is no longer popular in his home country. According to Mayor Sun, the city of Jinan is promoting its intangible cultural heritage by financing major cultural programs, holding courses in communities and schools and encouraging heritage to go global. chenmeiling@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily 09/20/2019 page12)

                    UFO devotees headed to Nevada, and maybe 'Area 51'
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The US Navy has confirmed that three recently released videos show "unidentified aerial phenomena", as UFO aficionados plan to descend on Rachel, Nevada, this weekend — with some planning to storm Area 51, a secret government research and development site believed by some to house alien spacecraft.The web page for the high desert town, elevation 4,970 feet (1,515 meters), advises visitors, "The nearest gas station or store is 50 miles (80.5 kilometers) south in Ash Springs or 110 miles (177 kilometers) north in Tonopah." It notes, "Population: Humans 54. Aliens??"Discussion of UFOs has been a staple of late-night talk radio and fodder for volunteer groups such as the Mutual UFO Network and National UFO Reporting Center. The Navy's videos are likely to heighten the mystery.The Navy says it doesn't know what the objects are. All the videos were taken from Navy ships. One video from 2004 and two videos from 2015 show incursions into military training areas.The Black Vault, a website dedicated to "exposing government secrets one page at a time", first reported the Navy's "unidentified aerial phenomena" designation. The videos are known as "FLIR1", "Gimbal" and "GoFast''. The first video was taken off the California coast, and the others were taken off the Virginia coast.The first video shows an oblong object that quickly accelerates out of view. The second includes a crew member saying, "Look at that thing!" The third shows an object that appears over the water, and a sailor using salty language asks, "What is that, man?"The first video was posted online by a crew member in 2007, but the Navy didn't discover it until 2009 and took no disciplinary action. The Navy said it had "no information" on how the second and third videos were released.In 2017, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program had investigated UFO reports for years, but the program was shut down in 2012. Some UFO enthusiasts see this as part of an ongoing effort to mislead the public.Many UFO proponents believe Area 51 contains flying saucers that have crashed and are being reverse engineered. Security is tight around Area 51. Signs posted on the perimeter read, "Restricted Area/No Trespassing/Beyond This Point" and "Photography Prohibited".It's unclear what goes on at Area 51, but as some prior media reports have suggested, it may be something as prosaic as developing radar-evading stealth aircraft.The organizer who planned "Alienstock" — the storming of Area 51 — has pulled out and advised others to stay away because it's not safe.Some apparently didn't get the word because the only motel in Rachel, the six-unit Little A'le'Inn, appears to be booked."Super-busy now. Can't talk," a woman who answered the phone said before slamming the receiver down.Route 375 through the Nevada desert is known as the "Extraterrestrial Highway" and says so on the road signs. Officials have taken the signs down because if the Little Green Men from a faraway galaxy don't steal them, the souvenir hunters might.

                    China Now Music Festival looks to unite with music to counter political differences
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                "Politics often divides people, but in art and music, you always find connections," renowned Chinese conductor Cai Jindong said.Cai is the director of the US-China Music Institute, based at Bard College in upstate New York, and also artistic director of the China Now Music Festival (Sept 25-Oct 6).At a news conference Thursday at the Museum of Chinese in America in New York, Cai said that he sees the festival, in its second season, as a cultural counterpoint to the current political landscape."With the China Now Music Festival as our looking glass, we hope to continue bringing people and traditions from China and America together through music," he said.According to Cai, the festival's major concerts will take place at Carnegie Hall in New York City and at Bing Concert Hall at Stanford University in California.The festival is dedicated to promoting an understanding and appreciation of music from contemporary China through an annual series of concerts and academic activities.This year's theme is "China and America – Unity in Music", in recognition of the 40th anniversary of the normalizing of diplomatic relations between the US and China in 1979.One of the musical highlights of the festival will take place on Oct 1 at the Stern Auditorium/Perelman Stage at Carnegie Hall.From the Middle Kingdom to the Wild West is an orchestral concert featuring the world premiere of Men of Iron and the Golden Spike, a symphonic oratorio by celebrated composer Zhou Long.The piece was created to honor the more than 20,000 Chinese laborers who contributed to the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in the American West 150 years ago.Cai said the Chinese railroad workers played a pivotal role in the westward expansion of the US during the 19th century, but their labors were not widely reported and have rarely been acknowledged. "Zhou Long's oratorio will give new voice to their epic story," he said.Zhou is well known for his blending of Chinese and Western elements to create singularly expressive compositions. His masterpieces, including the 2010 opera Madame White Snake, earned him a Pulitzer Prize.Zhou's latest concerto for orchestra, Classic of Mountain and Seas, will also have its US premiere on the same day.Both pieces will be performed by The Orchestra Now, conducted by the festival artistic director Cai Jindong.The orchestra will follow the path of the great rail line that connected East to West by performing the concert a second time at Stanford University's Bing Concert Hall on Oct 6.Another festival concert will take place on Sept 30 at Carnegie Hall in New York.Titled Wellington Koo the Diplomat – A Life in Song, the multimedia concert with video projections, dramatic narration and music, will explore Koo's role in opening China to the world and developing its relationship with the United States.Diplomat Wellington Koo participated in some of the most important events of the 20th century, famously refusing to sign the 1919 Treaty of Versailles out of concern for China's position in the postwar reorganization of world power, then serving as ambassador to the US and as a judge in the International Court of Justice. Koo also played a major role in the creation of the United Nations.According to Shirley Young, chair of the US-China Cultural Institute, producer of the concert, this year's festival will coincide with New York state's newly announced Senate Resolution No. J2103 by Senator James Sanders Jr. of Queens, "recognizing October 1, 2019, as China Day and the first week of October 2019, as Chinese American Heritage Week, "to strengthen the friendship and bilateral relationship between the State of New York and Chinese Americans", she said.Other festival events include panel discussions, lectures and film previews that will explore more topics in US-China relations.

                    California, 22 other states sue Trump over climate change rules
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                A group of 23 states on Friday sued to block the Trump administration from undoing California's authority to set strict car pollution rules, one of the biggest US battles over climate change.On the day that young people around the world staged protests demanding action on climate, the lawsuit in US District Court in Washington was the first round in a legal battle that many expect will outlast Trump's presidency."Mr. President, we'll see you in court," California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement.The legal fight pits a state that has become the US environmental champion against a president who wants to boost the economy by cutting regulation, a debate that already is playing out ahead of the presidential election next year.The Trump administration is seeking to reverse decades of precedent that has allowed California a national role in deciding what Americans drive as it regulated vehicle emissions."Trump's latest move is bad for our air. Bad for our health. Bad for our economy," said California Governor Gavin Newsom.California's vehicle emissions rules, more stringent than the Trump EPA's rules, are followed by a dozen other states that account for more than 40 percent of US vehicle sales.Trump has said looser tailpipe emissions rules would make vehicles cheaper. Environmentalists argue Trump's rules will hasten climate change, and that emissions rules improve fuel economy, lowering consumer costs.The states, led by California and joined by the District of Columbia, Los Angeles and New York City, sued the US Transportation Department in US District Court seeking a court order blocking the federal move.The states suing include New York, Michigan, Colorado, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Washington State and Massachusetts.The US Transportation Department declined to comment. It said on Thursday in its determination that federal law preempts state and local regulation of vehicle fuel economy, including California's greenhouse gas vehicle emissions rules that are followed by about a dozen other states.The legal challenge does not address a parallel decision by the US Environmental Protection Agency to revoke a 2013 waiver California received under the Clean Air Act to set emissions standards. That does not take effect until late November.The Trump administration is seeking to reverse decades of precedent that has allowed California a national role in deciding what Americans drive as it regulated vehicle emissions.Becerra said the Transportation Department's determination was unlawful, and that the administration misread federal law and ignored the intent of Congress."The administration insists on attacking the authority of California and other states to tackle air pollution and protect public health," Becerra said.The Trump administration has been waging a multi-pronged battle to counter the state's efforts to fight climate change by reducing emissions of greenhouse gasses from vehicles.In August, the Justice Department launched an antitrust probe of Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen, BMW and Honda Motor Co that struck a voluntary agreement with California to vehicle reduce emissions.The Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2025, with average annual increases of about 5%, compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration's preferred option to freeze requirements.Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said Thursday the administration will finalize revisions in the coming weeks. "No state has the authority to opt out of the nation's rules and no state has the right to impose its policies on everybody else in our whole country," she said.REUTERS

                    Xinjiang food festival debuts in San Francisco East Bay Area
                </p>
            </a>

                SAN FRANCISCO - A food festival was held Saturday in San Francisco's East Bay Area to offer Americans "a bite of unique traditional foods" from Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.The first Xinjiang, China Food Festival, hosted by Eden Silk Road Cuisine Restaurant in Fremont as part of the 6th edition of the Across Pacific-China Arts Festival, showcased not only specialty cuisines in Xinjiang, but also local traditional costumes such as velvet hats, silk embroidery, as well as bronze plates commonly used by the Uygur ethnic group.The arts festival to last through Oct 18 features Chinese dances, folk songs, acrobatics, visual arts events presenting Chinese and US paintings, Chinese tourism shows and intangible Chinese cultural heritages among others.Chinese Deputy Consul General in San Francisco Ren Faqiang said the food festival turns Xinjiang food into a bridge connecting the peoples of China and the United States."Foods are beyond borders, and the foods from different cultures and countries contributed to the diversity of the thriving food culture across the world," he said."Events like the food festival makes it possible for people to come together to share their love and food experience, which plays a positive role in their joint efforts to build a better, harmonious world," Ren said.David Haubert, mayor of Dublin City in Northern California, said each town has its own food and flavor."I love having a diversity of food, and having a restaurant like this with the great food that is different than other foods only helps to make the selection of restaurants more appealing to more people," he said. "Variety is very good for all of our lives and our city."Restaurant owner Zulpikar Abaidula said, "The Xinjiang cuisine actually represents the integration of different ethnic groups of the Chinese people with their own local cultures.""With this restaurant and its wonderful foods, I want the American people and the world to know that the majority of the people of the Uygur ethnic group love peace and unity among China's various nationalities," Abaidula noted.He hoped that his restaurant will serve as a window through which the people from around the world could know more about Xinjiang.
