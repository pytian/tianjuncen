                Power outage hits parts of Venezuelan capital
            </p>
            <p>
                CARACAS - Power failures left "several zones" of Venezuela's capital Caracas and the central state of Miranda without electricity on Tuesday, the National Electricity Corporation (Corpoelec) said.Corpoelec technicians were working to restore service, the company said via Twitter.The power outage interrupted subway service in Caracas, as well as train service linking the capital with Miranda.The Caracas Metro notified commuters via Twitter that stations along lines 1, 2 and 3 were closed due to the power failure, while the State Railway Institute issued a similar notification.Authorities at the National Institute of Transit and Overland Transportation launched a contingency plan to provide transport in cases of emergency.Since March, Venezuela has suffered from a series of crippling blackouts that have interrupted the supply of basic services, such as potable water, and caused the closure of schools and government offices.The government has said investigations into the power failures uncovered sabotage against the country's power infrastructure and software.A blackout in July was caused by an electromagnetic attack, said Mexican Communication and Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez.Officials have blamed the blackouts on the US-backed opposition and its campaign to generate widespread discontent in a bid to oust the ruling party.

                Groups sue to block Trump administration's expansion of rapid deportations
            </a>
            <p>
                Advocacy groups sued the Trump administration on Tuesday in an effort to block a rule published last month that expands the number of migrants who can be subject to a sped-up deportation process without oversight by an immigration judge.The rule, published in the Federal Register on July 23, broadened the practice of "expedited removal" to apply to anyone arrested anywhere nationwide who entered the United States illegally and cannot prove they have lived continuously in the country for at least two years.Previously, only migrants caught within 100 miles of a US border and who had been in the country for 14 days or less were subject to the fast-track process.Under expedited removal, migrants are not entitled to a review of their cases in front of an immigration judge or access to an attorney.The lawsuit, filed in US District Court in Washington, DC, by the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Immigration Council on behalf of three immigration rights groups, claims the government did not go through the proper procedures in issuing the rule and says it violates due process and US immigration laws.The US Department of Justice declined to comment on the filing.President Donald Trump has struggled to stem an increase of mostly Central American families arriving at the US-Mexico border, leading to overcrowded detention facilities and a political battle over immigration that is inflaming tensions in the country. In El Paso, Texas, last weekend a gunman killed 22 people after apparently posting an anti-immigrant manifesto online.Nearly 300,000 of the approximately 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally could be quickly deported under the new rule, according to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute."Hundreds of thousands of people living anywhere in the US are at risk of being separated from their families and expelled from the country without any recourse," Anand Balakrishnan, an attorney with the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, said in a statement.The government has said increasing rapid deportations would free up detention space and ease strains on immigration courts, which face a backlog of more than 900,000 cases.People in rapid deportation proceedings are detained for 11.4 days on average, according to the US Department of Homeland Security. People in regular proceedings are held for 51.5 days and are released into the United States for the months or years it takes to resolve their cases.Reuters

                Gunmen kill 5 at bus station in central Mexican resort
            </a>
            <p>
                MEXICO CITY -- Five men were shot and killed at an interstate bus terminal in the central Mexican city of Cuernavaca early Monday, local officials said.The execution-style killings sent shock waves through Cuernavaca, a popular weekend getaway in Morelos state for wealthy Mexican residents."This was an execution, they planned this," Morelos Gov. Cuauhtemoc Blanco told reporters.Authorities investigating the case said it appeared the assailants were specifically targeting the victims, not carrying out an attack on the terminal, which belongs to the Estrella de Oro (Gold Star) bus line.Another man was injured in the attack at 4:40 am local time, and was taken to hospital.Local media said armed men in pursuit of the victims opened fire in the parking area and the ticket selling area of the terminal, which was temporarily closed after the incident.The state security commission said average citizens were not at risk from "the fight between criminal rings."Homicides have shot up in Morelos state due to warfare between rival organized crime rings involved in drug dealing and extortion, according to officials.

                US Supreme Court backs Trump administration's tough asylum restrictions
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON -- The US Supreme Court late Wednesday permitted the Trump administration to enforce its tough asylum restrictions nationwide prohibiting migrants from seeking asylum in the United States.The rule, put forward by the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security on July 15, will disallow asylum application by migrants entering the United States through a third country without seeking protection there.The Trump administration said it was necessary to limit the number of Central American migrants crossing the US southern border via Mexico, citing "an unprecedented surge of" people enter the United States "illegally" and seek asylum when they are caught."BIG United States Supreme Court WIN for the Border on Asylum!" Trump tweeted after the Supreme Court announced the order.Among the nine Supreme Court Justices, Associate Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented the order. "Once again the Executive Branch has issued a rule that seeks to upend longstanding practices regarding refugees who seek shelter from persecution," Sotomayor wrote in her dissent.Sotomayor said asking green light to the rule is "an extraordinary request" from the administration to the Supreme Court. "Unfortunately, the Court acquiesces."The American Civil Liberty Union (ACLU), a nationwide non-profit organization that claims to defend the individual rights and liberties, also challenged the rule.The ACLU wrote in response to the Supreme Court's order, the current ban would eliminate virtually all asylum at the southern border, even at ports of entry, for everyone except Mexicans, who did not need to transit through a third country to reach the United States. "The court should not permit such a tectonic change to US asylum law."

                Mexico marks Independence Day with military parade
            </a>
            <p>
                MEXICO CITY - More than 12,500 soldiers, marines and National Guards took part in a military parade here on Monday to celebrate Mexico's Independence Day.Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador presided over the parade from the central balcony of the National Palace that overlooks the capital's main square, where tens of thousands of onlookers gathered.It was the first military parade in his presidential term.Lopez Obrador, flanked by his wife and top military aides, inspected 24 blocks of troops passing by the square. Eight military planes flew overhead in formation. 15 parachutists descended onto the square and landed in front of the National Palace.Then, a contingent of the newly-formed National Guard, which made history by taking part in a military parade for the first time, came in following an outsize Mexican flag.Lopez Obrador's administration formed the National Guard this year in a bid to establish a security force untainted by corruption to tackle rising level of crimes.The parade, which marked the 209th anniversary of Mexico's independence from Spanish rule in 1810, closed with 20 planes flying in formation and leaving a trail of smoke above the square.A total of 74 military aircraft, some 135 representatives from the National Guard or similar foreign organizations, as well as rescue teams from Mexican civil agencies took part in the parade.According to Mexico City's police department, the parade drew some 400,000 people who lined the parade route leading to the main plaza.
