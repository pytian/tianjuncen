                New NBA measures bid to curb tampering violations
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                NBA team owners passed stricter measures to force compliance with player tampering and salary-cap rules on Friday after a wild offseason where several top stars changed clubs.The tougher regulations provide for fines of up to $10 million, voiding of contracts, forfeiting of NBA draft selections and suspensions of team executives who seek to attract players while they are under contract to another team."We need to ensure that we're creating a culture of compliance in this league and our teams want to know they're competing on a level playing field and frankly don't want to feel disadvantaged if they are adhering to our existing rules," NBA commissioner Adam Silver said."What we are really seeking again is a cultural change in the league, that all the partners in the league are essentially saying this is the kind of league we operate."The issue came to a head after stars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving joined the Brooklyn Nets shortly after becoming free agents - when the official negotiating period for free agents and clubs had barely begun.Other deals that were eventually consummated came to light before talks were even supposed to start.There was also concern about players talking with each other about possible moves, such as Kawhi Leonard wanting Paul George to join him on the Los Angeles Clippers while George had a contract with the Oklahoma City Thunder."The ultimate goal here is to ensure compliance and to ensure that there's that appropriate tension that exists at the team," Silver said. "So there is sort of a significant threat that if a team doesn't comply that there will be consequences."Among the ways the league will toughen the tampering rules is a random audit of communications for five NBA teams, with Silver having the power to confiscate communication devices under the new regulations."I'm not looking to take devices," he said. "We do have the power to take people's devices. That is not something, certainly in the first instance, we would be looking to do."I think that we can create the appropriate culture without, certainly on a random basis, people feeling that's necessary. We also have lots of other tools available to us."Fines, Silver said, have proven ineffective at deterring violations."There's a general sense in this league that among the tools we have to ensure compliance, fining authority unto itself may be one of the least effective tools," he said."So within the power that already has been vested in the league, there is the ability to impact competition directly by suspending executives, taking away draft picks and voiding contracts."While not vowing a foolproof system, Silver warned potential violators: "We believe through these tools, we're dramatically going to increase the likelihood that we're going to catch you."Some issues the league wants to examine, such as changing the dates for free agency, must be done in conjunction with the players' union.But moves such as George leaving the Thunder for the Clippers show how much influence the bigger stars can have on other players and, by extension, their teams.An individual player's ability to change the fortunes of a team "provides enormous leverage for that player", Silver said.Agence France-Presse

                ISTANBUL, Sept. 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Dairy Federation (IDF) on Sunday accepted a Chinese executive into its board of directors and agreed on China hosting federation conferences in the next four years.Lu Minfang, the global chief executive officer of China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited, is the first Chinese to join the IDF board of directors since its inception in 1903.Speaking to Xinhua, he said as the Chinese and global dairy industries are highly integrated now, he would like to take advantage of his new status to promote better integration of their structural changes so as to "more efficiently reset the supply chain, utilize the technologies and promote global trade, in particular multilateral trade."At the IDF general assembly in Istanbul, the federation also signed an agreement with China Dairy Industry Association for its annual summit and other meetings to be held in China by 2023.IDF President Judith Bryans has seen "huge striving and advancement" in the Chinese dairy industry since she visited China 10 years ago."Since then I have seen huge innovation in terms of product development and sustainability and technology," she told Xinhua."We are absolutely delighted to welcome Lu into the IDF board of directors. The connection between IDF and IDF China is extremely important. I was delighted to have China's voice much stronger, which has developed over the years much stronger now within the IDF," she added.The Chinese dairy sector should work toward technological innovation and international cooperation while maintaining products quality, Liu Meiju, vice chairwoman and secretary general of China Dairy Industry Association and vice chairwoman of IDF National Committee of China, told Xinhua.The Brussels-based IDF, the only organization representing the entire dairy value chain at a global level, is scheduled to open its four-day 2019 World Dairy Summit in Istanbul on Monday.

                    Restored version of Soviet-made documentary on China screened in Beijing
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                Between September 1949 and 1950, the Soviet Union sent two film production teams to China. And joining hands with staff from Beijing Film Studio, the crews shot three color documentaries to reflect different facets of New China.Recently, Jie Fang Le de Zhong Guo (Liberated China), a restored version of one of the three films -- spanning 88 minutes -- was screened at the China Film Archive in downtown Beijing, as part of the organization's events to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.In the documentary audience can see China's then urban landscape and the country's efforts to build a better life for Chinese people.Besides, the Archive has also teamed up with Comic Book Publishing House, the country's only state-owned publisher specializing in comic books, to publish an anthology of 10 comic books about 10 classic films, including director Huo Jianqi's Postmen in the Mountains.

                Latvian beach volleyball grabbed both the men's and women's spots for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics after winning the qualification event on Sunday.The FIVB Tokyo Beach Volleyball Qualification started in Haiyang in East China's Shandong province on Wednesday, with 16 men's and women's teams from the FIVA's top-ranked 15 countries participating in a five-day competition.The Latvian women's team beat the Czech Republic 2 to 1 on Sunday after their male counterparts won the qualification the day before.The Czech pair is the former world No 1, while Latvia won the 2019 European championships. The Czech Republic was 2 points behind from victory at 13-9 in the deciding third set when the Latvian pair came from behind to win 17-15.This marks the first time a Latvian beach volleyball pair will enter the Olympics.Another qualified quota went to Spain's women's team and Italy's men's team.Joined by winning teams from the Haiyang qualifier, the world's top 15-ranked teams will enter the Tokyo Olympics automatically. China's Wang Fan/Xia Xinyi, ranked 20th and knocked out in the qualification, will take part in more matches to elevate their ranking.The qualification marks the highest-tier beach volleyball event in China.Haiyang, a coastal city in East China's Shandong province, is renowned for its fine grain sand and national forest park. It emerged as the nation's beach sport destination after hosting the third Asian Beach Games in 2012, following other national and world events, like the Beach Soccer World Cup and the National Beach Volleyball Tour.
