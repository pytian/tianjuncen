                San Francisco labels NRA as 'domestic terrorist'
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                San Francisco's legislature has passed a resolution labeling the National Rifle Association a "domestic terrorist organization". The measure by the city's Board of Supervisors, passed on Tuesday, also states that "the City and County of San Francisco should take every reasonable step to limit those entities who do business with the City and County ... from doing business with this domestic terrorist organization". "The National Rifle Association musters its considerable wealth and organizational strength to promote gun ownership and incite gun owners to acts of violence," the resolution states. "The National Rifle Association spreads propaganda that misinforms and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence, and ... the leadership of National Rifle Association promotes extremist positions, in defiance of the views of a majority of its membership and the public, and undermine the general welfare." In response, the Fairfax, Virginia-based NRA said in a statement: "This ludicrous stunt by the Board of Supervisors is an effort to distract from the real problems facing San Francisco, such as rampant homelessness, drug abuse and skyrocketing petty crime, to name a few. The NRA will continue working to protect the constitutional rights of all freedom-loving Americans." San Francisco City Supervisor Catherine Stefani introduced the resolution after a mass shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in Northern California on July 28. Three people, including two children, were fatally shot and 17 injured. Twenty-two people were killed in a mass shooting at Walmart shopping center in El Paso, Texas, on Aug 3; nine in Dayton, Ohio, on Aug 4; and seven in Odessa and Midland, Texas, on Aug 31. "People are dying every day in this country," Stefani said on Tuesday in an interview with KTVU in Oakland. "Doing nothing is not an option. And that's what the NRA continues to do." US corporate reaction to gun violence this week included Cincinnati-based supermarket chain Kroger joining Walmart in requesting customers not to openly carry firearms in states where such behavior is legal. Walmart also said this week that it would stop selling ammunition for handguns and short-barrel rifles. "Rather than place the blame on the criminal, Walmart has chosen to victimize law-abiding Americans," the NRA said in response to the firearms policy changes by the Bentonville, Arkansas, retail giant. Dick's Sporting Goods announced in March it would stop selling firearms and ammunition at 125 of its 700-plus locations. Kroger said last year that it would do the same at its Fred Meyer stores in the Pacific Northwest. Starbucks, Target and Wendy's also have asked customers not to openly carry firearms when they visit their premises, even if legal to do so. But they are not enforcing a ban because they don't want to put their employees in confrontational situations.

                    US to withdraw from int'l arms trade treaty

                WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump announced on Friday that the United States is withdrawing from an international arms trade treaty signed by the Obama administration, marking Washington's latest exit from an international pact.Trump made the announcement while attending an annual meeting of the National Rifle Association (NRA) in the US city of Indianapolis, saying that he will be revoking America's status as a signatory of the pact supported by the Untied Nations."We're taking our signature back," Trump told the audience. He also noted that the UN will soon receive formal notice of the US withdrawal.The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), which regulates international trade in conventional weapons from small arms to military aircraft, was approved by the UN General Assembly in 2013. It was signed by then US President Barack Obama but has not been ratified by the US Senate.The White House said later in a statement that Trump will ask the Senate to return it.The White House claimed the pact is "misguided" and constrains US ability to sell arms to its allies and partners.The Trump administration's new move has drawn criticism from some international human rights groups.The United States will now behave as a non-signatory to "this historic treaty whose sole purpose is to protect innocent people from deadly weapons," Oxfam America President Abby Maxman told US media.Kris Brown, the president of an anti-gun violence organization in the United States, said in a tweet, "This is a reckless move that will endanger countless Americans and other innocent people worldwide."So far more than 100 countries have formally joined the agreement.Since Trump took office in 2017, the United States has retreated from several global treaties, including the landmark Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal.

                Retired US Marine Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North will step down as president of the National Rifle Association, North said on Saturday, adding he was being forced out due to his allegations that NRA leaders engaged in financial improprieties.In a letter to the organization’s annual meeting in Indianapolis read by an NRA board member, North, a conservative commentator best known for his central role in the 1980s Iran-Contra affair, said he will not stand for re-election when his term ends on Monday.North, who was named by the NRA as its president in May 2018, was a pivotal figure in the Iran-Contra affair involving secret sales of arms to Iran by Republican President Ronald Reagan’s administration and the unlawful diversion of the proceeds to Nicaraguan rebels.On Friday, US President Donald Trump addressed the NRA’s annual meeting and vowed to revoke the United States’ status as a signatory of the Arms Trade Treaty.Reuters

                    EU slams Trump's withdrawal from UN arms trade deal signed by Obama
                </p>

                The European Union warned on Saturday that US President Donald Trump's rejection of a UN treaty designed to regulate the global arms trade would hamper the global fight against illicit weapons trafficking, Agence France-Presse. "A decision by the US to revoke its signature would not contribute to the ongoing efforts to encourage transparency in the international arms trade, to prevent illicit trafficking and to combat the diversion of conventional arms," said the EU's chief diplomat, Federica Mogherini. "The EU will continue to call on all states, and in particular the major arms exporters and importers, to join the Arms Trade Treaty without delay," she said. Trump announced on Friday that his country is withdrawing from an international arms trade treaty signed by the Obama administration, marking Washington's latest move to quit an international pact, Xinhua News Agency reported. Trump made the announcement while attending an annual meeting of the National Rifle Association, or NRA, in the US city of Indianapolis, saying that he will be revoking US status as a signatory to the pact supported by the United Nations. "We're taking our signature back," Trump told the audience. He also noted that the UN will soon receive formal notice of the US withdrawal. The Arms Trade Treaty, or ATT, which regulates international trade in conventional weapons from small arms to military aircraft, was approved by the UN General Assembly in 2013. It was signed by former president Barack Obama but has not been ratified by Senate. The White House said later in a statement that Trump will ask the Senate to return it. The White House claimed the pact is "misguided" and constrains US ability to sell arms to its allies and partners. A senior US government official told reporters on Friday that Washington is also concerned that the treaty is opening for amendment in 2020. "There are significant concerns about proposals that are out there in discussion ... for how to use that amendment period to further constrain what countries like the United States might do to undermine our sovereignty," the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told reporters in teleconference briefing. "The US already has significant controls in place to regulate our conventional arms transfers," the official added. The Trump administration's new move has sparked criticism. The US will now behave as a non-signatory to the "treaty whose sole purpose is to protect innocent people from deadly weapons," Abby Maxman, president of Oxfam America, a global organization on poverty reduction, told US media. Since Trump took office in 2017, the US has retreated from several global treaties, including the landmark Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal. (China Daily Global 04/29/2019 page6)

                    Diverse panda bond issuers reap benefits
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Home to the world's third-largest bond market worth more than 86 trillion yuan ($12.45 trillion), China has already attracted more than 1,200 overseas institutions to its onshore market so far.Thanks to large trading volumes and a wide investor base, issuing renminbi-denominated bonds, or the panda bonds, in the onshore market has become more popular not only for sovereign issuers but foreign companies.Semiconductor Manufacturing International Co, which is registered in Cayman Islands, is a case in point. It sold 500 million yuan panda bonds in the interbank market on April 29. China Chengxin International Credit Rating's AAA label suggested SMIC's panda bonds were regarded as of top quality.According to the prospectus, the proceeds will be used to fund SMIC's Shanghai subsidiary and narrow the latter's 4.5 billion yuan financing gap.As per local regulations, SMIC opened a non-resident account, or NRA, in Chinese banks for settlement. SMIC could borrow money from its cross-border RMB capital pool and transfer the fund to its Shanghai subsidiary.As an increasing number of international companies start to do business in China, panda bonds have become an important tool to raise funds to support their domestic projects and operations.Yuan-denominated bonds will help reduce currency rate risks, said Wang Tailei, a researcher at the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors.Some of the world's Top 500 companies, such as Daimler AG, BMW and Air Liquidity, have issued panda bonds in China. "For international issuers, entering the Chinese bond market means they can tap a larger number of investors with diversified risk appetite," said Wang.Besides, since 2016, the Chinese yuan has been part of the International Monetary Fund's basket of Special Drawing Rights, or SDRs, the supplementary foreign exchange reserve assets. So, global investors are more interested in holding yuan-denominated assets to hedge currency rate risks, said experts."Corporations are diversifying their investments by increasing RMB bonds, instead of focusing on investment in US dollar bonds," said Ivan Chung, head of China credit research and analysis at Moody's Investors Services.The panda bond issuance cost is one of the key factors that global issuers consider before deciding the currency in which they issue their bonds. The RMB exchange rate against the US dollar, and China's interest rate level compared with the US Federal Reserve's policy rates, may influence the panda bond issuance levels, said Chung.Global investors hope the Chinese financial regulators will remove certain policy restrictions, market insiders said.On their wish list is permission for foreign investors to freely transfer positions among the existing cross-border investment mechanisms like qualified financial institutional investors, RMB-qualified foreign institutional investors, bond connects and China interbank bond market accounts.This, they believe, will help improve the efficiency of fund deployment, said Guo Kai, deputy director-general of the International Department of the People's Bank of China."But a big gap remains in the depth and breadth of the bond market in China compared with that of major reserve-currency-issuing countries. China needs to further develop, open up, and improve the quality of the bond market not only to maintain financial stability as an emerging market but to meet the need for the yuan to become a major reserve currency," said Guo.

                    5 dead, 21 hurt in Texas shooting

                Attacker opened fire at random before he was shot dead by police WASHINGTON - A gunman hijacked a US postal truck and opened fire at random in the US state of Texas on Saturday, shooting dead at least five people and wounding many others before dying in a shootout with officers. Police identified the suspect as a white man in his mid-30s, but could not yet name him or say why he carried out the attack in the West Texas cities of Midland and Odessa. Coming less than a month after a gunman killed 22 people in the Texas city of El Paso, the latest bloodshed immediately ignited fresh calls for gun control to stem the US scourge of mass shootings.  Authorities control traffic on the street after the shooting in Odessa, Texas, on Saturday. Mark Rogers / AP"We have at least 21 victims, 21 shooting victims and at least five deceased at this point in time," said Odessa city Police Chief Michael Gerke. Three police officers were injured, he said. The Odessa Police Department had earlier reported that a suspect was "driving around Odessa shooting at random people" and "just hijacked a US mail carrier truck". Troopers had initially tried to pull over a passenger vehicle on the Interstate 20 highway but before it stopped, "the male driver (and only occupant in the vehicle) pointed a rifle toward the rear window of his car and fired several shots toward the DPS patrol unit," the Texas Department of Public Safety said in a statement. One trooper was wounded, the suspect fled the scene, "and continued shooting innocent people", the department statement said. Some of the shots were fired on the highway linking the cities of Odessa and Midland, where cars were left with bullet holes. "I just found out a friend of mine passed away," David Turner, the mayor of Odessa, told Fox News. "This coward pulls up beside" and opens fire on the car where the man and his family were waiting at a stop light, Turner said. During his rampage, the suspect had switched vehicles by hijacking the postal van, and Gerke said he "would assume" the postal worker was among the victims. Police said the suspect died during an exchange of fire with law enforcement at a movie theater in Odessa. Shauna Saxton was one of the terrified drivers who said she encountered the gunman during his rampage, during which multiple witnesses described gunfire near shopping plazas and in busy intersections. Saxton was driving with her husband and grandson in Odessa and had paused at a stoplight when they heard loud pops. "I looked over my shoulder to the left and the gold car pulled up and the man was there and he had a very large gun and it was pointing at me," she told TV station KOSA. Saxton said she was trapped because there were two cars in front of her. "I started honking my horn. I started swerving and we got a little ahead of him and then for whatever reason the cars in front of me kind of parted," she said sobbing. She said she heard three more shots as she sped away. US President Donald Trump tweeted that he had been briefed by Attorney General Bill Barr. A day earlier, at least 10 people were injured in a shooting at a high school football game at Ladd-Peebles Stadium in Mobile, Alabama. A 17-year-old suspect was arrested on Saturday. Mobile Police Chief Lawrence Battiste said the shooting stemmed from a fight, and the suspect pulled a gun and started "indiscriminately shooting". "This is a cowardly act by an individual who didn't know how to deal with a situation," Battiste said. The latest incidents came after the early August mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart store, where many victims were Hispanic. In that case, officers arrested Patrick Crusius, 21, a white Texan, who told police that he was targeting "Mexicans", according to an arrest warrant published by US media. The tragedy in El Paso was committed on the basis of "racist" anti-Mexican rhetoric, Jesus Seade, Mexico's foreign ministry undersecretary for North America, said during a memorial after that shooting. Critics of Trump have accused him of stoking such hatred. The shooting in El Paso came hours before a gunman in Dayton, Ohio killed nine people, again reigniting calls for gun control in the country where firearms were linked to nearly 40,000 deaths in 2017. "We need to end this epidemic," former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke reacted on Twitter after the latest killings. O'Rourke, a Democratic presidential hopeful, expressed sympathy with "everyone in West Texas who has to endure this again". Another Democratic contender, former San Antonio mayor Julian Castro, appealed on Twitter to the Republican-controlled Senate "who refuse to move on gun reform." "What is the number? How many Americans are you willing to sacrifice to the NRA?" NRA is the National Rife Association. After a series of mass shootings since late July Trump had expressed provisional support for implementing universal background checks. The president's position is crucial, because congressional Republicans, who count on gun rights supporters for votes, cannot move on tougher firearms legislation without his support.

                    Walmart to limit ammunition sales after mass shooting in Texas store
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Walmart, the world's biggest retailer, announced on Tuesday that it will stop selling ammunition for assault-style rifles and handguns, one month after a gunman walked into an El Paso, Texas, Walmart with an AK-style semi-automatic rifle and killed 22 people. Walmart said it will stop selling the ammunition after its current inventory for assault-style rifles and handguns is depleted. The company also will stop selling handguns in Alaska, the only state where it had continued to sell them after ending the sale of handguns in all other states more than two decades ago. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Walmart's changes were prompted by the El Paso shooting, as well as recent mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and Midland and Odessa, Texas. He said that he also will be sending letters to the White House and congressional leaders, asking for action on "commonsense measures". McMillon said that Congress should debate reauthorizing an assault weapons ban and expand background checks. "We encourage our nation's leaders to move forward and strengthen background checks and to remove weapons from those who have been determined to pose an imminent danger," he said. "Congress and the administration should act. Given our decades of experience selling firearms, we are also offering to serve as a resource in the national debate on responsible gun sales." In Washington, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday before Walmart's announcement that he won't put a gun bill of any kind on the Senate floor for a vote unless US President Donald Trump says he would sign it into law. The Kentucky Republican said on a radio show that he expects to get an answer from the Trump administration within the next week on what, if anything, it's prepared to support. "If the president is in favor of a number of things that he has discussed openly and publicly, and I know that if we pass it, it will become law, I'll put it on the floor," he said. McConnell has blocked nearly every piece of legislation passed by the Democratic-led House, including gun measures that have bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. NRA's response The National Rifle Association, a gun rights advocacy group, responded to Walmart's announced changes by saying "lines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America's fundamental freedoms". Walmart's announcement on Tuesday is expected to reduce its share of the nation's ammunition market to 6 percent, from 20 percent. Walmart said last month that it accounted for about 2 percent of the nation's firearm sales. Several years ago, Walmart stopped selling the type of assault-style rifle that was used in the El Paso shooting, but McMillon said the retailer recognized the need to do more "to make the country safer". Walmart also said it no longer will allow shoppers to carry firearms openly inside any of its 4,700 US stores. Shoppers with concealed-carry permits can continue to carry guns, the company said.

                    San Francisco labels NRA 'domestic terrorist'
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The city of San Francisco, in the aftermath of recent mass shootings in the United States, has passed a resolution labeling the National Rifle Association a "domestic terrorist organization".The measure by the city's Board of Supervisors, passed Tuesday, also states that "the City and County of San Francisco should take every reasonable step to limit those entities who do business with the City and County ... from doing business with this domestic terrorist organization"."The National Rifle Association musters its considerable wealth and organizational strength to promote gun ownership and incite gun owners to acts of violence," the resolution states. "The National Rifle Association spreads propaganda that misinforms and aims to deceive the public about the dangers of gun violence, and ... the leadership of National Rifle Association promotes extremist positions, in defiance of the views of a majority of its membership and the public, and undermine the general welfare."In response, the Fairfax, Virginia-based NRA said in a statement: "This ludicrous stunt by the Board of Supervisors is an effort to distract from the real problems facing San Francisco, such as rampant homelessness, drug abuse and skyrocketing petty crime, to name a few. The NRA will continue working to protect the constitutional rights of all freedom-loving Americans."San Francisco City Supervisor Catherine Stefani introduced the resolution after a mass shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in Northern California on July 28, in which three people, including two children, were fatally shot and 17 injured.Twenty-two people were killed in a mass shooting at Walmart shopping center in El Paso, Texas, on Aug 3; nine in Dayton, Ohio, on Aug 4; and seven in Odessa and Midland, Texas, on Aug 31."People are dying every day in this country," Stefani said Tuesday in an interview with KTVU in Oakland. "Doing nothing is not an option. And that's what the NRA continues to do."US corporate reaction to gun violence this week included Cincinnati-based supermarket chain Kroger joining Walmart in requesting customers not to openly carry firearms in their stores."I would actually agree with that because that's very intimidating. Nobody wants to see a gun on somebody," Suzanne Silvia told KOIN 6, a CBS affiliate in Portland, Oregon."I think that's totally wrong because it's part of the Constitution that we are allowed to pack our own guns wherever you want to," said Bob Shuman.Walmart also said this week that it would stop selling ammunition for handguns and short-barrel rifles."Rather than place the blame on the criminal, Walmart has chosen to victimize law-abiding Americans," the NRA said in response to the firearms policy changes by the Bentonville, Arkansas retail giant.Dick's Sporting Goods announced in March it would stop selling firearms and ammunition at 125 of its 700-plus locations. Kroger said last year that it would do the same at its Fred Meyer stores in the Pacific Northwest.Starbucks, Target and Wendy's also have asked customers not to openly carry firearms when they visit their premises. But they are not enforcing a ban because they don't want to put their employees in confrontational situations.The Associated Press contributed to this story.
