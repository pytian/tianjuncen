                A new round of rainfall has hit the capital on Monday as peak temperatures in Beijing on Sunday broke a historical record for early September, reaching 35.9 degrees Celsius, according to the local meteorological department.Beijing Meteorological Service on Monday evening issued a blue alert for rainfall and strong winds. It is also expected that most areas in the capital will face gusts of wind.The short-term heavy rainfall will last until 5 am Tuesday and carries a relatively high risk of floods and geological disasters, according to the meteorological bureau.The traffic during Beijing's peak hours might get affected and peak temperatures in the capital will hold steady at around 25 to 28 degrees until Sunday, according to meteorological experts quoted by the Beijing Daily.As the typhoon Lingling entered China's northeast areas on Saturday night, the region where the typhoon approached became a low-pressure area, experts said, explaining the reason for Beijing's high temperatures on Sunday.Influenced by the typhoon, some parts of Beijing saw low humidity and cloud cover, leading to the hot weather.

            <p class="style-content">
                BEIJING - The overall average price of commodities in China shrank by 2 percent in August from the previous month and by 6 percent from the same period last year, according to the China Logistics Information Center.The average price in the January-August period went down 2.7 percent from the same period last year. The decline was 0.6 percentage points larger than that in January-July.According to the center, the downward pressure of the domestic economy was obvious and the commodity market continued to be depressed in August.The market demand failed to meet expectations, influenced by high temperatures, rain and typhoons, and the real estate regulation policy showed a tightening trend, which further restrained demand, it said.The market supply is still increasing and the pressure on commodities continues to rise, leading to a renewed decline in commodity market prices.From an industrial perspective, the five major industries monitored reported drops in prices. Among them, the prices of chemical products and ferrous metals fell the most in August from the previous month, by 4.2 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively.In addition, the prices of refined oil shrank by 1.9 percent, raw coal dropped by 0.9 percent and non-ferrous metals fell by 0.4 percent in August from the previous month.
