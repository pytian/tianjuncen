                Summit held to address Syrian crisis
            </p>
            <p>
                Erdogan hosts Putin and Rouhani in Ankara in bid to secure a lasting truceANKARA - The leaders of Turkey, Russia and Iran were scheduled to meet on Monday to try to secure a lasting truce in northwest Syria following attacks by the Syrian government that risk deepening regional turmoil and pushing a new wave of migrants toward Turkey.The summit in Ankara, bringing together countries whose Syrian allies are combatants in a ruinous eight-year-old war, will focus on the Idlib region, the last remaining territory held by rebels seeking to overthrow the Syrian government.All three leaders are expected to hold one-on-one meetings before the summit, the Kremlin said.They will also hold a closing news conference with a view to presenting a joint declaration.Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iran's Hassan Rouhani have backed the Syrian government against the rebels. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, along with US, European and Arab allies, has supported different rebel factions in the conflict.Syrian government forces, aided by Russian air power, have regained control of most lands lost in the war. In recent months, government troops have attacked Idlib, where Syrian and foreign radical fighters hold sway alongside other more moderate factions.Under a deal with Moscow and Teheran two years ago, Turkey set up 12 military observation posts in northwest Syria aimed at reducing fighting between government forces and rebels. The Turkish military posts have recently been caught in the crossfire due to the Syrian offensive in the region."A large number of terrorists are still present in this zone, ... and fighters continue to fire on the positions of government forces," Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov said on Friday.The Turkish president's office has said the leaders would discuss the latest developments in Syria as well as "ensuring the necessary conditions for the voluntary return of refugees and discussing the joint step to be taken in the period ahead with the aim of achieving a lasting political solution".The fighting in northwestern Syria has also raised the risk of a new migrant wave toward Turkey, which currently hosts about 3.6 million Syrian refugees.The United Nations has said that more than 500,000 people have been uprooted in Syria since late April, most of them escaping deeper into the rebel bastion and toward the Turkish border.While Erdogan has said that Turkey could not handle such an influx of refugees, he has also previously threatened to "open the gates" for migrants to Europe unless Ankara receives more international support.Migration focused On Friday, Erdogan reiterated his warning and said Monday's summit would aim to stop migration from Idlib and establish a cease-fire to prevent any further civilian casualties."The expectation here is not a momentary cease-fire. First, it is to put a stop to the migration here," he told Reuters in an interview. "Second, to ensure a cease-fire here. Third, to seriously get terrorist organizations under control," he added."Turkey, which is hosting 3.6 million refugees at the moment, cannot take the millions of people that will arrive from there," Erdogan said. "We cannot carry that weight."Meanwhile, Turkey has other concerns regarding Syria.It has repeatedly threatened to launch a cross-border offensive against Syrian Kurdish forces, whom it sees as allied to Kurdish militants in its own territory.That has strained Turkey's relations with its NATO ally, the US, which backs the Syrian Kurds as the main fighting force against the Islamic State group.The US has vowed to work with Turkey to clear Kurdish forces away from its border, but Ankara says progress has so far been "cosmetic" and it could launch an operation into Syria by the end of this month.Turkey has conducted two previous offensives against the IS group in 2016 and the Kurdish People's Protection Units in 2018.Agencies

                Saudi Arabia: Drone attacks knocked out half its oil supply
            </a>
            <p>
                DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - Yemen's Houthi rebels launched drone attacks on the world's largest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia and a major oil field Saturday, sparking huge fires and halting about half of the supplies from the world's largest exporter of oil.The attacks were the latest of many drone assaults on the kingdom's oil infrastructure assaults in recent weeks, but easily the most damaging. They raise concerns about the global oil supply and likely will further increase tensions across the Persian Gulf amid an escalating crisis between the US and Iran over its unraveling nuclear deal with world powers.The attacks resulted in "the temporary suspension of production operations" at the Abqaiq oil processing facility and the Khurais oil field, Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said in a statement carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency. The fires "were controlled," the statement said, and no workers were injured.The fires led to the interruption of an estimated 5.7 million barrels in crude supplies, according to the statement, which said part of that would be offset with stockpiles. The statement said Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil giant, would provide updated information in the next 48 hours.The Iranian-backed Houthis, who hold Yemen's capital, Sanaa, and other territory in the Arab world's poorest country, took responsibility for the attacks in the war against a Saudi-led coalition that has fought since 2015 to reinstate the internationally recognized Yemeni government. But the US blamed Iran, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeting, "There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.""Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply," Pompeo added.In a short address aired by the Houthi's Al-Masirah satellite news channel, military spokesman Yahia Sarie said the rebels launched 10 drones after receiving "intelligence" support from those inside the kingdom. He warned that attacks by the rebels would only get worse if the war continues."The only option for the Saudi government is to stop attacking us," Sarie said.Houthi rebels have been using drones in combat since the start of the Saudi-led war. The first appeared to be off-the-shelf, hobby-kit-style drones. Later, versions nearly identical to Iranian models turned up. Iran denies supplying the Houthis with weapons, although the UN, the West and Gulf Arab nations say Tehran does.UN investigators said the Houthis' new UAV-X drone likely has a range of up to 1,500 kilometers (930 miles). That puts the far reaches of both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in range.First word of Saturday's assault came in online videos of giant fires at the Abqaiq facility, some 330 kilometers (205 miles) northeast of the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Machine-gun fire could be heard in several clips alongside the day's first Muslim call to prayers, suggesting security forces tried to bring down the drones just before dawn. In daylight, Saudi state television aired a segment with its local correspondent near a police checkpoint, a thick plume of smoke visible behind him.President Donald Trump called Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to offer his support for the kingdom's defense, the White House said. The crown prince assured Trump that Saudi Arabia is "willing and able to confront and deal with this terrorist aggression," according to a news release from the Saudi Embassy in Washington.Saudi Aramco describes its Abqaiq oil processing facility in Buqyaq as "the largest crude oil stabilization plant in the world."The facility processes sour crude oil into sweet crude, then transports it onto transshipment points on the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea or to refineries for local production. Estimates suggest it can process up to 7 million barrels of crude oil a day. By comparison, Saudi Arabia produced 9.65 million barrels of crude oil a day in July."This is one of the biggest central processing facilities in the world. The Iran conflict is going to be hitting the world in a new way," said Kevin Book, managing director, research at ClearView Energy Partners LLC.The Khurais oil field is believed to produce over 1 million barrels of crude oil a day. It has estimated reserves of over 20 billion barrels of oil, according to Aramco.There was no immediate impact on global oil prices as markets were closed for the weekend. Benchmark Brent crude had been trading at just above $60 a barrel.While Saudi Arabia has taken steps to protect itself and its oil infrastructure, analysts had warned that Abqaiq remained vulnerable. The Rapidan Energy Group, a Washington-based advisory group, warned in May that "a successful attack could lead to a monthslong disruption of most Saudi production and nearly all spare production." It called Abqaiq, close to the eastern Saudi city of Dammam, "the most important oil facility in the world."In a report published Saturday, Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, noted that although Aramco officials have indicated that exports will resume in the next few days, "there is nothing to suggest that this is a one-off event and that the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels will forgo further strikes on Saudi sites."The war has become the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The violence has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine and killed more than 90,000 people since 2015, according to the US-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or ACLED, which tracks the conflict.The rebels have flown drones into the radar arrays of Saudi Arabia's Patriot missile batteries, according to Conflict Armament Research, disabling them and allowing the Houthis to fire ballistic missiles into the kingdom unchallenged. The Houthis launched drone attacks targeting Saudi Arabia's crucial East-West Pipeline in May. In August, Houthi drones struck Saudi Arabia's Shaybah oil field.Associated Press

                Attacks on Saudi oil facilities cut half of kingdom's capacity, raise global concerns
            </a>
            <p>
                RIYADH -- Drone attacks on two Saudi Arabian oil production facilities on Saturday have halted about half of the supplies from the world's top exporter and raised global concerns over oil supplies.A "10-drone attack," for which Yemen's Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility, targeted Saudi state-owned oil company Aramco's facilities in Abqaiq in Eastern Province and the Hijrat Khurais oilfield on Saturday.Aramco's industrial security teams controlled and extinguished the fire before the flames spread.The attacks resulted in "the temporary suspension of production operations," Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said Sunday in a statement.After Saturday's attacks, Saudi Arabia saw production cut by 5.7 million barrels a day, according to Aramco.The country's total production hovers around 10 million barrels per day, with an average of 9.85 million barrels per day in August, data from the US Energy Information Administration show.An investigation has been launched, according to the Saudi Interior Ministry.The international community has voiced its condemnation of the attacks and concerns over the oil supply.On Saturday afternoon, US President Donald Trump spoke by phone with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, discussing the attacks and Saudi Arabia's self-defense, according to the White House.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran on Saturday, saying "there is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.""Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply," Pompeo said in a tweet.King Abdullah II of Jordan, in a phone call with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, expressed his condemnation of the drone attack, saying "the national security of Jordan and Saudi Arabia is one.""The security of the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and Saudi Arabia is inseparable. Any threat to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is seen as a threat to the stability and security of the UAE," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the United Arab Emirates said in a statement.The Houthis have recently stepped up drone attacks on Saudi Arabia, but most of the drones were intercepted by the kingdom's air defense systems.On Aug 17, Saudi Arabia said that a Houthi drone attack on its Aramco plant in Shaybah Oil Field caused a minor fire.In May, a Houthi drone attack damaged two oil pump stations of Saudi Aramco, according to the Saudi authorities."We promise to widen our attacks as long as the Saudi regime's aggression and economic blockade against our country continue," Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea was quoted as saying after Saturday's attacks.

                Peace, not Iran, ought to be US target: China Daily editorial
            </a>
            <p>
                Drone attacks on one of the world's largest oil processing plants and a major oilfield in Saudi Arabia on Saturday sparked huge fires and halted about half of the supplies from the country, sounding a warning to all countries that they beef up security in and around their oil facilities to prevent such attacks and avoid triggering a new round of blame game between the United States and Iran.The attacks on Saudi Arabia's Abqaiq oil processing facility and Khurais oilfield disrupted the supply of about 5.7 million barrels of crude oil — more than 5 percent of the daily global supply — which Riyadh said would be offset with stockpiles.It is not difficult to imagine the concern of the international community and the global anger against those behind the drone attacks.Yet it is irresponsible for countries such as the US to jump to conclusions without having any evidence whatsoever to prove their claims. Although the Iran-backed Houthis, who control the Yemeni capital of Sana'a and other areas in the Arab world's poorest country, claimed responsibility for the attacks, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted: "There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen."Still, Pompeo blamed Iran for the attacks, alleging that, "Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply".Is there a reason to believe Washington is simply using the attacks to vent its spleen against Teheran?Saturday's attacks were not the first on oil facilities in a Middle East country. Such facilities have been targeted, albeit on a smaller scale, over the past few months with the flaring up of tensions between Washington and Teheran.This is therefore the right time for the international community to give a clarion call to defuse tensions in the Middle East given that the global energy supply is at stake. With the US putting "maximum pressure" on Iran, the security outlook for the region, the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz in particular, has become increasingly bleak.Washington has already dealt a severe blow to the prospects of peace and stability in the Middle East by pulling out of the multilateral Iran nuclear deal last year. But contrary to its belief, it will not benefit by stoking conflicts in the Middle East. Instead, it will also be scaled by the fire it sparks in the region to fulfill its own narrow political and economic gains.
