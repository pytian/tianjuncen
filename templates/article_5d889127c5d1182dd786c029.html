                China, Netherlands had second straight set victory at Women's Volleyball World Cup
            </p>
            <p>
                YOKOHAMA, Japan - China and the Netherlands both recorded their second 3-0 victory over their respective opponents to kick their FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup off to a good start. Russia edged host nation Japan 3-2 in a five-set thriller to wrap up Matchday 2 here on Sunday.The defending champion sent a completely different starting lineup to face Cameroon on Sunday and the Chinese young players managed to nail a 25-18, 25-14, 25-19 win despite ups and downs. 19-year-old Li Yingying was the shining star of the match, especially in the third set in which the defending champions recovered a 4-11 deficit to claim the victory."We decided to send our young players on the court to give them chances to get accustomed to the arena and international games. We had some fluctuations during the match and we were slow in reading the opponents' tactics," commented Chinese head coach Lang Ping, who also praised Li for being more stable on the court than at the World Championship last year.The win lifted China to second place on the table, behind the Netherlands on point quotient disadvantage. The Dutch defeated Kenya 25-12, 25-19, 25-17 for its second straight-set win at the tournament to lead the 12 participating teams.The United States was also victorious against a young Serbian squad, recovering from one set down to defeat the world champion 25-23, 25-17, 25-16, 25-15. Team USA head coach Karch Kiraly gave credit to the opponent and his opposite spiker Karsta Lowe, who was sent on in the second set and pocket 19 points."We approached this match knowing it would be very difficult. They beat us in the first set, but the team did a nice job adjusting the block and defense, and we are happy with the result. Karsta Lowe came in and gave us some great energy today and some great power, and she helped us change the match after we lost the first set.""We couldn't do our best because we were very tired from yesterday's match against Brazil. In my personal opinion, I think the USA could take first place in this World Cup. Our team has a few injured players and some who are very tired from the European Championship, so I'm satisfied to win the first set against the very strong USA team. We just need to keep our focus in games like we did yesterday and as we did in the first set today," Serbia coach Aleksandar Vladisavljev responded to the second loss.The home fans had a bitter-sweet night as Japan lost 3-2 to Russia in a brilliant five-set showdown on Sunday night.Nataliya Goncharova scored 31 points for Russia's 25-11, 23-25, 25-27, 25-19, 15-7 win while Irina Koroleva added 21. Yuki Ishii led the Japanese team with 27 points.Shaking off a sluggish start, the host nation pulled one back and Ishii's super spike clinched a hard-fought 27-25 win for the Asian Championship winner in the third set after wasting three set points.Russian spikers regained their form in the fourth set and forced a decider, in which they shattered the Japanese defense with an 8-2 opening and safely claim the 15-7 victory.Elsewhere, powerhouse Brazil breezed past Argentina 25-17, 25-19, 25-16 for a 2-0 record at the World Cup with clear domination on the net, as the two-time Olympic champions had 17 successful blocks compared to seven on the Argentine side.The Dominican Republic had a 25-17, 24-26, 25-23, 25-23 victory over South Korea thanks to its on-fire wing spiker Elizabeth Martinez, who scored game-high 27 points. Kim Yeon-koung, the best scorer of the last World Cup, had 19 points and Kim Hee-jin pocket 20, yet not enough for the 2018 Asian Games champion to harvest a win at the tournament."I am happy with the win. They are an aggressive team with a strong attack and serve. They caught us in the second set, but we regained our rhythm in the third set. We will prepare for the next match now. We did target Kim Yeon-koung with our serves today so that she could focus less on attacks," said coach of the Pan American Games champion Marcos Kwiek.

                Duan determined to book Tokyo ticket
            </a>
            <p>
                Chinese doubles specialist targeting spot at Olympics to cap eventful yearIt's been a roller-coaster 2019 so far for Chinese player Duan Yingying.The 30-year-old was sidelined for three months at the start of the year with illness but bounced back brilliantly to reach June's French Open doubles final. Next on the agenda for the Tianjin native is trying to secure a spot in the doubles competition of the Tokyo Olympics.She and partner Zheng Saisai failed to advance that cause at this week's ICBC Credit Card Zhengzhou Open, where they lost 6-4, 2-6, 10-8 to Dutch duo Lesley Kerkhove and Bibiane Schoofs in the first round on Wednesday. However, they are still confident of booking their Tokyo ticket."I used to focus more on singles, but my singles ranking dropped dramatically given that I could not play for months because of illness earlier this year," said Duan, who is ranked 21st in the world in doubles but is down to No 323 in singles."My partner and I are preparing for the doubles competition of next year's Olympics. So as long as we can play and win more matches, we can earn higher rankings to win a ticket to the Games. Hopefully, we can make it."Right now, Duan is just thankful to be back on court after being forced to watch matches from her sickbed at the start of the year."Getting back to peak condition has been an extremely tough task because I did not play or practice for three months," said Duan, who returned to action in early April. "I can still remember my first match, which was also in Zhengzhou. I could barely breathe just half an hour into the match."That made her and Zheng's run to the final at Roland Garros in June even more commendable, when they were defeated by Timea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic.The Chinese pair also reached last week's US Open quarterfinals."Honestly speaking, we only decided to team up to play the French Open a very short time before the registration deadline, so actually we did not have any pressure," said Duan."Zheng is a very flexible player with great skills. We tried our best in each match, but it was truly unexpected that we would have such a deep run in a Grand Slam."Zheng was the only Chinese to survive the first round of the singles in Zhengzhou this week, by overcoming Schoofs. World No 38 Zheng won last year's tournament, when it was a lesser-rated 125K-level event. However, she's keeping her expectations in check for this year's Premier 700 tournament, which has attracted a much tougher field."After the US Open we didn't have too much time to prepare as we came to Zhengzhou right after," said Zheng. "It's a tight schedule. I hadn't played a singles match for a long time, so I'm still finding my pace."The biggest news in women's tennis this year was arguably Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu's stunning victory over 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams in last week's US Open final. Duan, though, was not surprised by the 19-year-old's breakthrough."I was not shocked by the result, because I played against Andreescu last year," said Duan. "Her skills and physical condition impressed me then. I told my friend that this youngster will have a big future. I just didn't expect it would happen so quick."Duan reckons it might not be too long before Chinese fans are cheering on an Andreescu of their own. She credits the increase in both the quantity (nine) and quality of WTA events being staged in China as helping to develop the nation's young talent."The young Chinese players can now play all these high-level WTA tournaments in China, which was unthinkable when I started my career," said Duan. "Although we are still waiting for the next Chinese superstar, the overall strength of Chinese tennis has improved. We're seeing a group of young Chinese talent growing and about to bloom."

                Dress code, a play on fashion
            </a>
            <p>
                  Fashion has always been in a state of constant flux. Even in 12th-century China, a monarch was said to have enjoyed women wearing dangling pearls and jade in a "hair-knot that sways at every step", while the emperor who built the Great Wall preferred a "hair-knot that rises above the clouds". Women of the Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907) wore the "hair-knot of the homing bird", and a writer in the last years of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) described the "hair-knot of disintegration and homeless wandering" as a style of the day. "The times are indeed out of joint," he wrote. "I tremble to think what is to come."What came was modernity. In 1993, Estelle Ellis, Seventeen magazine's founding promotion director, gave a speech at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, in which she explained: "Fashion is a perpetual-motion machine expressed in four areas: 'mode' – the way we dress; 'manners' – the way we express ourselves; 'mores' – the way we live; and 'markets' – the way we are defined demographically and psychologically."

                Hiddink dismissed as coach of China's Olympic team
            </a>
            <p>
                The Chinese Football Association (CFA) has appointed Hao Wei as the executive coach of the Chinese Olympic men's team when a four-member group was announced to be set up here on Thursday in charge of the Olympic qualifiers.The four-member group includes CFA vice president Gao Hongbo as well as the 43-year-old Hao, former head coach of the Chinese women's team, with the absentee of current head coach Guus Hiddink."Due to the ineffective Olympic qualification preparation, the CFA decides to establish a new group fully in charge of the training and match preparations of the Chinese Olympic team," said a statement released by the Chinese football governing body on Thursday.Last September, the 71-year-old Hiddink was appointed to be the head coach of the Chinese Olympic team. Despite his illustrious coaching career, the Dutch veteran is far from success in China as he only led to four wins out of the 12 official matches. Skepticism emerged after China lost to Vietnam 2-0 at home earlier this month.From the Olympic Qualifiers to kick off in Thailand four months later, China hopes to get one of the three Asian tickets for Tokyo.
