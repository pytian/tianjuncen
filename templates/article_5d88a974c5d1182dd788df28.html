                Guangzhou Customs focus on travelers using their bodies to smuggle drugs
            </p>
            <p>
                Guangzhou Customs has vowed to introduce more effective and concrete measures to prevent people from smuggling drugs inside their bodies as the number of such cases increases.Zheng Jun, deputy director of the Bureau of Anti-Smuggling of Guangzhou Customs, said there has been a reduction in the number of drug smuggling cases involving passengers' carry-on bags and mailed items after great efforts have been made to crack down on such methods."But cases involving the use of human bodies as vessels to smuggle drugs now represent a bigger part of the total drug smuggling cases investigated and fought by Guangzhou Customs in recent years," Zheng said at a news conference in Guangzhou on Wednesday.To this end, Customs departments in the southern metropolis will strengthen cooperation and exchanges of information with foreign counterparts in the fight against the smuggling method to prevent drugs from entering the country and to help construct a safe, social environment, Zheng said.Li Si, a senior customs officer with the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, said customs officers from the airport, one of the three busiest in the country, have investigated nine cases of people using their bodies to smuggle drugs in the first eight months of the year."More than a dozen kilograms of drugs have been seized after cracking down on such cases," Li said.On Aug 30, customs officers found an Angolan man and woman with dozens of small bags of suspected drugs inside their bodies during CT examinations at a hospital after they detained the pair, who arrived at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on the same flight.The man later discharged a total of 60 pills of suspected drugs while the woman discharged another 80. All told, the contents weighed nearly 1.7 kilograms.The pair admitted to using their bodies to smuggle drugs when the pills they discharged were later confirmed to contain cocaine.Between January and August, Guangzhou Customs officers detained 15 suspects in 38 drug smuggling cases and seized 17.3 kilograms of various drugs. Marijuana and cocaine are the drugs most often seized by customs officers."We will never relax our vigilance fighting against drug smuggling, which has been the top priority of the customs department," Zheng said.Zheng made his remarks after Guangzhou Customs on Wednesday burned 312 kilograms of various drugs seized by customs officers in recent years. The drugs included 201.6 kilograms of khat, a plant that is a fairly mild narcotic.Khat is mainly planted in Ethiopia, Kenya and other African countries, as well as some nations in the Arabian Peninsula.Other drugs that were burned include heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana, Zheng added.

                China, US keep winning streaks intact at FIVB Women's World Cup
            </a>
            <p>
                 YOKOHAMA, Japan - China and the United States both recorded their fourth successive wins at the FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup on Wednesday. World champions Serbia defeated Argentina 3-1, as the South American side, along with Cameroon and Kenya, still await their first win of the tournament.Zhu Ting, MVP of the last World Cup, kept her 20-plus scoring streak with 20 points, and Li Yingying added 11 in China's 25-19, 25-21, 25-19 victory over the Dominican Republic, for whom 21-year-old Jineiry Martinez top-scored."Our players have become more mature compared with last year's World Championship. They were able to keep their composure when faced with difficulties on court," said China coach Lang Ping.The USA also won, with a 25-23, 25-18, 25-19 victory over the Netherlands extending their unbeaten record at the tournament.Jordan Larson and Kelsey Robinson tied for a game-high 16 points for the Nations League champions, while Lonneke Sloetjes was the most prolific Dutch player with 10 points."We knew it would be tough today. The Netherlands are a great team. I think we got better as the match went on. I'm really proud of my team for staying in it and grinding through. It was an all-around team effort," captain Larson said after the match.With the victory, the USA sits second in the table with 12 points, level on points with China who remains top with a superior set quotient. The Netherlands fell to third, three points behind the two leaders.Elsewhere, Russia cruised to a 25-18, 29-27, 25-12 win over a South Korean side that rotated its starting line-up and benched Kim Yeon-koung, top scorer of the last World Cup. Nataliya Goncharova had a game-high 14 points for the winning side."We had strong attacks, good serves and blocks and I think that's why we were able to win today," Irina Koreleva told Xinhua after a game in which she managed three blocks.Captain Ana Bjelica had 29 points to spearhead Serbia's 25-15, 23-25, 25-23, 25-23 triumph over Argentina. Jelena Blagojevic, returning from an injury she picked up at the European Championships, added 14. Daniela Bulaich Simian scored a team-high 16 points for Argentina."Before the game, we knew it would be a tough match because Argentina have good defense and blocking, and we were prepared for a longer game, and it was a really long game. I'm really happy some players who didn't play from the beginning came back. Blagojevic did a great job and gave us some opportunities in attack and defense," Bjelica said.African teams Cameroon and Kenya remain winless at this year's World Cup, with Cameroon losing 25-17, 25-17, 25-20 to host nation Japan, while Kenya came up short against Brazil, going down 25-20, 25-17, 25-14.The 12 participating teams will play their last match in Yokohama and Hamamatsu on Thursday before moving to Sapporo and Toyama on Sunday.

                Time for Tsai to read the writing on the wall: China Daily editorial
            </a>
            <p>
                That her refusal to accept the 1992 Consensus that there is only one China and instead curry favors with the United States, which in reality can be no one's friend, would come back to haunt her was obvious. But rather than waking up and realizing it was a shadow she and her ruling party were following, she continued to dream of "independence".Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen's failure to realize her follies, apart from souring relations across the Taiwan Straits, has also cost the island seven "diplomatic" partners, the latest being Kiribati.Despite the constrained cross-Straits ties causing serious economic difficulties, Tsai and her Democratic Progressive Party could not see the light. As a result, the island's economic performance has continued to weaken, in part due to falling revenue from tourism which thrived for eight years before Tsai assumed office in 2016 thanks to record numbers of visitors from the Chinese mainland.Tsai didn't realize the foolishness of choosing the perilous path of "independence" even when the DPP suffered a humiliating defeat in the local elections last year. But even before getting the electoral shock, Taiwan had been receiving consular blows.Less than a year after Tsai assumed office, Sao Tome and Principe cut off official ties with the island to establish diplomatic relations with Beijing. The African island country was followed by the Dominican Republic, Burkina Faso, El Salvador and Panama. On Monday, the Solomon Islands became the sixth country to sever ties with Taiwan since Tsai took office, followed by Kiribati on Friday.Tsai believes, wrongly though, that her tough stance against Beijing will help her get re-elected next year, without realizing her flawed policy has done little to improve the island's economy and people's livelihoods despite the island's economic growth declining from 2.89 percent in 2017 to 2.69 percent last year. This year's growth forecast is even lower.Tsai and her party, in trying to strengthen their ideological hold over the island, are actually destroying the one thing Taiwan compatriots were proud of: economic prosperity. The situation across the Straits could not be more different, as Beijing's focus is on qualitative economic growth and improving people's livelihoods.The United Nations and the international community accept that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government that represents the whole of China, and that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China.Unless Tsai and her DPP acknowledge this essential fact, the island's economy will continue to suffer, partly because of the strained relations across the Straits, and the Taiwan administration will continue to be isolated, because the developments of the past years suggest Kiribati's decision could trigger a domino effect.

                Digital technologies could boost public services in African countries
            </a>
            <p>
                Africans may benefit from improved public services - and reduced corruption - if advocates of digital technology persuade governments across the continent to embrace change.Prof Sam Yala, the president of African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Rwanda, said the digitization of public services could help African countries fight corruption, a blight that has held back economic growth and undermined good governance and social development."When documents and services are digitized, it's difficult to illegally alter them, especially when specific technologies like blockchain are used," said Prof Yala, referring to the electronic ledger system that underpins some digital currencies.He believes that African countries yet to begin digitization processes should first invest in basic digital infrastructure and adopt policies aimed at facilitating growth in the sector. Cybersecurity, Big Data, artificial intelligence and overall capacity building should be priorities, he said.Cavince Adhere, a researcher and PhD student of international relations at the Central China Normal University, said digital technologies have the potential to bring efficiency and accountability to public services in Africa, Adhere said."Regardless of the stage of development of a given economy, the additional investments in digital technology increase the economic value to citizens," he said.Adhere said Rwanda, Nigeria, Tanzania and Kenya are African countries are using technology to improve public service delivery.Kenya has greatly increased its collection of public revenues, while cutting bureaucratic red tape, corruption and generally stripping out inefficiencies, he said.Through the country's e-citizen portal, as well as online procurement platforms, ordinary people and businesses can access government services without the need to deal with civil servants.The portal has more than 4 million registered users and clocks up 500,000 transactions a month, according to GSM Association, a trade body that represents mobile network operators worldwide.Additionally, 200 types of digitized services are being offered nationwide through establishments known as Huduma Centres.In Kenya's capital Nairobi, motorists can pay for parking spaces electronically, and online channels are also available for payment of household utility bills.Rwanda also has been making strides. In 2015, the government launched an e-government platform dubbed Irembo.The platform handles 88 government services, including Mutuelle, a community-based health insurance program, along with those relating to immigration and emigration.Irembo has more than 2 million registered users and transactions are running at 300,000 a month, government figures showed.In an interview with KT Press, Jules Ntabwoba, the spokesperson of Rwanda Online, said the portal had saved the government money in cutting out the role of front-line civil servants and the scope for them to take bribes.

                Foreign dance growing popular in China
            </a>
            <p>
                SHANGHAI -- Foreign dance used to be considered controversial in China. But now, more Chinese are learning it thanks to the country's opening up.Ariadna Naveira and Fernando Sanchez are masters in Tango. They come to China from Argentina every year to participate in the Tango International Festival in Shanghai."We don't know how many people are learning Tango in China, but the number of people who learn it is growing," Sanchez said.Tang Jiaying is a public servant in east China's Jiangsu Province. Her passion for Tango returned after she recently watched a Tango competition in Shanghai."My parents thought Tango was not decent and I would become 'bad' if I learned it," Tang said."Now we are more rational, and with a stable income and the desire to enhance my artistic taste, my parents encouraged me to take a Tango class," she added.Shi Yiqi, another girl in Shanghai even quit her job to learn Flamenco in Spain for a year. She opened a Flamenco training center to transmit the Flamenco dance culture to more Chinese enthusiasts.Currently, about 400 people assist in Flamenco training courses every year in Shanghai where Spanish and Latin dance shows and activities are endless.Hip-hop dance is also becoming more popular this summer in China with various competitions held in Shanghai, Shanxi and Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.Breakdance is part of hip-hop dance. In the early 1980s, breakdancing made a sensation in Shanghai after the screening of an American film.In 1988, breakdance competitions were held in various Chinese cities such as Nanjing and Xi'an, while an American breakdance company came to Beijing.However, modern dance became controversial in China."Before the opening-up, Chinese audiences only saw some folk dances of African and Asian countries, and classic ballet was once the only foreign dance for professional dancers," dance critic Lan Fan said."People's vision changed after the opening-up. Innovation can be seen in different types of dance combined with traditional and modern elements," he said.In the future, Lan Fan plans to introduce AI technology in dancing to motivate the interactions between people and machines."We are looking forward to the new development of dance in China," Lan said.

                California to Trump: 'See you in court'
            </a>
            <p>
                When Barack Obama was in the White House, the state of Texas sued his administration at least 48 times. For Donald Trump, no other state in the United States has resisted his administration in and out of court as frequently as California.On Friday, it was "Mr President, we'll see you in court" from Attorney General Xavier Becerra as the state filed its 60th suit against Trump, more suits against a sitting US president than any in history.California and 23 other US states, along with the cities of Washington, Los Angeles and New York, sued the Trump administration after it moved to revoke California's authority to set its own vehicle emissions standards, first granted under Obama.Trump announced on Twitter the plan to revoke California's greenhouse gas pollution waiver on Sept 18 while in Los Angeles to attend a fundraiser. The next day the Environmental Protection Agency formally announced it.Taking the Trump administration to court over the move further escalates what has been an antagonistic relationship between Trump and the state on many policy matters, including immigration, the environment and healthcare.Those lawsuits have resulted in 37 legal victories for the state - a mix of decisions in favor of California, or preliminary injunctions halting the Trump administration's actions pending a final decision.The state that launched the political career of Ronald Reagan and was once a hotbed of conservatism has become a very liberal, very Democratic state.One in eight US citizens lives in California. Its 39.5 million people make it the country's most ethnically diverse state. Whites make up just under 38 percent of the population. Latinos are the largest group at 39 percent, followed by Asian-Americans - the fastest growing group - at 15 percent and African-Americans at 6 percent, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.Democrats hold the governorship and every other statewide office and have a super majority in both houses of the legislature. Independents hold more elected political positions in the state than Republicans.The party gained even more power in the House of Representatives in last year's midterm elections. Republicans hold just seven of the state's 53-member House delegation. And the speaker of the House is Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat who often tangles with Trump."Donald Trump has put California in his sights because we have a governor and statewide officials, all of whom are Democrats," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst and former University of Southern California professor. "We have a legislature under the control of Democrats, who are all of them about 180 degrees opposite in terms of the major issues that concern Californians - opposite from Donald Trump. We are perceived as the fulcrum of the 'resistance' movement."During his time in office, Trump has singled out the state on Twitter more than any other, calling its sanctuary cities "ridiculous", accusing it of "gross mismanagement" of its forests, and allowing the streets of San Francisco to become "disgusting" with its homeless population.Not lone critic Trump hasn't been his party's lone critic of California."They (Democrats) want us to be just like California, right down to tofu and silicone and dyed hair," Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz told a crowd of supporters during his reelection campaign in 2018.Some Republicans have said that the party should plan to make California a symbol of Democratic dysfunction and "socialistic stagnation" in the 2020 presidential campaign.Dan Patrick, the Republican lieutenant governor of Texas, has suggested that Trump's reelection slogan should be: "I'm not going to let the Democrats turn America into California."Trump has repeatedly hammered away at the state's homeless problem.During a reelection rally on Aug 2 in Cincinnati, Ohio, he said: "California is a disgrace to our country. It's a shame. The world is looking at it. Look at Los Angeles with the tents and the horrible, horrible disgusting conditions."That came just days after Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill requiring presidential candidates to release their tax returns if they want to appear on the state's primary ballot - a law aimed at Trump, who hasn't released his tax returns.On Thursday, a federal judge ordered a temporary injunction against the law saying California can't force candidates to disclose their tax returns. He said he would make his final ruling on the law before Oct 1.After Trump said he was revoking the state's emission policy, later that day as he returned to Washington from a three-day trip to California and New Mexico, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that San Francisco was in "total violation" of environmental rules because of used needles used by many homeless people that he said were ending up in the ocean. "We're going to be giving them a notice very soon," he said, indicating that the city could be put on notice by the EPA within a week that its homelessness problem was causing environmental damage.San Francisco Mayor London Breed called Trump's comments "ridiculous".The emissions lawsuit represents the start of what is expected to be a legal battle over states' rights and climate change that is likely be resolved only when it reaches the Supreme Court.The federal government has never before revoked a waiver once it's been granted. But the Trump administration argues that California is violating a long-held principle that only the US government can regulate automobile fuel mileage standards.The auto industry has long favored a unified emissions rule. Four automakers in July - Ford, BMW, Honda and Volkswagen - announced they had partnered with California to manufacture cars that would satisfy the state's more stringent emissions standards.
