                A Beijing-based travel summit is building partnerships with overseas agencies and discussing ways of enticing more tourists to visit the mainland, Yang Feiyue reports.Nimesha Sarangi made her 40th trip to China in August. Working in outbound-tourism operations for Sri Lankan travel agency Jetwing Holidays means she has been dealing with the Chinese market since 2011."I've been to many places across the country, especially Beijing," Sarangi says."Whenever there's a new destination or hotel, I'll come and learn about it and then promote it among the people back in my country."Business has been good at her agency."We've seen a 10 to 20 percent growth every year over the past few years," Sarangi says.Just a few weeks ago, she traveled with 80 tourists from Sri Lanka to Beijing.Sarangi expects to bring about 2,000 travelers to the capital this year."They love to travel here because of the Great Wall and the Forbidden City," Sarangi says."Shopping and local food are also on their list of favorite things to do."Direct flights connecting Sri Lanka to Beijing and the welcoming nature of Chinese people have also helped fuel the Sri Lankans' enthusiasm to travel to the capital, she says.Sarangi is among the 60 overseas travel-service providers, who attended the Beijing Tourism Global Distribution Partnership Summit in late August.The summit was hosted by Beijing's municipal culture and tourism bureau with the aim of developing a global network of travel-business partners for Beijing to boost its inbound tourism.The summit was launched in 2018 and aspires to reach 100 foreign travel partners within three years."We keep them updated on tourism resources (in Beijing) for free on a regular basis so they can promote them on platforms in their respective markets," says Cao Pengcheng, deputy director of the Beijing's culture and tourism bureau.The partners will also be invited to experience unique travel experiences in Beijing every year, in addition to joining events like the summit."This way, they can come up with better tourism products based on the requirements of travelers from their countries," Cao says.

                    Chinese Buddhist honored in Sri Lanka
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                In memory of Master Fa Xian, a Buddhist monk who lived more than 1,600 years ago, an international cultural conference was held at the Sri Lankan Parliament Building on August 28, 2019, to commemorate his contribution to China-Sri Lanka cultural exchange and the Maritime Silk Road.The international conference was attended by Maithripala Sirisena, President of Sri Lanka, Cheng Xueyuan, Chinese ambassador to Sri Lanka, and official representatives from Sri Lanka’s ministries and delegates of Buddhist organizations.According to Camini Jayawickrama Perera, minister of Buddhasasa and Wayamba Development of Sri Lanka, the bronze statue of Master Fa Xian is the only statue of a foreign Buddhist figure standing in Sri Lanka’s Buddhist temple.Master Fa Xian was born during the fourth century, the time of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420), when Buddhism enjoyed an imperial favor seldom equaled in Chinese history. He was stirred by a profound faith to go to India in order to visit the sites of the Buddha’s life and to bring back Buddhist texts that were still unknown in China.On return from his pilgrimage, instead of once more taking the overland route, he took the sea route sailing to Sri Lanka (called Ceylon then), at the time flourishing hotbed for Buddhist studies.He stayed there for two years, visiting several places of worship and studying Buddhist literature before sailing back to China along the ancient maritime Silk Road. His journey was described in A Record of Buddhist Kingdoms, in which he noted down the local customs and practices and Buddhist development in Sri Lanka.

                    Foreign scholars applaud China's anti-terror efforts
                </p>

                Many foreign scholars who visited the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region said the efforts made by the local government in combating and preventing terrorism are effective, and could be learned by other countries.They positively viewed the local measures taken to deal with these challenges, and called for further international cooperation in counterterrorism and de-radicalization.From Wednesday to Friday, more than 60 scholars from the Advisory Committee of Human Rights Council of the United Nations and 17 countries including Serbia, Sri Lanka, France, Indonesia and Italy attended the International Seminar on Counterterrorism, De-radicalization and Human Rights Protection, which was organized by the China Society for Human Rights Studies, in Urumqi, the regional capital.The scholars visited an exhibition about major cases of terrorism in Xinjiang and went to the Xinjiang Islamic Institute. They also visited the Kashgar vocational education and training center.Xinjiang is a key battlefield in the fight against terrorism and extremism in China. Terrorism, separatism and extremism have gravely damaged the stability, solidarity and progress of Xinjiang for a long time, and the basic human rights of the people in the region to life, health, property and development had been trampled."Some countries have criticized China's policies against terrorism in Xinjiang. Let us ask what America would do if hundreds of Americans died in terrorist attacks?" asked Predrag Markovic, director of the Institute for Contemporary History, Serbia.He said the training center offers an opportunity for those young people who were affected by terrorism and extremism to start a new life. "I believe it is a much better solution than repression only. It is not the whole process, but it's a good beginning."Jayanath Siri Kumara Colombage, director of the center for Indo-Lanka Initiatives of the Pathfinder Foundation, said what the Chinese government is doing has proved effective.He communicated with young people in the training center and learned that they were misled by the wrong people. "The young people have repented of the past. These are good signs," he said.Colombage said his home country of Sri Lanka has been troubled by terrorism for decades. "I know how these people are radicalized, and I think this is a great program," he said.Addressing both the symptoms and root causes, Xinjiang has established vocational education and training centers in accordance with the law to prevent the breeding and spread of terrorism and religious extremism, effectively curbing the frequent terrorist incidents, according to a white paper released by the State Council Information Office in August.However, Xinjiang's anti-terrorism efforts were still attacked by some Western media."What we hear from the Western media and what is really happening on the ground are totally two different things," Colombage said."You are not hiding anything, you told us to ask any question, and we asked very difficult questions," he said.Abdul Wahid Wahid, a senior adviser to the Minister of Haj and Religious Affairs of Afghanistan, said Xinjiang's experience is effective in eradicating extremism and terrorism, and he wants to learn more about it."I've heard a lot about the education center. Western media somehow said that is a 'torture center'. Now that I saw the center, and that it's really an education center, I wish we had established such centers in Afghanistan many years ago," he said.Matteo Bressan, a professor of International Relations and Strategic Studies at Lumsa University (Rome), said he believes that education is a way to help fight the global phenomenon of extremism and radicalism."We should respect the Chinese approach to these issues and challenges," he said.Shu Hongshui, vice-president of the Anti-terrorism Law School, Northwest University of Political Science and Law in Xi'an of Shaanxi province, said terrorism and extremism are global problems, and China is offering its solution to the world.He noted that China has been actively participating in international counterterrorism and anti-extremism programs and China has joined a number of international conventions in this regard.

                    Indian moon mission suffers setback
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                India had been over the moon, as it were, preparing to celebrate a historic feat.Instead, contact was lost with spacecraft Chandrayaan-2 moments before its Vikram module was to make a soft landing on the moon in the early hours of Sunday.Kailasavadivoo Sivan, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation, or ISRO, said on Sunday afternoon that his agency had managed to locate the lander, Xinhua News Agency reported.The spacecraft managed to shoot a thermal image of the lander on surface of the moon, media reports quoted him as saying.By press time, the lander's condition was yet to be ascertained.On Sunday morning, he was quoted as saying that the descent had gone "as planned and normal performance was observed till the altitude of 2.1 kilometers".Contact was then lost between the control room in India's southern metropolis of Bangalore and the spacecraft 384,400 kilometers away.The first words of consolation came from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was at the tracking center to witness the final moments of the lander's scheduled descent. "In life, there are ups and downs. ... You have served the country well and served science and humanity well," Modi was quoted by local media as saying.Launched July 22, the unmanned Chandrayaan-2 was India's chance to become fourth country to land a craft on the moon, following Russia, the United States and China. It intended to accomplish the first soft landing in the moon's south polar region.Most importantly, analysts said, the failure denied the country a rare opportunity to search for water and minerals, and also explore minerals such as magnesium, ion and, importantly, helium. The technology of the spacecraft was 100 percent India-made and cost roughly $150 million.Had the soft landing been successful, the landing module's Rover may have helped to solve the country's energy needs, according to a former ISRO scientist. "It could help bring helium-3 which is in abundance on the moon. The moon can become our one and only savior by meeting all the energy needs on Earth," Arup Dasgupta said.Sandip Chakrabarti, director at the Indian Centre for Space Physics, said that the ISRO is still a powerful space agency.Despite its current setback, India became the first Asian country to send an orbiter around Mars on May 5. It also has several ambitious space programs lined up.Chakrabarti said that the ISRO has the potential to generate funds through commercial ventures.Asked how India measured up to other countries boasting advanced space technologies, Chakrabarti said: "R&D in India is the weakest compared to the countries with strong space programs. Unless India strengthens R&D, it will be difficult to compete with China and other countries in the long run."He said Chandrayaan-2 is doing what NASA did more than 50 years ago and China did by sending Chang'e 4, a robotic spacecraft mission to the moon in January this year.Better engines According to him, India needs to have better engines and rockets similar to Falcon of the US or Long March of China." (India's) missions are cheaper, but that cannot be the only criterion for winning the race. It must have a solid manned program. In this, China is also well ahead," Chakrabarti said.He said if India wants to have a space station, manned missions must become routine. However, he does not foresee India having such a capability in the next few decades.The country has planned to send a mission to study the sun in 2019-20, a second mission to Mars in 2022-23 and a Venus mission in 2023. It will also attempt to send astronauts to space on a spacecraft in 2022.New Delhi-based electrical engineer Prasun Dutta said the ISRO deserves appreciation for contributing to the socio-economic development of people as well. "Many of ISRO's space programs are integral to (India's) essential needs and national development," he said.He said ISRO's satellites provide nationwide connectivity in terms of voice and data communication. The country's space agency has launched programs such as telemedicine which network remotely located rural medical facilities to super specialty hospitals in big cities, Dutta said.Satellite-based weather monitoring and warning system is of immense importance in a country where agriculture, a sector which provides livelihood to millions of people in rural segment but is still critically dependent on the vagaries of nature."ISRO's sensing satellites provide realistic data of India's land, surface water, ground water, forest and biological resources as inputs to policymaking for governmental authorities," he said.Dutta added that the ISRO's disaster management support program provides space-based inputs which help in management and control of disasters like flood, cyclone, earthquake, forest fire, not only in India but also a few other countries.Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, distinguished fellow and head of the Nuclear & Space Policy Initiative at the Observer Research Foundation, said India's space explorations had positive implications beyond its borders.India launched the first South Asian satellite to enhance communication channels and improve disaster links for its neighbors: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.The author is a freelancer for China Daily.

                    Boao expert says China, South Asia can 'transform' global economy
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                China-South Asia cooperation can boost not only Asia but the global economy, neutralizing factors causing the current slowdown, an expert told the Boao Forum for Asia's Economist Roundtable in Beijing on Monday.Structural and geopolitical "chokepoints", not cyclical factors, are to blame mainly for the global economic slowdown and gloomy forecasts, said Sudheendra Kulkarni, a current affairs commentator from India.Kulkarni, also an author and strategist for India's former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said the most compelling geopolitical chokepoint to growth is the trade and technology war the United States has waged against China."The side waging this war does not know, and perhaps does not care, that it is doomed to lose," he said.Asia, Africa and Latin America alone can offer sustainable impetus to global economic growth — not only in 2020, but for several decades into the future. That is because rich economies of the West have exhausted their capacity to propel global growth or even to contribute significantly to improving the lives of the poor and needy people in the rest of the world, he said.Given that China and South Asia (a region comprising India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and Maldives) together account for nearly 3 billion people, economic cooperation between the two could prove a game-changer, he said.

                Island tourism is luring a growing number of Chinese travelers, Yang Feiyue reports.About a third of outbound Chinese travelers opt for island destinations, according to a report by the International Islands Tourism Conference in Zhejiang province's Zhoushan in late August.That's as outbound travel from China increased nearly 15 percent to 150 million visits.About 70 islands in China and overseas have become major destinations for Chinese, the report says. Over 40 percent of them generate at least a fifth of their GDP from tourism."Island tourism enables people to enjoy nature and improve health," Zhejiang's vice-governor, Cheng Yuechong, told the conference hosted by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, and Zhejiang's government.Tourism players from 24 countries and regions attended to discuss cooperation and seek ways to better tap islands' potential."We hope to strengthen exchanges with well-known island destinations around the world and jointly develop a high-quality island-tourism industry," Cheng says.A total of 21 project agreements, involving nearly 50 billion yuan ($6.9 billion), were signed at the conference.
