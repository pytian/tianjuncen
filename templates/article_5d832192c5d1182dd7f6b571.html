                UPDATE 1-Wary of conflict with Iran, Trump takes go-slow approach to attack on Saudi oil
            </p>
            <p>
                on Saudi oil@ (Adds Trump exchange with Senator Lindsey Graham)WASHINGTON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Known for acting on impulse, President Donald Trump has adopted an uncharacteristically go-slow approach over whether to hold Iran responsible for attacks on Saudi oil facilities, showing little enthusiasm for confrontation as he seeks re-election next year.After state-owned Saudi Aramco's plants were struck on Saturday, Trump did not wait long to fire off a tweet that the United States was "locked and loaded" to respond, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran.But four days later, Trump has no timetable for action. Instead, he wants to wait and see the results of investigations into what happened and is sending Pompeo to consult counterparts in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates this week."There's plenty of time," Trump told reporters on Monday. "You know, there's no rush. We'll all be here a long time. There's no rush."Two U.S. officials told Reuters on Tuesday that Washington believes the attack was launched from Iran, with one of them saying it originated in Iran's southwest.U.S. officials say Trump, who is famously skeptical of his intelligence community, wants to ensure the culprit is positively identified in a way that will pass muster not only with him but with the American people."In responding to the greatest attack on the global oil markets in history, I think not rushing to respond and ensuring everybody is on the same page is where we should be," said a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Trump's stance today is in stark contrast to 2017, less than three months into his presidency, when he waited only two days before launching air strikes to punish Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces for a chemical weapons attack.AMERICA FIRSTTrump's caution reflects the "America First" world view that found support with his base in the 2016 presidential campaign and that he is trying to promote again as he seeks a second term in 2020.Pillars of that view are that the Iraq war was a waste of blood and money, that the end of the war in Afghanistan is long overdue, and that Washington should be reimbursed for deployment of U.S. troops abroad, from South Korea to Germany.Jon Alterman, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former State Department official, said Trump also "has grown increasingly cautious as the reality of any military actions increased.""Theres a large constituency the president has that thinks it would be lunacy to go to war against Iran," he said. "There's a large part of his base that thinks the craziest thing we could do is committing ourselves to endless wars in the Middle East."The attacks on Saudi targets have stymied for now what had been an effort to open talks with Iranian leaders to try to get a sense of whether they were ready to strike a deal on their nuclear and ballistic missile programs in response to economic sanctions that have taken a toll on Iran's economy.Trump's willingness to consider easing sanctions on Iran alarmed his national security adviser, John Bolton, when the president raised the idea at a meeting last Monday, a source close to Bolton said. By the next day, Bolton was out.Bolton's departure removed a central anti-Iran voice from the president's inner circle. A well-known foreign policy hawk, Bolton was said to be furious in June when Trump abruptly called off air strikes in response to Iran's shooting down of a U.S. drone."If Bolton were there, he would be saying it was definitely Iran, and we need to strike right now," said a former senior administration official.Trump rebuked Lindsey Graham, one of his staunchest supporters in the U.S. Senate, after the Republican senator said in a tweet on Tuesday that Iran had seen Trump's response to the drone downing as a sign of weakness."No Lindsey, it was a sign of strength that some people just dont understand!" Trump said on Twitter.In Venezuela, despite repeated vows that all options were on the table, Trump also resisted Boltons suggestions for a stronger focus on military planning in the country, where a U.S.-led campaign of sanctions and diplomatic pressure has failed to push socialist president Nicolas Maduro from power.Barring a major escalation, future U.S. measures are expected to continue to stop short of military action due to a lack of support from U.S. voters but also because of opposition from allies in Latin America."We have to be realistic," a Venezuela opposition source said. "Trump will not be sending in the Marines to rescue us." (Additional reporting by Jeff Mason Editing by Mary Milliken and Sonya Hepinstall)

                Trump confirms U.S. will revoke California waiver to require cleaner cars
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed Wednesday the Environmental Protection Agency will revoke California's waiver that allows it to require automakers to build cleaner vehicles than federal requirements demand - a move that will set off a massive legal battle.Reuters and other outlets reported Tuesday the administration was set to formally announce the decision as early as Wednesday. The Trump administration will announce in the coming weeks a separate rule to roll back Obama-era fuel efficiency standards.Trump urged automakers to back the action, but so far none have publicly supported revocation of  California's authority. "Automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to California, you will be out of business," Trump wrote on Twitter.(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)

                Trump bars California from setting auto emissions rules, setting up court fight
            </a>
            <p>
                President Donald Trump says his administration is pulling a waiver that allows California to set its own auto emissions standards. California has already promised to fight the Trump administration move.President Donald Trump said Wednesday that his administration is barring California from setting its own auto emissions standards, setting up a fresh struggle over the president's push to unravel restrictions on businesses.In tweets announcing the move, Trump said the White House "is revoking" a federal waiver that allowed the state to craft its own rules on greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. The president argued he blocked California's ability to do so "in order to produce far less expensive cars for the consumer, while at the same time making the cars substantially SAFER."He also contends "there will be very little difference in emissions" under federal rules his administration plans to release than under standards California agreed to with automakers.Trump took the step over the protests of Democratic officials and activists in California, who argue it inhibits efforts to fight climate change and improve public health. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has said the state would file a lawsuit to stop the Trump administration from pulling its waiver."Our message to those who claim to support states' rights: Don't trample on ours," Becerra told reporters Wednesday. He added: "We're prepared to lead, we're prepared to fight. We'll do what we must."Speaking to reporters Wednesday, the state's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, said, "We are the pace car, as it relates to environmental stewardship." But he said his state is "dealing with an administration that lays claim, and a Republican Party that lays claim, to supporting free enterprise. The irony of that shouldn't be lost on anyone."The Trump administration's actions are "not free enterprise," Newsom said. "That's not about states' rights. That's about bullying and intimidation."Trump has moved to dial back Obama-era carbon greenhouse gas rules as he contends the restrictions have held back American businesses. In his tweets Wednesday, he pitched his latest move as a way to create a "new and uniform standard" and boost job growth."Automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to California, you will be out of business," Trump claimed, without citing why the state's rule would have put automakers out of business.Critics say his plans turn a blind eye to the dire threat posed by climate change.The Trump administration is set to announce proposals to set looser standards for auto emissions than those sought by his predecessor. In July, California signed a deal with BMW, Ford, Honda and Volkswagen that would set tougher standards than those desired by Trump.The automakers prepared to make cars nationwide that would meet the state's restrictions. Regulators under Trump have supported keeping emissions standards for new cars and trucks at 2020 levels through 2026, according to Reuters."A balanced fuel economy regulation is critical for the health of the U.S. auto industry," the Association of Global Automakers said in a statement. The group continued its call for a "unified national standard that continues the industry's significant progress in improving motor vehicle fuel economy, and that rewards investments in next-generation fuel-savings technologies."Ahead of Trump's announcement Wednesday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., criticized the administration's proposal. She said she "strongly" support Becerra's decision to go to court "to stop this ill-advised move."House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters that he hoped the state would side with the president, as he does not think the country should have more than one emissions standard.On Wednesday, UCLA School of Law environmental law expert Julia Stein wrote that "the administration is barreling forward into unprecedented territory ... where it will find itself on shaky footing from both a policy and a legal perspective.""It's just not smart policy. It's also unprecedented, unauthorized by the Clean Air Act, and unsupported by prior agency and court decisions," wrote Stein, project director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the UCLA School of Law.The fight is only the latest between California and the Trump administration. The state has already sued the administration dozens of times, over issues including the president's ban on travelers from several predominantly Muslim countries and his efforts to build barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.— CNBC's Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report.

                WRAPUP 5-Trump orders more Iran curbs, Saudi shows attack evidence
            </a>
            <p>
                * U.S., Saudi blame Tehran for unprecedented strike on oil plants* Attack exposes gaps in Riyadh's air defences* Oil prices fall on Saudi reassurances of restoring output* "We don't want conflict", says Iran's presidentJEDDAH/DUBAI, Sept 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he ordered a major increase in sanctions on Iran as Saudi Arabia displayed remnants of drones and missiles it said Tehran used in a crippling weekend attack on its oil facilities.Trump gave no explanation in a brief Twitter posting announcing the order, but the initiative follows repeated U.S. assertions that the Islamic Republic was behind Saturday's attack on the kingdom, a close U.S. ally."I have just instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to substantially increase sanctions on the country of Iran!," he wrote.Iran, however, again denied involvement in the Sept. 14 raids, which hit the world's biggest crude processing facility and initially knocked out half of Saudi production."They want to impose maximum ... pressure on Iran through slander," Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said."We don't want conflict in the region ... Who started the conflict?" he added, blaming Washington and its Gulf allies for the war in Yemen.Yemen's Houthi movement, an ally of Iran battling a Western-backed, Saudi-led coalition for more than four years, has claimed responsibility and said it used drones to assault state oil company Aramco's sites.However, the Saudi Defence Ministry held a news conference, displaying drone and missile debris it said was "undeniable" evidence of Iranian aggression. A total of 25 drones and missiles were used in the attacks launched from Iran not Yemen, the ministry spokesman added.Saturday's attack exposed the vulnerability of Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure and threw down a gauntlet to the United States, which wants to curb Tehran's influence in the region.Proof of Iranian responsibility could pressure Riyadh and Washington into a response, though both nations were stressing the need for caution.Trump has said he does not want war and is coordinating with Gulf and European states.Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the hit on the world's biggest crude exporter was a "real test of the global will" to confront subversion of the international order.His envoy to London, Prince Khalid bin Bander, told the BBC the attack was "almost certainly" Iranian-backed, however: "We're trying not to react too quickly because the last thing we need is more conflict in the region.""COMPELLING EVIDENCE"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was to meet Prince Mohammed in Jeddah on Wednesday to discuss the crisis before heading to the United Arab Emirates.U.N. officials monitoring sanctions on Iran and Yemen were also heading to Saudi Arabia to investigate.France, which is trying to salvage an international nuclear deal with Iran that Washington quit last year, said it wanted to establish the facts before reacting.A U.S. official told Reuters the strikes originated in southwestern Iran. Three officials said they involved cruise missiles and drones, indicating a higher degree of complexity and sophistication than initially thought.The officials did not provide evidence or explain what U.S. intelligence they were using for evaluating the attack, which cut 5% of global production.Saudi Arabia said on Tuesday the 5.7 million barrels per day of output lost would be fully restored by the end of the month.Oil prices fell after the Saudi reassurances, having surged more than 20% at one point on Monday - the biggest intra-day jump since the 1990-91 Gulf War.Saudi Arabia's finance minister told Reuters on Wednesday the attack had no impact on revenues and Aramco was continuing to supply markets without interruption.U.S. efforts to bring about a U.N. Security Council response look unlikely to succeed as Russia and China have veto powers and are expected to shield Iran.Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has offered to sell Riyadh defence systems, called for a "thorough and impartial" probe during a phone call with Prince Mohammed.The assault exposed serious gaps in Saudi air defences despite billions of dollars spent on Western military hardware and repeated attacks on vital assets during its four-and-a-half year foray into the Yemen war."The attack is like Sept. 11th for Saudi Arabia, it is a game changer," said one Saudi security analyst.IRAN-U.S. CONFLICTAlready frayed U.S.-Iran ties deteriorated further when Trump quit the nuclear pact and reimposed sanctions, severely hurting the Iranian economy. Iran has ruled out talks with Washington unless it returns to the pact.Trump said he is not looking to meet Rouhani during a U.N. event in New York this month. Rouhani and his foreign minister may not attend the General Assembly at all unless U.S. visas are issued in the coming hours, state media reported Wednesday.Washington and its Gulf allies want Iran to stop supporting regional proxies, including in Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon.Despite years of air strikes against them, the Houthi movement boasts drones and missiles able to reach deep into Saudi Arabia, the result of an arms race since the Western-backed coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015.Iran's clerical rulers support the Houthis, who ousted Yemen's internationally recognised government from power in the capital Sanaa in late 2014. But Tehran denies it actively supports them with military and financial support.Iran maintains the largest ballistic and cruise missile capabilities in the Middle East that could overwhelm virtually any Saudi missile defence system, according to think-tank CSIS, given the geographic proximity of Tehran and its proxy forces.But even more limited strikes have proved too much for Saudi Arabia, including recent ones claimed by the Houthis on a civilian airport, oil pumping stations and the Shaybah oilfield.(Reporting by Parisa Hafezi in Dubai and Stephen Kalin in Jeddah; Additional reporting by Guy Faulconbridge in London, Michelle Nichols in New York, Rania El Gamal, Davide Barbuscia and Marwa Rashad in Riyadh, Asma Alsharif and Sylvia Westall in Dubai, Alaa Swilam and Hisham El Saba in Cairo, Maria Kiselyova in Moscow; Tim Kelly in Tokyo, John Irish and Sudip Kar-Gupta in Paris, Phil Stewart and Steve Holland in Washington; Writing by Ghaida Ghantous and Andrew Cawthorne; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne and William Maclean)

                Trump names State Dept official Robert O'Brien as national security advisor, replacing John Bolton
            </a>
            <p>
                President Donald Trump named Robert O'Brien as his national security advisor on Wednesday, eight days after the abrupt departure of John Bolton.Trump says he fired Bolton, but Bolton says he resigned.The position does not require Senate confirmation.WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump named Robert O'Brien as his national security advisor on Wednesday, eight days after the abrupt departure of John Bolton.O'Brien, the State Department's top hostage affairs official, will become Trump's fourth national security advisor, following the departures of Bolton and retired Army Gens. Michael Flynn and H.R. McMaster.While O'Brien's recent work primarily dealt with matters involving U.S. hostages, he was assigned by Trump to help free rapper A$AP Rocky, who was detained in Sweden on assault charges over the summer. The rapper was found guilty, but was spared from jail time.O'Brien was also a partner in a boutique law firm focusing on high-stakes trials and appeals, and was a foreign policy advisor to Mitt Romney during the Utah senator's presidential run against then-President Barack Obama in 2012.O'Brien attended an Oval Office event in March, where Trump greeted a freed U.S. citizen who had been held in Yemen. The president called O'Brien "the greatest hostage negotiator in our history" at that event.Trump on Tuesday had named O'Brien and four other finalists for the role, including Vice President Mike Pence's national security advisor Keith Kellogg and Bolton's former chief of staff, Fred Fleitz.In selecting O'Brien, Trump said: "I have worked long & hard with Robert. He will do a great job!"Pence tweeted congratulations to O'Brien later Tuesday.The national security advisor does not require Senate confirmation. The position comes with a staff of hundreds of specialists from the Pentagon, State Department and U.S. intelligence agencies.The White House, Pentagon and State Department did not respond to CNBC's requests for comment on the president's announcement.Bolton, who was named national security advisor to succeed McMaster in March 2018, was known for his hardline approach to foreign policy, including calls for a pre-emptive strike on Iran and a hawkish position on North Korea. Trump announced on Sept. 10 that he fired Bolton saying that his advisor "disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions." Bolton said he resigned.Trump has said he fired Flynn for lying to the FBI and Pence about his contacts with foreign officials, while the president was reportedly frustrated with McMaster's detailed reports on national security matters.O'Brien's ascension comes as the Trump administration has pulled the United States back from global commitments and pushed forward on ambitious projects like the denuclearization of North Korea, a growing military footprint on the southwest border with Mexico, rising tensions with Iran, a bitter trade war with China and a recently aborted effort to negotiate the end of the U.S. war in Afghanistan.

                Trump orders Mnuchin to 'substantially increase' sanctions on Iran
            </a>
            <p>
                President Trump says he ordered the Treasury Department to "substantially increase" sanctions on Iran.The action comes after the U.S. accused Iran for the weekend attacks on critical Saudi oil installations.It was not immediately clear what the president directed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to do.President Donald Trump said Wednesday he ordered the Treasury Department to "substantially increase" sanctions on Iran.Trump's announcement follows strikes Saturday on the world's largest crude-processing plant and oil field in Saudi Arabia. The U.S. accused Iran of carrying out the attacks.It was not immediately clear what steps the president directed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to take. Asked about the sanctions later Wednesday during stops in California, the president told reporters he would announce details over the next 48 hours. The Treasury Department, White House and State Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests to comment.The strikes triggered the largest spike in crude prices in decades and renewed concerns of a budding conflict in the Middle East. All the while, Iran maintains that it was not behind the attacks.U.S. crude and benchmark global Brent oil prices dropped Wednesday after the White House announced sanctions instead of military action.On Tuesday, Trump said aboard Air Force One that he does not intend to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week."I'm not looking to meet him. I don't think they're ready yet, but I'd prefer not meeting him," Trump said. Rouhani likewise said he would not meet with Trump.The foreign ministry of Russia, a key strategic ally to Iran, called Trump's plan destructive and said it would not solve anything, Reuters reported, citing news agency Interfax.On Sunday, Trump warned that the United States was "locked and loaded" to respond to the attack on the Saudis, but a day later, he dialed down his rhetoric, saying there was "no rush" to take action and that the U.S. was coordinating with allies.Secretary of Defense Mark Esper also spoke with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to the kingdom Tuesday.The Pentagon's top Air Force general said Tuesday that while the service had not yet received direction to send additional bomber aircraft to the region, the U.S. was closely monitoring the area.The latest confrontation represents another brick in the crumbling edifice between Washington and Tehran after a string of attacks in the Persian Gulf in recent months.In June, U.S. officials said an Iranian surface-to-air missile shot down an American military surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz. Iran said the aircraft was over its territory.Hours later, Trump said Iran made a "very big mistake" by shooting down the spy drone. The downing came a week after the U.S. blamed Iran for attacks on two oil tankers in the Persian Gulf region and after four tankers were attacked in May.The U.S. in June slapped new sanctions on Iranian military leaders blamed for shooting down the drone. The measures also aimed to block financial resources for Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Though Trump has threatened to bring military action or even "fire and fury" against American adversaries, he has also said he does not want to throw the U.S. into another prolonged military conflict. In a tweet Tuesday, Trump called his measured response to the strikes "a sign of strength that some people just don't understand!"U.S. congressional leaders from both major parties had urged Trump to respond to the strikes.

                Trump is better off never cutting a trade deal with China, CME Group chief economist says
            </a>
            <p>
                Since early 2018, the U.S. and China have engaged in a trade dispute with both countries imposing tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of one another's imports. Trump initiated the tariffs citing unfair trade practices from China and accused it of intellectual property theft.Talks to resume the trade dispute have so far yielded little in the way of a solution. In fact, the situation deteriorated in recent weeks.President Donald Trump would be better off not cutting a trade deal with China as it could backfire on him ahead of the 2020 U.S. election, according to the managing director and chief economist at the CME Group."The political issue is very serious here," Bluford Putnam told CNBC Wednesday."President Trump faces a Democratic opposition that really doesn't like China, but he also faces — on part of his Republican Party — people that want him to be much tougher on China. So, he's way better off never cutting a (trade) deal. If he cuts a deal, he'll be criticized from both sides," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe.""If he just stays tough, he rides through it just fine. Which is, by the way, the same issues (Chinese President) Xi Jinping has: He can't give in to a bully like President Trump, so what's he going to do? He doesn't want a deal either," he added.Putnam believes there won't be any decision on a deal before next year's U.S. election. Having espoused an "America First" policy to voters ahead of the 2016 election, Trump will be aware that the opposition Democratic Party, and voters, will be quick to criticize his approach to global trade and China if the U.S. economy suffers as a result.Since early 2018, the U.S. and China have engaged in a trade dispute with both countries imposing tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of one another's imports. Trump initiated the tariffs citing unfair trade practices from China and accused it of intellectual property theft.Talks to resume the trade dispute have so far yielded little in the way of a solution. In fact, the situation deteriorated in recent weeks with new U.S. tariffs on $112 billion of Chinese consumer goods, and more due later this year. China responded with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods worth $75 billion. The new tariffs could cost the average American household $1,000 a year, according to a J.P. Morgan estimate and are seen to have hit both U.S. and global growth. In July, the International Monetary Fund forecast U.S. growth to be 2.6% in 2019 and moderating to 1.9% in 2020.The fund downgraded its forecast for global growth to 3.2% in 2019, down from its April forecast of 3.3%, citing "trade and technology tensions that dent sentiment and slow investment" as one of the reasons. It forecast global growth of 3.5% in 2020. CME Group's Putnam said U.S. citizens did not pay too much attention to economic metrics if their lives were going smoothly enough."In the American public, and I think in general, it's about the narrative that consumers are willing to tell. It's the stories they internalize — and they don't internalize the numbers like we do in finance. As long as people have their jobs and they're not worried about their neighbors losing their jobs, the confidence level will be high enough that the average voter … is going to be fine with the general slugging along with the economy," he said.Putnam believes the 2020 election would instead be fought on "diplomacy, on the trade war and immigration and health care issues."

                President Donald Trump said he ordered the Treasury Department to "substantially increase" sanctions on Iran.Trump had warned on Sunday that the U.S. was "locked and loaded" to respond to the Saudi incident.Oil production capabilities were fully restored and that oil output will be back to pre-attack levels by the end of September, Saudi energy minister said.Oil prices retreated on Wednesday, extending the decline in the previous session after President Donald Trump said he ordered the Treasury Department to "substantially increase" sanctions on Iran.Trump's announcement follows attacks on the world's largest crude-processing plant and oil field in Saudi Arabia that had forced the kingdom to cut its production in half. Oil prices jumped the most in history on Monday due to the disruption.Brent crude oil futures were down 36 cents, or 0.56%, at $64.21 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled 2.1% or $1.23 lower at $58.11 a barrel. The latest comment from the president marks a softening in his rhetoric as he had warned on Sunday that the U.S. was "locked and loaded" to respond to the Saudi incident.Oil tumbled as much as 7% on Tuesday after the Saudi energy minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said oil production capabilities were fully restored and that oil output will be back to pre-attack levels by the end of September.Fifty percent of the oil production loss from the attack has been restored in the past two days, bin Salman said, adding that production capacity would reach 10 million barrels of crude per day (bpd) by the end of this month and 12 million bpd by the end of November.Trump said Monday he's in no rush to respond to the coordinated attack. When asked if Iran was behind it, President Donald Trump said "It's certainly looking that way at this point."Drone and missile debris found by investigators at the Saudi Aramco attack site is proof of Iran's involvement in the drone attack, a Saudi defense ministry representative told media on Wednesday. He said the drones used in the attacks were Iranian Delta-wing unmanned aerial vehicles.Iran maintains that it was not behind the attacks. Iranian president Hassan Rouhani said the attacks on Aramco were a "reciprocal response" to the aggression against Yemen.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has blamed Iran for the drone strikes, saying in a tweet Saturday that Iran has launched an "unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply."Oil pared some of its loses after an unexpected rise in crude inventories.U.S. crude inventories increased by 1.1 million barrels from the previous week, according to the Energy Information Administration. Analysts expected a decrease of 2.5 million barrels.— CNBC's Maggie Fitzgerald contributed reporting.

                Iran is 'almost daring Donald Trump to respond,' says former diplomat

                President Donald Trump doesn't want war  with Iran — but Tehran seems inclined to "test the Trump administration," according to Gerald Feierstein, a former U.S. Ambassador to Yemen.Ultimately, the United States is still looking for "ways to get the Iranians back to the negotiating table," and Trump understands the American people don't want a military conflict, said Feierstein."Clearly, the Iranians look inclined to test the Trump administration, to call Donald Trump's bluff," he said.President Donald Trump doesn't want war with Iran — but Tehran seems inclined to "test the Trump administration," according to Gerald Feierstein, a former U.S. Ambassador to Yemen.Ultimately, the United States is still looking for "ways to get the Iranians back to the negotiating table," and Trump understands the American people don't want a military conflict, said Feierstein, who is currently senior vice president at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.Multiple drone attacks on Saturday crippled Saudi oil production, and knocked out 5.7 million barrels of daily crude oil production — that's half of Saudi Arabia's production and more than 5% of the world's daily crude production.The attacks on the oil plants of state-owned Saudi Aramco — on the world's largest crude processing facility in Abqaiq, and the kingdom's second-largest oilfield in Khurais — caused global oil prices to surge amid fears of supply disruption.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to meet Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman to talk about the attacks.Pompeo has blamed Iran for the attacks but Tehran refuted those allegations. On Tuesday, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei announced on state TV that the Iranian government "will never talk to America.""Clearly, the Iranians look inclined to test the Trump administration, to call Donald Trump's bluff, if you will, to see if he really has the will to really go all the way," Feierstein told CNBC on Wednesday. "So far, their bets have paid off."Yemen's Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, have been behind a series of attacks on Saudi pipelines, tankers and other infrastructure in the past few years amid rising tension between Iran and the U.S., and its allies like Saudi Arabia.The Islamic Republic, a target of U.S. sanctions for decades, has been blamed for recent attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. Washington has also blamed Tehran for the downing of a U.S. military drone."Whether you're talking about the tanker attacks or previous pipeline attacks or now this, they continue to raise the ante, they raise the bar, almost daring Donald Trump to respond," Feierstein added.Still, Feierstein said, "the Trump administration would not want to do things that would take the opportunity or the possibility of a negotiation away completely."Saudi Arabia would not want to be drawn into a war either, said Feierstein.The reason the Saudi government has been reluctant to point fingers at Iran is because it "will be very difficult to walk away from ... possible retaliation" if they do, he added.— CNBC's Natasha Turak and Yun Li contributed to this report.
