                20 mln children fail to receive lifesaving vaccines in 2018: UN
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                UNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations said Monday that more than one in 10 children, almost 20 million worldwide, failed to receive "potentially lifesaving" vaccines in 2018.A joint study report of the World Health Organization (WHO) and UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) published Monday showed that global protection against four diseases that are regarded as a gauge of overall coverage -- diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and measles -- has "stalled" at around 86 percent since 2010.Data shows that the best regional performer for vaccine reach in 2018 was Europe, whose more than 90 percent rate was 18 percent higher than Africa, the lowest-performing region.Worryingly, of the 19.4 million children worldwide who have not received three doses of vaccine to protect against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, two-thirds "didn't even receive an initial dose," the report noted, underscoring that this "points to a lack of basic immunization services."Most unvaccinated children come from the world's poorest countries and a disproportionate number live in fragile or conflict-affected states, said the report.Almost half of these at-risk youngsters are in 16 countries: Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Haiti, Iraq, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen."If these children do get sick, they are at risk of the severest health consequences, and least likely to access lifesaving treatment and care," WHO/UNICEF said in a joint statement.Citing major gaps in measles vaccine coverage across countries at all income levels, from Ukraine to the DRC to Madagascar, the UN report showed that the number of cases of the highly infectious disease doubled from 2017 to 2018, to more than 340,000.Identifying Ukraine as the country with the highest measles incidence rate in 2018, the report suggested that although the country has vaccinated over 90 percent of its children, coverage in 2010 was just 56 percent, meaning that a large number of older children and adults were at risk.Data is also available for the first time on coverage of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, which protects girls against cervical cancer later in life.As of 2018, 90 countries, home to one in three girls worldwide, offered the HPV vaccine. But only 13 of these were lower-income countries, the report said, meaning that those most at risk of cervical cancer are still least likely to have access to the vaccine.

                    UN official reiterates importance of coordinating African initiatives with BRI to spur infrastructure dev't

            <p class="style-content">
                NIAMEY - United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed on Sunday reiterated the importance of coordinating continental initiatives with the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to spur infrastructure development across Africa.Noted the UN' commitment to "working with African institutions to mobilize the resources that will be required for the full implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement, which officially went into operation here on Sunday, Mohammed also emphasized the need to invest in the infrastructure sector if the continent is to realize the full potential of the AfCFTA.She stressed the potential of BRI in advancing infrastructure development and regional integration across Africa."We will be working with you to coordinate and leverage complementary funding sources, from the African Development Bank's Africa50 Fund, to the African Union's Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa, and China's Belt and Road Initiative," Mohammed told African leaders at the opening session of the 12th Extraordinary Summit of the AU Heads of State and Government in Niamey, capital of Niger.The continental free trade pact "will create jobs and contribute to technology transfer and the development of new skills; it will improve productive capacity and diversification, and it will increase African and foreign investment," she said.The AfCFTA "will bring the promise of trade-led economic growth closer to reality for Africa's entrepreneurs, industrialists, investors, innovators and service suppliers," Mohammed said.The pact is "a tool to unleash African innovation, drive growth, transform African economies and contribute to a prosperous, stable and peaceful African continent, as foreseen in both Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development," she said.The African free trade accord was launched on March 21 last year in Kigali, capital of Rwanda.On Sunday, the AfCFTA's operational phase was official launched at the extraordinary AU summit. It came into force on May 30, after the deposit of the required minimum of 22 instruments of ratification by AU member states to the AU Commission.Five more instruments of ratification have since been deposited, including Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, which deposited their respective instruments on Sunday, bringing the total number of countries that have deposited their AfCFTA ratification to the AU Commission to 27.Also on Sunday, Nigeria and Benin signed the free trade pact, leaving Eritrea as the only member of the African Union that has not signed onto the historic accord.

                    China stands ready to support Africa's game changing FTA: China Daily editorial
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                In a historic move to unleash Africa's growth potential by boosting intraregional trade, African leaders launched a continental free trade zone at the African Union Summit in Niamey, capital of Niger, on Sunday after 17 years of tough negotiations.The African Continental Free Trade Area — a $3.4-trillion economic bloc that covers 54 of Africa's 55 countries and unites 1.3 billion people — is the largest free trade area since the creation of the World Trade Organization in 1994.That African countries have finally reached the milestone deal despite their conflicting interests and vastly different development stages underscores their collective resolve to liberalize trade for peace and prosperity across the continent. This is especially significant given the increasing trade protectionism that already poses a severe threat to global growth.Currently, African countries conduct only 16 percent of their trade with each other, compared with 65 percent among European countries, according to the African Union. With a single continental market for goods and services now in place, tariffs will be reduced markedly on 90 percent of goods, which is likely to boost intra-African trade by 60 percent within a few years.The free trade zone is also expected to create jobs, facilitate technology transfer, and boost free movements of businesses and investment. No wonder the International Monetary Fund, in a May report, has described the AfCFTA as a potential "economic game changer" for Africa.But the AfCFTA is not a magic wand with which Africa can quickly lift itself out of poverty, given the many constraints that it still faces. Many countries are still hugely dependent on primary resources such as minerals and lack the diversity necessary for two-way trade.And it will still take time for African countries to agree on such issues as a timetable for lowering tariffs and rules on an arbitration mechanism to settle trade disputes. Not to mention reducing the widespread bureaucracy that has long held back the continent's growth and integration. Some have cautioned that it will take about a decade for AfCFTA to produce positive effects.As the largest trading partner of Africa, China has always supported the continent establishing an integrated market, and stands ready to support the AfCFTA by helping African countries to deal with the many challenges that still remain.A potential area for cooperation is poor infrastructure, which has long been considered the bane of Africans doing business within Africa. The Belt and Road Initiative has already seen China invest heavily in infrastructure cooperation projects in Africa that include ports, power plants as well as highway and railway networks.The new trade zone will attract more Chinese investment for all the benefits that it produces, and thus open a new chapter for China-Africa trade and economic cooperation.

                    Africa launches world's largest trade zone
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                After seven years of negotiations, African leaders met on Sunday to launch the largest free trade zone in the world, bringing together a population of approximately 1.2 billion and a combined GDP of $2.5 trillion.Leaders attending an African Union summit in Niamey, Niger, agreed on five operational instruments to underpin the African Continental Free Trade Area. These are: regulations determining rules of origin, an online negotiating forum, a mechanism to monitor and eliminate non-tariff barriers, a digital payment system and an African Trade Observatory.Intra-trade constituted only 17 percent of overall African exports in 2017, according to the UN Economic Commission for Africa, or UNECA. This compared with 59 percent within Asia and 69 percent within Europe.The trade observatory will be established in 2020 by an African Union commission, the European Commission and the International Trade Center. The team is expected to accelerate the implementation of the zone by providing entrepreneurs, policymakers and other stakeholders with reliable trade data and statistics across the continent.The trade zone has injected strong momentum into multilateralism, free trade and an open global economy, China Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Monday. It shows the strong will and determination of African countries to work together for vitalization, Geng said.China has been the largest trade partner for Africa for the last decade, and has supported firmly the construction of the African Continental Free Trade Area, he said. The pact has far-reaching significance for Africa's social and economic development, he said.The trade pact was adopted on March 21, 2018 in Kigali, Rwanda. It entered into force on May 30, 30 days after having received the twenty-second instrument of ratification on April 29, 2019.Nigeria and Benin became the 53rd and 54th signatories, leaving Eritrea as the only member of the African Union that has not signed."The speedy entry into force of the agreement is a source of pride for all of us," said Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairman of the African Union Commission.Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou said the free trade area, or FTA, will tear down borders inherited from Africa's colonial past and ensure full continental integration.Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi called for the establishment of linkages with the private sector and the business and investment communities, while also calling for the involvement of the youth who will "continue the march" toward development.Amina Mohammed, the United Nations deputy secretary-general, noted that the African FTA is a tool to drive growth and innovation for Africa, and to create opportunities for sustainable development and realizing Agenda 2063.The effort to unite the economies of Africa into a single zone began in January 2012 in Addis Ababa where leaders agreed to eliminate barriers to trade, services, intellectual property and investment under the free trade agreement. The pact is expected to build on existing subregional and bilateral arrangements and help create a more integrated market in the continent.The trade pact could boost regional trade and industrialization by 50 percent, according to UNECA. Smaller countries are poised to be the biggest winners with an increase of up to 68 percent of intra-trade.

                    CNPC to spread global reach with crude oil pipeline in West Africa
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China National Petroleum Corp, the country's largest oil and gas producer in terms of output, has signed a contract with the government of Benin in West Africa to build and operate a crude oil pipeline in the region, the company said in a statement recently.The 1,980-kilometer pipeline, which will start from the Agadem oilfield in neighboring Niger and end at the port of Seme Terminal in Benin, is the biggest investment in a cross-nation oil pipeline that CNPC has made in Africa, the company said.The project will further facilitate the transportation of crude from Niger to the international market and promote the social and economic development of Benin, said Wang Yilin, chairman of CNPC.Li Li, energy research director at ICIS China, a think tank focusing on energy trends, said the deal will help Niger better export its crude resources and is also in accordance with the company's aim to further enhance its global oil and gas resource allocation capacity."After CNPC launched an oil refinery with annual throughput capacity of 1 million metric tons in Zinder in southern Niger in 2011, the new deal illustrates the importance of Africa as a strategic destination for CNPC investment," she said."This is in accordance with the company's globalization strategy under the Belt and Road Initiative, as CNPC is also stepping up its equivalent overseas equity oil and gas production to meet the surging demand for oil and gas."CNPC has vowed to come up with more than 100 million tons of equivalent overseas equity oil and gas production by 2020, especially from markets in Central Asia, Russia, the Middle East and Africa. At the same time, CNPC will also achieve balance in domestic and equivalent overseas equity oil and gas production.CNPC started oil and gas business in Niger in 2003. It now operates two exploration and development projects, and a joint venture refinery in the country, while also providing oilfield services.Li believes that as the biggest gas-consuming nation worldwide, China is likely to import more oil and natural gas from abroad.CNPC currently has 92 overseas oil and gas cooperation projects in 34 countries. Additional equivalent recoverable reserves for the company during the 2016 to 2018 period reached 230 million tons, with the annual growth in equivalent overseas equity oil and gas production reaching 10 million tons, it said.
