                Chinese film fans shun
            </p>
            <p>
                Around two years ago, actress Milla Jovovich saw her popularity reach new heights in China thanks to Resident Evil: The Final Chapter.As the sixth and final installment of the zombie game-adapted franchise, Resident Evil, which started in 2002, The Final Chapter earned nearly 1.2 billion yuan ($174.4 million) - the highest of all its films in China and far surpassing its box-office takings for North America.Yet her most recent return to the world's second-largest film market has turned out to be something of a disappointment.The Rookies, which marks the first Chinese film for Jovovich, has received low scores and a number of negative comments on major film review sites.With a reported budget of more than 300 million yuan, the film grossed merely 21.8 million yuan as of Wednesday, according to box-office tracker Maoyan.In earlier interviews with domestic reporters, Jovovich says she was a fan of Chinese martial arts films, including Zhang Yimou's Hero and Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.Her love of the genre and respect for its director lead the Ukraine-born American actress to join the cast of the Chinese action production led by Alan Yuen, a filmmaker best known for penning the scripts for Monster Hunt 2 and New Police Story.Also casting rising stars Darren Wang, Sandrine Pinna, Timmy Xu and Liu Meitong, the film is a kind of Chinese homage to such espionage classics like the James Bond and Mission: Impossible franchises, but presented with a more high-spirited tone.

                Film grants belated recognition to first Chinese Bond girl
            </a>
            <p>
                Thirty years before actress Michelle Yeoh Choo-Kheng shone her Chinese feminine beauty as a Bond girl in the 1997 film, Tomorrow Never Dies, Shanghai-born actress Tsai Chin, also known as Irene Chow, had already mesmerized Sean Connery as a secret double agent in the 1967 James Bond film, You Only Live Twice.Apart from being the first Chinese Bond girl, Tsai Chin has many more "first" titles under her belt. For example, she was the first Chinese student admitted to the prestigious British drama school RADA, the first Chinese actress to star in a West End show in London and the first Chinese artist to release an album in Britain.Revered by Chinese-American actors as their godmother, the name Tsai Chin, however, has remained largely unknown to most Chinese until recently, when the film Daughter of Shanghai brought her legendary life story to big screens across China.The 90-minute documentary directed by Chen Miao, a female Chinese director, features Tsai recalling memories from her past, scenes from the films and TV series she once starred in, and footage of celebrities talking about how Tsai influenced them.Unlike a hagiography, the film gives a warts-and-all portrayal of Tsai's life. Apart from presenting Tsai as a performer who has lived and breathed acting throughout her life and as a strong-willed woman who has weathered the storms of life, it does not shy away from Tsai's tensions with her family, especially disputes with her brother.The recognition arrives late for the 86-year-old actress, who now lives in Los Angeles, but her exotic adventures in the drama world spanning the past six decades can still provide fertile inspiration to today's young people, especially girls who want to carve out a career of their own.Now let's keep reading and take a closer look at this living legend.

                Jury hears of family's suffering since murder of scholar daughter
            </a>
            <p>
                As the sentencing phase in the trial of Brendt Christensen entered its second day on Tuesday, videos of murdered scholar Zhang Yingying's family and friends were shown, and her parents and boyfriend testified, bringing emotional moments to the federal courtroom in Peoria, Illinois.A female juror ran out crying when Zhang's mother, Ye Lifeng, talked about how she wanted to see Zhang in a wedding dress and wanted to be a grandmother, in a video shown to the jury on Tuesday, reported The News-Gazette newspaper of Champaign, Illinois."Our entire family does not know how to carry on," said Ye."I also so much wanted to see her in a wedding dress," she cried, adding that she can no longer go to weddings because she thinks about her daughter.Christensen, 29, a former graduate student himself at the University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign, the same school Zhang, 26, was attending, was convicted on June 24 for her kidnapping and killing the Chinese scholar. He faces either death penalty or life in prison.Ye initially did not want her daughter to leave China and study in the US, but supported her when the young woman was determined to do so, she said.Zhang's father, Zhang Ronggao, started crying when shown a picture of him with his daughter at a train station on her way to the US and was asked if it was the last time he saw her."I do not know how to live the remainder of my life," he said, and talked about a recent fall down stairs, because he could not concentrate."Yingying… is my pride and also my everything," he said."My life without her will not be complete."The News-Gazette reported that Christensen appeared to be crying before the video of Ye was played, and he had been looking down or had his eyes closed when family members testified.The jury also heard testimony from Zhang's boyfriend, Hou Xiaolin, who said he planned to marry Zhang in October 2017. Zhang went missing in June that year.Zhang was "the most important person" in his life, he said, and losing her totally changed his path. He said knowing what Christensen did to Zhang was "too cruel and painful", at which the defense objected and asked for a mistrial. The motion was denied by US District Court Judge James Shadid.Hou talked about how Zhang's death has been hard on her parents, to whom Zhang was their hope for the future. He said the family had lost its future, and Zhang's mother cries almost everyday."Their only desire is to find her and bring her back home," he said about Zhang's parents, who found it hard to move on without finding their daughter. "They cannot eat, they cannot sleep."Hou's and Zhang's college friend Wu Shuang, who appeared in another video shown to the jury, showed more of the personality of Zhang, who was independent, disciplined and positive and came to the US aiming at doing postgraduate research.

                Chinese film fans shun Rookies stunt
            </a>
            <p>
                Around two years ago, actress Milla Jovovich saw her popularity reach new heights in China thanks to Resident Evil: The Final Chapter. As the sixth and final installment of the zombie game-adapted franchise, Resident Evil, which started in 2002, The Final Chapter earned nearly 1.2 billion yuan ($174.4 million) - the highest of all its films in China and far surpassing its box-office takings for North America. Yet her most recent return to the world's second-largest film market has turned out to be something of a disappointment. The Rookies, which marks the first Chinese film for Jovovich, has received low scores and a number of negative comments on major film review sites.  Still images of The Rookies, which marks the first Chinese film for actress Milla Jovovich (right) and also casts actor Darren Wang (left) in a leading role. Photos Provided to China DailyWith a reported budget of more than 300 million yuan, the film grossed merely 21.8 million yuan as of Wednesday, according to box-office tracker Maoyan. In earlier interviews with domestic reporters, Jovovich says she was a fan of Chinese martial arts films, including Zhang Yimou's Hero and Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Her love of the genre and respect for its director lead the Ukraine-born American actress to join the cast of the Chinese action production led by Alan Yuen, a filmmaker best known for penning the scripts for Monster Hunt 2 and New Police Story. Also casting rising stars Darren Wang, Sandrine Pinna, Timmy Xu and Liu Meitong, the film is a kind of Chinese homage to such espionage classics like the James Bond and Mission: Impossible franchises, but presented with a more high-spirited tone. Set mainly in China and Hungary, Wang stars as a fictional extreme sports enthusiast who is accidentally drawn into the international criminal trade of chemical and biological weapons. After being recruited by Jovovich's super agent, who works for an independent secret spy organization which was founded in the 18th century, the young rookie embarks on an adventure after teaming up with a bumbling police officer, a self-made scientist and an unemployed doctor. On its opening day on Friday, the film was shown on around 18 percent of the country's screens, in a sign that suggested domestic theater operators believed it would sell well. But the film soon drew a lot of criticism and its share of screen numbers sank to 9 percent by Saturday. Usually, a blockbuster's screen time can be maintained through its opening week. With a series of fast-paced stunt-driven sequences, from a death-defying jump onto a helicopter in midair, to car chases around the narrow streets of Budapest, the film was criticized for a storyline that suffers from a number of plot holes. "The film runs for 113 minutes, but doesn't develop any of its characters convincingly and lacks a necessary explanation for the motives of the main villain. It also doesn't make sense that four rookies suddenly become so formidable without any training in the latter half of the movie," says one netizen on Mtime, a popular movie news and reviews site. For the Chinese fans who expected to see Jovovich perform stunts as dazzling as her role of zombie killer Alice in the Resident Evil franchise, many were left feeling disappointed after the female protagonist was paralyzed by a bullet a third of the way into the movie. For the remainder of the film, up until the closing scenes, where Jovovich was finally cured by acupuncture, the character could do little more than blink her eyes as the story began to unfold. "Stars and action scenes are no longer a guarantee of ticket revenues. The ending of The Rookies was a flop, and again shows that Chinese audiences are more discerning about storylines and characters. It will compel domestic filmmakers to concentrate more on polishing scripts before they start shooting," says Wang Xiaoyang, a Beijing-based critic. (China Daily Global 07/18/2019 page14)

                St. Louis-Nanjing: flourished with flora
            </a>
            <p>
                The monumental reference work Flora of China, published by Missouri Botanical Garden Press in St. Louis and Science Press in Beijing, consists of 25 volumes of text and 24 volumes of illustrations documenting 31,362 species of China's wild plants.Beginning in 1988, this project lasted 25 years and involved multiple institutes in the US, China and Europe.It also came about in part thanks to the St. Louis-Nanjing sister-cities relationship. Both the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis and Jiangsu Institute of Botany in Nanjing were involved in the project as two of the four important botanical gardens for the project, according to Joel Glassman, a retired professor from the University of Missouri in St. Louis (UMSL), who was also academic director of international studies and programs at the university.Glassman has been involved in the St. Louis-Nanjing Sister-Cities Committee since the beginning and served as committee president for almost 20 years.In 1979, St. Louis became the first US city to form a sister-cities relationship with a Chinese city after China and the US officially established diplomatic ties."St. Louis' mayor at the time, James Conway, had the vision of the importance of sister-cities ties in general. He had a clear vision of the future. China has more than lived up to that role of being a very important global player," said Glassman.Mayor Conway led a small delegation to Nanjing in November 1979 to sign the sister-cities agreement."We were very lucky to be the first to establish the first sister-cities relationship with such an important city as Nanjing. It has given us many opportunities. We have gotten a lot of benefits from partnering up with such an important city," Glassman said.Glassman himself had visited China as early as 1978 as a member of an engineering education delegation from the US."That was our first contact with China," he recalled. "In six weeks we visited many cities, including Nanjing. One thing that was clear — and disturbing — was how far behind China was in engineering education compared to the rest of the world. Today you would be impressed with the progress. China has caught up with the world."Glassman, an expert on US relations with eastern Asia, was teaching Chinese and Japanese politics at the time. He also got deeply involved in the sister-cities program."I am interested in not only educating college-level students about China, I am also interested in educating the St. Louis community about China. China was pretty much a mystery to most Americans in 1978. Over the 40 years since, we have contributed to a better public understanding of what's happened and what's happening in China," Glassman said of the sister-cities partnership.Through the committee for educational exchanges, Glassman made great efforts to develop collaborations between UMSL and Nanjing University."We have student exchanges, faculty exchanges, collaborative research projects, jointly sponsored conferences," he said.In addition, Nanjing University and UMSL has had a joint MBA program for about 15 years now."The students study one year in Nanjing University and another year at UMSL, then do an internship in the US to get an MBA degree from both universities. It requires a lot of work on both sides and has been very successful," Glassman said.Educational exchanges also extend to secondary education. Multiple high schools from both cities have become friendship schools. Students visit each other and stay at each other's homes to get to know them better. Since 1999, St. Louis has sent scores of teachers to Nanjing every year for educational exchanges.In 1994, St. Louis gave a complete playground to the children of Nanjing and Nanjing built a classic Chinese garden in the Missouri Botanical Garden for the people of St. Louis to enjoy.Every five years of the relationship, both cities hold various cultural events such as art exhibitions and performances to celebrate the special bond.The most notable example in business was when Emerson Electric Co of St. Louis first invested $900 million to set up an R&D center in Nanjing and then established a procurement center there.In April, Nanjing gave a bronze chair sculpture to St. Louis and sent a delegation of more than 50 people to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the sister-cities bond. Cultural events such as lantern and Chinese cuisine festivals were staged in St. Louis. In addition, St. Louis Zoo and Nanjing Hongshan Forest Zoo signed a cooperation agreement.A photo exhibit titled 40th Year Anniversary: Nanjing-St. Louis Sister City: Retrospective at the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum took stock of the sister-cities relationship. It also depicted the changing landscape and emergence of modern Nanjing.In June, Glassman presented a lecture at the photo exhibit and shared his insights into Nanjing and China.In return, Glassman said St. Louis is currently planning a visit to Nanjing led by Mayor Lyda Krewson in the fall. Students from UMSL will preform at Nanjing's Jazz Festival in October.Staying engaged over all the years has been the key to such a vibrant relationship, said Glassman."Every St. Louis mayor since Conway has visited China," he said. "We've stayed on friendly terms throughout the good times and the bad times. In 1989, some US cities canceled the sister-cities relationships with China. I fought very hard against that. You can disagree with what your sister has done, but the relationship is for life," he said.

                Trump's 2020 bid facing economic turbulence
            </a>
            <p>
                US President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced that White House officials are exploring the possibility of a temporary payroll tax cut to put more money in the hands of consumers and boost the economy amid anxieties of a looming recession. "I've been thinking about payroll taxes for a long time," the president told reporters in the Oval Office during a photo-op with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis. "Whether or not we do it now, it's not being done because of recession."Trump's announcement contradicted his own aides on Monday who said that "cutting payroll taxes is not something under consideration at this time''.Any such tax cut would need congressional approval. President Barack Obama cut payroll taxes in 2011 and 2012. The taxes fund Social Security and Medicare.The announcement comes as the solid economy expected to carry him to a second term is now clouded by the ongoing US-China trade dispute, threat of a recession underscored by the inverted yield curve for bonds, wild stock swings, plus a looming global economic slowdown."Trump could win with a not-so-strong economy as Obama did in 2012," Jonathan Zogby, CEO of Zogby Analytics, told China Daily. "He could do this by painting his opponent as a socialist coming for voters' healthcare, Second Amendment (gun) rights, looking to raises taxes and open the borders."Unless there's a downturn between now and Election Day, he should have a good chance to win re-election. It's hard to beat an incumbent running on peace and prosperity," Zogby said.Recessions usually occur after an industry sector crashes, such as the dot-com bust of the early 2000s, or the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007-2008.This time may be different because the US economy continues to grow, but at a slower rate; employment is at record highs while consumer spending, accounting for about two-thirds of the nation's gross domestic product, remains strong.With no immediate hits to the economy likely, recession risk this year or next may stem from the trade dispute as companies become more cautious and invest less, damaging consumer confidence. If so, that could create negative feedback, causing consumers to spend less, leading to further corporate cutbacks and job losses."President Trump's China strategy is failing," Jason Furman, a professor at the Harvard's Kennedy School of Government who served as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers 2013-2017, wrote in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece. "His tougher approach yielded no meaningful Chinese concessions, but is increasingly damaging the US economy."In 1992, Bill Clinton's adviser, James Carville, reminded him, "It's the economy, stupid." By focusing on economic issues, Clinton defeated President George H.W. Bush.Trump appears concerned, tweeting on Monday: "Our economy is very strong despite the horrendous lack of vision by (Federal Reserve Chairman) Jay Powell. The fed (funds rate), over a fairly short period of time, should be reduced by at least (one percentage point). If that happened, our economy would be even better and the world economy would be greatly and quickly enhanced — good for everyone!"Trump's making the economy the centerpiece of his re-election campaign has hit turbulence. US farmers, a key voting bloc in Trump's 2016 victory, have been pounded by the trade dispute, and retailers say supply chains have been disrupted. Trump tacitly acknowledged this with a $16 billion aid package to farmers after pledging $12 billion last year, and his decision earlier this month to delay a planned 10 percent tariff on about half of the $300 billion in Chinese goods subject to the latest round of import duties.Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 800 points, or 3 percent, after the US Treasury yield curve inverted for the first time since 2007. Inversion of the yield curve — when short-term yields rise above long-term yields — shows that investors have little confidence in the near-term outlook and bid up long-term notes.In 2005, two-year and 10-year yields inverted ahead of a recession. In the past 50 years, a recession — two consecutive quarters of negative growth — has followed a yield-curve inversion within 18 to 24 months.However, former Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen said investors should give less weight to the inverted yield curve."I think the US economy has enough strength to avoid (a recession), but the odds have clearly risen, and they're higher than I'm frankly comfortable with," Yellen told the Fox Business Network. "There are a number of factors other than market expectations about the future path of interest rates that are pushing down long-term yields."The yield-curve inversion came after the Fed last month cut short-term interest rates a quarter-point. The cut was generally viewed as an effort to stimulate the economy by reducing the cost of borrowing. Most analysts expect the Fed to make further cuts.Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, said he believes there's a 40 percent chance of a recession prior to the 2020 election."Recessions are inevitable, the only question is when?" he told CNBC. "I think that in the next two years, let's say prior to the next election, there's probably a 40 percent chance of a recession."But not all forecasters are downbeat about the economy, now in its 121st consecutive month of growth — even as Home Depot lowered its sales outlook because of the trade dispute.The Conference Board, a non-profit research group, recognizes the risks to the economy, but forecasts GDP growth of 2.3 percent in 2019 and 2 percent in 2020.The Federal Reserve expects 2.1 percent growth this year and 2 percent in 2020. The International Monetary Fund forecasts global growth of 3.5 percent in 2020, with the American economy expanding 1.9 percent.

                Darth Vader helmet among treasures in $10m auction
            </a>
            <p>
                LOS ANGELES - Darth Vader's helmet from The Empire Strikes Back is among a vast collection of coveted Hollywood treasures going under the hammer next month, with experts predicting the helmet could fetch nearly $500,000.The combination of mask and helmet is only one of a handful of those worn by actor David Prowse, who played Luke Skywalker's nemesis and - spoiler alert - father on-screen in the 1980 Star Wars blockbuster movie, making them the "holy grail" of science fiction artifacts."The catalog estimate is $250,000-$450,000, and you never know what something will go for until it crosses the block. It could well exceed that," said Zach Pogemiller of auctioneer Profiles in History."Star Wars is always popular. It's never been hotter than it is right now, with the franchise continuing as strongly as it is."The Icons and Legends of Hollywood sale will take place Sept 25-26 in Los Angeles, with nearly 1,000 lots together expected to sell for more than $10 million.It will feature items from some of Tinseltown's most iconic movies, ranging from Hollywood's Golden Age to contemporary action movies and sci-fi.Up for grabs will be a black-and-white dress worn by Dorothy - or more specifically, Judy Garland's camera double Barbara Koshay - in 1939 classic The Wizard Of Oz. It may go for up to $500,000.A prototype moon buggy stolen by James Bond from villain Blofeld's secret lair in Diamonds Are Forever will also go under the hammer, with an upper estimate of $600,000.Among additional items expected to trigger bidding frenzies are a dress worn by Kate Winslet as Rose in Titanic and an authentic best picture Oscar statuette from 1948."You always hear stories of movie studio personnel who rescued what are now priceless pieces from the dumpster because they were being thrown out," said Pogemiller.Agence France - Presse

                James Bond heading to Shanghai for secret screening
            </a>
            <p>
                Moviegoers in China will soon be able to sip martinis and rub shoulders with tuxedoed spies at an immersive cinema screening of the James Bond film Casino Royale, thanks to a new entertainment deal.United Kingdom events company Secret Cinema announced on Tuesday that its immersive theatrical productions will go to China for the first time, through a new partnership with Shanghai-based SMG Live.Secret Cinema combines movie and television screenings with interactive performances, live bands and custom-built sets. Audience members themselves dress as characters from the productions and can join in on reenactments of iconic scenes.The two companies will put on Secret Cinema Presents Casino Royale this November in Shanghai, where they will recreate some of the most memorable moments from the 2006 James Bond hit."I created Secret Cinema in 2007 to reinvent the cinema experience, allowing participants to live inside the movies," said Secret Cinema founder Fabien Riggall. "It's always been my dream to bring it to other parts of the world, and now, with the support of an amazing team, we are able to make this happen."Secret Cinema Presents Casino Royale first opened in London this year. Once a ticket is bought the simulation begins—the"secret service"makes contact and gives instructions for a clandestine mission, including dress code, and an alias.At the venue, the audience can play card games and buy cocktails at a replica of the film's eponymous casino in Montenegro and move through mock-ups of other scenes from the thriller that is also set in Madagascar, Miami, the Bahamas and London."Casino Royale is a rich territory for us to explore from the characters to the plot and locations," said Secret Cinema creative director Angus Jackson."Our audience will be given the opportunity to understand what it takes to embody modern espionage—bringing them closer to the Bond experience than ever before."In the UK, Secret Cinema has screened more than a dozen major motion pictures including Alien, Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, Casablanca, and The Shawshank Redemption. The company has also created worlds from popular television shows like the Netflix hit Stranger Things."It's been amazing to see Secret Cinema become a cultural phenomenon here in the UK, and we've loved thrilling audiences with small and large-scale productions of cult cinematic classics such as Back to the Future, Blade Runner and Star Wars," said Riggall. "SMG Live's heritage and production experience makes it the perfect partner to bring the concept of Secret Cinema to life in China."SMG Live is a subsidiary of Shanghai Media Group, which is one of China's largest production companies.While Riggall did not say if the companies plan on screening any Chinese films, he confirmed he is a fan of the country's cinema."China is the largest film market in the world with a rich cinematic heritage with some of my favorite films such as Chen Kaige's Farewell my Concubine, Wong Kar Wai's In the Mood for Love and Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," he said.
