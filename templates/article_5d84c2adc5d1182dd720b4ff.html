[Photo by Jiang Dong/China Daily]The National Art Museum of China displays pieces donated by a German collector couple in 1996, Lin Qi reports.Thomas Eller, a German artist who has lived in Beijing for three years, had a "strange yet sweet" feeling when he looked at some 50 works of modern and contemporary art displayed at the National Art Museum of China last week. They were donated to the museum by German art collector Irene Ludwig and her late husband, Peter Ludwig, more than two decades ago."The shown artists are all familiar to me and seeing their works reminds me of my work back in Germany's art circles," Eller says. "What a wonderful way to share our cultural experiences with a large audience in China."He was among dozens of visitors who enjoyed a night tour of the Beijing museum on March 20. They were invited to Eternal Warmth, an exhibition that runs through Sunday, and shows selected works from the art donations the Ludwigs made. The exhibition also coincides with the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Germany this year.China's current booming art scene is drawing international artists like Eller. He organized the Gallery Weekend Beijing over March 17-19, featuring a strong lineup of galleries and artists here.When the Ludwigs donated art to the Chinese museum in 1996, Western modern art was little known to the public in China.
