                Many may consider it a mere coincidence. But the fact that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is visiting China, her 12th visit in 14 years, at a time when the US administration has upped the ante in the trade conflict with China calls for some serious reflection, especially on the part of China detractors.The large business delegation accompanying her shows the level of confidence she has in her hosts that they will see through all the potential deals in just 48 hours, for that is how long her latest visit to China will last.Yet neither China nor Germany is immune to rising trade protectionism. For instance, the German economy grew only 0.4 percent in the first half of this year, the lowest in the past five years.China was Germany's largest trading partner for the third year running last year with bilateral trade volume of €199 billion ($219.62 billion), up 6.6 percent over 2017. Equally important, Germany's investment in China increased 72.4 percent year-on-year from January to July this year.It's not surprising therefore that the German business delegation comprises top executives of auto companies, and CEOs of semiconductor, logistics, financial service and energy companies.In other words, spurred by both external and internal challenges, Beijing and Berlin seem determined to further deepen their already highly productive cooperation, and show the wider world that negotiations based on equality and economic reciprocity, rather than bullying, bear fruit in bilateral trade relations.China is keen on seeking German cooperation and importing high-tech products, and Germany looks forward to tapping into the huge demand that China's industrial upgrading is expected to release. Besides, China's strengths in 5G could help Germany propel its growth.In particular, it is hoped Merkel's visit would expedite the free trade negotiations between the European Union and China.Moreover, since both countries support free trade and rules-based global governance, they are expected to strengthen global efforts to address some common challenges, from climate change to international organizations' reform, and prevent countries from backpedaling on these issues.Beijing and Berlin have already set a good example of how to transform differences into complementarities, instead of using them as excuses to engage in hostilities.A pragmatic and nuanced approach to bilateral economic relations always produces mutually beneficial results, unlike the US' gunboat economic diplomacy, which is detrimental to one and all.

                Scholars, business leaders and officials from China and the US on Saturday rejected claims that China is a threat to US economic and national security.The group called for the principle of "agreeing to disagree" to guide both sides in future discussions, with the aim of building trust and maintaining a healthy relationship between the two countries."The dynamic of China's impressive rise is clearly fueling American discomfort", said Neil Bush, founder and chairman of the George H.W. Bush Foundation for US-China Relations.Bush said that central to the current low point in Sino-US relations is the American question of whether China is a natural friend or foe of the US.The son of former US president George H.W. Bush rejected the assumption that a strong China will threaten US global power or that China will become a hostile actor on the world stage."For my understanding of history, China never uses military or economic power to impose its will on another country, and I think it's useful to look at history as a predictor of future behavior," he said.

                    Free trade gets vote of confidence: China Daily editorial
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                While very few, if any, governments are indifferent to the current political and economic uncertainties, the inconvenient truth is that the most advanced and most vibrant economies have been hit the hardest by unilateralism and protectionism.Should the world's major economies succumb to such disruptive, regressive tendencies, the world could be staring at the disintegration of the global economic and trade regime.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who just concluded her 12th visit to China, said a resounding "no" to those tendencies, sending a clear and loud message of unswerving commitment to multilateralism and free trade.As the world's second- and fourth-largest economies, China and Germany have every reason to work together and fight the countercurrents. The assurance Chinese and German leaders just exchanged in Beijing about deepening cooperation is exactly how economies should respond to the uncertainties.As President Xi Jinping told Merkel, no country is immune to trade hostilities, and the two countries need each other more than ever. With the United States threatening to impose more tariffs on Chinese goods, and noises about "decoupling" the Chinese and US economies rising in Washington, Beijing has no choice but to look for alternatives. Of course, Beijing is making all-out efforts — from proactive financial and monetary to job retention policies — to mitigate the negative effects of the US-instigated trade war.Germany, too, has seen its economy losing steam — the country's economy contracted 0.1 percent in the second quarter, according to the German central bank.And in the US, more and more economists are calling the White House's bluff of making "unprecedented" gains from the trade war by warning of an incoming recession. Given Washington's beggar-thy-neighbor policy, Beijing and Berlin have reached a consensus that enhancing cooperation is the only cure for the global economy afflicted by the virus of unilateralism.Yet challenges lie ahead. Beijing wants Berlin to treat Chinese companies and investors more fairly, saying its increasingly strict investment scrutiny has kept Chinese investors at bay. In the first half of this year, Chinese investments in Germany reportedly dropped about 90 percent. And Germany is obsessed with intellectual property rights protection being inadequate in China.If Beijing's promises of greater openness and better IPR protection and Berlin's about fair treatment of Chinese companies and facilitation of negotiations on the China-European Union bilateral investment treaty are fulfilled, not only the two economies, but the global economy as well would get a much needed shot in the arm.
