                Ebola death toll in DRC reaches 1,705
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                 The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed 1,705 people between April and July 18, according to the latest figures provided by the DRC's Ministry of Health.So far, 2,532 Ebola virus cases have been reported in the outbreak that is centered in the northeastern part of the country.According to the Doctors Without Borders, an international humanitarian medical non-governmental organization, the epidemic is by far the country's largest-ever Ebola outbreak.It's also the second biggest Ebola epidemic ever recorded, behind the West Africa outbreak of 2014-2016, where a total of 28,616 cases and 11,310 deaths were reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.An additional 36 cases and 15 deaths were reported after the disease spread to Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States.The African Union has announced that it will deploy more experts in response to the Ebola crisis.In a press conference at the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Friday, John Nkengasong, the director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said they will reactivate the African Voluntary Health Corps and deploy them not just in DRC but also in other countries within the region.The health corps is a team of 800 epidemiologists, anthropologists as well as communication, laboratory and logistics experts from different African countries who are on standby for emergency deployment."The corps were very effective in response to the 2014 outbreak in West Africa. We hope they will also be very useful in the current outbreak," Nkengasong said.Nkengasong said the decision to deploy the corps was dictated by the World Health Organization's declaration, categorizing the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern."This is a declaration that is issued when an event is extraordinary, serious and has a potential to cross beyond the country where it is, and have a regional or international effect from the public health perspective," he said.Nkengasong termed insecurity and attacks on health centers and health providers as a major challenge in the affected provinces.He said the AU will be engaging the United Nations security system to improve security for experts and facilities. They will also engage the AU Peace and Security Council."We will be working with the government of the DRC very closely to better coordinate our efforts with other partners like the WHO," he added.The Doctors Without Borders has recommended that the Ebola-related activities be integrated into the existing healthcare system in order to improve proximity of the services to the community and ensure it remains functional during the outbreak.To further strengthen response to the Ebola outbreak, the AU plans to procure and provide additional equipment and supplies, strengthen cross-border surveillance and laboratory systems, and come up with a new approach to raising awareness at the community level.Investigations point to a possible start of the outbreak back in May 2018. However, the delay in the alert and subsequent response can be attributed to several factors, including a breakdown of the surveillance system, and a strike by health workers of the area, which began in May, due to the non-payment of salaries.Surveillance measures at the borders of Rwanda and Uganda have been tightened to prevent spread of the virus.The Botswana's Ministry of Health on Friday announced that it will continue to monitor the situation in the DRC as well as the entire region in consultation with the WHO's country office.However, there are concerns that the situation might get difficult if the disease spreads to South Sudan, whose health system has been weakened by the prolonged civil war.The country has sent a health team to strengthen surveillance at one of the busiest border posts, Kayain Central Equatorial state, where one case was confirmed, as reported by the Associated Press.

                    Rwanda closes border with Congo over Ebola
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                KINSHASA — A Rwandan official says his country has closed its border with Congo because of the deadly Ebola outbreak.The state minister for foreign affairs Olivier Nduhungirehe confirmed the border closure to The Associated Press on Thursday.The closure comes after a man died of Ebola in Congo's major city of Goma, which is on the Rwandan border. He was the second confirmed Ebola case in Goma.The World Health Organization, which declared this yearlong Ebola outbreak a global health emergency last month, has recommended against travel restrictions.It also says the risk of regional spread is "very high."A Congolese official says a person who had contact with the second confirmed Ebola case in the city of Goma is at an Ebola treatment center after showing signs of the disease.If this suspected case is confirmed, it could be the first transmission of Ebola in this yearlong outbreak inside Goma, a city of more than 2 million people on the Rwandan border.Witnesses say border crossings with Rwanda near the city now appear to be closed.AP

                KIGALI - All travels to Ebola-hit areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) should be avoided due to the Ebola outbreak in the country, Rwandan Health Minister Diane Gashumba said Thursday."Unessential travels to eastern DRC, including cross-border trade should be highly avoided. Rwandans should think twice before crossing to DRC just to buy or sell a few pair of shoes or a few food stuff items," said Gashumba while addressing a press conference in Rwandan capital Kigali.She reiterated that Rwanda's border with DRC remains open, adding that the government would issue a statement in case of a temporary closure at the border.Traffic at the border slowed down on Thursday morning as measures were put in place to reinforce screening procedures and public safety at entry points, she said.The minister also cautioned against illegal crossings from or to DRC.She emphasized the need of seeking immediate medical advice when falling ill during or immediately after traveling to DRC.The presidency's office of DRC said in a statement earlier on Thursday that Rwanda has closed its border with its western neighbor after a man died of Ebola in the eastern DRC city of Goma, which borders Rwanda to the east.The man, in his 40s, has tested positive for the deadly virus and died on Wednesday in the populous city of Goma. He was the second confirmed Ebola case in the city.The DRC health authorities announced late Wednesday night the confirmation of a third case in Goma.This week marked one year since the start of the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the DRC that has already killed more than 1,700 people, making it the second worst Ebola outbreak in history.Rwanda has a detailed National Preparedness Plan for Ebola in place and has trained health workers in early detection and response, educated communities about Ebola, vaccinated health workers in high-risk areas, equipped health facilities, and continues to conduct simulation exercises to maintain a high level of readiness.Screening for Ebola symptoms at points of entry has been ongoing since the beginning of the outbreak in DRC, and has been reinforced since the confirmation of a case in Goma.An Ebola Treatment Center was put in place in the country and 23 isolation units are being prepared in hospitals in 15 priority districts. Ebola response simulation exercises are on a regular basis within the community, borders, airport and treatment center to test Rwanda's preparedness in response to a case, which includes emergency operations center activation, active surveillance, case management and laboratory testing.About 3,000 health workers in high-risk areas have been vaccinated as a preventive measure, and over 23,000 people including doctors, nurses, hospital staff, community health workers, religious leaders, Red Cross volunteers and security organs have been trained.
