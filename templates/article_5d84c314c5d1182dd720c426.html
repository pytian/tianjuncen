                City opens up economy to the world
            </p>
            <p>
                Jinan, capital of East China's Shandong province, showcased its industrial and economic development to overseas media representatives who took part in the three-day Discover Jinan tour earlier this month. The city of Jinan is developing an open economy and cultivating new engines of growth via its China (Shandong) Pilot Free Trade Zone, which was launched in late August. With an area of over 10,000 square kilometers and a population of 10 million, the GDP of Jinan hit 886.2 billion yuan ($125.4 billion) in 2018 while its per capita GDP reached 101,900 yuan, making it a member of Asia's top 50 cities, according to a report from Royal Society, a research institute in the United Kingdom. Sun Shutao, mayor of Jinan, said the city is working to optimize its regulations and the way it operates amid deepening economic globalization. Policies beneficial to overseas capital such as cutting negative lists, streamlining customs clearance and encouraging foreign ownership of companies in more sectors are on the way to construct an open, equal and efficient business environment, according to Sun. "Jinan will open itself wider to investment, finance, education and medical fields, and allow more foreign-owned or foreign-funded enterprises to operate or invest in more fields so as to provide a more open and inclusive market for companies," Sun said. For example, some 53 medical groups from home and abroad have registered with the Jinan International Center for Medical Sciences. By 2030, the center is expected to have 10 internationally renowned medical institutions and 100 key industrial projects. By that time it is anticipated that the medical center will receive 10 million visits annually, with an annual output value up to 100 billion yuan. As a key transport junction of the Belt and Road Initiative, Jinan is playing a bigger role in global trade in part due to its strengths in intelligent manufacturing, transportation and logistics. The Qilu China Railway Express, operated by Shandong High-Speed Logistics Group, is a major contributor to regional opening-up. The train travels from Shandong province to countries in Europe, Central Asia and Southeast Asia, including Russia, Belarus, Poland, Vietnam and Thailand, according to Liu Ying, deputy general manager of the company. The shorter transportation time, higher level of security and lower logistics cost compared with maritime and air transport have created new opportunities, she said, adding the express has made 88.3 trips per month on average in 2019, up 215.2 percent year-on-year. Trains from Jinan have delivered 102,300 metric tons of goods this year, with a value of $254 million. The category of goods has been expanded from daily necessities, apparel and small goods, to automobiles, home appliances, machinery equipment, laser-engraving machines and auto parts. Nhem Sophal, a senior reporter from Rasmei Kampuchea Daily Newspaper in Cambodia, a participant in the media trip, showed interest in the train. "Before, I never knew that a freight train can go to so many countries," he said. "It may be one of the best ways to increase China's economy because it can save the cost for import and export." Monthian Xayasith, deputy editor-in-chief of Champamai Newspaper in Laos, was impressed by China National Heavy Duty Truck Group, also known as Sinotruk, the nation's largest producer and exporter for heavy duty trucks, based in Jinan. "It is a very big company, which exports the most heavy-duty trucks in China and covers more than 100 countries and regions," he said. The 780-meter-long production line produces 100 vehicles every day, according to the company. Zhang Yanling, vice-president of the international department of the company, said it sold 303,000 vehicles last year, making 65.9 billion yuan in revenue. The Jinan-based Jier Machine-Tool Group, one of the top three CNC punching machine manufacturers in the world, showcased how over 82 years it has managed to innovate and globalize. When first produced, more than 600 of the company's products were the first of their kind in China. Its large CNC punching machine occupies 85 percent of the market share in China and is sold to more 60 countries and regions. It has provided high-end automatic stamping equipment to leading global auto brands such as General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen. Its operations cover 13 countries. Jinan has developed its intelligent manufacturing and high-end equipment industries in recent years, whose revenues surpassed 300 billion yuan in 2018, data from the local government showed.

                UN Security Council to vote on call for Idlib truce
            </a>
            <p>
                UNITED NATIONS－The United Nations Security Council is due to vote on Thursday on a draft resolution calling for a truce in northwest Syria.The diplomatic initiative comes after the leaders of Turkey, Russia and Iran agreed in Ankara on Monday to try to ease tensions in the war-ravaged country's Idlib region.Syria's northwest corner, including Idlib, is the last major chunk of territory still in rebel hands after more than eight years of war.Experts from the council's 15 members have met three times to negotiate on the latest text drafted by Kuwait, Germany and Belgium last month. A resolution needs nine votes and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain or the United States to pass.The draft resolution by Germany, Belgium and Kuwait "demands that member states ensure that all measures taken to counter terrorism, including in Idlib governorate, comply with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law, international human rights law and international refugee law".It also stresses "that counterterrorism operations do not absolve parties to armed conflicts of their obligations under international humanitarian law, including their obligation to distinguish between civilian populations and combatants".And it urges all parties to the Syrian conflict to distinguish between civilians and combatants, to apply the principle of "proportionality" and to take all feasible precautions "to avoid and in any event minimize harm to civilians and civilian objects".Syrian government forces have been waging a five-month offensive in Idlib. Much of the region is controlled by militants linked to the former Nusra Front, which was connected to al-Qaida.Shortly after the draft UN resolution was proposed, Damascus declared a cease-fire on Aug 31 which brought a lull in airstrikes. However, Syrian troops on Sunday shelled south of Idlib, according to rescuers and residents.The UN said that since the start of hostilities in northwest Syria in April, more than 550 civilians have been killed and some 400,000 displaced. Almost half of the displaced people are living in open-air areas or under trees.Although the leaders of Turkey, Russia and Iran agreed to try ease tensions in Idlib at the Ankara meeting, disagreements among the countries appeared to linger, especially over the threat from the Islamic State group.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced last month that the world body would investigate attacks on UN-supported facilities and other humanitarian sites in northwest Syria.The locations of the UN-supported facilities and other humanitarian sites like hospitals and health centers had been shared with the warring parties in a bid to protect them. However, the UN has questioned whether this decision has made these facilities targets.Agencies

                Kaspersky banking on sustained business growth
            </a>
            <p>
                Russia-based cyberspace security solution provider Kaspersky is eyeing double-digit growth in the China market, far higher than its global average, according to its CEO and founder Eugene Kaspersky.He made the remarks during the ongoing weeklong national awareness campaign on cyberspace security, China Cybersecurity Week that opened in Tianjin on Monday.Kaspersky said the rapid development of China will create a "more open market in the cybersecurity field and brew more opportunities for foreign companies."He said the company's sales grew by 30 percent last year to $15 million in China."We envision a double-digit growth in China by 2020," he said, amid the company's average global sales growth of around 10 percent in recent years."We formed a partnership with China Electronic Technology Cyber Security Co last year during the 2018 World Internet Conference," he said.The collaboration with the leading national level cybersecurity company based in Chengdu, engaged in key cyberspace security protection for Southwest China, will focus on antivirus and cloud computing. Kaspersky will look to have more partnerships with other information security solutions and services.Eyeing greater opportunities in North China, the company is now in close contact with some companies in Tianjin for further cooperation in cybersecurity, he said.Wang Yun, director of the Office of Cyberspace Affair Committee in Tianjin, said Tianjin is aiming to become a benchmark city of China's cyberspace security protection, and has inked partnerships with leading local companies including 360, Phytium and Kylin in the sector during the weeklong event.Liu Quan, director of the China Center for Information Industry Development Institute of Cyberspace, indicated that China's cyberspace market has ample opportunities for foreign companies.In the next five years, the market will see a 25 percent growth in terms of volume from its current 100 billion yuan ($14.1 billion) for the combined industrial chains, including cybersecurity products, chips and operation systems, just to name a few, he said.
