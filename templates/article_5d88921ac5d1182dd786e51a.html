                French president apologizes over Albania national anthem mix-up
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                TIRANA -- French President Emmanuel Macron sent an apology message to Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama for a national anthem mix-up ahead of a football match on Saturday evening, Rama tweeted on Sunday."President Macron expressed his sincere apologies for the scandalous gaffe of the French Football Federation, with our anthem of National Flag! He called it an 'unacceptable mistake'," Rama posted on Twitter.According to Rama, in his message the French president appreciated the reaction of Albania's national football team players and asked Rama to make his apology public.The wrong anthem was played for the Albanian team before the European Qualifier match kicked off in State de France in Paris Saturday evening.The Albanian football fans and players were expecting to hear their national anthem called "Himni i Flamurit" (National Flag) prior to the start of the game, but the national anthem of Andorra was played by mistake by the organizers, which puzzled the Albanian players.To make things worse, when the Albanian national anthem was about to play the stadium announced that "please respect the Armenia national anthem."The match was delayed by seven minutes in the end.Another public apology was offered by the coach of France, Didier Deschamps, who confirmed this at a press conference after the match.Albania lost 1-4 against the French national team. On Sept 10 Albania will be at home to the national team of Iceland in central Albania's Elbasan Arena stadium.

                It's got great parking, wonderful rooms, is near an airport, and the president of the United States says the Florida hotel that he owns and wants to be the site for the next G7 summit doesn't have bedbugs.On Tuesday, President Donald Trump blamed "Radical Left Democrats" for spreading a "false and nasty rumor" about a bedbug infestation at his golf resort in Doral."No bedbugs at Doral," Trump wrote in a midmorning tweet. "The Radical Left Democrats, upon hearing that the perfectly located (for the next G7) Doral National MIAMI was under consideration for the next G7, spread that false and nasty rumor. Not nice!"On Monday, Trump held a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron at the end of the G7 summit in Biarritz, France. Then Trump sought to make a case for convening at the Trump National Doral Miami next year when the US hosts the summit."Doral happens to be ... only five minutes from the airport, the airport's right next door," he told reporters. "And by the way, my people looked at 12 sites, all good, but some were two hours from the airport, some four hours."We have a series of magnificent buildings, we call them bungalows, they each hold from 50 to 70 rooms, they have magnificent views," he said. "Each country can have their own villa."Trump said he would not directly benefit from hosting the G7 at his golf resort: "From my standpoint, I'm not going to make any money. In my opinion, I'm not going to make any money."Fox News said Trump's advisers have cautioned against pushing the hotel as a G7 site amid concerns about the ethics of the president personally profiting from an official government event.One former Republican senator, Rick Santorum, said that such a move could be in "violation of the law"."The fact is that the president should not be doing this," Santorum said on CNN. "It would be a violation of the law as far as I understand it. I hope this is the last time he mentions it."The Washington Post reported that just hours after Trump suggested the property, the hash tag #TrumpBedBugs began trending on social media, in response to a January 2017 Miami Herald report about claims from a Doral guest in 2016 about waking up with dozens of bedbug bites. The guest sued the resort and reportedly reached a settlement in 2017, shortly after Trump's inauguration.Meanwhile, the newspaper that Trump has repeatedly criticized for publishing "fake news'' and has said is "failing'', said on Monday that its newsroom has bedbugs. The New York Times said that it had found evidence of bedbugs in the newsroom and elsewhere in its building and has hired professional cleaners to sweep the affected areas."All affected areas have already been treated," Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha told The Hill in a statement on Monday.Reuters contributed to this story.

                US leader seems intent on fueling and manipulating Sinophobia in the belief that it will force China's concessions Although not a member of the G7, China was nevertheless on the minds of those leaders gathered in French seaside town of Biarritz, for the group's annual meeting chaired this year by French President Emmanuel Macron. On his way to the G7 summit, the top US leader showed he was ready to dangerously escalate the trade war with China that he triggered in March 2018. Neither of the two meetings between the presidents of the two countries - on the sidelines of the G20 summits in Buenos Aires and Osaka - were able to pave the way for a trade agreement. The US leader decided to add even more pressure on the already complicated Sino-US trade relations on his way to Biarritz. In a tweet, he took the risk of initiating a new Cold War. Indeed, his mention of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) on Aug 23 2019 was a highly dangerous provocation. After the declaration of a national emergency, US federal law would then authorize the US President to order the US companies to stop doing business with China seen as an unusual and extraordinary threat to US national security. The impact of such a decision would be an enormous blow to the world economy already hurt by an uncertain geopolitical horizon. But the US leader seems intent on fueling and manipulating Sinophobia in the belief that it will help get him reelected next year. To understand the China policy of the current US administration, one needs to keep in mind its two major - and wrong - assumptions. First, it is of the opinion that China's success owes everything to US generosity and benevolence. Second, the administration assumes that a trade deal can be imposed on Beijing through a series of spectacular injunctions and mounting threats. These do not accord with reality. China is moving back into a position of centrality in global affairs thanks to its own efforts. And while the US administration's increasingly aggressive China policy can create a situation in which there is less interconnection between the two countries, it could even mean a decoupling, but it can't undermine and stop the Chinese renaissance, a deep historical long-term trend largely independent from short-term external variations. In the series of tweets mentioning the IEEPA, Donald Trump added a revealing - and deeply false - remark: "We don't need China" which is a baseless idea. Reinforced by a group-think phenomenon, especially since the departure of chief economic advisor Gary Cohn, it carries with it a disgraceful Sinophobia and a refusal to conceive of a world in which power has been redistributed, to some extent. Truth, however, imposes itself. On all major global issues, China has become indispensable. For world peace, for economic, social and environmental progress, China is needed as never before. The position on free trade expressed by the UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the fact that the journalists covering the G7 were focusing on Beijing, the time spent on China at the final news conference given by the US and the French presidents, are evidence of China's importance in world affairs. Beijing reacted wisely to the most recent series of tempestuous tweets from the US leader. Vice-Premier Liu He, on another occasion, called for calm on the final day of the G7 meeting, which allowed the G7 leaders to reassure, at least temporarily, the markets and the analysts. No matter the force of the tempest, it is the captain's capacity to remain calm which will increase the chance of reaching less dangerous waters. China and the US must find a way to reach an agreement. In parallel, and as indicated by French President Emmanuel Macron, an important part of the long-term solution to the Sino-American tensions will be a reformed World Trade Organization. We are clearly at a critical moment. Calm and vision should be our guides toward new forms of negotiated equilibrium.

                    Brexit to affect plans for RMB in Europe

                During the past three years, Brexit has had the world economy worrying. With the new UK prime minister taking office recently, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit has increased, raising concerns. Both the United Kingdom's and Europe's economies are showing signs of slowing down, according to newly released data. For China, which is far away from Europe and has obviously not been affected by Brexit, it's worth watching the process.Given that the renminbi's current international status is not fitting for the currency of the world's second-largest economy, China has made RMB internationalization one of its strategic goals. London, as a global financial center, has contributed a lot in this respect.Since the RMB, or yuan, is not freely convertible, currency swap is an important way to promote internationalization. In June 2013, China and the UK signed a currency swap agreement worth 200 billion yuan ($28 billion), which was increased to 350 billion RMB in October 2015.The UK government played a supportive role in the issue of RMB-denominated bonds. In 2014, it became the first foreign government to issue RMB-denominated bonds, and deposited 3 billion yuan from the bonds into its Exchange Equalization Account, which had previously dealt with only international currencies, such as US dollars, euros and Canadian dollars. This move is seen as recognition by the UK that the RMB is already an international currency.The UK supported the RMB in international financial organizations, including its inclusion in the special drawing rights basket of the International Monetary Fund, a key milestone in the journey toward internationalization.Since 2014, the RMB could be directly converted into pound sterling or euro without being converted into dollars, and many Chinese-funded banks were qualified for RMB clearance in London. RMB transactions in Britain account for over 6 percent of global offshore transactions, making it the largest RMB offshore transaction center after Hong Kong.London is important because of its status as a global financial center. The question is whether it will remain so after Brexit, particularly a no-deal Brexit.So far, it's far from clear how the UK will leave the European Union, even after Boris Johnson's recent visits to Berlin, Paris and Biarritz, France. But it is possible that the UK might lose free access to the European Union's single market, one of the key factors that helped forge its status as a financial center.Many large financial institutions around the world choose to access the European market through Britain.Britain is expected to try to bargain to maintain its access to the single market, but this is a tall order, particularly with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's tough Brexit policy. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, launched by the EU in 2014, stipulates that financial institutions from "third-party countries" that want to operate in the EU should be recognized by the European Commission.In other words, the UK will have to follow stringent European financial regulatory rules, something that will be difficult for the UK to accept, since it has always favored relaxing regulations.The UK will also face stiff competition from the European continent.Brexit will have an impact on China's RMB internationalization strategy in Europe. It may bring trouble for China in promoting RMB internationalization "from London to the world".But Brexit will not strike a "crushing blow" on London as a financial center.Britain will prioritize safeguarding its status as a financial center, which presents new opportunities for China-UK monetary cooperation. China could take this opportunity to improve cooperation and carry out more RMB business in the UK.Without a clear scenario about Brexit, it is too early to arrive at a clear picture of financial centers in the future. For example, there could emerge one single center or a number of competing centers.However, it is certain the eurozone will work harder on building up its financial capacity and improving cooperation with the rest of the world. China can work with any emerging financial center to conduct RMB business. As the saying goes, opportunities emerge from a crisis.The author is deputy director of the Institute of European Studies of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations.
