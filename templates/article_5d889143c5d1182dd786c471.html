                Xinjiang delegation pays visit to Germany
            </p>
            <p>
                BERLIN - A delegation from China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region on Thursday concluded a four-day visit to Germany, during which they held talks with German authorities and introduced the real Xinjiang to the German public.No terrorist attacks have taken place over the past three years because of Chinese government policy, said the delegation during talks on Sept 2 with the Interior Ministry of Bavaria State in Munich. Xinjiang has enjoyed steady socio-economic development, and even received a growing number of tourists to the region, it added.The delegation briefed the German side on the vocational education and training programs in Xinjiang, which provide courses in standard spoken and written Chinese language, law and vocational training, all in a bid to combat extremism.The delegation also hopes to exchange experience with the German side on deradicalization and how to resist international terrorist forces.China has long opened its door to the outside world for foreign diplomatic envoys, United Nations officials, Geneva-based senior diplomats of various countries, as well as those from political parties, civil society organizations, the news media, and religious organizations to visit Xinjiang, the delegation said.China also organizes groups to head abroad and introduce the real Xinjiang to the world, they added.Harald Pickert, an inspector with the Bavarian police, said at the meeting that terrorism is the common challenge facing both Germany and China. Although no terrorist attacks have taken place recently in Germany, counterterrorism work cannot become lax, he added.The German side said security is the precondition for economic growth and the development of tourism, and that combating terrorism at its roots and eliminating radicalization through education and vocational training programs are solid practices.On Wednesday, the delegation held talks with representatives from the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin over counterterrorism, deradicalization and vocational education and training programs in Xinjiang.Xing Guangcheng, head of the delegation, who works at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, on Wednesday delivered a lecture on cultural heritage protection and tourism development in Xinjiang at the Chinese Cultural Center in Berlin, to an audience of about 100.The five-member delegation, organized by the State Council Information Office of China, also includes scholars and grassroots officials from Xinjiang. They will next visit France and the United Kingdom.Xinhua

                Conservation of Buddhist artworks at the Mogao Caves is encouraging similar efforts at home and abroadEditor's note: As the People's Republic of China prepares to celebrate its 70th anniversary on Oct 1, China Daily is featuring a series of stories on the role regions have played in the country's development and where they are today.When asked in front of foreign visitors what it takes to sustain the love for his job after three decades, mural restorer Yang Tao said it is all about having "peace of mind"."You need to be in a state of tranquility, to guide a stable hand to mend the lines and reconnect the dots," said Yang, 52, who works at the Mogao Caves near the major Silk Road hub of Dunhuang, Gansu province.The UNESCO World Heritage Site is home to some of the best examples in the world of Buddhist murals, sculptures and writings located in nearly 500 grottoes. They cover a large expanse of Chinese history, including the golden age of the Tang Dynasty (618-907).Yang's approach to repairing and preserving the iconic works of art for future generations reflects the serious conservation efforts undertaken in Dunhuang in recent decades.Zhao Shengliang, director of the Dunhuang Academy of China, said the achievements helped to continue the site's historic role bridging relations between the East and West."In the past 70 years, our direction and role to protect, research and promote the grottoes have not changed. We are carrying forward that tradition and culture," Zhao said.As a pioneer in cultural relics conservation, management and research, the academy boasts state-of-the-art preservation and restoration technology, such as environmental monitoring devices and digital imaging equipment.

                Yak Museum gives curator lots to talk about
            </a>
            <p>
                A part of Tibetan life for centuries, the revered animals provide food, clothing, labor and transport. Over 40 years ago, Wu Yuchu was trapped in a blizzard in the Tibet autonomous region. It was 1977, two years after Wu had started working in Tibet. He and more than 50 other people took shelter in a mud-brick house while the blizzard raged. The outside temperature dropped to-30 C, and food was running out. When the rescue team finally arrived with yaks carrying lifesaving supplies, Wu immediately bonded with the beasts. He could not have imagined that the bond would last for decades. Yaks saved his life, and he has spent most of his life promoting the animals. "I have watched and studied them ever since," Wu says. "I grew really fond of them, and I wanted to learn more about the species." His yak studies remained a hobby until 2014, when he became the curator of the Yak Museum in Lhasa, Tibet's capital. With a total investment of over 100 million yuan ($14.5 million), it is the country's first and only yak-themed museum. "Now I see yaks every day, and I can tell more people about them," says the 65-year-old. He has even given himself a Tibetan name which roughly translates as "old yak man". As the Tibetan saying goes, "Where there is a Tibetan, there are yaks". The animal has been part of Tibetan life for centuries. They provide food, clothing, labor and transport and are so revered that they are commonly used as religious symbols. For these reasons, Wu is warmly welcomed when he goes to collect exhibits from every corner of Tibet. Locals not only donate items when Wu visits their homes, but they also trek from remote areas to Lhasa just to offer help. The museum has also received a donation of 86 items from a Nepalese businessman. Many of its exhibits have been shown in big cities like Beijing and Guangzhou, Guangdong province. The Yak Museum is not only Wu's spiritual sanctuary, but also a place where young people can learn about their ancestors' way of life and scholars to search for different perspectives. "Of course, one of the most frequently asked questions is 'What does yak meat taste like?'" Wu jokes.

                Foreign scholars applaud China's anti-terror efforts
            </a>
            <p>
                Many foreign scholars who visited the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region said the efforts made by the local government in combating and preventing terrorism are effective, and could be learned by other countries.They positively viewed the local measures taken to deal with these challenges, and called for further international cooperation in counterterrorism and de-radicalization.From Wednesday to Friday, more than 60 scholars from the Advisory Committee of Human Rights Council of the United Nations and 17 countries including Serbia, Sri Lanka, France, Indonesia and Italy attended the International Seminar on Counterterrorism, De-radicalization and Human Rights Protection, which was organized by the China Society for Human Rights Studies, in Urumqi, the regional capital.The scholars visited an exhibition about major cases of terrorism in Xinjiang and went to the Xinjiang Islamic Institute. They also visited the Kashgar vocational education and training center.Xinjiang is a key battlefield in the fight against terrorism and extremism in China. Terrorism, separatism and extremism have gravely damaged the stability, solidarity and progress of Xinjiang for a long time, and the basic human rights of the people in the region to life, health, property and development had been trampled."Some countries have criticized China's policies against terrorism in Xinjiang. Let us ask what America would do if hundreds of Americans died in terrorist attacks?" asked Predrag Markovic, director of the Institute for Contemporary History, Serbia.He said the training center offers an opportunity for those young people who were affected by terrorism and extremism to start a new life. "I believe it is a much better solution than repression only. It is not the whole process, but it's a good beginning."Jayanath Siri Kumara Colombage, director of the center for Indo-Lanka Initiatives of the Pathfinder Foundation, said what the Chinese government is doing has proved effective.He communicated with young people in the training center and learned that they were misled by the wrong people. "The young people have repented of the past. These are good signs," he said.Colombage said his home country of Sri Lanka has been troubled by terrorism for decades. "I know how these people are radicalized, and I think this is a great program," he said.Addressing both the symptoms and root causes, Xinjiang has established vocational education and training centers in accordance with the law to prevent the breeding and spread of terrorism and religious extremism, effectively curbing the frequent terrorist incidents, according to a white paper released by the State Council Information Office in August.However, Xinjiang's anti-terrorism efforts were still attacked by some Western media."What we hear from the Western media and what is really happening on the ground are totally two different things," Colombage said."You are not hiding anything, you told us to ask any question, and we asked very difficult questions," he said.Abdul Wahid Wahid, a senior adviser to the Minister of Haj and Religious Affairs of Afghanistan, said Xinjiang's experience is effective in eradicating extremism and terrorism, and he wants to learn more about it."I've heard a lot about the education center. Western media somehow said that is a 'torture center'. Now that I saw the center, and that it's really an education center, I wish we had established such centers in Afghanistan many years ago," he said.Matteo Bressan, a professor of International Relations and Strategic Studies at Lumsa University (Rome), said he believes that education is a way to help fight the global phenomenon of extremism and radicalism."We should respect the Chinese approach to these issues and challenges," he said.Shu Hongshui, vice-president of the Anti-terrorism Law School, Northwest University of Political Science and Law in Xi'an of Shaanxi province, said terrorism and extremism are global problems, and China is offering its solution to the world.He noted that China has been actively participating in international counterterrorism and anti-extremism programs and China has joined a number of international conventions in this regard.

                Success in curbing terrorism leads to social harmony

                This was not my first trip to the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, but it was the most impressive one. From Wednesday to Friday, I was with a group of scholars from 17 countries and the Advisory Committee of the United Nations Human Rights Council, who were invited to attend an international seminar on counterterrorism in Urumqi, the regional capital.On Wednesday, for the first time, I watched an exhibition about major cases of terrorism in Xinjiang and visited the Xinjiang Islamic Institute.I was shocked by the lunatic terrorist activities that happened to people, of which the bloody pictures still linger in my mind. Innocent people, the youngest aged five, were killed by the coldblooded terrorists. I don't think people with any human nature would do that.Thanks to the joint efforts, Xinjiang has remained stable for the past few years and recovered from the threat of terrorism. People from all ethnic groups here work and live in harmony. People's religious freedom has been fully protected and a large number of Muslims are studying in the new Islamic institute.Xinjiang is the pearl of Northwest China, where I longed to visit for many years. Many people in other parts of the country are also lured by its wonderful natural attractions, friendly people and splendid multiethnic culture. It should never be overshadowed by extremism and terrorism.On Thursday, we visited the Kashgar vocational education and training center, as well as the night market and Kashgar old town.When we were there, tens of thousands of visitors from all across the country were also visiting the old town, with local people dancing and singing to welcome the guests, and stores displaying local handicrafts.That is what's happening in Xinjiang－a stable and prosperous society. Many scholars in the visiting group that I interviewed said they found Xinjiang totally different from what some Western media had portrayed.At the training center, which has been slandered by some Western media in various ways, many scholars praised the government's efforts to give opportunities to these young people who had been affected by terrorism and extremism to restart their life.Predrag Markovic, director of the Institute of Contemporary History of Serbia, whose country once suffered from terrorism, said: "I regret deeply that we didn't have Chinese wisdom 30 years ago. We put radicalized young people in jails, it only made them worse."Many of the young people studying in the center are only around 20 years old. They still have another 50, 60 or 70 years of life. They need some vocational skills to find a decent job to support their families and create bright futures, rather than sitting at home, doing nothing and counting on their parents.I think what Xinjiang is doing now is not only to combat terrorism and extremism, but also to support the all-around development of the society and these young people.
