                IMF: Global GDP expected to rise 3.2 percent in 2019, 3.5 percent next yearChina's economic prospects remain robust despite sluggish global growth and the ongoing trade friction with the United States, officials and economists said on Friday."The country's positive economic fundamentals and long-term trajectory remain unchanged," Ning Jizhe, deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission, said at the China Development Forum Special Session in Beijing on Friday.China has all the confidence as well as capability to meet projected targets for economic and social development as the economy has strong resilience, great potential and ample room to maneuver, Ning said.The world's second-largest economy expanded by 6.3 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2019, the fastest growth among all major economies worldwide, he said.Global growth remains sluggish, with trade tensions being the biggest downside risk, said Gita Gopinath, director of the Research Department at the International Monetary Fund.Additional tariffs between China and the US, including those already implemented and those announced－if they take effect－could cause a "quite significant" impact on global growth by reducing global GDP by 0.8 percent in 2020, Gopinath said at the session.Global GDP growth is forecast at 3.2 percent in 2019 and is expected to improve to 3.5 percent next year, according to the IMF's World Economic Outlook released in July. Some analysts believe the IMF may downgrade forecasts in an updated outlook due out next month after some major economies reported softer growth for the second quarter.China's growth is slowing down but remains "relatively robust", with HSBC's latest forecast for China's growth standing at 6.2 percent this year and 5.8 percent next year, Stephen King, a senior economic adviser at the bank, said on the sidelines of the session."By the standards of other countries, it (China's growth) is still very impressive," King said, adding that supply-side reforms and monetary and fiscal stimuli are expected to be stepped up over the next 12 months and partially offset impacts of the trade friction.Over the long run, multiple factors should continue to drive China's growth, including closer connections between inland regions and the rest of the country as well as with Asia as a whole, and these will play "a big part" as the Belt and Road Initiative bears more fruit, he added.In the face of downside pressure from abroad and at home, China will take stronger countercyclical measures including accelerating the issuance of special local government bonds and promoting a reduction in actual interest rates, Ning said.The People's Bank of China will cut the required reserve ratio for financial institutions by 0.5 percentage point starting Sept 16, injecting more liquidity into the economy, the central bank announced on Friday.Ning added that China will continue to pursue higher-quality opening-up to accelerate reforms and development.Specifically, China is aiming to deepen practical international cooperation, expand access for foreign investment and create a world-class business-friendly environment.He said the country will eliminate all remaining restrictions outside of negative lists for the access of foreign investment. And it will expedite drafting of supportive rules and regulations for the Foreign Investment Law, which will take effect on Jan 1.Pascal Soriot, CEO of global biopharmaceutical giant Astra-Zeneca, spoke highly of China's key opening-up moves, saying, "It will stimulate investment from overseas to China and boost innovation in the country."Soriot said he thinks innovation remains the most resilient part of the Chinese economy as the country transitions from making low-cost items to focusing on innovation and new technologies."The economy in China will still be robust this year," he added. " (Growth) will be a little bit less than expected, but it will still be more than 6 percent. We are constantly increasing our investment in China and expanding our presence to more regions of China."

                Additional tariffs between China and the United States, including those implemented already and those announced, if allowed to take effect, could cut global GDP by 0.8 percent in 2020, according to the latest estimate from the International Monetary Fund.The impact is "quite significant" for the sluggish world economy, said Gita Gopinath, economic counsellor and director of the IMF's research department, at the China Development Forum Special Session in Beijing on Friday.Global growth was forecast at 3.2 percent in 2019, picking up to 3.5 percent in 2020, according to IMF's World Economic Outlook released in July.The IMF is scheduled to release updated forecasts of global growth next month and give details of the estimated impacts of tariffs imposed between the world's two biggest economies, Gopinath said.

                    US agenda shouldn't be driven by irrationality: China Daily editorial
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                With Chinese and US trade negotiators preparing to hold their next round of talks in early October in Washington, hopes are high that substantial progress would be made to at least de-escalate tensions, if not resolve all bilateral trade disputes.The trade war launched by the United States on China, which has already stretched into a second year, has dealt a blow to not only the two economies but also the world economy as a whole.The International Monetary Fund has forecast "sluggish" global growth for 2020, citing the Sino-US trade tensions as a major factor. "We are seeing the effects of the trade tensions more starkly on global trade and on industrial production and manufacturing," said IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath.But despite this, there is cacophony in Washington, which sounds even more disruptive at the moment, raising doubts over how serious the White House is about cutting a deal with China.Peter Navarro, director of the White House National Trade Council, recently resorted to his favorite pastime of China bashing while talking to the media. He claimed that China had committed the "seven deadly sins", ranging from forced technology transfer to currency manipulation.Anyone with even the basic knowledge about trade and economics can tell that Navarro is talking nonsense. The author of Death by China lets his emotions run wild when it comes to anything related with China. For instance, he believes that tariffs on Chinese imports are not causing a rise in the prices of US consumer goods, even though statistics from many organizations such as the Consumer Technology Association suggest otherwise.He also believes China, not the US, is the only one suffering the pains caused by the trade war, even though Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said "26 times" that he's cutting interest rates because of trade difficulties with China.Given that he is prone to directing his bile at China, people wonder what kind of advice he has for the US negotiating team heading into the next round of trade talks with its Chinese counterpart.Trade talks are all about give and take. Whenever possible, China has been willing to do whatever it can to find a way out of the current stalemate because that serves both sides' interest.But that would happen only when both sides talk reason. If the US negotiating team lets irrational minds like Navarro's hijack its agenda to take on China, the opportunities to resolve the trade disputes will become even more elusive.

                Gestures seen as prelude to 'productive' talksLeading US business groups have said they expect that the latest goodwill gestures demonstrated by the governments of the two countries locked in a protracted trade war would usher in "productive" talks and put an end to tariff increases.US President Donald Trump announced plans Wednesday to delay a planned tariff increase on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports by two weeks, until Oct 15. China also said earlier in the day that it was exempting 16 types of US products from duties.This was followed by reports that Chinese firms bought at least 10 boatloads of US soybeans on Thursday, the country's most significant purchases since at least June, Reuters reported."We hope this announcement, combined with other confidence-building measures from both governments, will create the conditions necessary for productive trade negotiations and end the cycle of tit-for-tat retaliatory actions," the Washington-based US-China Business Council (USCBC) said in a statement on Thursday.Late Thursday afternoon, Trump said he doesn't want an interim deal."I'd rather get the whole deal done," he told reporters.Earlier Thursday in Beijing, Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He said in a meeting with USCBC Chairman Evan Greenberg that the entire world looks forward to seeing progress in trade consultations between China and the United States.The USCBC represents about 200 American companies that do business with China, including some of the world's best-known brands.Liu said that working groups of both sides will meet next week and have "earnest discussions" on the trade balance, market access, protection of investors and other issues of common concern, according to a Xinhua report.Greenberg said the US business sector does not want to see a rise in tariffs, and hopes that the two countries will solve their differences through consultations and bring bilateral trade back to normal.The remarks were echoed by USCBC President Craig Allen in Washington."Tariffs are a tax on our businesses and consumers — the impact on supply chains and company confidence is clearly hurting the economy," Allen said, adding that unilateral imposition of tariffs makes US companies less competitive in the global arena."We urge both sides to work toward eliminating tariffs, realize the concrete progress that is possible today, and build momentum for longer-term negotiations on the most challenging issues," he said.Jennifer Safavian, executive vice-president of government affairs of the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), said leading US retailers are hopeful the president's gesture of goodwill in delaying the tariff increases will lead to productive talks between the two countries next month."A resolution is sorely needed that puts an end to the tariff increases," Safavian said.RILA represents more than 200 retailers, product manufacturers and service suppliers, which together account for more than $1.5 trillion in annual sales, millions of American jobs and more than 100,000 stores."Consumer confidence is the one pillar of strength in the US economy, and the president's tariff strategy is threatening that, as higher prices will be imposed on consumer goods with increased tariffs," Safavian said."Negotiating a path forward that puts an end to the erratic tariff increases and provides some dose of certainty to businesses should be the goal for the October trade discussions," she said.The International Monetary Fund said Thursday that the rising trade and geopolitical tensions have increased uncertainty, taking a toll on business confidence, investment and global trade."Our latest estimate is that … the US-China tariffs, including those implemented and announced, could potentially reduce the level of global GDP by 0.8 percent in 2020, with additional losses in future years," IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said at a briefing.Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, also said in a statement Wednesday that increasing tariffs are giving the stock market whiplash, and consumers are getting worried — last month consumer sentiment dropped almost 10 percentage points.
