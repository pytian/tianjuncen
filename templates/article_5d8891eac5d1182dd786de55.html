                Huawei seeks to speed up suit against US

                Telecommunication firm's motion asks court to declare ban unconstitutionalHuawei Technologies Co filed a motion on Wednesday to accelerate its lawsuit against the United States government, as the Chinese tech company said it has great confidence in the case and hopes to bring it to an early conclusion.The move came two months after Huawei sued the US government over a measure that bars federal agencies from using its products. This is part of a broader push by the world's largest telecom equipment maker to pursue fair competition and treatment in the global tech arena through legal means.Huawei said at a news conference in Shenzhen that it had filed a motion for summary judgment in a court in Plano, Texas, where it filed the case. The motion asks the court to declare the ban unconstitutional.Song Liuping, Huawei's chief legal officer, said the federal ban, outlined in section 889 of the 2019 US National Defense Authorization Act, is unlawful as it singles out a person or a group for punishment without trial."Politicians in the US are using the strength of an entire nation to come after a private company," Song noted. "This is not normal, almost never seen in history."The senior executive added that the US government has provided no evidence to show that Huawei is a security threat. "There is no gun, no smoke, only speculation."A motion for summary judgment is one party's effort to bring an early end to a lawsuit. Huawei is using it to request the court to rule in its favor as a matter of law. The company said this case presents pure questions about law and does not, at this point, involve any dispute over facts. The US court has scheduled a hearing on Huawei's motion for Sept 19."If the court grants Huawei's motion for summary judgment, the case is over. It will not go into a full-blown trial. But the US government can appeal to a higher court," said Li Lan, a US-based lawyer of Jincheng Tongda & Neal law firm.Huawei is facing a crackdown from the US, which accuses the company of posing risks to its national security. Huawei has repeatedly denied the accusations and says these claims are not supported by factual evidence.Huawei is not the first foreign company to sue the US government. In 2015, Chinese machinery manufacturer Sany settled a lawsuit with the US government, which forbade its project in Oregon on national security grounds. In 2017, Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky unsuccessfully sued the US government over a ban on its products.Huawei said in a note, "We have a different and much stronger case than Kaspersky." For example, the US ban not only bars all US government agencies from buying Huawei equipment and services, but also bars them from contracting with or awarding grants or loans to third parties who buy Huawei equipment or services.A partner at a Beijing-based law company who wished to remain anonymous, said: "The Huawei case is very different from the Kaspersky ban. The ban on Huawei is significantly broader, manifestly targets one company and is punitive in nature."Earlier this month, the US government added the Chinese company to an Entity List, forbidding Huawei from accessing any US technologies without special approval. Song said the move is affecting its more than 1,200 suppliers and threatened to affect its 3 billion individual customers in 170 countries and regions."Huawei is considering taking legal or administrative action to fight the US list ban," Song said. "It sets a dangerous precedent. Today, it is telecoms and Huawei. Tomorrow, it could be your industry, your company, your consumers."On Wednesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang also urged FedEx Corp to explain why it rerouted four Huawei parcels to the US without the Chinese company's authorization.masi@chinadaily.com.cn(China Daily Global 05/30/2019 page3)

                    CEOs share their views on China's digital future
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Editor's Note: China has witnessed rapid growth in a wide range of industries due to the advancement of internet and information technologies in recent years. China Daily reporters Cheng Yu, Liu Yukun and Ma Si interviewed top executives of well-known companies attending the Fifth World Internet Conference for their views on the prospects of China's internet sector and their key takeaways from this year's conference. Their answers to the following questions are given below.Q1: How do you see the role of the World Internet Conference? How does your company benefit from the annual meeting?Q2: Which aspects of the conference inspired you most and why? What are your key takeaways from this year's conference?Q3: How do you view the future of China's internet sector? How will your company better tap into the booming industry and its increasing integration with artificial intelligence?A1 The World Internet Conference has been held five times so far. It is the epitome of China's thriving progress from being a big internet country to becoming a strong internet power. The conference opens up a window for the world to understand China, and for China to step out into the world. It also acts as an important global stage to listen to Chinese voices and insights, and furthermore, to gather international consensus. It plays a vital role in promoting the further opening-up of the country's internet as well as international cyberspace governance.During these past five years, Tencent has been devoted to being a good "connector", hoping to provide different industries with abundant "digital interfaces" to enter into a "digital world". This has made positive contributions to China's digital economy and meanwhile driven the company's breakneck development pace.A2 The theme of this year's World Internet Conference, "Creating a digital world of mutual trust and governance", has inspired me. With the development of internet-based digital platforms, digital technologies are intertwining with the life of every individual, company or organization, and are forming a "community of a shared future in cyberspace".This requires us to be more active in taking on responsibilities, as being responsible for the community means being responsible for yourself, and being responsible for yourself is also being responsible for the shared community.A3 The digital economy has grown to become the most dynamic economic phenomenon worldwide. It has also become a new driver of the country's high-quality development. Digitalization and informatization is integrating ever-more deeply with various industries. There is still huge room for growth in China's internet development.In line with the development of the digital economy, linking or connecting has always been Tencent's core strategy. After connecting people, digital content and services, Tencent's focus for the next step is connecting industries. Tencent will take root in the consumer internet and embrace the industrial internet.We will continue to connect consumers. Meanwhile, we hope to promote the deep integration of suppliers with the internet, in a bid to help different industries to transform and upgrade, and to drive traditional firms to expand from manufacturing to providing consumer services.Tencent aims to help traditional companies to move from smart retailing to smart manufacturing, and from consumption to industry, and finally to gain a lead in hardware, software and services.

                    Security key to industrial internet of things rollout
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Industrial internet of things security in China is seeing rapid development to battle industries' increasing cyber risks, backed by government support and technology advancement, according to industry experts."With industrial IoT getting more advanced in China, security has attracted attention from government, industrial majors, and tech giants," said Zheng Qiliang, general manager of Kaspersky Lab's China arm. Kaspersky is a global security service provider headquartered in Moscow.The basic idea behind industrial IoT is to apply the internet and software to the operation of industrial equipment, creating an interactive, connected network of physical things. "Although the area is still at an early stage, it will see surging advancement," he predicted.Zheng's confidence in the prospects of China's industrial IoT security is well-grounded.Last November, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the country's top industry regulator, called for a massive round of IoT SIM card investigation, especially for major carriers such as China Mobile and China Unicom, as part of the nation's larger efforts to tackle the increasing risks of cybersecurity in IoT related industries.Meanwhile, industrial giants are ramping up their efforts to improve cybersecurity products and monitoring platforms, and tap into China's growing industrial IoT market.Kaspersky Lab, for example, is accelerating its push in the Chinese market by building an ecosystem that covers firewall deployment and whitelisting - two traditional lines of security products. It is also creating systems for censoring and identifying possible attacks, and providing staff cybersecurity training.Zheng of Kaspersky said a big challenge for the industry today is to develop efficient products and systems used in projects like railways and electric power - industries that can cost billions of dollars and are becoming increasingly common targets for cyberattacks."China's leading position in those areas also makes the country a target for digital attacks," Zheng said.Commenting on the issue, Wang Lijun, a division chief at China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team, told the industry newspaper China Economic Times that many infrastructure companies import some of their equipment from overseas, especially for monitoring and maintenance systems. And that, he said, could pose a challenge to cybersecurity teams due to difficulties in accessing data or detecting tech loopholes.The market for security products in such areas is huge, Wang said.A recent report from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology found over 2,600 tech loopholes in major industrial IoT monitoring platforms in China in the third quarter of 2018."Also, Chinese companies in the sector of industrial IoT are smaller in size than industry giants overseas, which is challenging for them to increase global competitiveness," Wang said.He noted that China is still at an early stage in its industrial IoT security, but he is positive about the area's prospects as the government is launching a series of policies to promote standard-making in the area, and offering incubating platforms to accelerate development of both industry giants and small and medium-sized enterprises.

                    Kaspersky Lab to open office in Kigali, Rwanda
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Kaspersky Lab, a global cybersecurity and anti-virus provider, has announced plans to open a new office in Kigali, Rwanda, to support the rapid growth of its business in East Africa. This strategic move will provide more room for development as well as closer proximity to new partners in the region, allowing the company to further its expansion into the region.The move was made during the recent visit by Eugene Kaspersky, the firm's CEO, to Rwanda, where he met with Rwandan President Paul Kagame at the Transform Africa Summit. The two discussed how Kaspersky Lab could collaborate with the Rwandan government and ways to better protect the country from cyberthreats."Governments and enterprises across Africa need an integrated approach to complex threat detection and response as they fight cybercriminals who have significant financial resources and are constantly looking to exploit any vulnerability," said the CEO.The Kigali office will serve the regional market. "We see great potential in the African market, especially with the current digital transformation initiatives that are in place. Nations across the continent are adopting new technologies to facilitate and enhance the way they do business. While a few years ago it was enough to have a strategy to prevent infection, today businesses have to be able to detect when they are infected or hacked, predict hacker behavior and respond to attacks quickly to ensure minimal damage and impact. We can provide support in achieving this," said Amir Kanaan, the managing director at Kaspersky Lab for the Middle East, Turkey and Africa.Kaspersky Lab operates in almost 200 countries and territories across the globe. The new office in Kigali will be the 36th representative office the company has worldwide.

                    Huawei aims to speed up US government lawsuit
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Huawei Technologies Co filed a motion on Wednesday to accelerate its lawsuit against the United States government, as the Chinese tech company said it has great confidence in the case and hopes to bring it to an early conclusion.The move came two months after Huawei sued the US government over a measure that bars federal agencies from using its products. This is part of a broader push by the world's largest telecom equipment maker to pursue fair competition and treatment in the global tech arena through legal means.Huawei said at a news conference in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, that it had filed a motion for summary judgment in a court in Plano, Texas, where it filed the case. The motion asks the court to declare the ban unconstitutional.Song Liuping, Huawei's chief legal officer, said the federal ban, outlined in section 889 of the 2019 US National Defense Authorization Act, is unlawful as it singles out a person or a group for punishment without trial."Politicians in the US are using the strength of an entire nation to come after a private company," Song noted. "This is not normal, almost never seen in history."The senior executive added that the US government has provided no evidence to show that Huawei is a security threat. "There is no gun, no smoke, only speculation."A motion for summary judgment is one party's effort to bring an early end to a lawsuit. Huawei is using it to request the court to rule in its favor as a matter of law.The company said this case presents pure questions about law and does not at this point involve any dispute over facts. The US court has scheduled a hearing on Huawei's motion for Sept 19."If the court grants Huawei's motion for summary judgment, the case is over. It will not go into a trial at all. But the US government can appeal to a higher court," said Li Lan, a Shenzhen-based lawyer of Jincheng Tongda & Neal law firm.Huawei is facing a crackdown from the US, which accuses the company of posing risks to its national security. Huawei has repeatedly denied the accusations and said these claims were not supported by factual evidence.Huawei is not the first foreign company to sue the US government. In 2015, Chinese machinery manufacturer Sany settled a lawsuit with the US government, which forbade its project in Oregon on national security grounds.In 2017, Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky unsuccessfully sued the US government over a ban on its products.Huawei said in a note that "We have a different and much stronger case than Kaspersky." For example, the US ban not only bars all US government agencies from buying Huawei equipment and services, but also bars them from contracting with or awarding grants or loans to third parties who buy Huawei equipment or services.A partner at a Beijing-based law company who wished to remain anonymous, said: "The Huawei case is very different from the Kaspersky ban. The ban on Huawei is significantly broader, manifestly targets one company and is punitive in nature."Earlier this month, the US government added the Chinese company to its Entity List, barring Huawei from accessing any US technologies without special approval. Song said the move is affecting its more than 1,200 suppliers and threatened to affect its 3 billion individual customers in 170 countries and regions."Huawei is considering taking legal or administrative action to fight the US list ban," Song said, "It sets a dangerous precedent. Today, it is telecoms and Huawei. Tomorrow, it could be your industry, your company, your consumers."On Wednesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang also urged Fed-Ex to explain why it rerouted four Huawei parcels to the US without the Chinese company's authorization."If it is not an isolated incident, FedEx needs to explain why such misdeliveries occurred to Huawei's parcels several times," the spokesman said.

                    Apple faces investigation for suspected unfair competition in Russia
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Apple is under investigation in Russia following a complaint from cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab and may be abusing its dominant market position, Russia's anti-monopoly watchdog said on Thursday.Watchdog FAS said it was investigating why a new version of Kaspersky Lab's Safe Kids application had been declined by Apple's operating system, resulting in a significant loss in functionality for the parental control app.It said Apple had released version 12 of its own parental control app, Screen Time, which had similar functions to the Kaspersky program. Parental control apps allow parents to control their children's phone and tablet usage.Asked about the Russian investigation, Apple referred Reuters to an April 28 statement in which it said it had recently removed several parental control apps from its App Store because they "put users' privacy and security at risk."It said several of these apps were using a "highly invasive" technology called Mobile Device Management (MDM) and that its use in a consumer-focused app was a violation of App Store policies.Kaspersky said Apple's App Store guidelines allowed for a limited use of MDM, but that it was not clear how to obtain Apple's permission to do so. It also said the requirements reduced the competitiveness of third party developers. Reuters
