            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                China Society for Human Rights Studies has published an article to highlight the long-lasting, unsolved problemRecently, a number of deadly mass shootings have taken place in the United States, which have caused widespread concern in the United States and the international community. On August 3, 2019, El Paso shooter Patrick Krusius with an AK-47 rifle in hand went on a shooting spree in a busy Walmart store located in El Paso, Texas, killing 22 people and wounding more than 20. In the early morning of August 4, the Oregon District, a lively area full of bars, restaurants, and theaters in Dayton, Ohio, became a grisly crime scene, when the 24-year-old Caucasian Connor Betts shot at the pedestrians on the streets with an AR-15-style rifle loaded with 100 bullets, killing 9 people and wounding 27. These two mass shootings have once again exposed the grave consequences of the proliferation of guns in the United States. They have reflected the profound crisis in the US political and social systems and highlighted the United States' hypocrisy on human rights.Part 1 The proliferation of guns and the serious problem of gun violence in the United States

                    Koepka leads sprint to PGA Tour's richest finish
                </p>

                It's billed as 'Ultimate August', with an eye-popping $15 million awaiting the new FedExCup champion. And for red-hot Brooks Koepka, it could mean collecting $18 million just in bonus money by the time the dust settles.Welcome to the conclusion of PGA Tour season, when every stroke matters and every missed shot can mean disaster.The stars know they have everything to fight for as one of the most prestigious accolades in sports await the FedExCup champion.Three tournaments remain out of the 46 that have seen the tour traverse the United States, Canada, Latin America and Asia over the past 11 months, cementing a legend's stature, establishing new superstars and heralding the arrival of a new generation of exciting young champions.The all-powerful Koepka is primed to be the season's biggest winner. Following his third victory of the season at the World Golf Championships-FedEx St Jude Invitational two weeks ago, he picked up a cool $2 million bonus for winning the Wyndham Rewards Top 10, which recognizes the high achievers in the regular season that concluded with last weekend's Wyndham Championship.The 29-year-old American then added another $1 million to his bank account for clinching the Aon Risk Reward Challenge, a new and innovative competition that highlights golf's best strategic decision-makers.This week, the top 125 golfers from the FedExCup points list are teeing up in the make-or-break Fed-ExCup playoffs, comprised of The Northern Trust, the BMW Championship and the Playoffs Finale, which will feature the top 30 and use a stroke-based system to determine the FedExCup champion.This season's $15 million payout to the FedExCup champion is $5 million more than what England's Justin Rose earned last year, thanks to a cash boost from FedEx, which topped up the overall bonus pool by $25 million to $60 million.Koepka, who also won this year's CJ Cup @Nine Bridges in South Korea and the PGA Championship, is geared up for a strong finish as he enters the playoffs at No 1 on the points list."It's incredible. To look at what I've done this year, the consistency, trying to take my game to a new level. I've done all that. To be up there in the FedExCup with a chance in Atlanta, that's incredible," Koepka said.Rory McIlroy, who is trying to join Tiger Woods as the only two-time FedExCup champion, is one of the contenders aiming to derail Koepka."You want to be as high up in the rankings as you possibly can. Obviously, there's a lot to play for. Every year, the FedExCup is getting bigger and bigger, and it's more of a target on all the guys' radar. There's a lot to play for in August," said McIlroy.Much of this month's excitement is due to the vision of PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan, who has advocated changes to the tour schedule and pushed for greater rewards to capture and expand the imagination of players, fans, sponsors, and TV and online viewers.As previous FedExCup champions include current greats such as Woods, McIlroy, Rose, Jordan Spieth, Henrik Stenson and Vijay Singh, winning the season-long competition has become a priority for the new generation.Reigning WGC-HSBC Champions and Sentry Tournament of Champions winner Xander Schauffele of the US, who enters the playoffs in third place, summed up the importance of the next three tournaments: "We have so much to play for. Everything's on the table. It's just as big as a major championship. I go to sleep thinking about those things."Rose, who became the first Englishman to taste FedExCup glory last year, added: "Obviously the playoffs are all about volatility and bringing your game when you really need it. We've all bought in and love that concept."Asia will have keen interest in the playoffs, with South Korean rookie Im Sung-jae currently ranked as the highest Asian on the points list in 23rd position, followed by compatriot Sung Kang in 29th and Japanese star Hideki Matsuyama in 30th.Chinese Taipei's CT Pan, who sits 35th, broke through for his first PGA Tour win in April and is determined to make it to the Championship for the first time."It's been my goal for the past three years. It's all I'm trying to do, get into the Tour Championship," said Pan.The writer is the PGA Tour's senior director of communications and is based in Kuala Lumpur.

                    California city tests giving 125 people $500 a month
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                One of the Democratic presidential hopefuls says he'd give every American $12,000 a year. In Stockton, California, 125 people have been getting $500 a month free since February.Maggie Denang, a 63-year-old retired nurse, is one of the recipients of the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED), a pilot program to provide insights on whether a long-term basic income helps lift residents out of poverty."I was shocked. It has never happened to me in my life. It's a surprise, a good surprise," Denang told China Daily of her inclusion into the program.The stipend is distributed monthly to randomly selected residents — who earn at or below the median household income of $46,033 — through prepaid debit cards. There are no work requirements or restrictions on how the money can be spent.The extra money "means a lot to our family. It helps me a whole lot," said Denang. She and her husband, who is disabled, live in an apartment. They rely on her pension."It helps with my rent, electricity, medications and food," said Denang. "It's made my life a lot easier for the last few months."The privately funded SEED program was spearheaded by Stockton Mayor Michael Tubbs and partly financed by the nonprofit Economic Security Project, a network focused on basic income in the US.Two researchers, Amy Castro-Baker at the University of Pennsylvania, and Stacia Adams-West at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, also received a $680,000 grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to evaluate the US' first city-led guaranteed income pilot program."The nature of the American economy is changing, such that the average worker can no longer count on earning the same paycheck week to week. Our current forms of assistance only allow families to access specific resources at one time, like housing vouchers or food assistance," said Castro-Baker and Adams-West in a joint email to China Daily."Guaranteed income gives families the flexibility needed to respond to volatile financial situations and prioritize spending based on their needs," said the researchers. "Our goal is to determine if and how guaranteed income works so it may be scaled out. It is an exciting time for all forms of unconditional cash, including guaranteed income and universal basic income."Universal basic income is an idea dating back to the 18th century. In the 1960s and 1970s, the US and Canada conducted several guaranteed-income experiments. Since the 1980s, the concept has expanded to many countries around the world.The idea has new momentum thanks to the 2020 US presidential race. Candidate and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang advocates for $1,000 monthly universal basic income for all American adults over the age of 18, regardless of one's work status or income. He argues that automation is causing the loss of millions of jobs in the US.The idea of universal basic income has been embraced by the high-tech industry for fear that automation and artificial intelligence would take over human jobs and collapse the society. The supporters include Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who came out in support of basic income.But critics are concerned that the unconditional income would lead to less incentive to work. Barry Broad, chair of the California's Employment Training Panel, said the concept is "a surrender to a kind of grim Dickensian view of the future. It's naive to think universal basic income is going to pay the bills. It's going to at best give people a poverty wage," he said.Yang's plan has been estimated to cost $2.8 trillion per year. He would impose a new tax on businesses' goods and services, while shrinking some other government assistance programs. Yang did not respond to an interview request.The key difference between universal basic income and guaranteed income is that the former is available to everyone, whereas the latter may be targeted to a specific subpopulation, such as women with children, or a geographic area, according to Castro-Baker and Adams-West.Compared with "trillions and trillions of dollars", guaranteed income is more "doable", said Chris Hughes, co-chair of the Economic Security Project, during a discussion at Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics in 2018.Guaranteed income is "evidence based" and "what's still missing is the political will, so that people believe it's possible, doable and desirable to create an income floor", he said.Stockton, in California's Central Valley, has a population of 321,000. The city was once known as the foreclosure capital of America and the nation's largest city, before Detroit, to declare bankruptcy. It is now ranked the second most fiscally solvent city in the US."Unfortunately in the United States there is a long and horrible history of poverty being stereotyped, and there's a lot of gender and racial stereotype attached to it," said SEED director Sukhi Samra. "Our economy isn't working for anyone, particularly for the most marginalized, people of color, and women of color."
