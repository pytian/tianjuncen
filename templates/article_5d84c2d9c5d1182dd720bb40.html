                Some experts believe the changing climate is good for agriculture and environmental restorationLANZHOU - Northwest China, which used to be cold and dry, is now getting warmer and wetter.As early as the 1980s, academics noticed increasing rainfall in the northwestern region and speculated that the climate would become warm and wet."The speculation about climate change in Northwest China in the next 30 years has been confirmed," said Ding Yihui, an expert with the China Meteorological Administration.Chen Baofu works for an airport in Gansu province. As an experienced shuttle bus driver, Chen said he has noticed the changes on the road linking the airport and capital city Lanzhou over the past few years."The 70-kilometer-long road was built on barren mountains. But there is more rainfall here, and more plants grow on the mountains nowadays," Chen said.The arid climate is a major reason that the Mogao Grottoes, a UNESCO World Heritage site, have been preserved for thousands of years. However, as rainfall increased in the summer, the tourist attraction in Gansu was temporarily shut down, while the Gobi Desert nearby has also seen grass growing."We used global climate models to predict that this trend will last until the mid-21st century," Ding added.Statistics from the meteorological departments of northwestern provinces Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai and Ningxia Hui autonomous region showed these areas have seen climate warming and increasing precipitation since 1961, while the trend of warming and humidification has risen since 2000.In Gansu alone, the temperature has risen steadily at a rate of 0.29 C every 10 years from 1961 to 2015.Last year, the average temperature in Gansu was 0.7 C higher, and average precipitation increased by 27.7 percent as well.

                Cuba rejects US expulsion of two diplomats as 'unjustified'
            </a>
            <p>
                HAVANA - Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez on Thursday slammed the US expulsion of two Cuban diplomats in the United Nations as "unjustified."Earlier in the day, the US State Department required the imminent departure of the two diplomats who are members of Cuba's Permanent Mission to the UN, accusing them of having "attempts to conduct influence operations against the United States."However, it announced the expulsion over "abusing their privileges of residence" in a statement without providing further details. Meanwhile, the US State Department demanded travels of the members of Cuba's UN mission should "essentially be restricted to the island of Manhattan" in New York City, where the UN is headquartered.Writing on his Twitter account, Rodriguez said, "I reject categorically the unjustified expulsion of 2 officials of the Cuban Permanent Mission at the UN and the tightening of the restrictions of movement for the Cuban diplomats and its families."He also criticized the US allegation against the Cuban diplomats as a "vulgar slander" and the newly announced restrictions as aiming to provoke an escalation of bilateral diplomatic tensions.The US moves came as Cuba is seeking an end to a 57-year-old US economic blockade and trade embargoes against it at the 74th session of the UN general Assembly that opened Tuesday.In a 2018 report to the UN, Cuba said it has incurred losses worth over $933 billion as a result of the US sanctions.On Monday, Rodriguez tweeted that the US sanctions on oil shipments are causing a fuel shortage on the Caribbean island, which creates difficulties "affecting every Cuban family."
