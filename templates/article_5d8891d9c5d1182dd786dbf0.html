                As professional orchestras spring up like mushrooms around China, musicians from overseas are making their way to the country to make the most of new opportunitiesEmma Jane Whitney's debut with the Suzhou Symphony Orchestra a couple of years ago was far from the fanfare performance she might have imagined beforehand. Instead it was more akin to being thrown under a cold shower when you are half awake.An 11-hour flight that was supposed to deliver the British French horn player to the Chinese city in plenty of time for her first rehearsal with the orchestra turned into a 30-hour odyssey because of a flight delay, and when she finally arrived in Suzhou she was exhausted.

                    Sale of New Jersey campus to Beijing company due
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Despite legal challenges and political opposition, the sale of a New Jersey college to a Chinese education company is scheduled to be completed on Monday.In June 2018, Rider University in Lawrence Township, New Jersey, signed an agreement in June 2018 to sell its second campus, Westminster Choir College, to Beijing Kaiwen Education Technology Co Ltd for $40 million, with a sale date of July 1.A private school founded in 1926, Westminster is a residential music college located on a 23-acre campus in Princeton, New Jersey. It has had a reciprocal program with its Ivy League neighbor Princeton University in which a limited number of students at either school could take classes at the other."At Westminster's core is a four-year music college and graduate school that prepares men and women for careers as performers and as music leaders in schools, universities, churches and professional and community organizations," the college's website says.Kaiwen Education was known as Jiangsu Zhongtai Bridge Steel Structure Co Ltd until December. The company is also spending $16 million for capital and working capital expenses, according to campusreform.org, a college news website."Kaiwen Education's obligation to act in full accordance with US laws and regulations is outlined in the Purchase and Sale Agreement, including the requirement to obtain all necessary licenses and accreditations," Rider University spokeswoman Kristine Brown told Campus Reform in an article published Friday. "Furthermore, Rider would not have moved forward if we didn't believe in Kaiwen's commitment to and strategic plan for Westminster."Discussions regarding the future of Westminster Choir College are continuing," Brown told the website. "We have no additional information to share at this time, but will do as soon as we are able."In February 2018, Rider University President Greg Dell'Omo announced the signing of a "nonbinding" term sheet for the sale."Kaiwen Education intends to make offers of employment to faculty and staff as well as continue committed student aid at the time of closing in the form of endowed scholarships, tuition discounts and other grant obligations," Dell'Omo wrote.Two local lawsuits attempting to block the sale also have been announced."I have been retained by tenured faculty at both Rider and Westminster to file suit on their behalf to block Rider University's continued damage to this vaunted music college," Westminster Foundation lawyer Bruce Afran told patch.com on Friday. "We will move to block any effort by Rider University to move Westminster Choir College and sell the endowed campus that has served the needs of the musical world for over 80 years."The state-of-the-art Cullen Center and Westminster's many other specialized facilities cannot be replaced at Rider's Lawrenceville campus, and a move of the Choir College will severely damage this institution," he said.Afran said that unless Rider ceases the sale, the lawsuit will widen, with tenured faculty joining as plaintiffs.Princeton Theological Seminary, which also has a reciprocity agreement with Westminster, also has sued to block the sale. The seminary cited a 1935 trust stating that if Westminster didn't continue its mission, the college should be shifted to the seminary.In March, the New Jersey attorney general's office launched an investigation into the sale, which focused on, among other issues, what Rider would do with the proceeds. The state sent the university almost 100 questions about the sale.

                    Chinese firm backs out of deal to buy New Jersey choir college
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                A Chinese company has withdrawn from a $40 million deal to buy Westminster Choir College from Rider University in New Jersey, after the company's board voted unanimously against the acquisition due to "uncertainty" that it would be successful.The Beijing Kaiwen Education Technology Co Ltd had been expected to complete the purchase of the prominent music college in Princeton on Monday. It had signed a sales agreement with Rider in June 2018.But on Friday, Kaiwen's board of directors met and voted 7-0 to "terminate" the purchase of the nearly century-old school to avoid "uncertainty that the original transaction will continue to advance after June 30, 2019''.Following the collapse of the deal, Rider University announced that its board had approved a plan to integrate Westminster Choir College into the university's existing Lawrenceville campus beginning in September 2020. It added that it would continue to work with Kaiwen "over the next three years on academic and artistic initiatives''.In a transcript of the minutes from the Kaiwen meeting, the board stated: "After friendly negotiation, Wenhua Xuexin and the US Rider University signed an Agreement on Termination and Cooperation, terminating the original Acquisition and Sale Agreement."The Chinese-for-profit company, which was called the Jiangsu Zhongtai Bridge Steel Structure Co until December, had faced a barrage of opposition to its plans to buy the small music school, which was founded in 1926.The Westminster Foundation — a group of alumni and donors — sued it to block the sale over fears that Kaiwen could shutter the college if it did not make a profit. The foundation did not respond to a request for comment.Another suit was filed by the Princeton Theological Seminary, which alleged that Rider University's decision to sell the school to Kaiwen went against the wishes of the donor who gave the college to the seminary's Princeton campus in 1932.The office of the New Jersey attorney general also launched an investigation into the planned sale. In March, it filed an opinion with Superior Court Judge Paul Innes, who presided over both lawsuits against Rider, that under terms of the 1930s land donation, the campus must continue to be used for the school's educational and religious mission.Rider President Gregory G. Dell'Omo said in a statement: "Throughout this process, we have continually sought to preserve and enhance Westminster's legacy as a world-class institution, and we made every effort to maintain the college in Princeton."Given the enormous complexity of the transaction, it became increasingly clear that partnering with an outside entity, even one as well-intentioned as Kaiwen, was not feasible on a viable timeline."Rider University first put Westminster Choir College up for sale in March 2017, citing financial woes. It said it contacted 281 potential buyers during the search for a new owner and agreed to work with Kaiwen after it offered a $56 million package that included $16 million in upgrades.Kaiwen said that it, along with two subsidiaries, and a non-profit called the Westminster Choir College Acquisition Corp, would buy the music conservatory. The agreement stated that Kaiwen would have to operate the company for no fewer than 10 years and operate the academic curriculum for at least five years.But a key sticking point among critics who filed the lawsuits was that after the purchase Kaiwen could do what it wanted with the college, including sell it."Now that it is clear that transferring Westminster Choir College to an external partner is not possible … it is not financially feasible to allow Westminster to continue on its present course as a separate, fully operational campus seven miles apart from Rider's Lawrenceville campus," Rider Board of Trustees Chairman Robert S. Schimek said in a statement.The university's new plan will create a Westminster College of the Arts. That will include Westminster Choir College in Princeton, the School of Fine and Performing Arts in Lawrenceville, and the Westminster Conservatory in multiple locations.Dr Marshall Onofrio, dean of the Westminster College of the Arts, said, "It is my hope that students, faculty, staff, and alumni will unite around this opportunity and participate in creating a new chapter in Westminster Choir College's illustrious history."
