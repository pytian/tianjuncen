            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                LOS ANGELES - Digging in its claws, Black Panther has clung to its box-office lead for a fifth straight weekend, taking in an estimated $27 million in North American theaters while fending off two new films, website Exhibitor Relations said on Sunday. The Disney/Marvel superhero film has now earned a domestic total of just over $600 million while becoming the first film since Avatar in 2009 to hold the top spot for five straight weekends. Black Panther, starring Chadwick Boseman as the superhero king of a utopian African country, has almost single-handedly kept the year's box office total slightly above the same period last year. It is only days away from overtaking another Marvel film, The Avengers, as the all-time top-grossing superhero film in North America, Variety reported.

                    'Beauty and the Beast' opens simultaneously in China and US

                A poster for Beauty and the Beast [Photo/mtime.com]The wait is finally over for fans looking to relive the romance of Beauty and the Beast. Disney's live action reboot of the classic tale has already opened in many parts of the world and is opening simultaneously today in China and the United States.The story of Beauty and the Beast dates back all the way to 1740, when it was first published by French writer Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve. The film expands on the original story and centers around a prince who is imprisoned and under a spell as a beast. His only hope is to be freed by true love. A girl named Belle enters his castle and becomes his savior.The movie stars British pair Emma Watson and Dan Stevens, who is best known for having played Matthew Crawley in Downton Abbey. While promoting the film recently, Emma Watson talked about what the story means to her."I think that, that don't judge a book by its cover, look beyond the superficial. And I think it also celebrates the idea that love takes on this almost soul connection, the spiritual connection, this bigger connection. As you say, we need to be reminded of that now more than ever," said Watson. Disney's animation of the story in 1991 was a worldwide hit, featuring an Oscar- and Grammy-winning original song of the same title by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson. The song has been covered by John Legend and Ariana Grande ahead of the release of the new film, and a Chinese version has also been preformed by Tian Fuzhen and Jing Boran. Celine Dion has been asked to perform a new song for the latest release, titled "How Does A Moment Last Forever".The soundtrack of the new Beauty and the Beast is now also available.Related: Which 'Beauty and the Beast' music video will fans like best?

                    Disney's 'Mulan' remake not going to be a musical: Director
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                A scene from Disney's Mulan [Photo/Mtime]Niki Caro, who has been tapped to direct the upcoming Disney live-action reboot of Mulan, said that the new film will not be a musical but a family-friendly and girl-powered martial arts flick.The revelation has disappointed some fans, as the original animation features well-known songs like Reflection and I'll Make a Man Out of You.During an interview with ScreenCrush, Caro said as the project has not officially started, she does not have too many details to reveal. However, given the scope of the production and the story, the director did promise the piece will come out a creative extravaganza.Caro added that to prepare for the film, she and her 9-year-old daughter plan to learn martial arts together.Since the story of Mulan is set in China, casting of the new film has attracted some attention, amid concerns of the story being whitewashed. The live-action remake will now reportedly feature an all-Asian cast to preserve the cultural accuracy of the tale.Disney's 1998 animation Mulan was a worldwide hit. It was based on the Chinese folk tale of legendary warrior Hua Mulan from the Northern and Southern Dynasties, or around 1,500 years ago, in Chinese history.Disguised as a man, she took her ailing father's place in the army and earned high military honors, before retiring to her hometown.The upcoming Mulan movie is scheduled for a release in November 2018.Related:Fans call on Disney 'not to whitewash' Mulan'Game of Thrones' director may direct Sony's live-action 'Mulan'

                Wonder Woman tops the Chinese box office in single-day takings among the recently released films. Photos provided to China DailyAfter fighting evil and saving the world for 75 years in comic books and on screen, Wonder Woman, or the Amazonian princess Diana, has just conquered the largest movie market to Asia.The latest Warner Bros' DC comic book movie has beaten Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales and the Indian biographical drama Dangal, the highest-grossing non-Hollywood import in China.Wonder Woman has yet to surpass the two films in terms of total earnings, but it has beaten them in single-day box-office takings since it opened across China on June 2, according to live tracker Cbooo.cn.At the end of Tuesday, with 36 percent of the country's 43,000 screens－similar to its debut on Friday－the 140-minute movie had raked in nearly 400 million yuan ($59 million) in China, which overtook Japan to become the world's second-largest movie market in 2012.Statistics show that Shanghai loves Wonder Woman the most, with the highest number of screenings, followed by Chongqing and Beijing, according to the box office and scheduling tracking site 58921.com.The ranking is probably due to the movie's Shanghai promotional event attended by Israeli actress Gal Gadot and American actor Chris Pine, industry watchers say.China's fast-expanding movie market has made Shanghai and Beijing lucrative Asian locations for Hollywood movies. And the stars' interactions with local fans often boost box-office takings.

                    Diversity goes global with 'Black Panther' leading the pack
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                "Black Panther speaks to all people, not just blacks," co-star, Daniel Kaluuya told Xinhua, "It resonates with what real people are feeling,"Kaluuya plays W'Kabi, a member of the Border Tribe and a close personal confidant of King T'Challa in the film. On a winning streak, Kaluuya recently also received a coveted "Best Actor" Oscar nomination this year for his starring role in the racially-motivated smash-hit, Get Out.And global sales of the film have proved him right, as it raked in $577 million outside the United States, including a staggering $66.5 million in just its opening weekend in China.Black Panther also continued to lead North American box office, becoming the first film since 2009's Avatar to take the top spot for five weekends in a row. The superhero film has grossed a spectacular $605.4 million in North America through Sunday, pushing its global cume to $1,182.5 million, according to studio figures collected by comScore. Black Panther is already the 5th largest global release of a superhero tent-pole in film history.Jeff Bock, a senior analyst at Exhibitor Relations, told the New York Times, "I think about it like a wall crumbling," In terms of Black Panther, no studio can say again, "Oh, black movies don't travel, overseas interest will be minimal."China was the final market for the Disney-Marvel tent-pole's global roll-out. Opening just after China's New Year vacation ended in February, Marvel's Afrocentric hit, starring the stately Chadwick Boseman (Captain America: Civil War) and empowered Lupita Nyong'o (12 Years a Slave), roared to a staggering 55 percent of China's weekend box office - the biggest Western film to open in 2018 to date.The China market can be a difficult one to predict with any accuracy, since third and fourth tier cities often react differently from the first and second tier metropolitan centers.But, lively interest on popular film fan rating sites like Maoyan helped increase the box office of the film, as Chinese fans accepted it as another Marvel superhero pic rather than a "minority-oriented" title.When asked by Xinhua if he thought Black Panther had become something of a rallying cry for people of color, Kaluuya said, "It certainly seems to have tapped into some part of the public's consciousness. It helps people feel good about themselves."Danai Gurira, who plays Okoye, the formidable head of the female warriors, the Dora Milaje, told Xinhua, "In a way, it's what we've been looking for."So, what's all the hub-bub about? After all, there have been black superheros on the screen before: Who can forget Wesley's Snipes blade-wielding vampire-superhuman in Blade (1998), Blade II (2002), and Blade Trinity (2004), or NBA superstar, Shaquille O'Neal's, superhero turn as "Steel" in 1997?There have also been black superheroes in studio comic book franchises, such as Academy Award-winner, Halle Berry's, star turns as two different superheroes: as Catwoman in Warner Bros' Catwoman (2004) and Storm in Fox-Marvel's blockbuster X-Men franchise. Hollywood royalty, Will Smith, is also a member of the double X superhero club, having played the lead in Sony's Hancock (2008) and Deadshot in WB's Suicide Squad (2017). Don Cheadle appears as War Machine in Paramount-Marvel's Iron Man franchise, while Anthony Mackie wings his way to glory as Falcon in their "Captain America" franchise as well.But, all that said, never before has there been a black superhero in a black world. Black Panther is no white man's sidekick, no uber step-n-fetch it. He's the noble leader of not just an elite race of African warriors, but the leader of a civilization steeped in its own values and traditions that is technologically superior to the white world around it.And it's had the same inspiring impact on black viewers as Wonder Woman has had on female viewers and "Wolf Warrior II" has had at home in China.Said Peter DeBruge of Variety, "Until now... big-screen superheroes have traditionally been white dudes put on this earth... to defend America from its enemies... Ryan Coogler's Black Panther is a radically different kind of comic-book movie, one with a proud Afrocentric twist, featuring a nearly all-black cast, that largely ignores the United States and focuses instead on the fictional nation of Wakanda - and guess what: Virtually everything that distinguishes 'Black Panther' from past Marvel pics works to this standalone entry's advantage.""Marvel Studios has excelled at creating engaging, entertaining diversions... What it hasn't done is make movies that feel consequential," wrote The Verges's Bryan Bishop.He continued, "Ryan Coogler's Black Panther is different. Not only is it a long-overdue embrace of diversity and representation, it's a film that actually has something to say..." He concluded, "It also feels like a turning point..."Black Panther is indeed proving to be a game-changer. If the staggering box office success of this movie is anything to go by, that invisible Hollywood color bar could be well and truly shattered.Quick to capitalize on the diversity market trend that runaway hits, "Wonder Woman" and "Black Panther," have kickstarted, other Hollywood studios are following suit, slotting ethnic superhero movies into their own pipelines.Warner Brothers is leaping to the head of the pack with multiple ethnic superheroes, including: Cyborg, starring Ray Fisher, which they premiered briefly last year in Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice; Shazam, starring Dwayne Johnson, and "Aquaman" starring Pacific Islander, Jason Momoa, of "Game of Thrones" and "Conan" fame.Fox is fielding female Hispanic superhero, Alita: Battle Angel, into the mix, along with two other Hispanic characters, Sunpost and Dr. Cecilia Reyes, in New Mutants, while Sony/Columbia is teeing up a remake of Jeff Most's The Crow, set to star Jason Momoa and there are rumors of a Green Hornet reboot with an Asian star playing Green Hornet.Ava DeVarnay was recently hired to direct WB-DC Comics Extended Universe's upcoming New Gods, making her the first African American woman ever to be hired to direct a Hollywood studio superhero movie and the second woman ever, after Patty Jenkins, director of the runaway hit, "Wonder Woman."Patty Jenkins told the press, "We have to do the real stories now. The world is in crisis... So, what does it really mean to be a hero? It's not just about defeating the bad guy, for most of us it's also about love and understanding and forgiveness and the complexity of life on a daily basis ... its about how to use your power as an adult, wisely and kindly."

                    Disney to reboot Home Alone for TV streaming

                LOS ANGELES - Disney is rebooting Home Alone and Night at the Museum for its new TV streaming service, which launches in the United States in November and is intended to rival Netflix. The beloved and high-grossing film franchises were acquired by Disney during its acquisition of 21st Century Fox in March. Chief executive Bob Iger said Disney was "focused on leveraging Fox's vast library of great titles ... for example, re-imagining Home Alone, Night at the Museum, Cheaper by the Dozen, and Diary of a Wimpy Kid for a new generation on Disney+." "Nothing is more important to us than getting this right," he added in an earnings call on Tuesday. He did not clarify whether the new versions would be feature films or television programs. The three Home Alone films that received theatrical releases together grossed $914.8 million at the global box office, not adjusted for inflation. The 1990 original, in which eight-year-old Kevin McCallister is accidentally left behind when his family goes on vacation and must defend his home from inept burglars, is widely seen as a classic Christmas family movie. No casting details have been announced for the remake. Macaulay Culkin, who as a child actor starred in the original, tweeted on Wednesday: "Hey @Disney, call me!" Ben Stiller's Night at the Museum trilogy, about a museum security guard trying to keep track of exhibits that come to life, has grossed over $1.35 billion worldwide. Both movie franchises will be part of the Disney+ service's original content in a crowded TV streaming marketplace soon to feature HBO Max, Apple and NBCUniversal platforms along with Amazon Prime and Netflix. Disney also owns Marvel Studios, which recently unveiled a slate of new superhero films and TV shows that will share characters and plotlines, blurring the line between the media. Former Fox superhero movie franchises including X-Men, Fantastic 4 and Deadpool will now come under the Marvel umbrella, Iger said, adding that parent company Disney sees "great long-term value" in the titles. After launching in the US on Nov 12 at a starting price of $6.99 monthly, Disney+ will gradually expand internationally with a start in Europe. It will launch with 300 movies including its Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel titles. Agence France - presse (China Daily 08/09/2019 page10)
