                Crucial juncture for Hong Kong now: spokesperson
            </p>
            <p>
                BEIJING - It has now come to the crucial juncture of safeguarding the bottom-line of "one country, two systems" principle and maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, said a spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council on Tuesday.The task of ending violence and chaos in Hong Kong is a cardinal issue on which Hong Kong's future hinges, Yang Guang said at a press conference, adding that there is no middle ground and there should be no hesitation, indecision or wavering on the issue.

                Youth, faith key to environmental protection
            </a>
            <p>
                The United Nations Environment Programme has expressed its commitment to work with youth, faith leaders and faith-based organizations from across the world to achieve the goals set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.Joyce Msuya, the deputy executive director of UNEP, said they have launched these partnerships to facilitate their efforts finding a more sustainable path.The first was the Faith for Earth Initiative, launched in 2017, which has so far built a network of more than 750 faith-based organizations to harness the power of faith on behalf of the planet.Also launched in the same year was the Interfaith Rainforest Initiative, with a mission to bring moral urgency and faith-based leadership to end the destruction of the tropical forests."I am hopeful, but I am also a realist. And I know we need to show more ambition in our work to heal our ailing planet. I find hope in the young women and men around the world who are drawing on both faith and science to campaign for change and to raise awareness about how to live more sustainably," she said.Msuya made these remarks on Monday at the opening ceremony of the 2nd International Conference on Laudato Si, held in Nairobi, Kenya. She challenged young people to speak up and show their leadership. "We need your energy, your passion and your ideas," she said.Cardinal Peter Turkson, prefect of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, said it's noteworthy youth mobilizations have acquired unprecedented strength since the "Climate Strikes" were ignited by the 15-year-old activist Greta Thunberg last August, with millions of students participating in the last two "Global Climate Strikes".Turkson said the pressure by the student mobilizations is being noticed by politicians, who are the ultimate decision-makers and need to show the political courage to fully implement the Paris Agreement."I am encouraged about the participation of young Catholics in these mobilizations, given the urgency of the situation," he said.Turkson urged the youth to carry on their commendable efforts through the Laudato Si generation and beyond, building networks of solidarity both inside the church and with the larger civil society movement to care for the planet.

                When it comes to human rights, US barks up the wrong tree
            </a>
            <p>
                Some Western countries have spared no efforts in smearing China's human rights record in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, alleging that Beijing monitors ethnic groups there and infringes upon their human rights and religious freedom. Some US politicians have even warned American businesses to think twice before doing business in Xinjiang.Yet actions speak louder than words. The right to good life is the cardinal principle of human rights, and Xinjiang residents, not foreigners, have the right to speak on human rights issues in the region.Let us consider some facts. The GDP of Xinjiang increased from 3.9 billion yuan ($567.71 million) in 1978 to 1.2 trillion yuan in 2018, and per capita GDP from 313 yuan to 48,000 yuan, growing 294 and 153 times respectively. The ethnic minority groups' right to use the mother tongue is fully protected and their languages are widely used in legislation, administration, education, publishing, broadcasting, and public affairs. And 52 of the 110 newspapers and 120 of the 200 magazines published in Xinjiang are in ethnic minority languages.

                Walmart announces Innovation Pipeline Round 3 finalists
            </a>
            <p>
                The Walmart Food Safety Innovation Pipeline Round 3 is focused on supply chain insights that advance transparency and improve food safety from farm to fork. Since the Walmart Food Safety Collaboration Center (WFSCC) launched the request for proposals on May 30, the Innovation Pipeline has received wide attention from media, the global startup community and big global brands.By July 19, the WFSCC had received 64 proposals from domestic and overseas companies and organizations. The submitted proposals cover solutions from across the supply chain, such as AI-assisted supply chain management, next-generation cold chain logistics, food traceability, rapid testing and agricultural data platforms. After careful review by the WFSCC and the Walmart Food Safety Innovation Council, 19 finalists were selected to join the next phase of the Innovation Pipeline Round 3.The Walmart Food Safety Innovation Council is a group of cross-sector leaders from food and beverage, retail, logistics, investment, tech, trade associations and startup incubators, who guide the direction of the Innovation Pipeline, mentor finalists, and identify potential pilot and investment opportunities on behalf of their organizations. This year, the Walmart Food Safety Innovation Pipeline has attracted more companies and organizations to join as partners, increasing the size of the Innovation Council to 26 members. These leaders will bring greater industry resources and insights to the Innovation Pipeline, provide in-depth and tailored advice to finalists, and create more pilot and investment opportunities.Next, finalists will be matched with a mentor from the Walmart Food Safety Innovation Council and be granted an exclusive opportunity to tour Walmart and partner facilities to refine their proposals. Finalists will then submit their revised proposals by Sept 9 and prepare to pitch their idea at the Innovation Draft Day in Shenzhen in late September.Walmart Food Safety Innovation Pipeline Round 3 FinalistsBeijing Geekplus Technology Co LtdBeijing Sya Data Science and Technology Co LtdBeijing XinhuiPro Sciences and Development Co LtdCardinal OperationsDongguan Jiujiu Mifeng Intelligent Technology Co LtdFoshan Cooler Refrigeration Technology Co Ltd & Foshan Jingxun Cold Chain Technology Co LtdFreshpoint Quality Assurance Ltd (dba EVIGENCE Sensors)Intello Labs Private LimitedMininglamp TechnologyNanjing New Hunter Testing and Technology IncPURESPACE INCRockwell Automation China Co LtdShannon Agriculture LaboratoriesSilverado Integrated Solutions LLCThe NEOM CompanyV-Mark Intelligence & Technology Co LtdVarcode LTDYoran ImagingZenMeasure Technology (Beijing) Co Ltd

                Africa must link environmental causes with politics, economy, religion
            </a>
            <p>
                In order to effectively address environmental challenges threatening the continent, African environmentalists have expressed need for consolidation of environment with economy, politics and religion.They admitted that despite the fact that Africa has enormous natural resource wealth, it's extremely vulnerable to the impacts of environmental degradation, including climate change, and that collective responsibility can successfully provide a lasting solution.Josephat Shete of Jesuit Hakimani Cetre, a research, formation and social action institute, said politicians are very influential in the African setting, hence they can effectively spearhead environmental conservation matters."If politicians can articulate the importance of environmental conservation, practical results can be realized," he said.Shete said linking environmental conservation with economy would motivate participation of many people especially rural residents."There are people who can't afford a meal a day. It would be so hard to convince such a person to conserve the environment, unless there is a way they can benefit economically from it," he said.He challenged youth and rural residents to engage in tree planting which in addition to conserving environment would provide them with livelihood.He cited a group of youth in central part of Kenya, who are growing commercial trees, conserving environment at the same time earning a living.The youth are growing eucalyptus, one of the tree species widely planted by farmers in Kenya because it's fast growing, multipurpose and has a ready market.According to Kenya Forestry Research Institutes, eucalyptus meant for production of rails and fuelwood can be harvested from three years; poles and pulp from six to eight years; transmission poles from 10 to 12 years; timber from 15 to 20 years; and plywood from 20 to 25 years.On linking environment with religion, environmentalists have the opinion that spiritual beliefs and religions define cultural values, social inclusion, political engagement and economic prosperity.Spiritual leaders at all levels are thus critical to the success of the global solidarity for an ethical, moral and spiritual commitment to protect the environment. They can specifically, display their sustainable behaviors, serving as role models for their followers and the public.Cardinal Peter Turkson, prefect of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, said religion plays a very important role in promoting care and respect for the environment."Faith in God leads us to know Him in his creation, which is the fruit of his love for us, and it calls us to look after and protect nature. It is thus necessary that religions promote a true education, at all levels, which will help to spread a responsible and receptive attitude to the need to care for our world," he said.In addition to religion, economy and politics, the environmentalist termed education and awareness creation as an important aspect in environmental conservation.Agatha Kariuki, from Catholic University of East Africa, is of the view that the government should incorporate environmental conservation into the curriculum."Environmental conservation should be taught as a subject from primary, secondary to university level. This way children from the young age will understand the importance of environmental protection and practice the same," she said.Innocent Wefon, a clergy at Mill Hill Missionaries in Cameroon, said most of the rural residents across Africa have very little knowledge on environmental conservation, making it hard to push the agenda.He said there should be programs to enlighten the villagers on the importance of environmental protection.Alphone Muia, an environmentalist, said the public should be encouraged to replace consumption with sacrifice, greed with generosity and wastefulness with the spirit of caring.George Thuku, the child safeguarding officer at AMECEA Pastoral Department, said Africa should redefine an economic model that is purely African. A model that strikes a balance between overreliance on the natural resources, while making use of the available resources."We need also to position Africa to be able to intellectually participate and influence environmental conservation discussions at a global level. No matter how good we are at protecting our environment, environmental issues are global concerns and whatever happens miles away from Africa affects us," he said.Thuku said Africa should also develop policies that are Africans and reflect the realities of the continent's context and culture.

                Australian PM expresses sympathy for victims after cardinal's sex abuse appeal dismissed
            </a>
            <p>
                CANBERRA - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has expressed sympathy for victims of child sexual abuse after Cardinal George Pell lost his appeal against sex abuse convictions.Victoria's Court of Appeal on Wednesday morning upheld Pell's conviction on five charges.Speaking shortly after the verdict was delivered, Morrison told reporters in Canberra that Pell will be stripped of his Order of Australia honor, which he was awarded in 2005 for "service to the Catholic church in Australia.""My sympathies are with the victims of child sexual abuse not just on this day, but on every single day," Morrison said."I would urge Australians who find themselves reliving these experiences to reach out to those around them, to reach out to services that are there for them."The courts have done their job, they have rendered their verdict. That's the system of justice in this country and that must be respected."Catherine King, the federal Member of Parliament (MP) for Ballarat, the town where Pell committed his offences in the 1990s, welcomed Wednesday's decision on social media."My thoughts today are with the so many survivors of abuse across Australia and in my community of Ballarat. Justice has been served by your courage," she wrote.
