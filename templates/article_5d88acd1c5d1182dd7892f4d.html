                UN chief calls for prevention of full-scale attack on Syria's Idlib
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                UNITED NATIONS - UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Tuesday that it is "absolutely essential" to avoid a full-scale attack on Syria's Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold in the country."This (A full-scale attack) would unleash a humanitarian nightmare unlike any seen in the blood-soaked Syrian conflict," said the UN chief in a press encounter at UN Headquarters in New York.Almost half of Idlib's population of 2.9 million people had gone there to seek refuge from conflict elsewhere in Syria, including nearly 1 million children. Their lives have been upended and they have nowhere to go, he said."Idlib is the last so-called 'de-escalation zone' in Syria. It must not be transformed into a blood bath."Guterres reminded parties to the conflict of their obligations under international law to protect civilians."I understand that the present situation in Idlib is not sustainable and the presence of terrorist groups cannot be tolerated. But fighting terrorism does not absolve warring parties of their core obligations under international law," he said. "I make a clear appeal to all parties directly and indirectly involved -- and in particular the three guarantors of the de-escalation zone, namely Iran, Russia and Turkey: Spare no effort to find solutions that protect civilians. Preserve basic services such as hospitals. Ensure full respect for international humanitarian law."It is important that the parties -- especially the three guarantors of the Astana process -- find a way in which it is possible to isolate terrorist groups and it is possible to create a situation in which civilians will not be the price paid to solve the problem of Idlib, he said.The three guarantors bear a particular responsibility since they have their own posts around the situation in Idlib and they have negotiated for a long time the de-escalation zones and different other forms and arrangements, said the UN chief.It also goes without saying that in the 21st century any use of chemical weapons is totally unacceptable, said Guterres. "Beyond the immediate human toll, such use would lead to a situation spiraling out of control," he warned.He asked for peace-making efforts, particularly within the framework of the UN-led Geneva process.There is an urgent need to make greater progress in the Geneva process, and in particular the creation of a constitutional committee as part of the overall political package, he said. "There is no military solution to the conflict. The solution must be political.""We have a collective responsibility to protect people who have already suffered too much," he said.Guterres made the appeal after the Security Council remained divided over Idlib on Tuesday.US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley issued a stern warning on the Syrian government, Russia and Iran over military operations in Idlib."We consider any assault on Idlib to be a reckless escalation of the conflict. If (Syrian President Bashar) Assad, Russia, and Iran continue down the path they are on, the consequences will be dire. The world will hold them responsible," she told the Security Council.Russian and Syrian government air forces have launched over 100 airstrikes in Idlib this month, she noted.Russian ambassador to the United Nations Vassily Nebenzia argued at the same Security Council meeting that there is a need to fight terrorists in Idlib."We cannot allow terrorists to hold hostage and use hundreds of thousands of people as human shields," he told the Security Council. "It is unacceptable to spare terrorists."Feridun Sinirlioglu, the Turkish ambassador to the United Nations, made it clear that his country is opposed to an assault on Idlib."The Syrian regime seeks to legitimize its operation on counter-terrorism grounds. Let us make no mistake: such an operation would not achieve the stated goal," he told the Security Council."In a complex place like Idlib, traditional counter-terrorism methods would not yield the desired results. On the contrary, they would create further suffering, alienate and radicalize more Syrians. In this sense, a military operation in Idlib would only play into the hands of terrorists," he said.

                    Xinjiang rides high on Belt and Road Initiative
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The only thing visible from the ground or air was mountains and mountains of sand. There were no roads, no houses, no trees, no water — nothing but sand. That one day there would be any sign of civilization in the middle of Gobi Desert was unthinkable a decade ago. But if there’s one country that knows how to do the unthinkable, it is China.In fewer than 10 years, China has constructed a gleaming highway in the middle of that desert that stretches 2,768 kilometers from Beijing to Urumqi in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. The highway, the world’s longest expressway passing through a desert, has shortened the distance between the two cities by 1,300 km.But there’s a bigger goal behind this technological feat than reducing travel time. Xinjiang is a crucial gateway for the Belt and Road Initiative, as it borders Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and India. Its land border with seven countries means it is best placed to expand China’s trade and ties not only with these neighboring nations, but also with Europe and beyond.The initiative, which has already attracted more than 80 countries and international organizations, has two prongs: The Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. The belt links China with Central Asia, Russia, Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and South Asia. Xinjiang comes into play under this plan. On the other hand, the road links China’s coast to Europe through the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean on one route, and China’s coast through the South China Sea to the South Pacific on the other.Globally, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a port city in Sri Lanka and the high-speed railway in Indonesia are some of the biggest current projects under the initiative.Domestically, Fujian, the launch pad of the ancient Maritime Silk Road, and Xinjiang are at the center of action.The Beijing-Urumqi highway is part of this initiative.Xinjiang, which the central government hopes will serve as a transportation hub and commercial, logistics and cultural center in the near future, already plays an important role in China’s economic growth, as almost all imports and exports to and from Central Asia pass through it.One of the goals of the initiative, which was first proposed by President Xi Jinping in Astana, Kazakhstan in 2013, is to boost economic growth in Xinjiang, which like the rest of the western region, lags behind other more developed parts of the country.To reduce this regional disparity, the local government plans to invest billions of dollars in infrastructure construction, including airports, roads and railway networks. In 2017, Xinjiang invested about 450 billion yuan ($66b) in infrastructure, an increase of 50 percent year-on-year.Last year, 700 freight trains began their journey from Urumqi to Europe. This year, around 1,400 trains loaded with goods are expected to head west. The mining sector, healthcare and tourism are some areas projected to benefit from the BRI.By government figures, Xinjiang’s economy grew 7.6 percent year-on-year in 2017. It recorded 20 percent annual growth in its fixed-asset investment and its foreign trade expanded 19.9 percent year-on-year. The region’s GDP totaled 1.09 trillion yuan last year, according to this year’s Government Work Report. Xinjiang’s urban and rural per-capita disposable income was 30,775 and 11,045 yuan, respectively, up 10.1 percent and 9.9 percent in real terms. And its economy is projected to grow 7 percent year-on-year, with per-capita disposable income expected to go up 8.5 percent.Xinjiang attracted more than 100 million tourists in 2017, up 32.4 percent year-on-year. They spent over 182 billion yuan last year, a 30 percent increase over 2016.As the region borders Central Asia, it is witnessing a steady growth in medical tourism. Its hospitals receive hundreds of patients from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and other neighboring countries every year. With Xinjiang’s medical sector beginning to play an important role in the BRI, the regional government has launched a number of initiatives ranging from attracting more specialist doctors to expanding networks for online consultation and even remote surgery.It seems Xinjiang, once the heart of the ancient Silk Road, is prepared to play a central role in the Belt and Road Initiative.Faisal Kidwai is a journalist with more than 18 years experience in media.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                    Autumn increase of tariffs
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                On Aug 29, Kazakhstan's Nursultan Nazarbayev International airport unilaterally increased its costs for cargo processing in domestic routes by 50 percent. The decision made favorable to the air harbor, however, obviously will have a reverse effect on the rest of the market players. Tariff increases for an additional 11 services at Astana’s main gateway will lead to drastically skyrocketing of air carriers’ spending with the beginning of the new year.It's worth noting that by Order No 449 of the Civil Aviation Committee at the Investments and Development Ministry of Kazakhstan, dated Aug 29, the tariff for handling goods on domestic routes service escalated by 50 percent, from 9,640 Khazakhstani tenge ($26.25) per ton to 14,506 Khazakhstani tenge ($39.50) per ton.Astana airport justifies its decision by the need for modernization and unprofitability of this service with the tariff remaining unchanged for almost eight years.But the question is, why is such a lucrative business (according to financial report of Astana International airport) seeking modernization of its services to the cost of its consumers, rather than using its own funds or additional investments? Air carriers' attempts to receive information on the cost of modernization of freight transportation services and cargo handling services to date have been unsuccessful.The legitimacy and validity of the issued order also is questionable. Article 174, Paragraph 1, of the Entrepreneurship Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan prohibits the action (inaction) of market entities occupying a dominant or monopolistic position, including such as the establishment and maintenance of monopolistically high prices. Article 175, paragraph 2, of the Code clearly defines that the price exceeding the means for the production and sale of goods and income is considered monopolistic. Consequently, experts conclude that Astana airport's actions are contrary to the norms of the law and the procedure for tariff escalation itself was carried out in violation of the requirements of the law. This included timing of the notification regarding a public hearing and incomplete information about a public hearing in the announcements. The main thing, according to experts, was violation of the core principle of public hearings - the transparency of the formation of prices for goods (work, services), described in Paragraph 18 of the rules on pricing on socially significant markets.And it looks like the tariff policy of the Astana airport will not get any ‘softer’. Similarly, in January this year, the airport unilaterally increased fees for a number of its services on all international routes. Thus, a service of "ensuring the take-off and landing of an aircraft on international routes" increased by 30%, "ensuring aviation security on international routes" by 100%, "basing of aircraft" by 157% and service of "over parking of aircraft" by 188%.Now, according to an airport notice to domestic air carriers dated Aug 22, beginning Jan 1, this list will expand by 11 additional services related to ground handling. And the range of price growth is quite big - from 45% to 314%.The increase in the handling fee for domestic flights will increase the cost of Air Astana alone by 18.5 million tenge per year. And with the increase of the remaining tariffs the company's expenses will soar by 1.5 billion tenge per year.But air carriers are forced to accept such an aggressive tariff policy. They do not have an alternative choice in the form of another airport. For comparison, in many local and foreign airports with similar passenger and freight traffic, the tariffs for the cargo handling service are lower on average by 63 percent: in Almaty, 5,250 Khazakhstani tenge; in Karaganda, 5,973 tenge; in Bangkok, 9,999 tenge; and in Istanbul 14,537 tenge.Other reasons may be behind the increase in tariffs, experts say, namely, loan obligations to the JSC Development Bank of Kazakhstan.Anyway, the consequences of all these price metamorphoses can be very sad and worsen the condition of civil aviation in Kazakhstan. Air carriers, in an effort to pay for their expenses, will be forced to increase tariffs on passengers departing from the capital city of Kazakhstan. Experts warn that existing routes might be closed and passenger traffic might drop.It is hoped that the route chosen by the Astana airport will not lead to a point of no return.

                    Air Astana to launch a low cost airline, FlyArystan
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Air Astana is pleased to announce that it is to launch a low cost airline in the first half of 2019. The airline will be called FlyArystan. It will operate a fleet of Airbus A320 aircraft configured to an all-economy class of 180 seats. It will operate a classic LCC model, following the examples of highly successful airlines such as easyjet, Indigo, Cebu Pacific, and Air Asia. It will offer low airfares – approximately half of what Air Astana offers today – on mostly domestic routes – but it is expected to expand onto regional international routes in the mid-term.It will operate initially four aircraft, growing to a fleet of at least 15 by 2022. FlyArystan will operate from multiple aircraft bases in Kazakhstan with routes and aircraft bases to be announced over the coming months.FlyArystan's management team has already been appointed and is drawn from Air Astana's senior local managers, whom the airline has been developing for the last 16 years. The team will be led by Tim Jordan, a British-Australian national with more than 15 years' senior LCC management experience at Cebu Pacific and Virgin Blue.Although FlyArystan will be a low cost airline, with very different service procedures to those of Air Astana, it is to be stressed that as a division of Air Astana, there will be no degradation of airline safety or reliability standards. All safety standards and regulatory processes to which Air Astana is subject, will automatically apply to FlyArystan. Finally, and as usual with Air Astana, the project will be entirely self-funded. FlyArystan will require no capital from shareholders, no state subsidies or external financial support of any kind.Peter Foster, president & CEO of Air Astana, was quoted as saying "FlyArystan is the result of much serious thought and internal business planning, and comes as a result of a rapidly changing local and regional airline business environment. It will be good for the mid to long-term prospects of Air Astana, and we hope, very welcome to the Kazakhstan travelling public, who will be able to benefit from significantly cheaper airfares on domestic and regional routes".

                    Astana Intl Financial Center poised to be leader in Asia
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                In December 2015, President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan signed the Constitutional Law on the establishment of the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC) and, in his managerial style, set an ambitious task: the center should become the main financial hub and become one of the leading financial centers in Asia as soon as possible.A number of international experts predicted the opening and launch of the first auction would not happen earlier than in 5-6 years, best case scenario. However, the government of Kazakhstan promised to realize the idea earlier, so the start was given.The first company whose securities were put up for auction was Kazakhstan heavyweight Kazatomprom JSC – going right in with the trump cards, as they say. This is not surprising. The company is considered the world's largest producer of natural uranium (it accounts for about 20 percent of the world ore mining market) and market players are very interested in it.In addition to Kazatomprom, 49 foreign and 16 Kazakhstani companies, as well as 2,700 Kazakhstani citizens, presented their shares on the stock exchange in Astana that day.In the near future, shares of Kazakhtelecom, Air Astana, KazMunaiGaz and other national companies of Kazakhstan will also be placed on the AIFC stock exchange. And this forms a special moment of trust for foreign investors. That is, the national companies of Kazakhstan, which are going to have an initial public offering, will be traded on the AIFC platform within the framework of European rules. Foreign business, thus, will get clear and transparent conditions for investing in the economy of Kazakhstan.The guarantee of the reliability of these investments will be not only the perfect reputation of Kazakhstan and its first place in the global Ease of Doing Business rankings for the protection of minority investors. It will also be backed by the fact that the AIFC's shareholders include the authorities of the global financial system: Goldman Sachs, the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the Silk Road Fund and the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, which specializes in trading shares of high-tech companies.The main advantage of the AIFC and all its participants, in whatever status they come to this site, is the independence of the court from the existing judicial and political system. The International Arbitration Center at the AIFC operates under the rules of British law. The AIFC court is able to deal with very difficult categories of cases, and the party filing a lawsuit has as many as three years to do so. Without going into details of court procedures on the site, in general terms we can say that the AIFC is ready to provide a legal atmosphere that meets the highest international requirements and this, of course, attracts market players.In general, all the conditions have been created, the start has been given, and, further, the AIFC should become a launching pad for participants in the financial market. Some 88 companies have already registered in the jurisdiction of the center. By the end of 2020, according to the plans, this figure will be increased to 500. By this time, the AIFC itself should enter the ranks of the top 50 international financial centers in the world.It is clear that such deadlines and plans can cause a lot of skepticism. But Kazakhstan, as is known, has its own time scale. Rebuilding a new ultramodern capital in the steppes with futuristic landscapes and advanced technologies for 20 years, and leading the country to the top 50 developed countries and the top 30 in Ease of Doing Business rankings -- for Kazakhstan, these tasks turned out to be easily accomplished.The author is an observer on Eurasian economies based in Beijing.

                    FlyArystan Airline is in standby mode
                </p>

                Nowadays air travel is an ordinary part of our life. It is no secret that low-cost airlines or low-costers are very popular wherever you go.Kazakhstan aviation market is developing this service line. In autumn 2018 it was officially announced about establishing FryArystan low-coster, a subsidiary of national air carrier Air Astana.It was planned to launch the low-coster operation in May 2019 based on the classic model of successful global airlines like Easyjet in Europe, Indigo in India, Cebu Pacific in the Philippines or Air Asia in Southeast Asia.The FlyArystan website will offer flights on 30 domestic routes with lower tariffs compared to Air Astana or other air carriers. Low cost will be reached due to exclusion of in-flight catering and limiting of checked baggage to 20 kilograms.So, if you'd like to have meals and soft drinks on board or check in extra baggage, it will cost you some extra fee. This is how all the low-costers work.But for operating in line with the rules similar to those established for the well-known low-cost carriers, the Kazakhstan air legislation regarding baggage transportation and own tariffs setting must be amended.Currently, the passenger having baggage and the passenger without the baggage pay the same ticket fee. It is worth mentioning that tariffs excluding baggage fee are currently applied by the airlines operating in Kazakhstan, for instance, Wizz Air to fly Astana-Budapest, Air Arabia to fly Almaty-Sharzha and Fly Dubai to fly Almaty-Dubai.Another obstacle for developing low-cost air transportation in Kazakhstan is tighter government regulation of air transportation and the inability of setting the tariffs by the airlines. It is obvious that the ticket fee consists of 30 percent of the air-fuel cost, up to 13 percent of flight navigation services, 11 percent of in-flight service, 10 percent of maintenance, 8.5 percent of leasing fee, personnel costs and much more.Extra paid services are of acute importance for the low-cost carrier well-being, in particular, the airline's right to set a baggage rate, as the ticket cost reduction by the low-coster is achieved due to:• High loading of the aircraft• Buying tickets online• No service fees to tourist agencies• Use of secondary airports• No connecting flights• Economy class seats only• Minimum crew• Short ground turn-around time• Excluding all the extra services (baggage, meals on board or seat selection etc.) from the base rate.For Almaty -- Astana, one of the most popular routes, the average low-coster ticket will cost 14 -16 thousand tenge. In contrast, the Tulpar-Talgo train ticket costs 13.5 -19 thousand tenge. So, the train passengers will probably use aircraft more often than trains. All the above-mentioned conditions will allow the low-cost carrier to offer lower tariffs and to get more passengers to fly low-coster both for business and tourism.

                    Air Astana comment on Kazakhstan - Japan flights

                Currently, Air Astana is working towards launching regular flights between Japan and Kazakhstan.This involves securing approval from Japan's aviation authorities. Submission of the required documents and determination of the technical matters to JCAB (Japan Civil Aviation Bureau) is expected to be a lengthy process - a minimum six months, we envisage. We would like to clarify that Air Astana has not received any subsidies from the Kazakhstan Government to commence commercial flights to Japan.From the very beginning, the growth of Air Astana has been entirely self-sufficient, with no call on subsidies from the State budget. Eleven of the carrier's 33 aircraft, including its three long-range Boeing 767s, were purchased outright. The company will update media should there be any further developments.DKnews.kz
