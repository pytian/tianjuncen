                             During his state visit to Russia in early June, Xi said the two countries should proactively push forward the connection between the Belt and Road and the Eurasian Economic Union and dedicate themselves to promoting the integration of the regional economy. Juan Carlos Capunay, Peru's former ambassador to China, said the BRI is the best solution for countries that want to embrace open business environments and build up their economies by joining global groups like the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization.

The expansion of cities will increase continuously in the next 30 years and [oblige] the governments in this region to launch good management techniques to protect their countries from disasters," he said. It suggested that policy-makers make three preparations to deal with disasters: optimise the effectiveness of the Bt350-billion water-management budget; ensure cooperation among agencies assigned to analyse and study legal aspects of disaster issues; and develop city plans that minimise disaster risks from urban expansion, said World Bank official Abhas Jha

Britain's Sun newspaper said the city had 115,014 reported crimes between January and June, including murders, sex attacks, gang fights, and a spree of thefts on the metro transportation system
