                            Tsai believes, wrongly though, that her tough stance against Beijing will help her get re-elected next year, without realizing her flawed policy has done little to improve the island's economy and people's livelihoods despite the island's economic growth declining from 2. As a result, the island's economic performance has continued to weaken, in part due to falling revenue from tourism which thrived for eight years before Tsai assumed office in 2016 thanks to record numbers of visitors from the Chinese mainland.Unless Tsai and her DPP acknowledge this essential fact, the island's economy will continue to suffer, partly because of the strained relations across the Straits, and the Taiwan administration will continue to be isolated, because the developments of the past years suggest Kiribati's decision could trigger a domino effect

                            China on Thursday demanded the United States stop advancing a Hong Kong-related bill and its interference in Hong Kong affairs on Thursday, after US lawmakers held a news conference to back the bill. US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a bipartisan group of members of Congress held the media event on the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019". China is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposed to the move, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Thursday

The insurgents are now promising more bloodshed, and US advocates of withdrawing from the battlefield questioned on Monday whether Trump's decision to cancel what he called plans for a secret meeting with Taliban and Afghan leaders at the Camp David, Maryland, presidential retreat over the weekend had poisoned the prospects for peace

In response to the Americans' visit, the Chinese National Table Tennis Team, led by Zhuang Zedong, embarked on an eight-city tour in the US in April 1972

In other words, how does Washington justify its double standards when it comes to street violence in the US and Hong Kong?The UK government has always been poking its nose into Hong Kong affairs.On June 19, the Speaker of US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, a longtime critic of China's human rights record, called the mass demonstrations in Hong Kong "a beautiful sight to behold", despite the fact that the "beautiful sight" soon turned into a freak show of extreme actions that rocked the global financial hub for the following two months

                            And it might be just wishful thinking on the part of the US to organize such a coalition considering that its European allies are less enamored of the "maximum pressure" the US is putting on Iran in an attempt to force it to terminate its involvement in the conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen — as they still hope to save the Iran nuclear deal.Even if such a coalition is established, the US should realize the more warships that it and its allies have in the strait, the more risk there is of an inadvertent run-in or miscalculation that may trigger a military conflict that neither the US nor Iran wants. The best solution to the current stand-off is for both sides to take a step back, which Iran already seems to have taken, and engage in talks, talks in which the US should not ask for too much

                            If the United States is seeking to safeguard the security of commercial shipping and freedom of navigation in the strategic Strait of Hormuz with its plans to put together a coalition to provide naval escorts for oil tankers, it would do well to consider why it thinks that is necessary. A series of attacks on shipping in the world's most important oil artery may seem to have provided the US with the excuse of putting together such a coalition. That three Iranian vessels tried to impede an oil tanker passing through the strait in recent days has added to the tension in the region

                            Some imports, including laptops, won't face new levies from Washington until Dec 15In what one expert called a "course adjustment" by the Trump administration, the Office of the US Trade Representative announced Tuesday that a planned 10 percent tariff on a range of Chinese imports would be delayed, sending the stock market soaring.Hundreds of companies testified in June against the new tariffs, and many warned that additional tariffs would raise prices at home and cost a loss of American jobs.Based on a Reuters analysis, the tariff delay until Dec 15 would cover around half of the $300 billion list

Since he reportedly discussed specific disarmament steps that the DPRK could promise at the Vietnam summit and corresponding measures the US would be willing to take, the bargaining on who will do what in return for what seems to be getting down to the necessary nitty-gritty.There appears to be a real need on both sides for the negotiations to move forward in order for such engagement to continue making sense

Both initiatives have enabled Chinese investment and loans in Africa to give priority to development projects and, through Chinese loans, have for the first time enabled African governments to turn the continent's resources advantage into a development advantage. Since Africa is yet to climb the value chain of mineral processing and manufacturing, the assistance in building up local capacity could have a much greater impact on developing skills in African economies if it were closely aligned with African economic potential and priority sectors, such as manufacturing

Choosing policies that support growth has become the priority for global leaders, and Chinese policymakers are expected to follow suit in their own way, providing assurances that the economy is on firm footing while striking a macroeconomic balance for long-term stability, analysts said." Stephen Schwartz, senior director of sovereign ratings at Fitch (Hong Kong), said, "In the face of the external headwinds, we believe the Chinese authorities will stop short of the type of credit-led stimulus policies that could exacerbate medium-term financial and economic imbalances

Such concerns may be somewhat reasonable, but considering the declining trend of major economies across the world, in large part due to rising trade protectionism, and the still-strong growth momentum of the Chinese economy, there is no reason to view China's economic prospects with pessimism.Also, some new and emerging sectors are making greater contributions to China's longer-term high-quality growth

                             In fact, there is a good reason that they should welcome such a move: recent research by my team at the University of Northampton indicated that the latest stages of globalization of innovation actually involved Chinese companies investing in developed countries for R&D and, perhaps counter-intuitively, they have things to teach their partners in the West, therefore also helping the latter to further upgrade their capabilities.Moving up the value chainWhile Western observers should keep pressing and helping China to further improve IP protection, they must also recognize and appreciate the legitimate concerns of China, and developing countries in general, in upgrading themselves in global value chains. There are many intertwined issues between China and the US (and the West in general) but the core issue is how the world (including China itself) should comprehend and cope with the rise of China and its technological giants

                            The trip, which represents the two powers' common aspiration to strengthen military trust and reduce misunderstanding and misjudgments, came amid efforts by Beijing and Washington to build a new model for the relationship between great powers, the US' insistence on pushing forward its Asia-Pacific rebalancing strategy and increasing tensions over the maritime disputes in East Asia. Washington is caustic about the so-called lack of transparency of China's military spending, worried about China's development of new military equipment, uncertain about China's military strategic intention, and believes China is carrying out an "anti-access/area-denial" strategy, which poses a challenge to the US' military supremacy. The lack of military mutual trust might lead the two countries to fall into the historical trap of conflict between a rising power and an established power
