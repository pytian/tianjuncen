                Shanghai tops national minimum wage standards
            </p>
            <p>
                Shanghai had the highest minimum monthly wage across China by June, according to the latest national minimum wage standards released by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security.Shanghai enjoys the highest minimum monthly pay of 2,480 yuan ($351) and Beijing tops the minimum hourly wage chart of 24 yuan among 32 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, according to the statistics from the ministry.Seven cities and provinces have seen minimum monthly wages of over 2,000 yuan, and along with Shanghai, they are Shenzhen, Beijing, South China's Guangdong province, Tianjin, and East China's Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.Meanwhile, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangdong province own the top four highest minimum hourly wages - workers get minimum pay of over 20 yuan.On the other end of the spectrum, the minimum hourly wage in Liaoning province is only 10.6 yuan, which is less than half that in Beijing.According to minimum wage regulations released by the authority, the national minimum wage standards are set based on the residents' annual living expenses, employees' average pay, local economic development and social insurance money and housing funds, as well as the unemployment rate.Su Hainan, a researcher at the China Association for Labor Studies said, "Due to the difference in local economic levels, market prices, residents' incomes and minimum wage standards vary from region to region."The standards are important to workers in labor-intensive enterprises, and small and micro companies."The majority of front-line middle and low-skilled workers, such as labor-intensive workers, skilled manufacturers, stevedores, catering staff at low-end diners and cleaners are paid as much as or slightly higher than the minimum wages," Su said.In Beijing, cleaners, janitors, supermarket salespeople and hotel room attendants usually earn wages slightly above the minimum wage, and jobs that offer employees accommodations and meals tend to pay even less. In addition, older employees, such as security guards and janitors over 50 years old, are prone to earn lower incomes.For example, according to a recruitment notice on a local website, it is hiring men and women under 60 years old to work as sanitation workers. Employees earn 2,600 yuan on a monthly basis by sweeping the public roads from 5 am to 7 pm per day. A daily meal break and a 2-day monthly vacation are included, and workers live in a free dormitory with two roommates.According to Su, due to the excess of labor supply in the market in the past few years, some middle and low-skilled workers had been underpaid. The raise in national minimum wage standards is to ensure the basic needs of low-income workers and their families.

                Carpoolers wait for Didi hitch service to resume
            </a>
            <p>
                For Zhao Huijiao, it's a nightmare in the morning when her roommate stays in the bathroom taking an epic shower. But it's even worse if she can't find a driver in her WeChat group carpools.Zhao, a 26-year-old accountant who lives near the south Sixth Ring Road in Beijing but works in the city's upmarket Guomao area more than 50 kilometers away, was a regular user of Didi Chuxing's hitch service. It saved her time and money.Since Didi suspended it hitch service in September, after the murders of two female passengers by drivers, she has joined two WeChat groups that include 500 drivers and users in the neighborhoods."If the hitch service was still available, it would save me a lot trouble finding a driver every day," Zhao said.Many people who are active in similar groups also look forward to the resumption of the hitch service. And Didi recently began laying the groundwork to restart its carpooling service.Zhang Rui, the executive who was brought in to reform the company, has proposed five measures to revamp the service: restricting drivers' routes, abandoning the platform's social features, more strictly screening new drivers, allocating safety complaints to specialists and improving emergency management.There is no precise timeline for relaunch yet, and the safety of the Didi model still concerns many passengers."If Didi strictly followed those rules, the platforms might not survive, as some policies are not market-driven," Gao Yu, 32, a coder in Beijing, said on social media. "There are still huge potential risks for passengers."Xu Kangming, a transportation expert and policy adviser at the Ministry of Transport, said on Weibo that "hitch operates on the idea of matching private car owners and passengers heading in a similar direction, which is budget-friendly for both sides and helps address urban congestion and pollution. The new business model should be encouraged."However, he added, many full-time drivers flocked to the service as a result of the low threshold for approval of driver applications, as well as big profits, which went against the essence of carpooling and added uncertainty to passenger safety."The key is to prevent full-time hitch drivers by limiting orders to two a day and restricting the routes, which might go against the ride-hailing platforms' goal of attracting more drivers and passengers," Xu said."But only when the platforms rule out the unqualified hitch drivers will the passenger be truly safe."

                Healthy traditions
            </a>
            <p>
                A look at many ways in which people observe Dragon Boat FestivalTaking a stroll around the city's Songhua River and Central Street is a significant part of the celebration of Duanwu Festival, or Dragon Boat Festival, for residents in Harbin, Heilongjiang province. The traditional Chinese holiday falls on Friday this year.Official data show that last year, the number of visitors to the Songhua River during the festival exceeded 3.23 million, or about one-third of the city's population.The tradition originated from the Manchu ethnic group. On the morning of Dragon Boat Festival, they hike in rural areas to refresh themselves and stay healthy.Fu Binghan, a 28-year-old civil servant from Harbin, says: "A sea of people surges forward on Central Street－both locals and tourists. I'm impressed to see someone dressed up like Qu Yuan and recite his poetry."Legend has it that the patriotic poet Qu Yuan drowned himself in the Miluo River during the Warring States Period (475-221 BC). This eventually gave rise to Dragon Boat Festival.To mark the event, Fu says, some locals set up camp in a nearby park or by a dam to have a picnic, and enjoy themselves with family or friends. There are also dragon boat races on the Songhua River."It's also an opportunity for family reunions. And young people should join local festivities to learn about culture," he says.Like him, Chinese of different ages across the country observe the festival in their own ways.Beijinger Han Ping prepares a month ahead, buying ingredients for her homemade zongzi (pyramid-shaped rice), which she gives as gifts to her friends. The 61-year-old was a guest host on a Beijing TV food program and often teaches others how to make zongzi.Beijing's traditional zongzi are filled with small red jujube stuffing, and people often eat them by dipping them in sugar.

                Unexpected turn in murder trial
            </a>
            <p>
                Defense admits client's responsibility, but enters plea of not guiltyEvery June for the past two years, memorial events have been held on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Students and community members gathered to show their compassion and, for some, their hope that Zhang Yingying would somehow still be alive.Last fall, the school dedicated a memorial garden to Zhang near the spot where she went missing on June 9, 2017, just two months after she arrived in the United States from China. A stone was placed there, engraved with Zhang's name in both English and Chinese.For nearly two years, defense lawyers have been preparing their case for Brendt Christensen, a former University of Illinois doctoral student who is charged with kidnapping, torturing and killing the 26-year-old scholar from China.On Wednesday, in the federal courtroom of the central Illinois city of Peoria, a 90-minute drive from the campus, in front of Zhang's family members, friends, reporters－and 12 jurors－it took defense attorney George Tesseff less than one minute to stun the courtroom by saying Christensen had indeed killed Zhang.However, the defense entered a plea of not guilty.The surprise admission was part of the defense attorney's strategy to focus on why his client's life should be spared when the trial resumes on Monday.The prosecution presented its case first: Christensen abducted Zhang off campus and raped, stabbed, choked and beat her with a baseball bat before decapitating her at his Urbana apartment.Admission of guiltThe start of the trial, Christensen's admission presented by his attorney and the gory details of how Zhang was killed have put the case back in the spotlight of massive media coverage both in the US and China. And it has had a ripple effect on overseas Chinese students and their families thousands of miles away.Of the more than 1 million foreign students enrolled at universities in the US, 350,755, or about 35 percent are Chinese, according to the Open Doors study by the Institute of International Education, a nonprofit organization supported by the US government."I first heard about this case when I was still in China two years ago, at the time I accepted an admission offer from UI. I was so shocked, and I remember that many newly admitted students were talking about the case in our WeChat group at that time," said Kevin Zhao, a doctoral student at the Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois."My parents were really worried when they heard a Chinese student had been kidnapped on campus, and they asked me to call them every day when I first got here."Zhao said he has been closely following the case since he came to the US in August 2017."As a Chinese international student at UI, I hope they (the jury) can bring her (Zhang) and her family justice," he said. "I was very angry when I heard that the suspect tortured Yingying before he killed her－he deserves the death penalty."Fran Tao had just graduated from UI when Zhang was first reported missing."I learned about the case from day one as the news started circulating on WeChat right away," she said. "All the details disclosed these days make me feel totally speechless. It's hard to verbally describe that sense of loss.Tao added that the defense lawyers' admission of Christensen's responsibility was "at least a sign that he knew he could not get away with it".The case has not only drawn attention from students at UI, but from Chinese students across the US."I heard about the case from the news," said Zhang Dian, a graduate student at Columbia University in New York. "I was very sad, but at the same time very shocked and angry."For many Chinese students in the US, the case has prompted discussions about campus security.In an interview in June 2017, just after Zhang Yingying was reported missing, Frank Ping, then president of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Chinese Students and Scholars Association, said he would further emphasize campus security issues during orientation for new students, and the organization was committed to raising safety awareness among students.Surveillance cameras were installed around the UI campus, which helped police determine that Zhang Yingying got into Christensen's car, and led to his arrest. But investigators acknowledged in 2017 that the cameras were outdated and provided only foggy images, prolonging the search for Zhang Yingying.School officials then pledged to purchase new security cameras to replace the older ones.In addition to the overall campus safety issue, students are concerned about the challenges faced by international students, especially when they first arrive in a foreign environment."Many of our international students and scholars face unique safety challenges while they are here on campus," wrote the school's police department on its website.Zhao, the doctoral student, said he thinks the case of Zhang Yingying serves as a very good wake-up call for many international students in the US about how to protect themselves, and how to use campus resources when they are in danger."If I were her (Zhang Yingying), I don't think I would jump into a stranger's car even if I was late for something," Zhao said. "But many international students just lack awareness of self-protection. I think after the case, many Chinese students started to pay attention to campus security information sessions and take down the campus police's number."He added that some of his friends have started sharing their iPhone locations with family and friends.

                'Spirited Away' back to tap into nostalgia of Chinese moviegoers
            </a>
            <p>
                Japanese animated film Spirited Away is becoming a huge box office success on the Chinese mainland 18 years after its original release in Japan, drawing in a legion of nostalgic moviegoers who once watched the film from non-official sources.The Hayao Miyazaki-directed film took 192.7 million yuan (about $28 million) after three days of screening, more than doubling the 90.7 million yuan of the runner-up Pixar and Disney's Toy Story 4, according to the China Movie Data Information Network. Both films debuted on the Chinese mainland last Friday.The Oscar-winning fantasy film tells the coming-of-age story of a young girl -- Chihiro -- who ventures into a spirit world to save her parents that have been turned into pigs.Many Chinese had already seen the film on DVDs or from online sources, but that did not stop them from returning to the cinema to pay their "overdue tickets," as alleged by many netizens.A manager of a Capital Cinema branch in Beijing observed that the films' patrons were mostly those in their 20s and 30s seeking to revive their childhood memories, and some also brought their children."The cinema screened this film over 20 times a day during the weekend to meet the huge demand. More than 90 percents of the seats were booked," the manager said.Zhao Xiaoyu, a resident from East China's Shandong province, said she rushed to the cinema after work on Friday and stayed in the seat even after the end song started to play."I was immediately transported back to the time when my college roommates and I sat before the only computer in the dormitory to watch the film 15 years ago. I remembered it took a long time for the movie to be downloaded because of the slow network," she said.Similar nostalgic reviews are abundant on China's cyberspace. On popular microblogging site Sina Weibo, the topic "Spirited Away" has been viewed 260 million times."I watched it by VCD at the age of six and have since wished to see it in the cinema," said a Weibo user."This movie accompanied me as I grow up. I will surely go to the theater to pay tribute to my youth," commented another netizen.

                Max makes the most of bad weather
            </a>
            <p>
                It was only a matter of time.After six top-10 finishes, including four top-fives, American Max McGreevy finally lifted his first trophy in China after being declared the 36-hole champion at the weather-affected Guangzhou Open.Although considered an unofficial victory, the prize money is very much real, with McGreevy's 288,000 yuan ($42,000) top prize moving him to first place on the order of merit with five events remaining.Stormy weather wreaked havoc with the scheduling all weekend, with officials first reducing the tournament to 54 holes, then chopping it to just two rounds as the threat of lightning loomed on Sunday.That turned out well for McGreevy, who backed an opening 7-under 62 with a 67 on Saturday to hold a two-shot overnight lead over fellow American Trevor Sluman, who still had four holes remaining in his second round.On Sunday morning, Sluman began with a bogey on his restart on No 6 but closed with a birdie on 9 to finish at 7-under.He didn't know it at the time, but that birdie would end up securing a solo second-place finish, one shot ahead of six players tied for third who all completed their rounds on Saturday.McGreevy said it wasn't the ideal way to earn his first PGA Tour-affiliated victory, but the 24-year old was still delighted to come out of a difficult week on top."I'm a little upset that we didn't get more rounds in, but it ended up how it is and I can't do anything about it. It's unfortunate, and I would have liked to play against all these guys. It would have been a really good test," he said."I was trying to get to the top after two rounds just in case something like this happened. It's lucky for me but stinks for everybody else. I've also been in their position, but I'm happy to finally be able to lift the trophy."McGreevy became the third player from the University of Oklahoma to win in China since 2016.Luke Kwon won the Qinhuangdao Championship earlier this year and Charlie Saxon, the tour's all-time money-list leader, won twice in 2016 and twice in 2018, and now plays on the Korn Ferry Tour.McGreevy and Saxon are currently roommates in Dallas, Texas, and McGreevy is hoping to return to the Korn Ferry Tour and play alongside Saxon next season."The goal is definitely to stay No 1 on the order of merit. I only had it for one week in Suzhou, but I've played good all year and hopefully I can keep it up and keep the No 1 spot for the rest of the year," said McGreevy, who moved atop the list after finishing third at the Nantong Championship."I'm excited to see what happens, but it's going to be challenging. These other guys are playing well, so hopefully I can hold another trophy at the end of the year."For Sluman and the other players chasing, it was frustrating not being able to compete for the title on Sunday.However, Sluman is looking at the positives－especially his second-place position on the money list, just over 100,000 yuan behind McGreevy."Max played great, so he deserves the win. The lowest man won the tournament, and 36 holes is what defined that this week," said Sluman."I'm pleased with a solo second, and it's my second one this year. All that helps towards the total prize money for the end of the year," added the 26-year-old from Rochester, New York, who finished ninth on last year's order of merit.

                College student's demand for higher living expenses sparks debate
            </a>
            <p>
                A recent online post about a female college student asking for 4,500 yuan ($630.16) for monthly living expenses has ignited public debate on how much a student really needs for college life, and most believed that demand is too much.According to the post, the new college student said her school is in a new top-tier city and complained her mother gave her too little, 2,000 yuan, as she had to eat in the school canteen through the end of the month.She explained the expenses included skin care products and new clothes, and that her roommates used good products too, but her mother refused to give her the 4,500 yuan.She said spending on after-school classes exceeded 4,000 yuan a month during high school, and her mother gave it without the least hesitation, while now her tuition and accommodation fees reached 30,000 yuan a year in college."Is 2,000 yuan enough for a student's life in college" soon became a hot topic on the list of top trending searches Wednesday since the new semester started this fall.Some internet users shared their living expenses, and except for some outliers, most ranged from 1,000 to 2,000 yuan a month. Some questioned whether the female student could even earn 4,500 yuan after graduation.Some internet users have pointed out that a student's spending should depend on the family's financial situation, and they should learn about how to manage their money.According to a survey from Chengdu-based Red Star News, students from colleges in the city, such as Sichuan University, Chengdu University and Sichuan Conservatory of Music, had expenses ranging from 1,500 to 2,000 yuan.Data from Wacai, an app focusing on financial advice, showed that students in 15 cities spent over 1,500 yuan a month on average, topped by Beijing at 2,400 yuan, Shanghai at 2,300 yuan, and Hangzhou at 2,250 yuan.

                Earthquake leaves 1 dead, 63 injured in Sichuan
            </a>
            <p>
                One person was killed and 63 others injured after a 5.4 magnitude earthquake jolted Weiyuan county, Neijiang, Sichuan province, at 6:42 am on Sunday, the Neijiang government information office said.Of the wounded, three were in critical condition as of 6 pm, the office said.Sixty-three townships and 10,883 people were affected by the earthquake. One hundred and thirty-two houses collapsed, 161 houses were severely damaged and another 4,880 were slightly damaged, it said.Soon after the temblor, Huang Ming, Party chief of the Ministry of Emergency Management, and vice-ministers Fu Jianhua and Zheng Guoguang held a video conference with leading officials of Sichuan's Department of Emergency Management, the Sichuan Provincial Firefighters' Brigade and Weiyuan County Firefighters' Brigade, who were on the scene to direct quake relief efforts.Ma Bo, Party chief of Neijiang, said the city had sent 4,781 people to assist in rescue operations, including militiamen, policemen, firefighters and medical workers.The provincial Department of Emergency Management had sent 4,000 cotton quilts, and the Neijiang municipal bureau of emergency management had dispatched 200 tents for the quake victims, he said.The epicenter of the earthquake was 12 kilometers from Weiyuan, 26 km from Neijiang and 141 km from Sichuan's provincial capital, Chengdu.A female student at Neijiang Normal University was awaked by the quake. As she fled her dormitory on the fifth floor, she fell and injured an ankle."A roommate spent several minutes carrying me to the first floor, and I was greatly moved," she said.A young woman in Weiyuan who said she usually took her cat outside at 7 am recalled it behaving abnormally just before the earthquake."About one hour before the quake, it jumped onto my bed and kept trampling on me as if it wanted me to wake up and take it out right then," she said.Trains leaving Chengdu for Chongqing, the provinces of Guangdong, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Zhejiang and Liaoning, and some parts of Sichuan were either delayed or canceled, China Railway Chengdu Group said.Some residents of Neijiang received an early warning through smartphones, television broadcasts and special receiving terminals 2 seconds before seismic waves from the quake reached the city."Thirty-six seconds before the waves reached Chengdu, residents there received the early warning," said Wu Liangyan, an information officer with Chengdu's Institute of Care-Life, which was founded after the devastating Wenchuan earthquake in 2008 with the aim of reducing casualties from quakes.A real-time system providing warnings seconds after a quake can save lives because the warnings are transmitted via radio waves traveling faster than seismic waves.Radio waves travel at 300,000 km per second, while seismic waves travel at 3 to 6 km/s. Therefore, people in nearby areas may escape danger before seismic waves arrive, said Chen Huizhong, a senior research fellow with the China Earthquake Administration's Institute of Geophysics.

                'Nerd' finds success and makes friends with Friends
            </a>
            <p>
                Hu Chen first traveled overseas at the age of 10, when he took second place in a national calligraphy competition and won a five-day cultural exchange to South Korea.Although Hu's mother was worried about him traveling overseas unaccompanied, he coped with the situation well. By using his limited, or rather broken, English, he managed to communicate with the locals and even bargained with street vendors to buy gifts for his parents.At high school, Hu learned of an opportunity for 13 Chinese students to visit the United States on a two-week exchange. Though initially hesitant, he applied for the program after his parents encouraged him, and was accepted.During the trip, he visited Microsoft's headquarters at Redmond, Washington, and gave a solo piano recital at the Washington State Capitol. The experience prompted him to pursue college studies in the US."To practice my English, I watched every episode of the sitcom Friends six times; the first with Chinese subtitles, the second and third with English subtitles and the rest without subtitles," the 29-year-old said.When he started college in the US in 2008, three Chinese roommates were assigned to his dorm to help him become acclimatized, but he asked the school to assign local students as his dorm mates."I came to the US to experience a different culture. I wanted to make friends with people from all over the world, not just hang out with Chinese students. If I had wanted that, I would have stayed in China."Hu pursued three majors at college-finance, accountancy and electrical engineering. He also found three part-time jobs: as a consultant at the school's office of continuing education; as a web analyst at a careers center; and as a security consultant at a computer service center.During his last two summers at college, he interned at Deloitte Consulting and Ernst & Young, both internationally recognized consultancies.He said some people in the US have a biased view of students from China, thinking they go abroad to study because their parents are rich."I realized that I not only represented myself, but Chinese students in general. I wanted to work hard and make a difference, so people would know the Chinese can achieve great things."In 2013, he started graduate studies in finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After successfully completing his course in 2014, he began working as a management consultant for Deloitte in New York.Two years later, he moved to Silicon Valley and began working at Google as a strategy and operations leader."I like to joke that I chose to study three majors in college because I am a nerd. From taking business courses to conducting engineering experiments, from leading student organizations to working at prestigious companies, I credit my accomplishments to my desire and willingness to take on challenges," he said.
