                Moi University students sing Chinese songs
            </p>
            <p>
                 To celebrate the 14th anniversary of the Confucius Institute, the Confucius Institute at Moi University in Kenya held the 2018 Confucius Institute Day and Chinese Singing Competition finals on Sept 29 in Eldoret. Moi teachers and students participated, resulting in a colorful and entertaining display of Chinese and Kenyan cultures.Zhuo Wu, chairman of the Kenya Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and Bao Ping, chairwoman of the Kenyan Chinese Art Troupes, attended the event as distinguished guests and judges.The Moi University choir performed the Kenyan folk song, Jumbo, as well as the Chinese folk song, Usuli Boat Song, incorporating Chinese characteristics into their performance.Fierce competition among the contestants meant the judges had to carefully deliberate the merits of each performance. Eventually, Ruth Kipchumba won the crown with a wonderful rendition of Moon Represents my Heart. It is not an exaggeration to say that her beautiful voice deeply touched those in the audience.Eddyglen Ligawa and Marie Sangona, with their charismatic performance of Just Meet You and Exists in My Song were the first runner up and second runner up, respectively. In addition, five second prize winners and eight third prize winners were selected.At the end of the event, the guests took to the stage to present awards and prizes to the winners. Huang Peixi, dean of the Confucius Institute at Moi University, delivered a moving speech to celebrate the successful completion of the event.

                Fashion merges Sino-Kenyan culture
            </a>
            <p>
                The ongoing China Trade week exhibition in Nairobi was temporarily interrupted yesterday when students from a local university converted part of the exhibition hall into a catwalk with students donning clothes from Donghua University, a public research institution of higher learning based in Shanghai, China.This was the first event of its kind held by Confucius institute at Moi University, which sees the Chinese and Kenyan institution collaborate closely in textile engineering and fashion design besides language exchanges.According to Huang Peixi, the associate professor and director of the Confucius institute, the event, with the help of the Kenya Chinese Chamber of Commerce, was a bicultural expression of arts and ideas. "This is a combination of education and trade. We are supporting the growing Sino-Kenyan trade relations and wanted to create awareness to both Chinese and Kenyan people on the benefits of people-to-people exchanges," he said.The colorful clothes were designed and produced in China. "We want to highlight the fashion ideas born from cultural exchanges between China and Africa," said Zheyu Han, the director from Shanghai Greater Donghua Fashion and Innovation Center. "There is heavy influence of African culture in the designs, a testament of what the students think on the growing China relations with the continent. I think this show is interesting."He is confident that there will be increased cooperation since China and Africa are keen not only on improving trade but also cultural exchanges. " Donghua University hosts students from more than 100 countries. I believe this program has increased awareness of various cultures while also increasing knowledge about Chinese culture. Kenyans are industrious people and we hope to see some of this work showcased during the Shanghai fashion week."On his part, Peter Simatei, the dean of school of arts and social sciences at Moi University and co-director of Confucius institute said the program is further bridging the two cultures. "We are using textile as our common language where we can communicate, borrow and teach each other. Beyond trade, this is an avenue of deepening our understanding and in a small way helping to build a bridge to improve Sino-African relations."He is buoyant that the fashion show has created awareness of the growing skill capacity locally and believes this will significantly contribute to building the moribund textile and apparel sub-sector.

                Kenyan university students begin China summer camp experience
            </a>
            <p>
                Kenyan university student Samuel Mwangi is anticipating learning fruitful knowledge that will help shape his future during his two-week summer camp experience to China."I hope this trip to China can sow the seed for me to become the Kenyan ambassador to China" someday, the fourth year undergraduate student at the Confucius Institute at Moi University said at the send-off ceremony held Saturday in Kenya's capital, Nairobi.Mwangi, who is majoring in communication and public relations, said that during the two-week trip, he wants to learn how China grew to be the world's second largest economy within 40 years.He believes Kenya can learn from China's successful economic growth since Kenya is facing great challenges in fulfilling its industrialization, just as China did before adopting the reform and opening up policy.His view was echoed by Han Jun, chairman of the East Africa Chinese Chamber of Commerce. He told the students that 40 years ago China's economic situation was not better than that of Kenya's. After a series of trial and experiments and even failure, China found its own way of rapid development. For the benefit of Kenya, the students should learn not only the Chinese language but also the Chinese culture, wisdom and ways of thinking, Han said.

                Realizing African dreams through FOCAC
            </a>
            <p>
                FOCAC: Deepening China-Africa cooperationThe establishment of the Forum on China Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in 2000 signified the starting point of a new era of China’s engagement with Africa. From this date, China launched unprecedented and unparalleled economic cooperation with Africa. The size and potential of China as a world power raised the level of expectations from African countries to dizzying heights.Since 2000, China-Africa relations have entered a new phase of development, with both sides trying to establish a new type of strategic partnership based on principles of mutual trust, economic win-win cooperation and cultural exchanges. These principles have become cornerstones for China-Africa cooperation.FOCAC is a forum held in China or an African country on an alternating basis. It was founded in October 2000 at the first ministerial conference in Beijing. Its objective is to strengthen Sino-African economic cooperation and trade relationships in order to establish a new international order that will better reflect the needs and mutual interests of China and Africa. The forum meets once every three years, with this year’s FOCAC Summit taking place in Beijing, China, from Sept 3-4.The theme of the Beijing FOCAC Summit is “China and Africa toward an even stronger community with a shared future through win-win cooperation”. Through FOCAC, China will align the Belt and Road Initiative started in 2013 to the African Agenda 2063, the UN 2030 Agenda and development strategies of respective African countries. The aim of the Belt and Road Initiative is to establish an elaborate trade and infrastructure network that will connect Asia with African countries. In the case of Kenya, China is expected to align its Belt and Road Initiative to the country’s Vision 2030.In this connection, African leaders participating in the two-day summit should seize this golden opportunity to deepen and strengthen China-Africa cooperation in order to spur development in their own respective countries. The summit presents an opportunity to alleviate poverty afflicting many people in many African nations and to attract foreign direct investments from Chinese transnational corporations.African leaders should forge a united front at the summit and push for a common China policy to realize the dreams of the African people envisioned in the African Agenda 2063. African leaders should also review the successes of the sixth FOCAC Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2015. The major objective of this summit was to promote industrialization and agricultural modernization in Africa.Trade and strategic partnershipsConsidering recent major developments in the global arena, it is high time for African leaders to review cooperation with their three strategic partners: China, the European Union and the United States.Today, two-way trade between Africa and the EU exceeds $300 billion, but the EU has an uncertain future. Some observers view the EU as a leaderless, shrinking and almost burnt-out power. Efforts by various European leaders to make the EU a formidable global power have not yielded much fruit.For a long time, the US has stood out as the leading trading and investment partner in Africa. However, at present, two-way trade has reduced considerably from $100 billion in 2008 to $39 billion in 2017. This could signal that the US is a spent force, a declining power saddled with pre-World War I nationalist policies that are old-fashioned and out of step with current global trends of fair, ethical and free trade, among others. It is also doubtful whether the current Trump administration has time for Africa.Given the gloomy forecasts for the future of the US and the EU, the only African path left for realizing its Agenda 2063 is through Beijing. Many African nations have now adopted a “look East” policy, eager to learn from China’s miracle of economic success and yearning for closer cooperation with the country to speed up their development.China is now regarded as the real engine or driver of the global economy. It is an upcoming modern superpower which respects and supports the other countries it cooperates with (including those in Africa), upholds international law, and also honors multilateral agreements. It has clear global policies of engagement which ensure the sharing of a common future.China has emerged from being a relatively minor player in African economies about a decade or so ago to becoming one of the principal sources for trade and investment. Today, China’s role in supporting African development predates official pronouncements for the Belt and Road initiative, which now provides a galvanizing framework for the Chinese government and corporate leaders and their counterparts to formulate engagements.In many ways China and Africa are well-suited partners. This is because much of Africa is cash-hungry, infrastructure-deficient and resource-rich. On the other hand, China seeks greater investment opportunities for its burgeoning private sector, and also needs a lot of raw materials for the expanding manufacturing sector. This combination of respective assets and liabilities has fostered a strong China-Africa interdependency, as each party uses the other to reconcile its own balance sheet.As far as Kenya is concerned, a new era of cooperation with China has begun in earnest. China plans to make joint efforts with Kenya to strengthen the strategic connection of the BRI with Kenya's Vision 2030 and the Big Four Agenda. China will work closely with the Kenyan people in order to accelerate Kenya's rapid and high-quality development and initiate a golden era for China-Kenya cooperation. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 55 years ago, China and Kenya have cooperated to complete more than 100 major projects, including the standard gauge railway (SGR) and the Moi International Sports Centre. Currently, China is Kenya's largest trading partner, investor and contractor. China-Kenya cooperation brings along tangible benefits to the people of both countries, and promotes the economic and social development of Kenya. This is a result of solid work the two countries have accomplished together. The Mombasa-Nairobi SGR is the best-known project between the two countries. Financed by the Chinese EXIM Bank and constructed by a Chinese State-owned enterprise, the SGR project has created 46,000 local jobs and cut the transport cost between Mombasa and Nairobi by 40 percent.China’s role in the international community, especially in trade and investment, is also rising to a level commensurate with its increasing economic strength as the world’s second-largest economy. It is predicted that, in the coming decade or so, China may overtake the United States as the world’s leading economy. This growing global influence of China may serve as a tremendous source of inspiration for African countries. Africa is likely to gain immensely from the Chinese experience of unparalleled development achieved in the last two or so decades.Still, for many African countries, China has already become the leading trading partner in terms of both import and export business. In fact, China has surpassed the US as the single-largest trading partner of Africa.Food securityThe Beijing FOCAC Summit will have to address a wide range of issues, but some are more critical than others. Agriculture and food security should be at the forefront of the deliberations in Beijing. A number of African countries – such as Cameroon, Senegal, Guinea, Niger and Zimbabwe -- have in recent times experienced social unrest due to increasing prices or shortages of food items, worsened by the global financial crisis. To avoid “food riots” in the future, it is crucial today to mobilize resources toward food security in African countries. Enhancing food security is already part of Kenya’s Big Four Agenda, and there is a need to come up with a clear agricultural policy emphasizing food security and value addition. This where China should come in to assist Africa by drawing on its long experience in agricultural transformation to speed up the construction of agricultural demonstration centers and ensure an effective transfer of technology in this important sector in Africa.Lessons learnedAfrican leaders attending the Beijing FOCAC Summit this September should learn a lesson or two from China’s socioeconomic achievement of lifting 660 million citizens out of poverty. On average, China alleviates poverty at a rate of 12 million citizens annually. Within the next few years, the country is likely to alleviate poverty for all its 1.3 billion people, which will be a great feat in living memory.At the Beijing summit, African leaders should ask certain questions: Can’t we develop without outside interference? Can’t we do away with the Western model of development? Can we look elsewhere for an alternative model of development? The late Chairman Mao Zedong once said, “There is no one path to development. Let a thousand flowers bloom.” China-Africa cooperation, if well-nurtured, could be one of the many paths to sustainable development for our continent.China, as the leading funder for various development projects in Africa, should scale up its investments and financing to assist the continent in building its capacity to achieve food security, increase value addition of raw materials, improve infrastructure, strengthen environmental responsibility and raise the standard of living for the people of Africa. This, in my view, should be the spirit of the Beijing FOCAC Summit.The author is an associate professor in the Department of Geography andEnvironmental Studies at the University of Nairobi, and can be reached ateirandu@yahoo.com.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                African runners in it for the long run
            </a>
            <p>
                Athletes from continent making their mark in country as part of increasing marathonsSome 30,000 athletes took part in the Beijing Marathon on Sunday, with the starter's pistol reverberating against blue skies in Tian'anmen Square at 7:30 am.Once again, African runners outperformed the pack during the 42-kilometer course, and the growing number of distance events in China is increasingly becoming a launchpad for the careers of thousands of runners from the continent.Marathons offer opportunities for up-and-coming athletes to build their profiles and transform their lives back home.Distance events in China have become more competitive globally, and as a result, races in China have become game-changers.Elias Makori, a sports journalist in Kenya with a quarter century of experience, said quality races, big prize money and blossoming Sino-African relations have made China a great destination for African athletes."In particular, the Xiamen (Fujian province), Beijing and Shanghai marathons, and the Yangzhou Jianzhen Half Marathon (Jiangsu province), have seen Kenyans and Ethiopians flocking to these places. These races offer great quality, generous prize money and also pay winners promptly," he said.China's marathon industry grew by 20 percent last year, reaching a value of about $20 billion, according to the China Athletics Association. More than 1,100 distance events were held in the country in 2017, of which 256 were hosted or co-hosted by the sport's governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations.The total number of participants in these events reached 4.98 million.There are eight IAAF Gold Label races on the Chinese mainland, as well as three Silver Label and four Bronze Label races.Over the past 18 years, there has been a rise in the number of African runners taking part in events in China.Last year saw a Moroccan, Salah Eddine Bounasr, 26, clinch victory in the Beijing Marathon－which has been staged for 37 years－followed by an Ethiopian and a Kenyan. Bounasr won the Guangzhou Marathon in Guangdong province the previous year. The Beijing event, an IAAF Gold Label Road Race, saw an Ethiopian, Melesech Tsegaye Beyene, extend the nation's winning streak in the women's race to four years.

            </a>
            <p>
                The first Kenya-Asia-Pacific cultural event was successfully held Saturday in Nairobi.The colorful event, which drew hundreds of locals, saw booths showcasing cultural products from Kenya, Pakistan, India, Republic of Korea, China and the Philippines, among other countries, in an upscale shopping mall located in the city suburbs. Event organizers included the Kenya Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Huawei Technologies and Guangdong Business Association."This is an ideal platform to break through language and cultural barriers," said Li Xuhang, the minister counsellor of the Chinese embassy in Kenya. "Asia has a very rich culture. China's civilization alone dates back 5,000 years ago, where we developed folk songs, dances, writing and clothing, and that shows the strength of the Chinese people and the spirit of Chinese culture. We are excited to participate in this event, where we can candidly interact with our Kenyan brothers."

                <!--p.content_1   {  font-size:10pt;color:blue;}-->Le ciel est la limiteAdepte de la vie en altitude, un ascensionniste escalade une montagne à Enshi, dans la province de l’Hubei. [Yang Shunpi/for China Daily]Les trompe-faims avalent 256 milliards d’euros en ChineLa production annuelle du secteur chinois des aliments à grignoter dépasse 2 billions de yuan (256 milliards d’euros), selon le ministère du commerce. Ce secteur est le plus prometteur dans le domaine en évolution rapide des biens de consommation. En valeur, sa production brute devrait être de 3 billions de yuan l’an prochain. Les spécialistes expliquent que les gens disposent aujourd’hui de plus de choix et de filières pour acheter des en-cas grâce au succès des plateformes de commerce électronique.Des étudiants bien avec leurs parentsEnviron 96% des étudiants chinois ont des relations excellentes ou bonnes avec leurs parents, selon une étude publiée par le journal China Youth Daily le 4 juin. Dans le cadre de l’enquête effectuée par la China University Media Alliance, 561 répondants dans plus d’une centaine d’universités avaient été interrogés sur leurs rapports avec leurs parents. Au lieu du stéréotype qui les voit rebelles ou peu intéressés à communiquer avec les parents, les étudiants nés après 1995 apprécient les liens familiaux et sont plus disposés à exprimer leur amour pour leurs parents, selon le journal.Premier lancement marin d’une fuséeLa Chine a procédé le 5 juin à son premier lancement dans l’espace à partir de ses eaux territoriales en mer Jaune, ouvrant ainsi un nouveau chapitre de son industrie spatiale. Une fusée porteuse à propergol solide s’est élancée d’une plateforme de lancement mobile, un appareil submersible modifié, au large de la province du Shandong, pour mettre en orbite sept satellites à 600 kilomètres au-dessus de la Terre. Par rapport aux lancements terrestres conventionnels, une mission en mer présente moins de risques de perturbations pour les zones de forte densité le long de la trajectoire de la fusée.4 600 km de lignes de métroLe réseau ferroviaire souterrain de la Chine s’est accru de manière importante ces dernières décennies, totalisant près de 4 600 kilomètres réalisés depuis l’ouverture de la première ligne de métro du pays en 1969 à Pékin, indique le 21st Century Business Herald. Trente-trois villes chinoises ont désormais un métro, 21 d’entre elles étant entrées dans l’ère du transport en commun ferroviaire au cours des 10 dernières années. Avec 669 km, Shanghai est en tête de liste, suivie de Pékin (617 km) et de Guangzhou (473 km).Des micro-puces pour tous les chiensShenzhen, dans la province du Guangdong, prévoit de commencer cette année à placer des micro-puces sur tous les chiens, selon le bureau de l’administration urbaine et du maintien de l’ordre de la ville. À peu près de la taille d’un grain de riz, la micro-puce est insérée sous la peau du chien exactement entre les deux épaules, précise Feng Zengjun, directeur adjoint du bureau. « Les renseignements élémentaires sur chaque animal peuvent être scannés, ce qui permet d’identifier rapidement les chiens perdus », explique-t-il. La ville prévoit de réduire le nombre de chiens errants en appliquant le plan d’adoption Trap-Neuter au cours des trois prochaines années.Les pays conquis par le paiement mobilePrès de 500 millions de personnes en Chine utiliseront cette année leur téléphone pour régler leurs consommations dans les magasins, les cafés et les restaurants, selon le cabinet Statista Digital Market Outlook, ce qui équivaut à un taux de pénétration moyen de 35%, le plus élevé au monde. L’Inde se classe deuxième avec un taux de pénétration de 29,5%, suivie de l’Indonésie (15,9%) et d’Israël (14,5%). Cependant, la valeur annuelle globale des transactions par client en Chine est inférieure à ce qu’elle est aux États-Unis, en Grande-Bretagne et en France.Vol record pour une pilote octogénaireUne femme de 82 ans a établi un nouveau record dans l’industrie de l’aviation chinoise en pilotant son petit avion au-dessus de Pékin pendant 40 minutes ce mois-ci. Accompagnée d’un moniteur, Miao Xiaohong a contrôlé l’appareil, un Tecnam P2010, au décollage et a effectué plusieurs virages, montées en flèche et piqués avant d’atterrir en toute sécurité. À sa descente, Mme Miao, qui est en retraite depuis 30 ans, a dit qu’elle se sentait en pleine forme et que son battement de cœur était normal.Le codage informatique plébiscitéL’initiation au codage informatique dans le cadre d’une formation extrascolaire connaît un grand succès auprès des parents désireux de guider l’avenir de leurs enfants. Depuis 2015, le gouvernement chinois publie des directives invitant les écoles à se lancer dans des expériences éducatives dans les domaines de la science, de la technologie, de l’ingénierie, des arts et des mathématiques, y compris le codage informatique. Un plan de développement de l’intelligence artificielle communiqué par le Conseil des affaires de l’État a rendu obligatoires les cours de codage dans les cycles primaire et secondaire.Téléphonie : palmarès des premiers fabricantsLe cabinet d’études de marché IDC a publié son tout dernier classement des fournisseurs de téléphones intelligents basé sur leur part de marché au premier trimestre. Samsung conserve la première place avec une part de 23,1%, suivi de Huawei avec 19%. Parmi les six premiers, quatre sont chinois – Huawei, Xiaomi, Vivo et Oppo.Les villes préférées des milliardairesHong Kong, Beijing, Shenzhen and Hangzhou figurent parmi les 15 premières villes comptant le plus grand nombre de milliardaires au monde, nous apprend la sixième édition du rapport Wealth-X’s Billionaire Census. New York vient en tête avec 105 milliardaires l’an dernier. La Chine en comptait 285, dont la fortune totale atteignait 996 milliards de dollars (882 milliards d’euros) l’an dernier, tandis qu’aux États-Unis, on en dénombrait 705, chiffre le plus élevé dans le monde, représentant une valeur nette cumulée de plus de 3 billions de dollars.
