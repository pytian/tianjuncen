                A short video clip from the Fengshen Trilogy at a Beijing International Film Festival (BIFF) promotional event in Toronto won a round of applause at the Bell Lightbox of the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).Du Yang, vice president of Beijing Culture, said she was proud to present the film project at TIFF, one of the world's top film festivals."With a total investment of over 3 billion yuan, we have assembled the world's top-notch teams to develop this project, aiming to initiate the Chinese mythology film and present China's time-honored literary epic to the world," Du said.Cui Yan, deputy executive director of BIFF, said it has made great strides in the past nine years and forged cooperation with major film festivals like TIFF."We aim to further promote Chinese film industries and strengthen the international cooperation, and build a big communication platform for films in Asia," Cui said.As a "going abroad" program, BIFF is just one of the strategic approaches for Chinese films going global.The filmmakers from North America shared their insights on the implications for the globalization of China's growing movie industry, as well as how Chinese film could integrate its culture internationally.Cameron Hood, a senior story artist, director and producer at Cameron Hood Studios, told China Daily that he loves writing stories, specifically for the world market."Like Minions, I make a lot of money in China, and I am looking for Chinese partners to see what the next big idea for the China market could be as well as for the rest of the world," he said.Hood has visited China and worked with studios in Wu Xi, and brought Western style animation to Chinese partners."We come up with lots of collaboration, because the audiences in China are going so fast. When I did master class in China … the students were very professional, and they keep learning and sharing," he added.Liz Taylor, the president of Wild Maple Films, said she is learning the Chinese language and hoping to shoot pictures and co-produce in China."I really want to collaborate with China because this is the country I really love ... the culture and the people," Taylor said.Raymond Massey of Massey Productions, who co-produced the film Iron Road with China in 2007, said the company is interested in telling Chinese stories around the world."I go to China frequently, and I am excited by China," said Massey. "I have been working with China projects every year since producing of Iron Road. China has a special place in my heart."Unlike here in North America, investors can be only behind the producers who make the movie, but Chinese film investors sometimes drive the producers, and they always ask what day they could make profits," he said.Another hiccup is the language, because Chinese movies need English subtitles in the Western market, which can limit the promotion and distribution of films. "And most of the Western audiences here only know a few Chinese filmmakers, such as Zhang Yimo, Feng Xiaogang, Jackie Chan," Massey added.

                    Creating a future for the homes of Beijing's past

                The Neighborhood Warming Initiatives 2019, part of Beijing Design Week, is to focus on the renovation of hutong (alleyway lined with traditional residences in Beijing) and quadrangle courtyards and residents' participation in building management. The event, between Sept 10-20, aims to preserve the local housing in historical and cultural blocks in a way that also satisfies modern lifestyle demands, its organizers said. They added it comprises nearly 100 activities such as exhibitions and forums. The Master Zeng's Time Photo Studio invited 10 couples born in 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded, and took wedding photos for them. The studio activity also showcased designers' work for improving hutong residents' life quality and their emotional connections. The reception room of Baitasi Block co-hosted an activity in cooperation with Beijing Pagoda Light International Youth Hostel, inviting visitors and local residents to interact by preparing Beijing and Western food. The interaction activity can help tourists learn about culture and life in Beijing, an internationally acclaimed tourist destination, and promote neighborly relations in the new era, the organizers said. The Beijing Green Corridors 2020 exhibitions have been held four times since 2016. This year's theme is landscape inside and outside Beijing. The 2019 exhibitions displayed design results of the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway green landscape; the historical Nanluoguxiang neighborhood, a busy south-north commercial area hidden among hutong; and the ancient Changxindian town in Beijing's Fengtai district. Hutong is a cultural symbol of Beijing. There was an exhibition showing the daily life of Bing Yi, a modern artist, in hutong in Dongcheng district. By displaying how life in hutong brought vitality to her life and work, the exhibition aimed to introduce visitors to a new hutong lifestyle and to increase the use and social value of preserved residential blocks. The initiatives are held in different venues in the Baitasi historical and cultural conservation area located in Xicheng district. They can be dated back to the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). The area is home to a white pagoda in Miaoying Temple built in the Yuan Dynasty; a former residence of late renowned writer Lu Xun; a market selling flowers, birds, fish and insects; and quadrangle courtyards in a combination of Chinese and Western architectural art. The area is in an old neighborhood and one of the few existing residential areas featuring low buildings in the ancient capital. It is seeking a new path for urban improvement and community revitalization, local people said. The initiatives are part of the Baitasi Remade Plan to realize Beijing's overall plan for 2016-35. The Baitasi plan aims to explore ways to improve the public environment and help regional revitalization. Its purpose is to maintain the residential role of hutong and traditional quadrangle courtyards. Meanwhile, it is to create new cultural blocks featuring elements such as design, cultural creativity and exhibitions. (China Daily 09/20/2019 page19)
