                Garbage sorting products see big online sales
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                The sales volume of domestic trashcans totaled 3 million on e-commerce portal Taobao in the past month — before Shanghai's regulations on household garbage sorting and recycling took effect on Monday.The sales surge hit its peak from June 24 through 30, when the sales of domestic trashcans increased 50 percent year-on-year, the e-commerce platform announced on Monday."Online shops that delivered products from within Shanghai were the most sought after, of which the sales volume was triple that of the same period last year. It was probably because Shanghai residents aimed to receive the products before the regulations took effect," a news release from Taobao read.More than 25,000 of a trashcan that collects wet and dry garbage separately were sold on a Taobao store that sells imported household equipment from Japan in June. Owing to high demand, the store allowed only one unit per shopper ID.Teaching tools on the subject of garbage sorting were also popular in the past month. Searches made by consumers for small plastic trashcans mimicking the appearance of the four categories of trashcans jumped more than 17 times compared to the previous month.Aiming for more efficient garbage disposal, Shanghai started to officially implement its regulation on domestic waste management on Monday, making garbage sorting compulsory. Individuals and units shall shoulder responsibilities to classify garbage according to the four waste categories: recyclable, hazardous, wet and dry.

                    End of an era for artsy Philippine 'jeepney' bus
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                MANILA－Bernardo de la Cruz casts his eyes around the nearly silent workshop where he used to toil overtime hand-painting custom decor on jeepneys, the singularly Philippine minibuses facing the scrap heap.These rolling art galleries adorned with images of everything from Batman to babies, as well as disco lights and chrome wheels, have for decades provided cheap transport for millions.But pollution and safety concerns have led to a modernization program, with jeepneys 15 years or older to be taken off the streets by 2020."This is an act of treachery against fellow Filipinos," said de la Cruz. "This is a uniquely Filipino product. We were born with it."When he began 45 years ago, there were hundreds of artists giving the vehicles their famously boisterous paint jobs. Now there are estimated to be fewer than a dozen left.He has seen orders decline from a high of up to 80 a month in the 1980s to just one or two now.His canvas is being replaced by eco-jeepneys, powered by electricity or lower-polluting diesel motors.Riders of old jeepneys currently have to climb in through a hatch in the rear, cramming into the benches inside with no respite from the heat and roadside pollution.On borrowed timeThe jeepney's successor is being billed as a big improvement.It has doors, individual seats, air conditioning, and enough height to stand up.But it will be mass-produced and look just like a public bus.Skipping over the jeepney's bespoke production process in small workshops means a loss of the individual style and flair that made them global symbols of the Philippines."It's one of the most genuine forms of modern folk art that we have," said Bernie Sim, a Manila-based graphic designer and co-author of a 2014 book on jeepney art.French fashion designer Christian Louboutin launched a jeepney-themed handbag collection last year, while Swedish furniture giant Ikea painted a jeepney in its signature blue and yellow to announce plans to open a Philippine store.But the vehicles, which were first made from leftover US jeeps after World War II, have been on borrowed time for years.Jeepneys are highly polluting, and the Philippines is desperate to improve air quality in its traffic-clogged cities.What's more, their drivers usually ignore traffic rules and the vehicles have few safety features.On top of that, Manila ushered in internet-based ride-sharing services in 2014, and three years later, President Rodrigo Duterte said the jeepney must evolve or disappear.'I cry quietly'"They have all but stopped making jeepneys," said 52-year-old jeepney artist Vic Capuno, based in San Pablo town south of Manila.As a result he and a colleague at Armak Motors now paint just three of four jeepneys a month.De la Cruz worked on nine in the last year. He's the only painter left at Manila's Sarao Motors, once the country's biggest producer.Two of his siblings were also jeepney artists, but they died from diseases he believes were caused by years inhaling fumes from the paint.Yet he is still passionate about the vehicle's importance in Philippine history."When the jeepney disappears a piece of Filipino culture will also die," de la Cruz warned.His jeepney designs, still seen on the streets for now, chronicle the rapidly changing landscape of his home－Las Pinas－from a farming and salt-making backwater into a highly urbanized area. "It's a pleasing sight," he said.AGENCE FRANCE - PRESSE

                    Apple, in rare reversal, pulls plug on wireless charging mat
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Apple Inc on Friday said it is canceling the AirPower wireless charging mat that the company announced in 2017 on the same day as its iPhone X, a rare public retreat for the gadget maker known for splashy product launches.The mat was intended to wirelessly charge up to three Apple products at once, such as an iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods wireless headphones.While wireless charging has spread through the gadget industry, charging three devices at once with higher wattage "fast charging" has proved challenging. Furniture seller Ikea, for example, sells a $60 matt that can handle three phones but it only features slower 5-watt charging.In a statement, Apple said that it had concluded that its AirPower mat "will not achieve our high standards.""We apologize to those customers who were looking forward to this launch," Dan Riccio, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering, said in the statement. "We continue to believe that the future is wireless and are committed to push the wireless experience forward."The announcement was a rare move for Apple, known in the electronics industry for keeping tight wraps on product plans until it publicly launches them at splashy events in Silicon Valley. The early announcement of AirPower, along with a wirelessly charged version of its AirPods headphones, was a break in that tradition. Apple released the updated AirPods last week, heightening speculation that the accompanying charging mat would come soon.Daring Fireball, a website that covers Apple news, previously reported that Apple engineers had issues with devices overheating on the AirPower pad. Apple declined to comment beyond its statement on the project.Apple offered wireless charging in the iPhone in 2017, after many of its rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd had offered the feature for several years. While rumors circulated that Apple might create its own unique wireless charging technology, the company instead chose to use a system that works with Qi, an open industry standard already in use by Samsung and others.Apple shares did not move on the news, and shares of NXP Semiconductors and STMicroelectronics, two major suppliers of chips used in Qi systems, appeared to be unaffected also.Reuters

                A road show encouraging Swedish enterprises to participate in the second China International Import Expo (CIIE) was held in Swedish capital, Stockholm, on Thursday.The Chinese delegation at the event, led by Wang Bingnan, Vice-Minister of Commerce, expressed a warm welcome to around 100 representatives from Swedish corporations, inviting them to CIIE, scheduled for November in Shanghai.China's determination to import high-quality products offers an opportunity to Swedish enterprises to expand to China, said Gui Congyou, Chinese ambassador to Sweden.A total of 15 Swedish enterprises took part in the first CIIE last November, covering six exhibition areas and showcasing Swedish innovation.Partnerships worth $369 million were signed between Chinese and Swedish enterprises during the event.Marcus Burmester, marketing director with a Swedish food enterprise, said the first CIIE provided an excellent platform for his company to promote their products, share useful information and find potential partners.To date nine Swedish enterprises, including Volvo, IKEA, medical company Elekta, and water purification company Bluewater, have signed up for the second CIIE.Sino-Sweden bilateral trade increased 15 percent in 2018, while Sweden's exports to China have grown steadily over the past five years, accounting for 5 percent of its total export volume, Wang said.Tang Xiaofan in Shanghai contributed to this story.

                    CIIE to attract more European companies
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                Greater exposure, marketing gains from first expo sparking renewed interest, say officialsEuropean companies are showing greater interest than before in being a part of the second edition of the China International Import Expo in Shanghai later this year, judging by the record participation of companies at the roadshows in major cities since early this month.Five new companies from Finland expressed their keenness to be part of the ambitious expo during the roadshow in Helsinki, while cleaning solutions provider Elozo Oy has already confirmed its presence for the third CIIE next year. Finnish air purifier maker Air0 is participating in the event for a second time this year, according to the company's co-founder Valle Kulmala.Kulmala said that Air0 gained several end users and partners after it participated in the inaugural edition of the show last year. More importantly, the event helped the Finnish firm to gain a better perception of the industry and market opportunities, something that other companies from Finland should also seize through participation at the CIIE.Jusa Susia, head of the East Asia region at Business Finland, said that several Finnish companies will make their presence felt at the second CIIE to demonstrate their strengths in telecommunications, clean energy and biotechnology. The European nation will also seek cooperation with Chinese companies and institutions regarding winter sports and early childhood education.Wang Bingnan, vice-minister of commerce, said during the roadshow that China was Finland's largest trade partner in Asia for 15 consecutive years. Finnish companies should continue to explore opportunities in the Chinese market, which is estimated to import over $30 trillion worth of products and $10 billion worth of services in the next 15 years.During the roadshow in Sweden on April 11, natural food supplier Plantamed AB signed an agreement for the second CIIE. Before that, eight other Swedish companies signed up for the exhibition, led by big names such as Volvo and Ikea.A total of 15 Swedish companies attended the first CIIE last year, covering intelligent and high-end equipment, automobiles, consumer electronics and home appliances, food and agricultural products, medical equipment and healthcare as well as services trade. Swedish companies also signed cooperation agreements totaling $369 million during the event.Marcus Burmester, marketing director of the Swedish food company Lantmannen, said that they were overwhelmed by the large number of visitors to the CIIE last year. It was an ideal gateway to launch new products, share market information and look for potential business partners, he said.Gui Congyou, China's ambassador to Sweden, said that the Chinese government will increase imports of high-end products, and urged companies from Sweden to use the expo to further expand their market share.The Enterprise Pavilion for the second CIIE will be expanded to 300,000 square meters this year, up from the 270,000 sq m for the first exhibition, according to Liu Fuxue, deputy director of the CIIE bureau. Meanwhile, an outdoor experience zone will be added, featuring activities such as unmanned driving and baking.By April 2, more than 1,800 companies from 77 countries and regions had sent in applications for the second CIIE, and 50 percent of them have inked contracts with the CIIE bureau. Up to 180 Fortune 500 companies have also signed contracts for the show, according to the latest data from the Ministry of Commerce.

                    90% of world's cities not provide adequate housing: WEF report
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                GENEVA - A new report by the World Economic Forum (WEF) said Thursday that 90 percent of cities worldwide do not provide affordable or adequate housing for their citizens."The world must act now to address the crisis in affordable housing," said the WEF in its report released Thursday titled Making Affordable Housing a Reality in Cities.The report says that the cost of housing, as well as location, prohibits people from meeting other basic living costs, threatening their employment and fundamental human rights."In Africa, more than half of the population live in sub-standard conditions," said the report.The critical challenges to affordable housing include land acquisitions, zoning, and regulations that affect land use, funding mechanisms, and design and construction costs, says the report.Across the world, millennials, the group of people who came to adulthood at the turn of the 21st century, spend more on housing than previous generations and have a lower quality of life.By 2050, more than 30 percent of the urban population around the world, about 2.5 billion people, will live in sub-standard housing or be financially stretched by housing costs."A world in which only a few can afford housing is not sustainable," said Alice Charles, who heads the WEF's Cities, Urban Development and Urban Services.She said the report explores both supply and demand dynamics affecting affordability and it guides decision-makers toward strategic interventions and long-term reforms.Such reforms can reduce dependence on government support systems and incentivize more commercially viable affordable housing through policies that address systemic gaps in the housing value chain.The key challenges to affordable housing include land acquisitions, zoning, and regulations that affect land use, funding mechanisms, and design and construction costs.Employers such as Facebook and Google in the US, IKEA in Reykjavik, Iceland; Lego in Billund, Denmark; Samsung in Seoul and Suwon; and Alibaba in Hangzhou, China, are investing in housing developments for employees.Ensuring affordable housing is critical to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11, which aims to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, said the WEF.

                    Ikea to move its only US factory to Europe: report
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - Swedish furniture company Ikea will close its only manufacturing site in the United States in December and move it to Europe to reduce costs, US media reported Tuesday.According to CNN, Ikea will end production at its plant in Danville, Virginia. The facility opened in 2008 and produces wooden shelves and storage units, and the shutdown will cut about 300 jobs."We made every effort to improve and maintain the competitiveness of this plant, but unfortunately the right cost conditions are not in place to continue production in Danville, Va., for the long-term," plant manager Bert Eades was quoted as saying in a statement.The company cited the high material cost there as a significant factor leading to the location shift.Tim Kaine, US senator from Virginia, toured the Danville site in April 2018, when he tweeted that workers there were worried about the impact of additional tariffs the US administration levied on some imports."They're ok for now, but because they import a lot of raw materials, they're concerned about what's to come," he said. "We have to stop this rash policy before it hurts even more US businesses and workers.""Ikea said Tuesday the decision to close the plant was not related to tariffs," CNN said in its report. "It said that particle board used at the Danville plant is purchased from US suppliers."Ikea runs production facilities in nine countries and employs some 20,000 workers, according to CNN. Globally, the company hires roughly 200,000 people.Ikea said last year it would lay off 7,500 employees in a restructuring effort that it said would eventually create 11,500 jobs.

                    Ikea planning to attract more young buyers throughout China

                Ikea is working to connect better with young consumers in China by becoming nimbler and more digitalized. The Swedish company that sells modern Scandinavian-design ready-to-assemble furniture, kitchen appliances and home accessories has thrived for more than two decades in China on its business model that focused on large brick-and-mortar shopping centers. People paid about 100 million visits per year to the company's Chinese stores.Ikea's fiscal report of 2018 showed that revenue in China was 14.6 billion yuan ($2.1 billion), a growth of 9.3 percent year-on-year. However, the growth rate was 4.7 percentage points lower than that in fiscal year 2017 and 10 percentage points less than that in 2016.Ikea China will make its largest-ever yearly investment - 10 billion yuan - in fiscal year 2020, with more to come in the next two years, aiming to attract younger people in first-tier and smaller cities to its physical stores and digital sites, according to top executives of the company.Ikea China will recruit over 3,000 new employees in the new fiscal year. The company now employs 14,000 people in the country.Last October, Ikea China launched its website and delivery services and also smaller-sized stores at places where urban dwellers love to meet.Anna Pawlak-Kuliga, CEO and president of Ikea China, said the plan has been adjusted based on the dynamics in the local market. "The home furnishings market in China is now in a phase of stable growth. In addition, urbanization, digitalization and people's increasing disposable income are changing the way people live and consume."That is why we have a full confidence in the market and strongly believe that the new strategy will help us to create a better everyday life for even more of the many people in China." Many innovations and initiatives that have been created in China are expected to be expanded to Ikea's operations globally, she said.To offer easier consuming experience both online and offline, Ikea will upgrade its existing stores, with Ikea Shanghai Xuhui store as the company's first "store of tomorrow "in the world.The company is accelerating its expansion in China by opening four new stores in the next four months and expanding the coverage of e-commerce to make Ikea's products and home furnishing knowledge accessible for more Chinese consumers.Ikea will also create more smaller scale "meeting places" close to consumers, with the first small-size store, at 8,500 square meters, to be opened in Shanghai before Chinese New Year 2020.IKEA also plans to provide a good shopping experience through the development of digitalization, including providing digital tools offline to simplify shopping and an equally inspiring and convenient shopping experience online.The online and offline coverage is expected to help expand Ikea's consumer reach to about 1 billion people, said Francois Brenti, director of expansion at Ikea China. Thanks to the digital and physical coverage, he said the company has expanded to 227 cities and regions, from first-tier to third-tier and even lower-tier cities.To achieve this goal, Ikea Digital Hub China was established in July, as a brand-new business unit with 250 digital experts to enable the digital capabilities across Ikea.Ikea will also launch full-house design services, starting with bedrooms and kitchens, developing more products with the concept "In China, For China and Co-create with China". Pawlak-Kuliga said home furnishing is a complete package of products, design and services. Ikea's full-house design services can help Chinese consumers to best use their home space, she added.The company will also upgrade its business-to-business service to work with commercial real estate companies to furnish move-in ready apartments, long-term rental apartments and offices.
