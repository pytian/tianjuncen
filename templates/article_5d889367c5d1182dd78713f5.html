                S. Koreans protest amid Japan row

            <p class="style-content">
                Japan cautioned its citizens visiting South Korea about potential "safety risks" on Wednesday, as South Koreans are expected to mount protests in several cities over historical conflicts between the two neighbors.South Korea commemorated the International Memorial Day for Comfort Women amid rising tensions over trade and historical issues between Seoul and Tokyo, while Thursday marks the country's national day of liberation from Japanese colonial rule from 1910-45.Japan's Foreign Ministry issued an advisory on its website for Japanese residents in South Korea and visitors, reminding them to be careful and avoid areas where anti-Japanese protests and gatherings are expected to happen."Since July there have been large-scale Japan-related protests in Seoul, Busan and other places in South Korea.... A man burned a car outside the building of the Japanese Embassy and several students were taken into custody by police as they protested around the Consulate General of Japan in Busan," it said.The advisory said since Japan-related protests and gatherings are expected to be held in various cities in South Korea on Wednesday and Thursday, "please pay attention to the latest information and act carefully, such as staying away from places where protests are being held. When you go out, please pay attention to the surroundings when visiting Japan-related facilities".Around 300 people, including elderly women who were sexually enslaved by imperial Japanese army, participated in Wednesday's event in Seoul, Yonhap News Agency reported, but South Korean President Moon Jae-in did not appear, as he did last year when the memorial day was marked for the first time.Instead, Moon focused on raising global awareness of the comfort women issue and did not criticize Japan in a message posted on Facebook."Wednesday's ceremony was made possible because former comfort women were not afraid to speak publicly about the hardships they faced," Moon said, adding that he will share the issue with the international community and spread it as a message for peace and women's rights.Jin Sun-mee, South Korea's minister of gender equality and family, said Seoul will take the lead in expanding the comfort women issue into a women's rights movement and vowed to restore the women's dignity and honor."We will establish the comfort women issue as one of women's human rights and educate a new generation so that it will be remembered as a historical lesson," Jin said.Thursday marks the 74th anniversary of Korean Independence Day which is celebrated across the Korean Peninsula.Meanwhile, the international community and media are watching Japan closely as Emperor Naruhito will give his first war-related speech since he ascended to the throne in May.

                    Trump's Japan visit rich in symbolism

                US President Donald Trump, who arrived in Tokyo on Saturday, began his state visit to Japan on Sunday morning with a round of golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, followed by the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, where Trump presented the President's Cup to the winner. The centerpiece of the trip will be Trump's visit on Monday with new Japanese Emperor Naruhito, who has heralded the start of the country's Reiwa era. As is traditional for state visits, the royal couple will host a formal banquet for Trump on Monday evening. Trump is the first foreign leader to make a state visit to Japan since the May 1 enthronement of Naruhito. This is widely believed to underscore the importance of the Japan-US relationship. Daniel Sneider, a lecturer on international policy at Stanford University, in an article in Japanese magazine Tokyo Business Today, called Trump's visit "almost completely free of serious policy discussion, but laden with policy purpose". Showcasing relationship The schedule for the visit is a carefully orchestrated series of message moments, Sneider wrote. "And the first and most important purpose is to showcase the personal relationship between the two men, one cultivated by Abe and the Japanese government to an extent that dwarfs similar efforts by other governments around the globe." Abe has met and spoken by phone with Trump more than 40 times and twice has been invited to the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. This is Trump's second visit to Japan as US president. Sneider said the symbolic significance of Trump's visit with Japan's new emperor cannot be underestimated, adding that the Japanese government's central goal in organizing this trip was to make sure that the US president was the first foreign leader to see the new emperor. Sheila A. Smith, senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a blog that the pomp and circumstance planned for this visit by Trump to Japan shows how important the leader-to-leader approach has been to Abe. Trump also will be taken to Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force base in Yokosuka, Kanagawa prefecture, on Monday to board the Japanese helicopter carrier Kaga, the vessel likely to be equipped with the US-made short-takeoff and vertical landing version of the F-35 fighter, the F-35B. Trump will be the first US president in modern history to set foot on a Japanese warship. According to Smith, this will signify Trump's nod to Japan's growing contribution to Asia's military balance. The Japanese government, and Abe personally, wants this visit to showcase the close security ties between the two allies. Though analysts believe that trade will not be the focus of the visit, Trump reminded leaders from some of Japan's leading companies, including Toyota, Honda and Nissan, on Saturday evening that Japan has had "a substantial edge" for many years. The US and Japan are negotiating a trade deal. "With this deal we hope to address the trade imbalance, remove the barriers to United States exports and ensure fairness and reciprocity in our relationship," Trump said. Trump has insisted that the trade deficit of $68 billion with Japan must be lowered. Even as he lifted tariffs on May 17 on steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico, Trump maintained tariffs on Japanese metals, despite Abe's protests. Trump decided to delay new auto tariffs for six months as his administration negotiates bilateral trade agreements with Japan and Europe. During Trump's stay in Japan, Abe is expected to stave off further trade tensions and gain assurances that the US will maintain pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Important ally Satohiro Akimoto, president of the Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA and an associate fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies' Asia-Pacific program, wrote in a commentary published by the Japan Times that at a time when relations between Washington and traditional US allies have frayed, Japan has established itself as the single most important ally for the US in the region - and arguably in the world. "This is a strategic moment for Japan to think big based on the country's unique situation in the age of Trump, both domestically and internationally," Akimoto said. When Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif visited Tokyo earlier this month, Japan made clear that it does not support the US decision to withdraw from the nuclear agreement with Iran. Japan has important oil and other economic ties with Iran. Abe is considering a visit to Iran as early as mid-June, the first such trip in four decades, according to Japan's NHK television. Trump will be back in Japan next month for the Group of 20 summit in Osaka on June 28 and 29. Trump's two visits to Japan present windows of opportunity for Japan to strengthen its strategic position on the world stage, said Akimoto. caihong@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 05/27/2019 page1)

                    US, Japan seen to differ in key areas
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                While US President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe underscored the US-Japan alliance on Monday in a series of diplomatic activities and talks, analysts said Tokyo and Washington differ on some key issues. During a joint news conference on Monday, the third day of Trump's state visit, the two leaders said both sides have shown a willingness to strengthen the countries' close ties and will continue to collaborate in a variety of fields. Trump said he and Abe agreed to cooperate on space exploration. "The nations will be going to the moon and Mars very soon," Trump said, adding that "from a military standpoint, there is nothing more important right now than space". Abe spoke of walking "hand in hand" with the United States on some issues. He said Japan will make "new investments" in the US, and revealed a plan to buy 105 US-made stealth fighter planes, which would give it the largest F-35 fleet of any US ally. Trump's visit to Japan included ceremonial activities, the most notable of which was the US president's meeting with Emperor Naruhito and his wife, Empress Masako, on Monday. Trump was the first foreign state leader to be received by the new emperor since Naruhito ascended the throne earlier this month. Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor at Renmin University of China's School of International Studies, said the planned activities during Trump's visit, including watching sumo wrestling matches and presenting the President's Cup to the winner, and playing golf with Abe, were attempts by Abe and his government to impress Washington. "Abe seems to believe that the personal relationship between the leaders is of great significance for influencing the bilateral relations between Japan and the US. In this case, he must win over Trump the man before he might try to influence his decision-making," Cheng said. Analysts said that although a friendly atmosphere marked the summit, differences remain between Washington and Tokyo. Pang Zhongpeng, an associate researcher at the Institute of Japanese Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that while the two countries have long touted their friendly alliance, it can be seen from the news conference that there are growing gaps between the two. In response to the recent firing of short-range missiles by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Trump said he was not "personally bothered" by the tests. Abe, however, said the missile tests violated UN Security Council resolutions and were "of great regret", adding that he was concerned because the short-range missiles pose a threat to Japan's security. On trade issues, Trump and Abe largely glossed over their differences at the news conference, although Trump is threatening to put tariffs on auto imports from Japan and the European Union. Trump declined to say what Japan would have to do to avoid the tariffs but complained of an "unbelievably large" trade imbalance with the nation. "I think we will be announcing some things probably in August that will be very good for both countries," Trump said. Pang, the Chinese researcher, said that since Washington has maintained an "America first" policy, "it is more likely to undermine others' interests, even if the cost is to damage the relations with its traditional allies". On the issue of rising tensions between the US and Iran and the withdrawal by the US from the Iran nuclear deal, Abe said Tokyo and Washington would work together in an effort to ease tensions. Trump said the US is not looking for a regime change in Iran. Zhou Yongsheng, a professor at China Foreign Affairs University and deputy director of its Japanese Studies Center, said that Japan, as one of Iran's important trading partners, wants to be exempted from US sanctions while continuing its economic ties with Iran. "But it seems to be impossible, as the US' latest deployment of military forces to the Mideast region prompt fears of a conflict," Zhou added. panmengqi@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 05/28/2019 page1)

                Closing trade deal only possible after Japan's upper house election in JulyJapan rolled out the red carpet for US President Donald Trump this week, winning Tokyo a brief respite in its trade battle with Washington, but Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe faces pressure to deliver concessions after a summer election.Trump on Tuesday wound up a four-day state visit featuring golf, sumo, a state dinner with newly enthroned Emperor Naruhito and inspections of US and Japanese warships meant to showcase the alliance, but it was all shadowed by a feud over the two-way trade gap. Trump and his wife Melania boarded Air Force One at Tokyo's Haneda airport and were headed back to Washington, via a refueling stop in Alaska.Aboard the Japanese J.S. Kaga destroyer, a helicopter carrier designed to carry submarine-hunting helicopters to distant waters, Trump, thanked Japan for planning to buy more US-made F-35B stealth fighter jets.After his Monday meeting with Abe, Trump had said he expected the allies to be "announcing some things, probably in August, that will be very good for both countries" on trade.On Tuesday, however, Japanese Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said Trump's comment probably reflected his hope for quick progress in the trade talks."When you look at the exact wording of his comments, you can see that the president was voicing his hopes of swift progress in talks toward something that is mutually beneficial," Motegi told reporters at a regular cabinet meeting.Concessions on trade before Japan's upper house election in July could upset Japanese voters, especially farmers, who are important backers of Abe's Liberal Democratic Party, although consumers might welcome cheaper food products.Japanese officials have denied that the two countries had agreed to reach a trade deal by August.Opposition parties said Japanese farmers would be in the line of fire after the poll, adding that Trump had said "agriculture and beef were heavily in play" on Twitter on Sunday."Trump's comments can only be taken to mean that Japan has in fact made major concessions on agriculture and livestock," Yukio Edano, head of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, told a news conference this week.Washington wants Tokyo to cut tariffs on US farm products to restore their competitiveness.Trump has also declared that some imported vehicles and parts posed a national security threat but delayed a decision on imposing tariffs for as long as six months, allowing more time for talks with Japan and the European Union.Japan opposes any limits on its exports, which would violate World Trade Organization rules.Motegi, who is in charge of trade talks, said his meeting in Tokyo last week with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer made clear differences remain, but no timetable has been set for further talks.Some diplomatic experts said Abe had probably won the best results he could hope for, despite worries over trade and other policies, such as Pyongyang's nuclear programs.Toshihiro Nakayama, a Japan fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington, said: "You cannot embrace this president with nuance. If you are going to do it, you might as well embrace him fully. Overall, I would say that it was a successful ceremonial event. What more can you expect?"Reuters-AP-AFP-Xinhua

                    Abe to play mediator role for US, Iran
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Terming it a sensible move, expert says Japan shares good ties with both nations Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will arrive in Teheran on Wednesday on a three-day visit, the first by a Japanese prime minister in more than four decades. Abe hopes to mediate between Iran and the United States during his trip. Abe proposed the trip to US President Donald Trump during a visit by the US leader to Japan in late May and received his support. Japanese prime minister is scheduled to meet with Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani. In May 2018, Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action between Iran and major world powers, and re-imposed sanctions on the Middle East country's petrochemical industry, including the country's largest petrochemical holding group. The nuclear deal offered Iran sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear program. The White House designated Iran's revolutionary guards a "terrorist organization", and Teheran hit back by declaring the US a "state sponsor of terrorism" and Washington's forces in the region "terrorist groups". Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Seyyed Abbas Mousavi said the US sanctions against Iran's petrochemical industry is a clear example of economic terrorism. The US administration issued a strong message with a commitment to increase troop deployment in the region while Iran countered that it would not yield to US pressure. Under such circumstances, Abe is visiting Teheran. In an article published in Japan Times, Michael MacArthur Bosack, the special adviser for government relations at the Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies, said Japan may seem like an odd choice, but the good relations Japan has with both the US and Iran is one of the reasons why it is a sensible option to mediate between the two countries. At the administration level, Abe has healthy ties with both Trump and Rouhani. Japan and Iran will celebrate 90 years of established diplomatic relations this year. "Abe's visit to Iran will be setting a precedent for the Japanese government," Bosack wrote. "The successes or failures of this endeavor will color future diplomatic engagements, meaning that missteps will not only affect this effort, but potential opportunities in the future." He said it is unrealistic to expect that Abe can resolve long-standing problems between the US and Iran. Abe's push to mediate between the US and Iran, as Bosack put it, is a logical move that could succeed in providing necessary off-ramps for the two countries. "It will test his skills as a diplomat and leader on the global stage, while providing his government the chance to explore a role Japan is primed to play in the Reiwa Era," he said. Reiwa is the era of Japan that began on May 1, 2019, the day on which Emperor Akihito's elder son, Naruhito, ascended the throne as the 126th Emperor of Japan. Wang Xinsheng, professor of Japan studies at Peking University, said Abe has taken the initiative to be a mediator for the US and Iran because he has long wanted Japan to play a bigger part in world affairs. Wang Shaopu, an adviser for the Center of Japanese Studies of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, highlighted the economic motive behind Abe's visit to Iran. With 85 percent of its oil and 28 percent of its natural gas being imported from the Middle East, Japan has maintained friendly relations with Iran, though oil from that country now accounts for only about 5 percent of Japan's total oil imports, down from 10 percent in the 2000s. As the Middle East is the main supplier of energy for Japan, the country needs to stabilize its relations with Iran and the region, Wang said. An editorial in the Japan Times said the US and Iran are too entrenched and the changes demanded are too great. US demands on Iran are extensive, ranging from halting the nuclear program to ending support for forces that Washington believes create instability throughout the Middle East. "Mediation is a high-stakes move for Abe, who could lose face if no meeting with the Iranian leadership materializes or if Trump pulls the rug from under him with a provocative statement or tweet," the Japan Times said. The newspaper continued that both Iran and the US have given Abe an opportunity to make the case for direct engagement, but all he can propose are general principles and vouch for the other side's good will. But Japan Times does not think Abe has leverage to either entice or force Washington or Teheran to negotiate, adding that he faces powerful headwinds from the governments in Israel and Saudi Arabia that prefer that Teheran is isolated. "And if Abe comes back empty-handed or embarrassed, failure could encourage the hardliners and increase tensions further." Keivan Khosravi, spokesman for Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said the success of Abe's visit could be guaranteed if efforts were made to "return the US to the 2015 JCPOA and compensate the losses incurred on Iran", and to remove "the US extraterritorial sanctions" on Iran, according to MEHR News Agency, an Iranian news agency headquartered in Teheran. caihong@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 06/12/2019 page3)

                    1 Year: Tokyo Olympics unveil gold, silver, bronze medals
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                With exactly one year to go until the Tokyo Olympics open, organizers marked the day by unveiling the gold, silver, and bronze medals that will symbolize the 2020 Games.Thousands of politicians, sponsors, and fans jammed a massive exhibition hall in central Tokyo on Wednesday.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a cameo appearance to welcome the guests. And IOC President Thomas Bach said: "I have never seen an Olympic city as prepared as Tokyo with one year to go before the Olympic Games."Despite all the talk and theatrics, the center stage belonged to the medals by Japanese designer Junichi Kawanishi.Kawanishi wrote that the medals are to "resemble rough stones that have been polished and which now shine with light and brilliance."The front side carries the Tokyo Olympic emblem, with the Greek goddess of victory on the back.Bach, a fencing gold medalist in the 1976 Olympics, conducted a mock fencing duel earlier in the day with a junior high student — another chance to draw attention to the one-year milestone. The games will be held July 24-Aug. 9, 2020.Tokyo is spending about $20 billion to prepare the city to host the games, though exact Olympic spending is disputed and difficult to track. Five of the eight new venues are already finished, and the centerpiece, the $1.25 billion National Stadium, is to open by the end of the year.Ticket demand by Japanese residents appears to be a least 10 times above supply — maybe more — with demand also surging abroad. A recent law banning unauthorized ticket resales in Japan is sure to be tested because of glaring loopholes.Organizers are also preparing for Tokyo's typically hot summer weather, though this summer has been wet and cool. Traffic and subway congestion is also a concern, as is earthquake preparedness."This year Tokyo is chilly rather than hot," Yoshiro Mori, the president of the organizing committee, said. "It's quite different from what we experienced last year."Mori said Japanese Emperor Naruhito had accepted a role "as honorary patron" of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics. He will be expected to announce the opening of both the Olympics and Paralympics.Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike was asked a few days ago to justify spending billions on the Olympics. Organizers have been under pressure to cut costs, and they say they have cut billions by using existing venues. Tokyo is building eight new venues, but using 35 "temporary" or older venues.Koike described the Olympics and Paralympics as an "accelerator" to get things done, though research shows that the Olympic deadlines drive up costs. And Tokyo is famous for building things — with or without the Olympics."I'd like the legacy of the 2020 Games to be something more intangible, a new way of thinking for people and for society," she said. Koike described the Paralympics, which open Aug. 25, 2020, as a "springboard" to make the city more accessible to people with disabilities.AP

                    Naruhito speaks of remorse over WWII
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                 But Japanese PM Abe sends offering to controversial Yasukuni ShrineFollowing his father's lead, Japan's Emperor Naruhito expressed "deep remorse" over the country's wartime actions and prayed for global peace when making his first appearance as emperor on Thursday at an annual ceremony marking Tokyo's surrender in World War II."Looking back on the long period of post-war peace, reflecting on our past and bearing in mind the feelings of deep remorse, I earnestly hope that the ravages of war will never be repeated," Naruhito said."To those who lost their lives in the battlefield or by the war, I pay my heartful tribute together with all of our people and pray for world peace and further development of our country," the 59-year-old emperor added, using terms almost identical to those in his father Akihito's speeches.As Japan's first emperor born after the war, and grandson of Emperor Hirohito, in whose name Japanese troops fought the war, Naruhito's attitude toward the country's past aggressions had been a focal point of many with several viewed it as "encouraging".Yuzo Tanaka, a professor of economics at Ryukoku University in Kyoto, said the emperor's choice of echoing his father is a "pleasant move" as "it reminds people not to forget the tragedy of past, especially at a time when today's young people almost got no clue of war at all".In addition to Naruhito and his wife Empress Masako, more than 5,000 people participated in Thursday's event. They included Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, lawmakers from various parties and family members of the war dead.In his address, Abe renewed his pledge to maintain peace saying Japan "deeply recalls the lessons of history". However, as in the past, he steered clear of acknowledging Japan's wartime responsibility."Over 3 million of our countrymen's lives were lost during the war. ... We will never forget that the peace and prosperity we are enjoying now are built on the ultimate sacrifices of the war dead," Abe said, adding that Japan's vow of never engaging in war again will not change.Despite his reflection on the war, Abe also sent a ritual offering to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine on Thursday. The shrine honors Japanese soldiers killed in the war as well as 14 Japanese wartime leaders convicted as class-A criminals including Hideki Tojo, the wartime prime minister who was executed.Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker Tomomi Inada, an aide to Abe and former defense minister, made a monetary offering on the premier's behalf."The peace and prosperity of our country is due to those heroes who gave their lives for their homeland and I express my gratitude and respect," Inada quoted Abe as saying.Saying it was a private matter, Yoshihide Suga, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, refused to comment.Zhou Yongsheng, a professor at and deputy director of the Center of Japanese Research at China Foreign Affairs University, said as the shrine is regarded as a symbol of past Japanese militarism, visits and ritual offerings made in person or by proxy will trample on the feelings of the people of China, South Korea and other countries brutalized by Japan during World War II."Japan must face up to and reflect on its history of invasion, and draw a line under its militarism," Zhou said, adding that the issue is about whether Japan correctly acknowledges its history of invasion and of Japanese militarism, and about the feelings of the people in victims' countries."Pang Zhongpeng, an associate researcher at the Japan Studies Center of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said memorial of any kind to war criminals would only make matters worse for Japan's credibility as a responsible country.Pang said, because China and Japan's relations have warmed in recent years, it is high time that the Abe administration stop trying to whitewash Japan's war crimes if it really wants to make Japan a normal country and maintain good relations with its neighboring countries.
