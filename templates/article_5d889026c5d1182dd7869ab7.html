                City's economy is facing three structural challenges
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor warned that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region must wade through an economic malaise that will likely be more acute than the previous two downturns caused by the financial crisis in 1997 and SARS outbreak in 2003.The approaching economic malaise suggests that the economy, as well as society, are facing three fundamental structural challenges.The first challenge originates from the United States initiating a new global strategy that unprecedentedly lists China as one of its main rivals.It has been a consensus of the global community to treat Sino-US relations as the most important bilateral relationship in the first half of the 21st century.The far-reaching influence of the rivalry between the two economies is the linchpin in the paradigm shift of the century and could determine the 21st-century global power layout.The bruising trade war that US President Donald Trump launched has spilled over into science and technology as well as finance, and it will no doubt trigger shakedowns of industrial chains and value chains on a global scale.As a result, the trade war has increasingly affected Hong Kong as a trading port and will continue to do so in the years to come.The list of markets that Hong Kong does transshipment trade with will change, as will their standing by trade value and Hong Kong's total trade volume.Those two factors will affect other industries closely related to transshipment trade to the extent that it may be a matter of life and death for some enterprises.The second structural challenge is the result of the repositioning of Hong Kong's external relations.More importantly, it is the natural outcome of the country's relations with the US and some other Western countries that has necessitated Hong Kong's repositioning of itself in response to the changing big picture and will continue to do so.Before the US adjusted its global strategy with China as one of its main rivals, Hong Kong was a "bridge" between China and the US-led Western powers as well as a center of friction. As the US stepped up efforts to contain China from all directions and its Western allies more or less went along for the ride, Hong Kong has quickly become a "battlefield" in a sense.The US and some of its Western allies are the "dirty hands" conducting the ongoing "black revolution" in Hong Kong.The "black revolution" is no doubt doomed to fail, but Hong Kong must take a side, which is the sovereign state no matter what, meaning it simply cannot sit on the fence between the motherland and the US-led Western powers.This change is happening and will conclude in the foreseeable future. As such, it will noticeably impact Western economies' investment in Hong Kong, including the amount of capital they have already invested in the SAR.Hong Kong society has long been influenced by Western culture and politics, with the US and the UK being the most important investors in the city.That is why the repositioning of Hong Kong amid the changing relations between the motherland and the US-led Western powers are already faced with growing resistance.It is bound to happen whether one likes it or not. Whether the repositioning process will be smooth or otherwise will be reflected by Hong Kong's GDP growth and employment situation.The third structural challenge arises from the advancement of the "one country, two systems" policy with the times. Hong Kong's biggest carrier, Cathay Pacific Airways, was the first to feel the pressure to strike a balance between "one country" and "two systems".A recent notice from the Civil Aviation Administration of China warned Cathay against allowing its employees to engage in "illegal protests", "violent acts" and "overly radical activities", in response to recent instances in which Cathay Pacific employees, including pilots in active service, posed undeniable security and safety risks to passengers.The warning demanded that beginning on Aug 10, Cathay Pacific immediately bar anyone engaged in or supporting illegal protests and violent acts from working on flights over the mainland regardless of the type of flight; beginning on Aug 11, all Cathay Pacific and affiliated airlines must submit complete passenger and crew manifests of all flights to or over the mainland in advance so that the civil aviation departments concerned can verify and approve them, and flights that fail to pass advance security checks will be rejected; and beginning Aug 15, Cathay Pacific must submit a proper action plan to enhance flight safety and security measures for approval by the relevant civil aviation authorities on the mainland as a qualified commercial air transport operator.The requirements for Cathay Pacific are unprecedented and have sent an important message: The central government is now emphasizing that implementing the "one country, two systems" policy is a common undertaking for the Hong Kong SAR as well as the mainland.The original intent of the "one country, two systems" policy was to ensure the exercise of socialism on the mainland and capitalism in Hong Kong, but many people have mistakenly convinced themselves of caring only about practicing capitalism in Hong Kong in the past 22 years.This partial view has given rise to "localism" and pursuit of Hong Kong independence. Such ideas are closely related to rallying calls of the ongoing "black revolution" such as "no extradition to China" and "free Hong Kong, revolution now".That is why Cathay Pacific was made an example of, to never take any erroneous interpretation of the "one country, two systems" principle for granted ever. All business owners in Hong Kong must learn a lesson from Cathay Pacific regarding correctly understanding "one country, two systems" and fix their conduct accordingly.That is the significance of the Cathay Pacific scandal and backlash and will spill over to Hong Kong-based businesses' investment and flow of capital on the mainland.As a result, it will also lead to the readjustment of Hong Kong's local capital structure.The three structural challenges are intertwined and affecting deeper adjustment of Hong Kong's economy and finance as well as its future socio-political situation.The author is a senior research fellow of China Everbright Holdings.

                    Virgin Australia to trim overseas services
                </p>
            </a>

                Carrier is 'fundamentally' sound but needs 'hard-nosed business approach'When Virgin Australia first started operating in Australia on Aug 31, 2000, the airline, then known as Virgin Blue, promised so much to the traveling public.For the first 13 years, the carrier, whose investors include China's Nanshan Group and Hainan Airlines parent HNA Group, Singapore Airlines and United Arab Emirates' Etihad Airways, did well in a market that has been dominated by market leader Qantas.But it has been hemorrhaging money for the last seven years and on Aug 28 announced it will cut 750 jobs, mainly from its bloated head office, after posting a loss of $234.2 million for the financial year ended June 30 this year.The airline and its new chief executive officer, Paul Scurrah, are now examining its entire business operation.Already there is talk within the industry that Virgin Australia－Australia's second-biggest carrier and the largest airline by fleet size to use the Virgin brand－is looking at chopping services to Los Angeles, Bali and Hong Kong. It may even sell its low-cost airline Tigerair, which it acquired in 2014.When it took full control of Singapore's Tigerair, Virgin Australia's then CEO John Borghetti said the transaction marked "an important milestone for the airline" and would form an important part of Virgin Australia's "Virgin Vision 2017" strategy.The visions did not materialize, however, and Tigerair has been a millstone around Virgin's neck, some analysts say.Geoffrey Thomas, whose company Airlineratings.com monitors and rates the safety of more than 435 airlines globally, says Virgin Australia is "fundamentally" a sound airline."It does need to trim its sails and perhaps pull a couple down," he said. "There are some routes that need to go, and frequency on others reduced."Thomas said the airline has announced the integration of some of its units, and that will "streamline management and produce big savings"."Virgin is a superb airline with excellent customer service. Get the backroom costs sorted and it will be fine and in the black," he said.As to whether Australia can support two local carriers, Thomas said: "Australia needs two premium airlines, otherwise we would face a monopoly with much higher fares."Scurrah is Virgin Australia's third CEO, having taken over from Borghetti in March. The appointment of the former Queensland Rail boss did leave many in the industry scratching their heads, believing that running an airline is much more difficult than railways.Neil Hansford, chairman of Strategic Aviation Solutions, said Virgin Australia's biggest mistake was losing touch with its original business model of being a low-cost carrier. Instead it took on Qantas.Hansford said the airline's current business model is not sustainable and what has been announced are "band-aid' measures."The ability of its partners to put in additional capital is doubtful (given) their own problems in Hainan (Airlines) and Etihad (Airways) and the conservative investment strategies of Singapore Airlines."In April 2018, Air New Zealand ended its partnership with Virgin Australia on flights across the Tasman Sea. Air New Zealand had decided to pull out of the alliance operating since 2010.Hansford said Virgin Australia will need to make some "hard" decisions in the coming weeks and months."Major decisions must be taken to get out of international markets like Hong Kong and the United States where it competes with up to five heavyweights on the routes," he said. In the results just published, Virgin Australia's international arm lost $50.8 million."Tigerair lost $30 million on revenue of only $376 million and needs to be closed or integrated into Virgin mainline as a product only with no separate management." He suggested "Virgin Lite" could fly in Virgin's original budget space."It's not time for band-aids, it is time for business reconstruction into areas where profitability is quickly deliverable."He said apart from the sustainability of its overseas routes and the future of Tigerair, the airline should review the suitability of offering business class on domestic leisure routes, rationalize direct services within Australia, and reduce the fleet size.Hansford said the airline needs to remove the "founder culture" and replace it with a hard-nosed business approach to what is a very low-margin industry."Virgin Australia needs to go back to marketing to their core business adopters and stop chasing the Qantas business pie. Market itself as being economic and different, to a more defined audience," he said.

                    It's time for Cathay Pacific to fasten its seat belt
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                That security is supreme on flights is a well-known fact. It is equally well known that no one should tamper with any equipment in an airplane. And flight crew should be the last people to break this rule, comments China Daily writer Zhu Yuan.Yet 13 empty and partly empty bottles of oxygen were found on two Cathay Pacific flights from Hong Kong to Toronto on Aug 17 and 18. Another empty bottle of oxygen was found on a flight operated by Cathay Dragon (a subsidiary of Cathay Pacific) before it took off for Kuala Lumpur on Saturday.Investigators are yet to identify the suspects or whether they have any links with the illegal demonstrations in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, but the recent actions of some Cathay Pacific employees suggest their minds have been poisoned by anti-Chinese mainland ideas.Although the airline has put 40 crew members on a "duty to be assigned" list and introduced a new policy requiring flight crew to conduct even stricter checks on flights every 60 minutes to ensure complete security, there is still enough reason for the public to be worried about security on Cathay Pacific flights.In fact, on July 26, the pilot of a Cathay Pacific flight from Tokyo to Hong Kong, instead of informing passengers about the weather and flight condition, used the public address system to voice his support for the demonstrators, seriously violating work ethics.True, even a pilot has the right to air his or her political views－but not on flights or at airports.Perhaps owning up for the unethical and illegal behaviors of some of the airline's employees, John Slosar resigned as Cathay Pacific chairman on Wednesday, even though the airline said his resignation is due to "his retirement and that he is not aware of any disagreement with the board of the company".Still, Cathay needs to focus more on beefing up security on flights rather than being lulled into a false sense of security. The airline should also ensure that its employees don't express support for the Hong Kong demonstrations while on duty, for by so doing they would not only break service rules but also could compromise flight security.After all, whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out.
