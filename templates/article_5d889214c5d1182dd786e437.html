                Moderating economic data should not be a cause for alarm
            </p>
            <p>
                Major economic data for August have moderated from the previous month, sparking concerns about further slowdown of China's economy. Such concerns may be somewhat reasonable, but considering the declining trend of major economies across the world, in large part due to rising trade protectionism, and the still-strong growth momentum of the Chinese economy, there is no reason to view China's economic prospects with pessimism. Year-on-year growth rates of industrial output, fixed-asset investment and retail sales were all lower than in July, indicating the Chinese economy faces heavy growth headwinds. Yet the economic data are in line with the global cycle of easing growth. No wonder economists widely believe the United States Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates to help the world's largest economy cope with the slowdown. In Europe, the European Central Bank introduced an aggressive stimulus package on Thursday, cutting its deposit rate - the first such reduction in more than three years - to a record low of minus 0.4 percent, and restarting its bond-buying plan as part of a quantitative easing program to boost growth.

                The biomedicine threat could become real
            </a>
            <p>
                Biomedical advances in recent decades have been hugely beneficial－particularly for the world's poor, whose life expectancy has increased dramatically. But the future looks dangerous. Although continued innovation will further improve people's lives, it will also give rise to new threats, and sharpen some ethical dilemmas concerning human life itself.For starters, some scientists are looking into extreme ways of enabling people to live longer. Although we would almost certainly welcome an extended, healthy lifespan, many of us would not want to prolong matters once our quality of life or prognosis dips below a certain threshold. Some people dread to live in the grip of, say, dementia, or being a drain on resources.Medical progress is also blurring the transition between life and death. Today, death is normally taken to mean "brain death", when all measurable signs of brain activity cease. But now there are proposals to restart the heart artificially after "brain death", in order to keep transplantable organs "fresh" for a longer time. Which would add to the moral ambiguity of transplant surgery.Already, for example, unscrupulous "agents" are persuading people in less developed countries to sell organs that will then be resold at a much higher price for the benefit of potential wealthy recipients.These ambiguities, and the shortage of organ donors, will only increase. One priority, therefore, must be to make xenotransplantation－harvesting organs from pigs or other animals for human use－routine and safe. An even better option, although further off, could be 3D printing of replacement organs, using similar techniques to those currently being developed to make artificial meat.Advances in microbiology may also prove to be a double-edged sword. True, better diagnostics, vaccines and antibiotics should help to sustain health, control disease and contain pandemics. But this very progress has sparked a dangerous evolutionary counterattack by pathogens, with bacteria becoming immune to the antibiotics used to suppress them.This growing resistance has already led to a resurgence in tuberculosis. Without new antibiotics, the risks posed by untreatable postoperative infections will rise back to where they were a century ago. Preventing the overuse of existing antibiotics－including in American cattle－and incentivizing the development of new treatments is thus an urgent short-and long-term priority.And yet there are also risks associated with the race to develop improved vaccines. In 2011, researchers in the Netherlands and the United States demonstrated that it was surprisingly simple to make the H5N1 influenza virus both more virulent and more transmissible. Some argued that staying a step ahead of natural mutations would make it easier to produce vaccines in short order. But critics of the experiments pointed out the increased risk of dangerous viruses being released unintentionally, or of bioterrorists gaining access to new techniques.Rapid innovation in biotech demands that we explore regulations to keep experiments safe, control the spread of potentially dangerous knowledge, and police the ethics of how new techniques are being applied. But effective worldwide enforcement of such rules would be virtually impossible. If something can be done, then someone, somewhere, will do it. Which is a potentially terrifying prospect.Whereas producing a nuclear weapon requires elaborate special-purpose technology, biotech involves small-scale, dual-use equipment. In fact, bio-hacking is an increasingly popular hobby and competitive game. Because our world has become so interconnected, the magnitude of the worst potential bio-catastrophes is greater than ever. Yet far too many people are in denial about this.Today, a natural pandemic would have a far greater social impact than in times past. Mid-14th-century Europeans, for example, were understandably a fatalistic lot, and villages continued to function even when the Black Death killed half their inhabitants. But these days, the feeling of entitlement in many developed countries is so strong that the social order would collapse as soon as a pandemic overwhelms the healthcare system.Nor is it scaremongering to highlight the human risks of bio error or bio terror. After all, the spread of an artificially released pathogen can be neither predicted nor controlled. That fact inhibits the use of bioweapons by governments, or even by terrorist groups with specific aims. But an unbalanced loner with biotech expertise would not necessarily feel so constrained if he or she believes that there are too many humans on the planet.Both bio error and bio terror are possible. And the risk will become even greater in the longer term once it becomes possible to design and synthesize viruses. The ultimate nightmare would be a highly lethal bioweapon that has the transmissibility of the common cold.Yet perhaps the greatest dilemma concerns human beings themselves. At some point in the future, genetic modification and cyborg technologies could make humans mentally and physically malleable. Worse, such evolution－a kind of secular "intelligent design"－would take only centuries, in contrast to the thousands of centuries needed for Darwinian evolution.That really would be a game changer. Today, when we admire the literature and artifacts that have survived from antiquity, we feel an affinity across thousands of years with those ancient artists and their civilizations. "Human nature" has not changed for millennia.But there is no reason to assume that the dominant intelligence a few centuries from now will have any emotional resonance with us, even though they may have an algorithmic understanding of how we behaved. Will they even be recognizably human? Or, will electronic entities have taken over the world by then?

                ECB cuts key rate, to restart bond purchases
            </a>
            <p>
                 FRANKFURT - The European Central Bank approved a fresh stimulus package as expected on Thursday, cutting interest rates and approving a new round of bond purchases to prop up euro zone growth and halt a worrisome drop in inflation expectations.The ECB cut its deposit rate to a record low -0.5 percent from -0.4 percent and will restart bond purchases of 20 billion euros a month from November, it said in a statement.With inflation falling, Germany skirting a recession and a global trade war sapping domestic confidence, the ECB had all but promised more support to the economy and the only question was how extensive stimulus would be."The Governing Council expects (bond purchases) to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates," the ECB said in a regular policy statement.The ECB also eased the terms of its long term loans to banks and introduced a tiered deposit rate to help banks.Economists polled by Reuters expected a 10 basis point deposit rate cut, a tiered deposit rate to support banks, bond buys of 30 billion euros a month from October and a fresh promise to keep rates low for longer."The Governing Council now expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2 percent within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics," the ECB said.Attention now turns to ECB President Mario Draghi's 1230 GMT news conference, at which he will also present fresh growth and inflation projections.Reuters

                World anticipates next economic move
            </a>
            <p>
                Whether or not China will enact further accommodative monetary policies to maintain growth momentum is a question that has drawn the market's attention, as other major economies have stepped back into a policy-easing cycle in response to negative factors clouding the global outlook. Choosing policies that support growth has become the priority for global leaders, and Chinese policymakers are expected to follow suit in their own way, providing assurances that the economy is on firm footing while striking a macroeconomic balance for long-term stability, analysts said. The aim of supportive policies in China is to prevent a slowdown in growth, rather than boosting growth to a strong level, according to the latest research from Goldman Sachs, which added that policymakers are "highly flexible" in reacting to global conditions.

                World awaits next economic move by China
            </a>
            <p>
                Beijing policymakers expected to follow suit as other global leaders opt for cycle of easing Whether or not China will enact further accommodative monetary policies to maintain growth momentum is a question that has drawn the market's attention, as other major economies have stepped back into a policy-easing cycle in response to negative factors clouding the global outlook. Choosing policies that support growth has become the priority for global leaders, and Chinese policymakers are expected to follow suit in their own way, providing assurances that the economy is on firm footing while striking a macroeconomic balance for long-term stability, analysts said. The aim of supportive policies in China is to prevent a slowdown in growth, rather than boosting growth to a strong level, according to the latest research from Goldman Sachs, which added that policymakers are "highly flexible" in reacting to global conditions. Its research was released before the economic data for August, which will be posted on Monday. Economists had predicted a rebound of growth in August from July's moderate performance. They foresaw strengthened industrial output growth, stabilized fixed-asset investment and accelerated retail sales, as some earlier supportive measures had begun to take effect. "China's macroeconomic policy tools are adequate," Sheng Songcheng, former head of the statistics and analysis department at the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, told China Daily on Sunday. "Proactive fiscal policy will play a major role, while prudent monetary policy will be used to coordinate the fiscal policy." After the market-oriented reform of the loan prime rate mechanism, or LPR, the central bank has more tools to guide the real lending rate, including adjusting the medium-term lending facility interest rate, which is still at a relatively high level. The monetary easing measures by other major central banks have provided more room for China's monetary policy adjustments, Sheng said. "However, the adjustments of interest rates should also take into account both internal and external balances, such as the impacts on domestic asset prices," he said. The European Central Bank launched an aggressive stimulus package on Thursday - the first cut of its deposit rate in more than three years to a record low of - 0.5 percent, from - 0.4 percent, plus a restart of a bond-buying plan, or quantitative easing program. The bank said the moves were a response to the slower global growth and the continued shortfall of inflation domestically. This stimulus provoked criticism by investors, who worry it could trigger more market volatility. All eyes will be on the United States and the Federal Reserve's policymaking meeting on Wednesday. There is broad consensus among economists that the Fed may announce another rate cut. For China, one of the most important challenges ahead is the trade dispute with the United States. Rising risk aversion globally and a reshuffling of supply chains may also affect foreign investment in China, said Alicia Garcia Herrero, Asia-Pacific chief economist for Paris-based Natixis Bank. "China's growth model, despite foreseeable headwinds, has been evolving constantly, including further opening up in attracting international capital and deepening financial market reforms," she said. "We expect China to adapt to current challenges and stabilize growth with corresponding policy supports." Stephen Schwartz, senior director of sovereign ratings at Fitch (Hong Kong), said, "In the face of the external headwinds, we believe the Chinese authorities will stop short of the type of credit-led stimulus policies that could exacerbate medium-term financial and economic imbalances." chenjia@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 09/16/2019 page1)

                Moderating economic data should not be a cause for alarm: China Daily editorial
            </a>
            <p>
                Major economic data for August have moderated from the previous month, sparking concerns about further slowdown of China's economy. Such concerns may be somewhat reasonable, but considering the declining trend of major economies across the world, in large part due to rising trade protectionism, and the still-strong growth momentum of the Chinese economy, there is no reason to view China's economic prospects with pessimism.Year-on-year growth rates of industrial output, fixed-asset investment and retail sales were all lower than in July, indicating the Chinese economy faces heavy growth headwinds. Yet the economic data are in line with the global cycle of easing growth.No wonder economists widely believe the United States Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates to help the world's largest economy cope with the slowdown. In Europe, the European Central Bank introduced an aggressive stimulus package on Thursday, cutting its deposit rate — the first such reduction in more than three years — to a record low of minus 0.4 percent, and restarting its bond-buying plan as part of a quantitative easing program to boost growth.Which shows the world is searching for a way to boost the global growth momentum, even though some countries have resorted to protectionism and unilateralism. Given these facts, China's growth remains impressive, because despite the weakening of its major economic indicators in August, its unemployment rate dropped compared with July.As Premier Li Keqiang said in an interview with a Russian media outlet on Sunday, the country can tolerate moderate fluctuations in growth so long as the employment market remains stable.Also, some new and emerging sectors are making greater contributions to China's longer-term high-quality growth. National Bureau of Statistics data show that some high value-added sectors, such as services, online retail, high-tech, environmental protection, education, culture and entertainment, have registered higher growth than the traditional sectors.The strong performance of the high value-added sectors, in fact, has continued over many quarters, filling the gaps created by the slowing growth of some traditional industries and laying the foundation for higher growth in the future.The growth potential of the Chinese economy is evident from the fact that Shanghai signed 42 contracts for foreign investment projects worth $7.7 billion on Monday alone in traditional fields such as finance, chemical engineering and biomedicine, as well as high-value-added sectors like integrated circuit, smart manufacturing, new energy and new materials.And with the economic restructuring continuing, it could become normal for the Chinese economy to fluctuate within a narrow band in the coming quarters, but the possibility is high that China will maintain a healthy growth rate despite the downward global economic cycle.
