                China's Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has first 5G base station
            </p>
            <p>
                XINING - China's Qinghai-Tibet Plateau recently had its first 5G base station opened in the city of Xining, Qinghai province, according to the Qinghai subsidiary of telecom firm China Mobile.The service was opened last week. Currently, part of the city's downtown area is covered by 5G service, with a peak download speed of 1.3 Gbps, about 10 times that of 4G service.The high altitude province of Qinghai has lagged behind in infrastructure construction. In April 2018, the local government vowed to develop new wireless technologies such as 5G network.The province also plans to offer information services such as virtual reality and telemedicine thanks to faster internet speeds.Officials with the company said 5G service is expected to improve communication between Qinghai's Tibetan-populated areas and the rest of the country by closing their information service gap.

                CSL side Luneng deny interest in Arsenal manager
            </a>
            <p>
                JINAN - Chinese Super League (CSL) side Shandong Luneng on Tuesday denied interest in signing Arsene Wenger as their head coach after he leaves Premier League club Arsenal, at the end of the season.The 68-year-old Frenchman will say goodbye to Arsenal where he served as manager since 1996. Reports said Luneng will offer a coaching job to Wenger with an annual salary reportedly close to 28 million GBP.The club humourously denied the rumour on it's Weibo account. "It is surely a surprise to learn from netizens that Mr. Wenger will be the head coach of our club."Former Chinese men's football international Li Xiaopeng took over as Luneng's head coach in December, replacing German manager Felix Magath.The 42-year-old Li Xiaopeng, who spent his entire playing career in Luneng, was one of the key figures in China's only World Cup experience in 2002.As a player, Li helped Luneng win one Chinese Jia-A League title, three CFA Cup titles and one CSL Cup title.

                New chips to be made in 'Optics Valley'
            </a>
            <p>
                A new type of 3D NAND flash memory technology was released by a company based in Wuhan, Hubei province, during the Flash Memory Summit held in California on Wednesday, providing faster performance with lower costs.Flash memory is widely used in computers and smartphones, and 3D NAND flash is a type in which the memory cells are stacked vertically in multiple layers instead of in a planar form.The new technology, Xtacking, released by Yangtze Memory Technologies Co Ltd, uses a different architecture for making 3D NAND flash, in which the whole intellectual property is owned in China, according to Diao Shijing, the co-president of the company.At present, the world's highest input/output speed for 3D NAND is targeting 1.4 gigabits per second, while the majority of the industry is offering 1 Gbps or below."With our Xtacking technology, it is possible for the speed to reach up to 3 Gbps," said Yang Shining, chief executive office of the company. "This is going to be a game changer in the industry."In conventional architecture, the periphery circuits take up 20 to 30 percent of the die area, lowering the density of the memory unit, and as the 3D NAND technology continues to progress to 128 layers to offer the user larger memory, the periphery circuits will likely take up more than 50 percent of the total die area.According to Yangtze Memory Technologies, the periphery circuits are placed above the array chip in the new architecture to save space, thus increasing the density of the memory unit area.It also has an independent process of the array and periphery module, which will allow parallel product development and manufacturing, reducing product development by at least three months and reducing the manufacturing cycle by 20 percent.Founded in 2016, Yangtze Memory chose Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Zone as its headquarters, where a national-level memory chip production base with a total investment of 160 billion yuan ($23.41 billion) is under construction and the company's first factory started pilot operations in April."The new technology is expected to go into mass production in 2019," said Diao. "Our target is to become the main global provider of memory chips in the next decade."Yangtze Memory is just one of the companies that have been attracted to the high-tech zone, also known as the "Optics Valley of China", which is the most advanced manufacture and R&D base for optoelectronic industry in the nation.China Star Optoelectronics Technology Co, a Shenzhen-based screen supplier to many smartphone makers including Xiaomi and TCL, also started building a 600,000-square-meter factory focusing on the manufacturing of flexible AMOLED screens in the zone since 2014.Zhao Jun, general manager of its Wuhan company, said the first batch of the flexible screens will be produced in the first half of next year. Once entering mass production, the factory will be able to deliver screens for 10 million six-inch smartphones per month."Just as internet companies are lured to Silicon Valley, the cumulative effect is what drew us to the Optics Valley," Zhao said. "With the complete supply chain here, we will be able to grow faster and go further."Established in 1988, the zone has seen the production of the nation's first optical fiber and the first optical transmission, and is on the list of the nation's 10 key high-tech zones designated by the Ministry of Science and Technology, which also includes Beijing's Zhongguancun and Shanghai's Zhangjiang high-tech parks.Last year, the provincial government set up a 50-billion-yuan fund for the development of the high-tech zone with the aim of attracting more than one trillion yuan of investment to the area.

                Blockchain cooperation between UK and China increasing
            </a>
            <p>
                Blockchain technology, which combines the openness of the internet with the security of cryptography, could be a highlight of collaboration between China and the United Kingdom in the years to come, according to a Chinese diplomat in London.Speaking at the China-UK Blockchain Collaboration Seminar at London & Partners' headquarters, Bao Ling, minister counselor at China's embassy in the UK, said: "Britain has unique advantages in blockchain research, and has gathered a large number of talents and professionals. Financial technology and the UK's well-developed financial market provide rich soil for blockchain incubations."Bao said China, with the world's largest population of internet users and with online shopping and electronic payment methods increasingly popular, is emerging as a crucible for blockchain innovation and adoption."Demanded both by government and enterprises in China, great importance has been attached to blockchain technology's further development and application," Bao said, adding that it provides growing opportunities for closer collaboration between two vibrant blockchain ecosystems.Bao said major and medium-sized cities in China are embracing the new technology revolution and it is gradually changing people's lifestyles and creating great business opportunities.Mark Hedley, director of information and communication technology at the China-Britain Business Council, said: "Blockchain is one technology with tremendous potential for shifting the paradigm of how global business is transacted."Though much of the attention so far has been focused on bitcoin and currency-related applications, Hedley noted that the technology has many other potential uses, in areas including smart logistics, legal contracts, trade documentation, healthcare, education, and manufacturing."Governments across the world, including in both China and the UK, are actively exploring the potential to develop, harness, and apply distributed ledger technologies to a wider range of problems and scenarios," said Hedley, who noted that blockchain also appeared in China's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20) and has benefitted from more than $100 billion of Chinese investment.The seminar coincided with the unveiling of a new cryptocurrency payment method called UKEX, which was created by the London-based Chinese fintech company UKDE.Wu Junsong, director of UKDE, said: "Blockchain is an attractive alternative to traditional online payments, offering a decentralized accounting method that is time-stamped, allowing peer-to-peer payments free from the concerns of personal data loss. Realizing blockchain payments means that mankind will have fully entered the era of the crypto economy. The free exchange between USD, GBP, Euros, and cryptocurrencies is made possible on a crypto asset exchange platform."

                Shanghai gets into the gigabit groove
            </a>
            <p>
                Shanghai Telecom, a China Telecom Corp subsidiary, is leading the world by supporting 10Gbps (10G) throughout its citywide wireline broadband access network.It announced on Wednesday that it had completed the first commercial fiber to the home (FTTH) network based on 10G PON across the entire city.This means that China Telecom has deployed faster broadband speeds for residential buildings of up to 10 gigabit per second, while fiber users can have the option of up to 1 Gbps service for download."Becoming the first gigabit city demonstrates Shanghai's bid to implement the strategy of building China into a strong cyber power," said Ma Yimin, general manager of China Telecom Shanghai Branch."Life in Shanghai has become easier thanks to higher internet speed, smarter infrastructure and better accessibility to the world (through technologies)."The three-year infrastructure upgrade cost more than 1 billion yuan ($144 million), the company said. The service has become available to nearly 20,000 neighborhoods, covering 10 million households in Shanghai.The so-called gigabit connection is typically delivered over fiber optic lines and provides speeds of 1,000 Mbps, which is also referred to as "1 Gbps" or "Gigabit" internet."A gigabit connection means our customers have the bandwidth needed to be as connected, entertained and immersed as they could possibly want," said Chen Zhihong, the company's vice-general manager.Much faster than today's average broadband connection, the gigabit connection can power a variety of services that meet the needs for bandwidth-hungry users, including multi-channel 4K video, smart home, online gaming and video streaming at the same time, among others, he noted.The company said the new infrastructure also provides room for emerging automation-based and 5G services that the carrier is expecting to reach the market in the coming years.Before rolling out the service city-wide, the carrier unveiled two subscription plans priced from 299 yuan per month including broadband, mobile and IPTV services. Existing users of the plans can choose to upgrade to the service for free.Beijing introduced the "Broadband China" strategy in 2013 which aims to speed up the network, lower service fees and drive the proliferation of internet usage.Massive infrastructure input has paid dividends. By the end of September, 88 percent of Chinese broadband users were on fiber optic connections, according to figures released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.The current development will also put Shanghai on a par with Singapore and Qatar as the most prominent economies to have the highest fiber penetration rate which can drive gigabit broadband, according to US-based consultancy Arthur D Little."While people may not make use of all that performance (the high speed), they will be ready to adapt in the future after upgrading their equipment," said Xu Heyuan, deputy chief engineer of China Academy of Information and Communications Technology.

                New golden age ahead
            </a>
            <p>
                5G, AI and the industrial internet hold bright prospects for the futureFifty years have passed since 1969 when the first message was sent over the ARPANET, the first wide area packet-switching network, which is viewed as being the official birth of the internet. Today, more than 55 percent of the world population enjoy surfing online.For China, the proportion is even larger. According to data released by China Internet Network Information Center, up to December 2018, China had more than 800 million internet users, and the internet penetration rate was 59.6 percent, up 3.8 percentage points year-on-year.The rapid development of the internet had been riding on the demographic dividend in China, but the remaining 40.4 percent (around 562 million) are mostly senior citizens and children, meaning the growth rate might be nearing its limits.These numbers from China are not encouraging. And capital has been quick to respond: The Nasdaq Internet Index (QNET) declined from June 2018, with the downward trend continuing through January this year; the index fell by 30 percent compared with June last year, a level similar to that of summer 2017. The share prices of listed Chinese internet companies also fell.People say the golden age of the internet is over. But I disagree. Beyond the difficulties, there is a silver lining: New momentum is emerging with the rollout of 5G, artificial intelligence and the industrial internet.First, 5G, the fifth generation wireless network, is coming.Based on the continuous innovation of telecom technology, in the era of 5G, users will be able to enjoy a 100-times increase in traffic density, 30-times rise in peak data rates, and magnitude improvement compared with 4G.Obviously, the mobile communication revolution, from 4G to 5G, is on the way, which promises higher speeds, lower latency and more connections, which will support the development of the mobile internet and the industrial internet.For instance, virtual reality and augmented reality are not new, but as the bandwidth is insufficient, the experience is not very good. 4K HD video normally needs 25 Mbps bandwidth while 8K UHD video about 100 Mbps bandwidth. True, 4G could support this, however, the experience is not satisfying. For the same reason, 3D computer graphics processing needs 5G to provide Gbps bandwidth. No doubt, the emergence of 5G will boost the development of VR and AR in the future.By 2035, according to the research report of Qualcomm and IHS, global GDP is estimated to increase 7 percent, corresponding to $3.5 trillion because of 5G. For China, because of 5G, the country's GDP will increase by nearly $1 trillion, and nearly 10 million new jobs will be created. That is why 5G is so welcomed.The second engine is artificial intelligence.How can AI contribute to the human society? It will help improve labor productivity, promote a boom in consumption and advance product quality. AI's contribution to labor productivity, estimated by global market consultancy McKinsey & Co, will exceed 55 percent of GDP from 2017 to 2030.The pharmaceutical, automotive, financial, retail, entertainment, manufacturing and energy sectors are all major application areas for AI.Voice-recognition technology and face-recognition technology are already being wildly applied in China. High-tech companies are booming - from startups such as Yitu Technology to the market leaders such as iFlytek - by providing such kind of services.There are also vast industrial applications for artificial intelligence. For instance, Tsinghua University and Nvidia worked together to improve the accuracy of printed circuit boards using AI.By 2030, AI is expected to contribute an additional $13 trillion of GDP growth to the world, with an average annual growth rate of 1.2 1.2 percentage points, which is comparable to steam engines in the 19th century, industrial robots in the 20th century and information technology in the 21st century, according to McKinsey.The industrial internet is the third momentum we can count on.From desktop websites to the mobile web to the internet of things, and now to the industrial internet, the development of the internet has been changing rapidly and getting to a new stage. But what is the exact definition of this so-called industrial internet?The industrial internet is the integration of big data, AI, the mobile web, 5G, the internet of things, cloud computing and blockchain technology, among other things. It also incorporates industrial technologies such as intelligent machines and advanced manufacturing.There are obvious differences between the first-stage internet and industrial internet. Generally speaking, the internet is human-oriented while the industrial internet is object-oriented, which results in quite different types of terminals and performance requirements.Nevertheless, we can be optimistic about the future of the industrial internet, for it has shown its widespread commercial value and great prospects for development.A joint study by the World Bank and GE Corporation shows that $82 trillion will be added in certain industries because of the industrial internet in 2025, accounting for 50 percent of the GDP. It is also estimated by other organizations that the industrial internet will contribute $1.42 trillion to the global economy by 2030.Thus, by 2030, three new momentums - 5G, AI and the industrial internet - are expected to each reach the scale of $12 trillion to $15 trillion globally. That is to say, great technological and market opportunities lie ahead, which should be very good news for China's internet industry.The author is president of the internet Society of China and a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.

                Spain enters 5G era in cooperation with Huawei
            </a>
            <p>
                MADRID - Interested in the advances of 5G, Tinatin Gersamia has considered to buy a smartphone with this technology after consulting at a Vodafone store in Barcelona."I have very positive feedback about the 5G technology and I think it could really help me in my daily life, as well as in my professional life. I would be able to connect the Internet from anywhere," Gersamia said.In cooperation with Chinese technology company Huawei, the English telecommunications company Vodafone has recently launched the first commercial service of the 5G mobile network in 15 Spanish cities.In several shopping centers, including bus stops in Madrid, large advertisements herald the arrival of the ultra-fast technology.Spain thus becomes one of the first European countries to have this ultra-fast mobile network. Consumers and professionals in the sector have high expectations about 5G, which is characterized by immediacy, high speed and low latency.With 5G mobile phones, users will experience download speeds of up to 1 gigabits per second (Gbps) now and up to 2 Gbps by the end of the year. Consumption of data will also increase, Eduard Martin Lineros, the 5G Program Director of Mobile World Capital Barcelona, told Xinhua, emphasizing that 5G enables operators to analyze the response of users to this technology.The arrival of 5G technology in Spain has been made possible by Huawei's network. "There are a few network manufacturers that take the lead and Huawei is one of them," said Tricas.The manager of the Smart City program of Zaragoza, Daniel Sarasa, agreed. Huawei "has an excellent position in the infrastructure market in Spain," he said, adding that the US has been adopting several protectionist measures because Huawei surpasses them in this field.The network launched by Vodafone in cooperation with Huawei will cover 15 major cities including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Seville, and the service will be expanded further in the future. Among the cities, 12 use Huawei base stations.The industrial sector has high expectations for 5G, because it will be able to put into practice automatic driving, telemedicine and connectivity or Internet of Things.Eduard Martin Lineros told Xinhua in an interview with that the launch of 5G commercial services was very important for the digital development of Barcelona."I think (5G) will allow us to test some services for citizens, which so far we have not been able to carry out as we did not have the means to do it," Martin Lineros explained.Barcelona, the city that hosts the Mobile World Congress, promotes the 5G Barcelona initiative, whose goal is to turn the city into "a digital hub for the validation and adoption of 5G technologies.""It is an important step for Barcelona to have a 5G commercial network," he explained, noting that the implementation of this technology will provide better solutions for smart cities.Fernando Tricas, vice-chancellor of information and communication technology at the University of Zaragoza, has said that "5G and immediate response will be fundamental, for example, for a doctor carrying out remote surgeries or for the police to control something remotely ... It will be as if they did it in place and with their own hands."Luis Furnells, executive president of the Oesia Group -- a Spanish technology company that performs consultancy tasks in information technology and the design of electronic engineering in security and defense -- agreed that 5G is part of a revolution and pointed out that "5G will finally give full meaning to concepts such as mobility or the Internet of Things".

                Huawei unveils new flagship 5G chip
            </a>
            <p>
                Huawei on Friday unveiled what it considers the world's first flagship 5G system-on-chip (Soc) chipset.The move comes as the Chinese tech company continues to showcase its technological capabilities, despite the challenges it faces.The Kirin 990 5G is manufactured with seven nanometer processes and can support real-time on-device inference.Huawei's Mate smartphones powered by the Kirin 990 5G will be unveiled later in September.Yu Chengdong, CEO of Huawei's consumer business group, said the Kirin 990 5G supports both standalone and non-standalone 5G networks, suggesting wider use scenarios.Non-stand-alone networks still rely on existing 4G.Most companies currently use 4G SoC and a separate 5G modem as chip solutions for their 5G smartphones. The Kirin 990 5G incorporates the 5G modem into its 5G SoC, making it the smallest chip solution for 5G handsets.The chipset has 10.3 billion crystal valves and is the most powerful 5G SoC, Yu said.The Kirin 990 5G can achieve peak download speeds of 2.3 Gbps and peak upload speeds of 1.25 Gbps. It can also enable new AI applications and photography capabilities, Huawei said.Wang Yanhui, secretary-general of the Mobile China Alliance, said the move demonstrates Huawei’s technological competitiveness when competing with Qualcomm and Samsung in 5G chips.Its product development map is not affected by the US government’s restrictions on the company, Wang said.
