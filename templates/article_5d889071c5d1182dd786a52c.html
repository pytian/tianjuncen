                When crossing into Nanchong from neighboring cities Chengdu and Suining, it's easy to know when you've arrived. A lush array of cypress trees, lavender-colored shrubbery and neatly close-cut grass greets visitors entering from the west, as a preview of the unique experience to follow. The city, with roots dating back to the early Sui Dynasty from 581 to 618, is becoming more environmentally sustainable and efficient. "There is so much beautiful scenery here," said Zhao Weisu, a city spokesman. "We feel it's our responsibility for our people and our visitors to preserve it." Since 2011, the provincial government has stepped up to protect the Jialing River Basin, building 13 of 33 new Sichuan wetlands parks in the city of Nanchong. A national wetland pilot park in Nanchong will be built by 2020, officials said. Nanchong has also recently built four national-level forest parks, two Taihe Egret Nature reserves and five national-level wetlands parks. Officials hope the new environmental efforts enhance a city already known for its hospitality and internationally recognized cuisine to draw more tourists. In Nanchong, finding a spicy hotpot restaurant is about as easy as coming across a cicada or an egret along the Jialing River - they are everywhere. The local cuisine's bold flavors, highlighted by the pungency of garlic, chili peppers, ginger and the citrus-like Sichuan pepper have been replicated across the country and the world as a staple of Chinese gastronomy. But it's best in the province where it originated. Dishes like mapo doufu (spicy tofu with pork), fuqi feipian (beef stomach in chili oil, with peanuts) and chuanbei liangfen (mung bean jelly in hot sauce), combined with a herbal tea, watermelon juice or cold glass of beer make for a flavorful and memorable gastronomic experience. And while the food is intensely spicy, the laid-back and friendly nature of Nanchong residents is perhaps the cooling contrast that makes this city so delightfully balanced. Zhao proudly proclaims the people of his city promote a culture of hospitality with "an appreciation for life." "When you come to Nanchong, you're a friend," he explained. "We're a very welcoming and inclusive city with people who enjoy living here." The city's tourism attractions have received recognition both nationally and abroad. Wang Biao, a shadow puppeteer in northern Nanchong municipality Langzhong, continues to practice and teach the traditional entertainment in honor of his late grandfather. Operating in a 42,000 square-foot facility in Lanzhong's ancient city-one of four ancient cities in China - Wang is frequently asked to perform across the mainland. His grandfather, Wang Wenkun, once performed at the world-renowned Golden Concert Hall in Vienna, in 1988. Also in Lanzhong, Nanjinguan Town is one of about 250 tourist attractions in China to earn a five-star government rating as a national tourist attraction, said Jiang Xiaoping, a Lanzhong spokesman. Its nighttime entertainment, Langyuan Fairyland, features a dozen different performances displaying the area's intangible cultural heritage with song and dance. At the end of the riveting artistic performances, spectators are left with a view of the Jialing River and the picturesque lights of homes, businesses and watercrafts surrounding it. "It's one of the nicest views in Sichuan," Jiang said. "We encourage our visitors to really pause for a second and take in the view around them."While the Jialing River flows 1,120 kilometers into the mouth of the Yangtze, the roughly 300 km that flow through Nanchong is among the most significant, local officials said.

                    Austria's alpine skiing king Marcel Hirscher announces retirement

            <p class="style-content">
                VIENNA - Eight-time overall World Cup champion Marcel Hirscher announced his retirement Wednesday evening in Salzburg."Today is the day I'll end my active career," said Hirscher at a news conference titled "Review, insight, preview"."There are several reasons, and the decision was made two weeks ago," the Alpine ski star said about his farewell."I'm incredibly lucky to be able to sit here with two healthy knees," he said. "I want to play soccer with my kid, ride motocross, and I'm glad I can do it now, and I'm fortunate to be healthy and survive my career without major injury."The 30-year-old Salzburger, arguably one of the best alpine skiers in history, has won numerous accolades in his career, including eight consecutive World Cup titles, seven world championships and two gold medals at the 2018 Olympics Winter Games."If you stop now, at the peak of your career, I can understand that," said President Alexander Van der Bellen in a televised message. "Thank you for the excitement and joy that you have given to all of us, to Austria."Hirscher married his longtime girlfriend, Laura Moisl, last June and the couple welcomed their first child, a boy, into the world in October.According to a large survey on KURIER.at, Hirscher is Austria's greatest athlete, followed by the late F1 legend Niki Lauda and Hermann Maier, another alpine skiing champion and Olympic gold medallist nicknamed the "Herminator".

                    Environmental authority promises stronger fight against ozone depletion
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China's top environmental watchdog pledged to enhance the management of ozone depleting substances through an online monitoring system and by establishing more testing laboratories to facilitate law enforcement, as the world celebrated the 25th International Ozone Layer Protection Day on Monday.Significant progress has been made in the control of ozone depleting substances in China since the country joined the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer 30 years ago. So far, China has phased out 280,000 metric tons of the substances, accounting for about half the total reduction by developing nations, Li Ganjie, minister of ecology and environment, said during a meeting to commemorate the day in Jinan, Shandong province.The Journal Nature published a study in May 2018 claiming that the atmospheric levels of CFC-11-an ozone depleting substance that has been globally banned-are significantly higher than expected because of unexpected emissions in East Asia.Li reiterated the country's zero-tolerance policy toward the illegal production and use of ozone depleting substances and said the Chinese government rolled out special law enforcement campaigns after the study was published.Law enforcement officers inspected 1,172 enterprises in 2018. This year, they conducted 24-hour on-site supervision in the facilities of all 16 manufacturers of CTC-an ozone depleting substance and a major raw material for CFC-11 production-and also rolled out online monitoring, he elaborated.Despite challenges to speed up the phasing-out of ozone depleting substance as required and to inspect for banned ones, Li said China will "confront these challenges boldly" and "honor its promise resolutely"."China is willing to continue in-depth exchanges and cooperation with other parties and international organizations on policies and regulations for convention implementation, supervision measures, capacity building and alternative technologies," he said.In addition to the Vienna convention, China also joined the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer in 1991.Liu Bingjiang, head of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment's Air Quality Management Department, said the online monitoring system has been installed in the facilities of seven CTC manufacturers and will be extended to the other nine by the end of this year to watch for illegal production of CFC-11."The online monitoring system will be connected to the ministry's supervision platform," he added.The ministry has dispatched 20 sets of portable detection equipment to local environmental authorities and will hand out another 30 sets by the end of this year, he said.He said the ministry established six testing laboratories for industrial products this year and it is still working on qualification for these labs to ensure that "they could offer legally valid testing data" by the end of this year. Another two labs are in the pipeline.He added that China also plans to establish a monitoring network to promote the country's capability in assessing its progress in implementing control conventions.
