                Philippine legislation does not require clearance or prior notification of foreign vessels passing through the waters within its baselines On Aug 20, Senator Christopher Lawrence Go said the Philippine government would require vessels from other countries to notify the Philippine authorities about their impending passage through "territorial waters" and get approval from proper government authority well in advance. It was reportedly a response to Chinese warships passing through the Situba Strait in July and August. Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr also said he filed a diplomatic protest to China over the ships' passage, and Philippine presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said it is a violation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) since they passed through the Philippine's "exclusive economic zone". It seems that the Philippine government officials are confused about the status of waters around the Sibutu passage - whether they are territorial sea, exclusive economic zone or archipelagic waters. Consisting of more than 7,000 islands and islets located around 600 miles off the southeastern coast of the Asian mainland, the Philippines is an Archipelagic State that made a significant contribution to the recognition of Archipelagic State status at the UN negotiation conferences of the UNCLOS. The 1987 Philippine Constitution stated that there is no difference between internal waters and archipelagic waters while the UNCLOS distinguishes the two. In 2009, the Philippines updated its archipelagic baselines through R.A. 9522, otherwise known as an Act to Amend Certain Provisions of Republic Act No. 3046, as Amended by Republic Act No. 5446, to define the Archipelagic Baselines of the Philippines, and for Other Purposes. However, it does not identify whether the waters within the baselines are archipelagic waters or internal waters, and it did not specify the breadth of the territorial sea. Moreover, while it is a consequence of acquiring archipelagic status to designate archipelagic sea lanes passage, it has so far not submitted a proposal to the International Maritime Organization designating archipelagic sea lanes passage. According to Article 53 paragraph 12, "if an archipelagic State does not designate sea lanes or air routes, the right of archipelagic sea lanes passage may be exercised through the routes normally used for international navigation". The Situba passage is a deep channel about 18 miles wide connecting the Sulu Sea with the Sulawesi Sea. It is one of the eight most important straits lying wholly within Philippine archipelagic waters. It is an important transit route for international trade between the Pacific and the Indian Ocean. Thus the Situba passage is a route "normally used for international navigation" that all vessels can sail through as an archipelagic sea lanes passage, including Chinese naval vessels. Some also accused China of having a "double standard" since it requires foreign vessels to have prior authorization in its territorial waters. But the accusation makes no sense. China does require foreign warships to apply for passage in its territorial sea according to the 1992 Law of Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone. It did not notify the Philippine government simply because the Philippine government has made no such requirement. The Philippines has no domestic law requiring foreign vessels to get such clearance before passing through the waters within its archipelagic baseline. In 2011, the Supreme Court stated that the sovereignty of Philippines over the waters within the archipelagic baselines is subject to the rights of innocent passage and archipelagic sea lanes passage as provided for under international law. However, the Philippine legislation never requires clearance or prior notification of foreign vessels passing through the waters within its baselines. China respects Philippine domestic legislation and will notify relevant authorization if there's such a legal requirement. Despite the unresolved territorial and maritime delimitation dispute, political relations between China and the Philippines have improved dramatically in the past three years. Stable top-level relations also help promote maritime cooperation and facilitate the expansion of economic deals. China has been the Philippines' largest trade partner since 2016 and its biggest investor since last year. The two countries established the Bilateral Consultation Mechanism and already held four conferences so far. Coastguard cooperation is also on schedule. The relationship between China and the Philippines is now on a healthy track and is perhaps as good as it has ever been. There is no reason for China to send military vessels to intentionally pose a security threat as it would damage bilateral relations. The passage of Chinese ships through Sibutu passage should not be a problem or concern. President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to make his fifth trip to China on Aug 28. It is better to save time to discuss real significant issues such as how to achieve a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea at the earliest date and resolve the long-standing disputes in a peaceful way.

                    Valverde: I'm not thinking about Neymar arrival

                 MADRID - FC Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde continues to avoid questions over the possible return of Brazilian forward Neymar Jr to the club.Speaking to the press ahead of Barca's friendly against Napoli in the United States Valverde was again asked about the Brazilian, who is also being linked with a move to Barca's traditional rivals, Real Madrid.When asked if Neymar's arrival would unbalance the Barca squad, he replied, "that is supposing he arrives.""We don't know what is going to happen and I am not thinking about it. I am thinking about our next game and we will have to see what happens. I am working with the players that I have," commented Valverde.Barca have signed Antoine Griezmann, left back Junior Firpo, goalkeeper Neto and midfielder Frenkie de Jong for the new season and Valverde said he was "always happy with the squad," he has."I have got some great players. They are players who apart from half of a game (Champions League against Liverpool) and the Cup final, did everything almost perfectly. We have made some important signings and we will try to improve," commented the coach, who also spoke about the pressure ahead of his third season at the Camp Nou."The Barca coach is always in being looked at and people remember defeats more than wins. I accept that and we will try to win all of our games. That is what we did in my first season and against last season," he concluded.

                Stocks sell off as persistent US-China trade dispute spurs recession talk by analystsUS-China trade jitters and fears of a worldwide economic slowdown sparked a stock market selloff on Monday.The continuing trade dispute with China is hitting the US economy harder than anticipated and increasing the risk of a recession next year, according to analysts and investment bank Goldman Sachs.Companies with large investments in China, including heavy-equipment makers Caterpillar and John Deere and aircraft maker Boeing all saw their shares fall on Monday.Analysts said they don't expect a trade deal to be reached before the 2020 presidential election.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Monday at 25,896.44, down 391 points or 1.49 percent from Friday's close. The Nasdaq Composite index closed at 7,863.41, down 95.73 points, or 1.20 percent. The S&P 500 finished at 2882.70, down 35.95 points, or 1.23 percent."Fears that the trade war will trigger a recession are growing," Jan Hatzius, chief US economist at Goldman Sachs, said on Sunday in a research note to investors."I would put the chance of a recession in the second half of 2020 at about 30 percent," Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, told China Daily. "Partly because the economy has done so well for so long, partly because the trade war with China and partly because of sluggish growth in Europe and Japan. Probably the biggest warning sign of a recession ahead is weak commodity prices, particularly copper."Copper is often viewed as a leading economic indicator because it has many applications in major sectors of the economy, including autos, home construction and electronics as well as electrical generation and transmission.The high for copper in 2019 was $2.96 a pound. It was recently trading at $2.59. Copper is down 21.52 percent from its 2018 peak of $3.30 a pound.Andrew Karolyi, a professor of economics and the Harold Bierman Jr distinguished professor of management at Cornell University, said a worldwide slowdown eventually will affect the US."The US economy and its financial markets continue to be highly integrated with those of the rest of the world," he told China Daily. "As China's, Europe's and the rest of the world's economic growth slows, eventually so must the economy of the US, regardless of how strong a run it has experienced in the past several years."The trade dispute between China and the US is salient since it reflects one of the key links integrating the US and the world," he said. "But it is important not to exaggerate its importance. Some of the better warning signs of a US recession ahead may be the fundamental news about slowing manufacturing growth numbers in Germany and Italy and credit tightening in China."Goldman Sachs didn't quantify the recession risk, but analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal see a 33.6 probability of a recession in the next 12 months. Goldman Sachs cut its estimate of fourth-quarter growth in the US to 1.8 percent from 2 percent."We now estimate a peak cumulative drag on the Gross Domestic Product at 0.6 percent, including 0.2 percent from the latest escalation,'' Hatzius said. "The business sentiment effect of increased pessimism about the outlook from trade war news may lead firms to invest, hire or produce less."Two weeks ago, US President Donald Trump threatened to impose a new 10 percent tariff on additional Chinese goods valued at $300 billion beginning Sept 1. On Aug 5, Beijing responded by halting purchases of US agricultural products.In July, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates a quarter-point to spur growth.The current US economic boom started in June 2009 and is now the longest cycle in US history, breaking the run of 120 months of economic growth from March 1991 to March 2001, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.

                Consumer spending boosted the US economy in July, raising stocks on Thursday after Wednesday's 800-point and easing immediate fears of a recession.Retail sales, including brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce and restaurants, increased at a seasonally adjusted 0.7 percent in July from June. Excluding cars, retail sales were up 1 percent in July, the US Commerce Department reported.Consumer spending, which represents about two-thirds of the US economy, grew 1.8 percent May-through-July compared with the previous three months.Overall, the US gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services, grew at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the second quarter compared with 3.1 percent in the first quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported.The market rallied on the solid retail report in early trading, turned negative in the afternoon and rallied before the close. It was a sharp rebound from Wednesday when fears about the bond market dove stocks lower.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 25,579.39, up 99.97 points of 0.39 percent. The Nasdaq composite closed at 7,766.62, down 7.32 points, or 0.09 percent."There are emerging signs about weakening fundamentals with slowing economic growth worldwide," Andrew Karolyi, a professor economics and the Harold Bierman Jr distinguished professor of management at Cornell University, told China Daily. "In the short-run what we are seeing is heightened uncertainty about what is ahead.''Walmart, the world's largest retailer, said second-quarter sales at domestic stores and websites operating at least 12 months increased 2.8 percent driven by strong grocery sales. The company reported second-quarter revenue of $130.4 billion, up 1.8 percent from a year ago. Walmart has reported growth for 20 quarters, or five years, an achievement unmatched by any other retail chain.In China, Walmart said same-store sales increased 3 percent, and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd reported a 42 percent increase in sales and more than doubled profit in its latest quarter despite the domestic economy being weakened by the US-China trade dispute. The company's shares rose 3 percent to $166.97 in New York trading.US industrial output declined 0.2 percent in July as the manufacturing sector continued to be buffeted by the on-going US-China trade dispute, underscoring the importance of consumer spending in the US economy.Disposable income increased 4.9 percent to $193.4 billion in the second quarter compared with an increase of $190.6 billion, or 4.8 percent, in the first quarter.But personal savings totaled $1.32 trillion in the second quarter, according to the government figures, compared with $1.37 trillion in the first quarter, suggesting consumers are still spending.Belinda Robinson contributed to this story.

                    Zidane: Bale to stay at Real Madrid
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                MADRID -- Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said Saturday that Welsh international Gareth Bale would not be leaving the club this summer.Zidane spoke to the press following his side's 3-1 win away to Celta Vigo in their opening league game of the season.His words come a few weeks after he said in the USA that the "best thing" for both Bale and the club would be if the forward was sold over the summer and subsequently leaving him out of most of his pre-season line-ups.However, with the English and Chinese transfer markets closed and Phillippe Coutinho joining Bayern Munich, there seems to be little chance of Bale leaving before the end of the month, and with Eden Hazard injured, Bale was a surprise starter on Saturday.Bale justified his inclusion with an impressive display and helped set up Karim Benzema for Madrid's opening goal of the game."He's here with all of us and I am happy about the game that he played and he is going to stay," said Zidane in his post-game press conference."The work of Vinicius JR and Gareth has been very good," he insisted, before adding that Real Madrid had, "showed solidarity in their game, we kept out lines close and we were effective with the ball. I am happy with what we have done," he said.Tony Kroos and Lucas Vazquez scored Madrid's second and third goals of the game and they will now face Valladolid at home next weekend.

                    Hong Kong officials urge dialogue to restore order, revive economy
                </p>
            </a>

                HONG KONG - Continued internal strife has worsened Hong Kong's economy, officials and lawmakers warned Sunday, calling for restoring social order and strengthening dialogue among all walks of life to show a united front on developing Hong Kong.The deteriorating external environment and the continued violent protests in Hong Kong are creating an "economic typhoon", Paul Chan Mo-po, financial secretary of the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), wrote in an article online.According to Chan, the aggregate unemployment rate of the retail, accommodation and food services sectors, which create 600,000 jobs, has risen from 3.4 percent at the start of the year to 4.3 percent, with 27,500 unemployed.According to data from the Census and Statistics Department, the number of unemployed persons increased by around 4,200 from 114, 300 in April-June to 118, 500 in May-July."In retrospect, the unemployment situation deteriorates much faster than people would expect," said Chan, citing Hong Kong's experience of weathering several economic crises over the past two decades, including the bursting of the dotcom bubble, where unemployment rate rose from 4.4 percent at the end of 2000 to 7.5 percent in mid-2002, and then to 8.5 percent in 2003.The negative impact of the protracted strife on Hong Kong's economy has begun to emerge, Chan said, adding that it depends on the Hong Kong people's decision whether the impact would be deeper and broader and affect more people's livelihood or not."We hope that everyone can let the Hong Kong society calm down first. Let consultation replace conflicts and let dialogue replace fists, so as to safeguard Hong Kong as our common home and avoid more residents' jobs and livelihood being affected," said Chan.In another article posted online, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury James Henry Lau Jr. said that Hong Kong's economic growth is becoming increasingly sluggish due to external factors, including the U.S.-China trade frictions and a possible "hard Brexit" of Britain from the European Union, as well as social strife within the Hong Kong society.While the macro environment affecting Hong Kong's economy cannot be changed, Lau said that he hopes the Hong Kong society can resolve its internal strife as soon as possible.Otherwise, international investors may lose confidence in Hong Kong, which will cause long-term harm to Hong Kong, he warned.Lau urged all parties in the Hong Kong society to put aside their prejudices and antagonism, return to reason, and safeguard Hong Kong's hard-earned achievements.Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam on Saturday called for dialogue after meeting a group of people who seek to solve the current situation on how to build a platform for dialogue."To solve Hong Kong's current problems, there is no other way than to communicate, listen and act," Lau said.In an interview with local media, Hong Kong Legislative Council member Yiu Si-wing said that due to the protracted protests, a number of indicators of the tourism industry dropped drastically in August, with the largest decline in inbound passenger arrivals.The impact is most pronounced on tour guides who depend on leading tour groups for a living, said the lawmaker who represents tourism.Yiu warned that if the protests drag on, the impact would be far-reaching for the service industry.

                    Trump pushes for G7 summit at his resort; critics pounce
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                MIAMI — President Donald Trump was in full sales mode Monday, doing everything but pass out brochures as he touted the features that would make the Doral golf resort the ideal place for the next G7 Summit — close to the airport, plenty of hotel rooms, separate buildings for every delegation, even top facilities for the media.There's just one detail he left out: He owns the place.Government ethics watchdogs have long railed against the perils of Trump earning money off the presidency and hosting foreign leaders at his properties. They say Trump's proposal to bring world leaders to his Miami-area resort takes the conflict of interest to a whole new level because, unlike stays at his Washington, they would have no choice but to spend money at his property."It's ethics violation squared," said Kathleen Clark of Washington University School of Law in St. Louis.Added Larry Noble, a former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission, "This is him making it perfectly mandatory that they stay at his resort."Trump's proposal at the current G7 Summit in Biarritz, France, portrayed the Doral resort in the most glowing terms, even though he said later he was more interested in logistics for the meeting than making money."We have a series of magnificent buildings ... very luxurious rooms," Trump told reporters. "We have incredible conference rooms, incredible restaurants, it's like — it's like such a natural."Trump's pitch comes as several lawsuits accusing the president of violating the US Constitution's emoluments clause, which bans gifts from foreign governments, wind their way through the courts.It also comes as Doral, by far the biggest revenue generator among the Trump Organization's 17 golf properties, appears to have taken a hit from Trump's move into politics.The trouble began during soon after Trump announced he was running for the presidency in 2015 with a speech that called Mexican immigrants crossing the border illegally rapists and murders. Businesses started cutting ties to the president. The PGA and NASCAR moved events that used to be booked at Doral elsewhere.Eric Trump, who is overseeing the business with his older brother, Don Jr., told The Associated Press last year that "the Doral is on fire." But a financial disclosure report filed with the federal government this year showed revenue at the club has barely been growing — up just $1 million to $76 million.Trump's financial disclosure also shows he owes a lot of money to Deutsche Bank for the property, which helped him buy it in 2012. As of the end of last year, Trump had two mortgages on the resort, one for more than $50 million, the other for as much as $25 million.A Trump Organization consultant told the Miami-Dade Value Adjustment Board last year that the property was "severely underperforming," according to The Washington Post. The local government cut the resort's assessed value for 2018 from $110.3 million to $105.6 million, according to county records.Another sign of trouble is the long list of former Doral members who quit the club years ago but are still waiting for their initial deposits back. New members have to join first for old ones to get refunds, but that isn't happening, according to Doral member Peter Brooke. He says some former members have been waiting for 10 years or longer.Brooke said a G7 summit would bring in "considerable income" for the club, citing the need to accommodate Secret Service, guards and other staff that must accompany each foreign government delegation. "They would have to house all of them at the various lodges, not to mention food and more staff," he said.In an effort to assuage critics, Trump agreed before he took office to donate profits from foreign government spending at its properties. But the company is private, so it's not certain the $340,000 donated so far is all of the profits, or even precisely how "profits" is defined.The company has also said it doesn't actively seek foreign government business, and even tries to turn it away. Earlier this year, Eric Trump said the company goes "to great lengths" to discourage such spending.It's not clear how hosting the G7 would square with this policy. The Trump Organization did not respond to several requests for comment.At Monday's news conference, Trump spoke as if the idea of making money off the summit never entered his mind. In fact, he said, other people were pushing Doral as a venue — not just him. He said the Secret Service and the military have been visiting various sites and appear to have formed a bit of consensus already."They went to places all over the country and they came back and they said, 'This is where we'd like to be,'" Trump said. "It's not about me. It's about getting the right location."He then added: "I'm not going to make any money. I don't want to make money. I don't care about making money."AP

                LONDON - Vasyl Lomachenko's big goal in boxing is to become unified champion in one weight category.He's one win away from achieving that dream.Considered among the world's greatest pound-for-pound fighters, Lomachenko added the vacant WBC belt to his WBA and WBO titles at lightweight with a unanimous points win over Britain's Luke Campbell on Saturday.Two judges awarded the fight 119-108 to Lomachenko, with the other giving it to the Ukrainian 118-109 at the O2 Arena in London-the city where, seven years ago to the day, he won one of his two Olympic gold medals.Campbell, also an Olympic champ in 2012, gave Lomachenko problems with his longer reach but struggled to make it to the final bell after being knocked down in the 11th and desperately wrestling his opponent to the canvas in the 12th while in survival mode.A stunning amateur fighter, Lomachenko is breaking records as a pro, having become the quickest boxer to win world titles at three weights, in just 12 fights.Only Ghana's Richard Commey, who holds the IBF title, stands between Lomachenko and a sweep of the 135-pound belts. Commey is set to fight mandatory challenger Teofimo Lopez Jr. in December, and perhaps Lomachenko after that."Next, IBF. This is my title," Lomachenko said.The technique, athleticism and foot speed that stands Lomachenko apart from the rest only shone through against Campbell after he made his first breakthrough in the fight-a short left to the face that plunged Campbell back to the ropes in the fifth round.While Lomachenko connected with more power punches-136 to 87 in the end-the rounds stayed close, with Campbell, a southpaw, connecting a few times with his looping left hook.The 11th was where Lomachenko showed his class, following up a flurry of body shots with a straight right to the face that sent Campbell backward and down for an eight count. Lomachenko landed 31 power punches in that round alone, and Campbell was saved by the bell.A visibly tiring Campbell struck a low blow in the 12th before virtually rugby-tackling Lomachenko to the floor late in, much to the bemusement of the Ukrainian.The result wasn't in doubt as they waited for the judges' scoring."He's a special fighter, we all knew he was a special fighter," said Campbell (20-3, 16 KOs), who also lost to Jorge Linares in a split decision in 2017. "It's hard to come up with a game plan when someone like that is so good in front of you."The 31-year-old Lomachenko (14-1, 10 KOs) said he wanted to fight again in Britain. By that time, he might have become undisputed lightweight champion and be fighting at another weight."We are looking to win the fourth belt to unify the title," his promoter, Bob Arum, said in the ring.On the undercard, Britain's Charlie Edwards retained his WBC world flyweight title after video evidence overturned his stoppage loss to Mexican opponent Julio Cesar Martinez.After Edwards took a knee in the third round following a flurry of shots, Martinez landed a punch to Edwards' ribs that was missed by referee Mark Lyson.Martinez was declared the winner to jeers from the home fans but WBC supervisor Mauricio Sulaiman-watching at ringside-declared the fight a no-contest and said there would be a rematch.In the heavyweight division, Alexander Povetkin won a unanimous points decision over Hughie Fury-the cousin of former world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury-to claim the vacant WBA International title.
