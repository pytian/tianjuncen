                Trump vows to end HIV spread within 10 years, critics skeptical
            </p>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON -- US President Donald Trump has unveiled a bold plan to stop spread of HIV within a decade in the United States despite challenges posed by his lack of action to improve the healthcare system.In the annual State of the Union address delivered on Tuesday night, Trump urged his audience in Congress to work on to "eliminate the HIV epidemic" in the country "within 10 years."This is the second time that Trump used his annual speech in the Congress to make big promises in beating back health scourges. Last year, Trump set a red flag to tackle opioid crisis but the money for a wide expansion of addiction treatment is still lacking as he prioritized to cut back the country's healthcare services.In the United States, more than 1 million people aged 13 and older are living with HIV infection, with an estimated 15 percent unaware of their status, and approximately 56,000 new infections occur each year, according to National Institutes of Health (NIH).Trump based his ambitious pledge on "scientific breakthroughs" in recent years. It did hold some water as the Food and Drug Administration approved three new drugs in 2018 to fight the global epidemic and at least one HIV vaccine has been put into clinical trial with promising results.However, as the epidemic disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities, women of color, and men who have sex with men, the drive to end the HIV spread is more a social issue than a scientific one.AIDS United, a non-profit organization, said in a statement that they "are cautiously encouraged" by Trump's promise, since "this administration's actions speak louder than words and have moved us in the wrong direction."Trump proposed in his fiscal 2019 budget to cut the domestic HIV/AIDS program by 43 million U.S. dollars and worked to roll back the healthcare services in the Obama era."The President's attacks on the Affordable Care Act and proposed cuts to non-defense discretionary spending have threatened to undermine our efforts to end the HIV epidemic," according to AIDS United's statement.The disparity among populations to have access to medical protections made the situation worse.African American and Hispanics are the most vulnerable group of HIV infections, but they are poorly covered by healthcare services like Medicaid and Medicare.The Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-profit organization on healthcare issues, cited "poverty, lack of access to health care, lack of awareness of HIV status, and stigma" as challenges for the epidemic among the most vulnerable communities.Trump didn't make substantial moves in fighting HIV/AIDS in his first two years in office. Medicaid is "the single largest source of coverage for people with HIV in the US," according to Kaiser Family Foundation, but the Trump administration encouraged states to cut funding for the program.A recent proposal made by Trump on the reform of Medicare would dismantle most of protections for people living with serious conditions, like HIV and may threaten to "reignite the domestic epidemic as opposed to positioning us to end it," according to the AIDS United.The epidemic prevention has not been on Trump's high agenda, making his ambitious 10-year strategy suspicious. The Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS did not meet at all in 2018, according to a report released by the Fenway Institute, an LGBTQ health organization.Trump has not appointed a new director for the White House Office of National AIDS Policy since its previous chief resigned in January 2017. The office's page within the White House's official website showed a 404 error: That page cannot be found.

                Heavy screen time appears to impact children's brains, ongoing study shows
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - Researchers have found "different patterns" in brain scans among children who record heavy smart device and video game use, according to initial data from a major ongoing US study.The first wave of information from the $300 million National Institutes of Health study is showing that those 9-and 10-year-old kids spending more than seven hours a day using such devices show signs of premature thinning of the cortex, the brain's outermost layer that processes sensory information."We don't know if it's being caused by the screen time. We don't know yet if it's a bad thing," said Gaya Dowling, an NIH doctor working on the project, explaining the preliminary findings in an interview with the CBS news program 60 Minutes."What we can say is that this is what the brains look like of kids who spend a lot of time on screens. And it's not just one pattern," Dowling said.The NIH data reported on CBS also showed that kids who spend more than two hours a day on screens score worse on language and reasoning tests.The study - which involves scanning the brains of 4,500 children - eventually aims to show whether screen time is addictive, but researchers need several years to understand such long-term outcomes."In many ways, the concern that investigators like I have is that we're sort of in the midst of a natural kind of uncontrolled experiment on the next generation of children," Dimitri Christakis, a lead author of the American Academy of Pediatrics' most recent guidelines on screen time, told 60 Minutes.Initial data from the study will begin to be released in early 2019.The academy now recommends parents "avoid digital media use - except video chatting - in children younger than 18 to 24 months".Agence France-Presse

                Chinese HEV vaccine begins clinical trial in US
            </a>
            <p>
                XIAMEN - A Chinese vaccine against the Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) has entered clinical trial in the United States after two US volunteers were vaccinated on May 1 (local time), according to Xiamen University.The trial will be carried out in three phases. The phase 1 clinical trial is scheduled to enroll 25 US volunteers, and Phase 2 and 3 FDA-approved trials of the vaccine are expected to be done in a third country.The vaccine, sold under the trade name Hecolin, was initially developed by a research team from Xiamen University in East China's Fujian province and then transferred to and commercialized by the Xiamen Innovax Biotech Co., Ltd.Hecolin has been used in China since 2012 for the prevention of hepatitis E.It has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to enter a clinical trial in January.It is the first time that FDA has given a green light to a Chinese vaccine to enter a clinical trial in the United States, according to Zhang Jun, deputy director of National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases at Xiamen University.According to Zhang, the trial was sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the primary agency of the US government responsible for biomedical and public health research.Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by HEV, which is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water and food. Large outbreaks of the disease have been reported in at least 30 countries in Africa, Asia and North America.According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report in 2015, there are approximately 20 million HEV infections, 3.4 million symptomatic cases and 70,000 deaths globally every year.The disease is typically most life-threatening among pregnant women, with a fatality rate of 10 percent to 50 percent. People with pre-existing chronic liver disease are prone to develop severe hepatitis following HEV infection.

                Academia reacts to professors’ firings
            </a>
            <p>
                Emory University's recent decision to terminate two Chinese-American professors has increased concerns among researchers and administrators at US universities, amid ongoing tensions between China and the US.In a statement published on Science magazine's website, Li Xiaojiang, a veteran neuroscientist at the Department of Human Genetics at Emory University School of Medicine who had been working there for 23 years, said he "was shocked that Emory University would terminate a tenured professor in such an unusual and abrupt fashion and close our combined lab consisting of a number of graduates and postdoctoral trainees without giving me specific details for the reasons behind my termination".The Atlanta-based private university said in a statement that the decision came after the university's investigation, prompted by a National Institutes of Health (NIH) inquiry, revealed "that two of its faculty members named as key personnel on NIH grant awards to Emory University had failed to fully disclose foreign sources of research funding and the extent of their work for research institutions and universities in China".Although the university didn't identify the former staffers, Science magazine has identified the scientists as Li and his wife Li Shihua — both US citizens and both professors of biology.The university fired the couple on May 16 when the Lis were traveling in China. It also closed a laboratory jointly led by the Lis and told four Chinese postdoctoral students who worked at the lab to leave the US in 30 days, according to Li's statement.The action came after the NIH, the main funding source for biomedical and public health research in the US, sent a letter to more than 10,000 academic research universities last August that urged institutions to work with the NIH and other agencies, including the FBI, to crack down on foreign influence.Recipients of US federal funds have to disclose if they are receiving funds from other countries and are not permitted to share their grant applications with foreign governments.In April, NIH Director Francis Collins told a Senate committee that the agency was investigating NIH-funded foreign scientists at more than 55 US institutions, according to Science.However, Li said he "has disclosed my Chinese research activity to Emory University each year since 2012", adding that he has provided documents requested by the university during the investigation of his research activities in China since November 2018.Li also noted that he had not received "any copy of the investigation that was sent to NIH by Emory, though I have requested Emory to give it to me".The Lis also said in the statement that they feel that their experience is part of a larger problem with the way foreigners are treated, adding that Emory's action "negatively derides Emory faculty members and international visitors, especially those of Chinese origin".They urged the university's president to "recognize the contributions of Emory's diverse global community, and the enumerable benefit to science, research and education locally and globally".Emory's statement said that the university "remains committed to the free exchange of ideas and research and to our vital collaborations with researchers from around the world. At the same time, Emory also takes very seriously its obligation to be a good steward of federal research dollars and to ensure compliance with all funding disclosure and other requirements."Yale University President Peter Salovey said in an open letter sent to students and faculty last week as Emory terminated the two professors, "In recent weeks, tensions in United States-China relations and increased scrutiny of academic exchanges have added to a sense of unease among many international students and scholars here at Yale and at universities across the country."Salovey affirmed the Ivy League school's "steadfast commitment" to its foreign talent and said, "openness — a key to the extraordinary success of America's great research universities — must remain a hallmark of Yale"."Scientific progress has long been based on the open exchange of ideas," Frank H. Wu, chairman of the Committee of 100, a non-profit leadership organization of prominent Chinese Americans, told China Daily.Personnel and cultural exchange "should not be politicized and interfered with," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Monday."This is inconsistent with the aspirations of the two peoples and has caused widespread concern among the academic circles of China and the United States and all sectors of society," Lu said.

                University firings raise tensions in academia

                Chinese-American professors' US tenures endedThe decision by a prestigious university in the United States to terminate the tenures of two Chinese-American professors has heightened concerns among researchers and administrators at academic institutions.One of the professors, Li Xiaojiang, a veteran neuroscientist at the Department of Human Genetics at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia, who had worked there for 23 years, issued a statement on the decision to Science magazine.Li said he was "shocked that Emory University would terminate a tenured professor in such an unusual and abrupt fashion and close our combined lab consisting of a number of graduates and postdoctoral trainees without giving me specific details for the reasons behind my termination".The private university said in a statement that the decision came after an investigation by the institution prompted by a National Institutes of Health inquiry.It said the inquiry revealed that two of its faculty members named as key personnel on NIH grant awards to the university had failed to fully disclose foreign sources of funding and the extent of their work for institutions and universities in China.Although the university did not name the former faculty members, Science magazine identified them as Li and his wife, Li Shihua, both professors of biology and also US citizens.According to Li's statement, the university fired the couple on May 16 when they were traveling in China. It also closed a laboratory jointly led by the couple and told four Chinese postdoctoral students who worked there to leave the US within 30 days.The action came after the NIH, the main funding source for biomedical and public health research in the US, sent a letter to more than 10,000 academic research institutions in August urging them to work with it and other agencies, including the FBI, to crack down on foreign influence.Recipients of US federal funds must disclose if they are also receiving funds from other countries, and they are not permitted to share their grant applications with foreign entities.Last month, NIH Director Francis Collins told a Senate committee that the agency was investigating NIH-funded foreign scientists at more than 55 US institutions, according to Science magazine.Li said he had disclosed his Chinese research activity to Emory University each year since 2012, adding that he had provided documents requested by the university during the investigation.He also said he had not received any copy of the investigation that was sent to the NIH by the university, although he had asked Emory for one.US media reports said the NIH alleged the couple had also been hired for positions in China, where they received funding to create shadow laboratories to conduct the same research they were doing in the US.The couple said they felt their case was part of a larger problem with the way foreigners are treated in the US, adding that the university's action "negatively derides Emory faculty members and international visitors, especially those of Chinese origin".They urged the university's president to issue a statement to "recognize the contributions of Emory's diverse global community, and the innumerable benefits to science, research and education locally and globally".The university said in a statement that it "remains committed to the free exchange of ideas and research and to our vital collaborations with researchers from around the world. At the same time, Emory also takes very seriously its obligation to be a good steward of federal research dollars and to ensure compliance with all funding disclosure and other requirements".

                Academics fear Trump's policies will stifle international cooperation
            </a>
            <p>
                President Donald Trump's protectionist trade conflict with Beijing has recently spilled over into academia with the dismissal and even detention of scientists with Chinese links who have long worked and studied in the United States.In the latest case, Indian-born Turab Lookman, a physicist who formerly worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory, was indicted last month for allegedly having lied about his links to China's Thousand Talents Program.Lookman, who was initially taken into custody, denies the charges, which the US Science magazine described as part of a crackdown on researchers who receive US government funds and allegedly fail to disclose ties to China.Earlier in May, a husband and wife team of neuroscientists, Li Xiaojiang and Li Shihua, were dismissed from their posts at Emory University in Georgia, despite their insistence that they had disclosed their links with China.The couple are US citizens and had worked at Emory for 23 years. Their lab, which works on Huntington disease, was also shut down and four post-doctoral students working there were ordered to return to China.These and other related cases have caused concern, not only among Chinese academics in the US but also among the institutions that have long hosted them.The top US journal for the sector, The Chronicle of Higher Education, has said that anxiety over a so-called "Trump effect", linked to his travel bans and anti-foreigner rhetoric, could block top students and scholars from going to the US and damage the standing of its higher education.Academic cooperation has been one of the main benefits of 40 years of improved ties between China and the US. The late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping told former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger at a Beijing banquet in 1979: "We have nothing to fear from Western education."In the intervening years, millions of Chinese students have attended universities in the US. One in three international students in the US is now from China.Many have stayed on to work as scientists and researchers, although in recent years the proportion of those returning home to work in China after graduation, the so-called "sea turtles", has grown to more than 80 percent.China's Thousand Talents Program is designed both to encourage these graduates to return home as well as to attract top foreign scientific talent to go to China.Despite fears in the US academic community of being sucked into Trump administration's conflict with Beijing, some have been forced to bow to federal government pressure.After the administration targeted Chinese-funded Confucious Institutes, Congress banned those institutes from using US federal funds for Chinese-language training.There are around 100 Confucious Institutes on US campuses and some universities have already decided to close them, rather than lose federal funds.US university administrators have also complained about being swamped by demands from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to provide information about NIH-funded faculty members who it believes have not disclosed links to foreign governments. According to Science magazine, the universities worry that this process could cast a chill over all types of international scientific collaboration.In a parallel crackdown, Chinese scientists are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain long-term US travel visas to work in the US, and even short-term visas to attend conferences or visit universities with which they collaborate.The New York Times reported in April that as many as 30 Chinese professors regarded as experts in China-US relations, had their visas to the US cancelled in the past year, or put on administrative review.Some scholars suspect that the crackdown has less to do with allegations of industrial espionage and unfair competition, as often expressed by the Trump administration, than with a strategy of reducing US dependence on trade with China, a central feature of the president's trade war.One scholar who had his visa cancelled, Wang Wen, executive dean of Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, told China's Global Times: "It is normal for China and the US to have competition and cooperation, and everyone just plays by the rules. Now, the US is beginning to feel anxious about the influence of Chinese scholars and they have decided not to play by the rules and cancel their visas."While no one would challenge the right of governments to show vigilance in protecting the security of their populations, the emerging US crackdown in the academic sector appears to go beyond such legitimate concerns.Scientific advances almost always come via international cooperation – for example, scientists from 100 nations use the facilities of the European Organization for Nuclear Research,known as CERN.At a time when the planet faces challenges that only science can confront – climate change, food security, disease control – it is surely an opportunity for more collaboration between international scholars, rather than less.

                Former NIH chief defends dismissed Chinese scientists
            </a>
            <p>
                A leading US biomedical scientist on Friday questioned some top US research institutions' recent practices of dismissing Chinese American scientists over security concerns, noting their contributions to the scientific and economic success of the United States.Elias Zerhouni, a former director of the National Institutes of Health, wrote in an editorial published "in the July 5 issue of Science magazine that it is understandable there is "consternation, sense of targeted discrimination, and fear" within the Chinese-American scientific community, and urged the administration to find explicit ways to reassure such communities.While the US policymakers had long been supporting scientific exchanges and collaborations with China, as Zerhouni recognized in the article, Chinese Scientists and Security, in recent months the tensions between the two countries have seemingly cast a shadow over such exchanges in fields including but not limited to biomedical science.Last year, NIH launched investigations in answer to federal officials' increasing concerns over exploitation of US-funded research by foreign countries, particularly China.Such efforts have resulted in three senior researchers ousted in April by the renowned Houston-based cancer research facility MD Anderson Cancer Center, due to the researchers' ties with China.A month later, Emory University fired a neuroscience research team headed by a Chinese couple Li Xiaojiang and Li Shihua, who allegedly failed to disclose China-related funding.The FBI has also reportedly urged US universities to develop protocols monitoring some of their Chinese students and scholars from Chinese state-affiliated research institutions, according to National Public Radio.Zerhouni said that many "rules" about disclosing foreign funding, now presented and enforced "as severe violations of US ethics and intellectual property regulations" were previously not rigorously implemented by many US institutions.The US has overall benefited from the contributions of foreign scientists, according to Zerhouni.The US "relies heavily on attracting the best and brightest in the world to its ecosystem of innovation" considering the size and intensity of its economy and its insufficient number of graduates from the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, he wrote.Heads from some leading US universities share such recognition.L. Rafael Reif, president of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, described Chinese and Chinese Americans researchers as not only "exemplary members of our community but exceptional contributors to American society" in an open letter sent campuswide titled Immigration Is a Kind of Oxygen.Students, scholars and faculty members from around the world make significant contributions to Yale's research and educational endeavors, the school's president Peter Salovey stressed in an open letter sent in May, where he also recognized the "increased scrutiny of academic exchanges" and the unease among international students and scholars.Both presidents noted in their letters the significance of the security concerns, as did Zerhouni, who described the security and protection of the country's science and technology as an issue "of paramount importance".In May, a bipartisan bill, Securing American Science and Technology Act, was introduced in the US House of Representatives aiming at encouraging discussions on science and security and dedicating a group in executive branch to tackle the issue.Calling the bill "a good step forward" while highlighting the urgency of the situation, Zerhouni encouraged the administration to also develop ways of preserving the country's attractiveness to foreign-born scientists, most particularly those from China.He questioned in the article if it would be in the national interest to risk "losing all or some of the extraordinarily productive" Chinese American scientists trained and supported for years in the United States."The United States should not risk losing critical intellectual assets such as productive foreign-born scientists and engineers" to serve short-term security concerns at the expense of long-term national interests, said Zerhouni.

                Efficacy test of new HIV vaccine against multiple strains to be launched
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson announced Monday a plan to carry out an HIV vaccine efficacy trial in North America, South America and Europe.This Phase 3 efficacy study will enroll 3,800 HIV-negative men and transgender people aged 18 to 60 years who have sex with men and/or transgender people.The study will evaluate an investigational vaccine called Mosaico based on "mosaic" immunogens, vaccine components comprising elements from multiple HIV subtypes, aiming to induce immune responses against a wide variety of global HIV strains."We are committed to developing a safe and effective preventive HIV vaccine suitable for the global populations most vulnerable to HIV acquisition," said Anthony S. Fauci, director of NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.It is anticipated to open for enrollment in the United States later this year and the clinical research will also be done in Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Mexico, Peru, Poland and Spain, according to NIH."We are in the process of submitting regulatory applications to the respective Health Authorities/Ethics Committees," Corina Ramers-Verhoeven, a spokesperson with Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, told Xinhua.The vaccine candidate may work against multiple strains of the rapidly changing virus. Currently, there is no vaccine that could bring forth broadly neutralizing antibodies, the body's most effective protection against viruses.Initial findings from Mosaico are expected in 2023, according to Janssen.Mosaico will be the third HIV vaccine efficacy trial in progress worldwide. The other two are Imbokodo and HVTN 702, both being tested in African countries, according to NIH.The World Health Organization has set a goal of ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030, and a vaccine is seen as a critical tool to achieve that goal.

                China-Pakistan seminar held on disease control
            </a>
            <p>
                The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and Pakistan's National Institute of Health held a seminar on preventing and controlling major communicable diseases and promoting advanced molecular diagnosis technology earlier this month.The major diseases covered in the seminar include poliomyelitis and influenza.Located in South Asia and a neighbor of China, Pakistan has witnessed marked increase in polio cases this year as compared to 2018.Despite rich experience tackling communicable diseases, Pakistan lacks advanced equipment and personnel, and its technical needs are high. Healthcare institutions and colleges have a strong will to learn and master advanced molecular diagnostic techniques, with emphasis on gene-based point of care testing) and the Chinese-patented recombinase aided isothermal amplification technology.During the seminar, experts from the China CDC and NIH Pakistan introduced work and experiences from poliomyelitis and influenza prevention and control in the two countries, also discussing recent incidence of the diseases in Pakistan.China CDC experts also conducted a Molecular Diagnosis and Pathogen Determination Training Program by China CDC for their Pakistani counterparts, which was well-received by the Pakistani peers.This seminar created a platform for public health communication and cooperation between China and Pakistan, something of great importance to public health cooperation between the countries under the Belt and Road initiative.Feng Ning contributed to the story.
