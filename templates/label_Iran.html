                             While the White House has not ruled out a meeting with Iran's top leader, Zarif said Iran hoped to avoid conflict, adding that Teheran was willing to hold talks with Riyadh, and the possibility of a return to negotiations with the US depends on whether Washington would provide full sanctions relief as promised under the 2015 nuclear deal.That the news of the US considering such a move can increase the already high tensions in the Middle East is evident in Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif raising the specter of an "all-out war", and stressing that if the US or Saudi Arabia attacked Iran, it would have to fight to its last soldier.In the long run, therefore, keeping the Iranian nuclear deal alive, and ensuring it is implemented both in letter and spirit, is the only viable way of resolving the US-Iran conflict and defusing the tensions in the Middle East

China was called a "thuggish regime" for even bringing this up — naturally, the "free press" was all crickets when it came time to do their purported jobs and speak a little truth to power. Because the US has the largest economy and military many times over, however, leaders who might otherwise speak out against this treatment stay silent.

And quoting US President Donald Trump's remark that Johnson was "Britain's Trump", Corbyn said that the failure to "take back control" ("Vote Leave" slogan during the Brexit referendum) could make the United Kingdom "a vassal state of Trump's America". "In the 98 days that remain to us, we must turbo-charge our preparations to make sure there is as little disruption as possible to our national life," Johnson said, referring to the Brexit deadline of Oct 31

                            And it might be just wishful thinking on the part of the US to organize such a coalition considering that its European allies are less enamored of the "maximum pressure" the US is putting on Iran in an attempt to force it to terminate its involvement in the conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen — as they still hope to save the Iran nuclear deal.Even if such a coalition is established, the US should realize the more warships that it and its allies have in the strait, the more risk there is of an inadvertent run-in or miscalculation that may trigger a military conflict that neither the US nor Iran wants. The best solution to the current stand-off is for both sides to take a step back, which Iran already seems to have taken, and engage in talks, talks in which the US should not ask for too much

                             In an article published in Japan Times, Michael MacArthur Bosack, the special adviser for government relations at the Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies, said Japan may seem like an odd choice, but the good relations Japan has with both the US and Iran is one of the reasons why it is a sensible option to mediate between the two countries. An editorial in the Japan Times said the US and Iran are too entrenched and the changes demanded are too great. The newspaper continued that both Iran and the US have given Abe an opportunity to make the case for direct engagement, but all he can propose are general principles and vouch for the other side's good will
