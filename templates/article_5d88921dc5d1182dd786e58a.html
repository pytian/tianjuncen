                Kunming may ban loud noises on subway trains
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Kunming, capital of Yunnan province, is mulling whether to punish subway passengers who make a lot of noise, including playing loud music.The city held a hearing over a draft code about regulating passengers on urban rail transit recently. The offenders, if the new code is passed, would be recorded in the local credit platform.The draft code forbids passengers from making a racket and playing music publicly on the train. Those who violate the code would be given administrative punishment.According to the draft, the passenger flow on Kunming's rail transit system has been increasing, so it is even more important to keep noise levels down on the subway to avoid disturbing riders.The city has five subway lines with a total length of 88.7 kilometers. On average, nearly 600,000 people ride on the trains daily.Earlier this year, Beijing and Lanzhou, capital of Gansu province, issued similar regulations to punish people who play videos or music loudly inside trains and subways.Lin Chuyan, 26, spends about two hours commuting in Beijing and often hears people using their mobile phones on the subway. She is in favor of prohibiting such behavior."The sound is quite noisy, especially when I want to read something quietly or take a nap," she said. "But few people take a stand to stop the uncivilized behavior when it happens."I think the administrative punishment may be enough for offenders, which could teach them a lesson, but a bad record may be a little harsh for them."In Lanzhou, staff have the right to dissuade, stop or refuse to provide services and can mete out punishment.

                    Huawei mulls open-source chip design if US ban continues
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Huawei Technologies Co said Friday that it would consider using RISC-V, an open-source chip architecture, if the US government continues restricting its access to the latest technologies from the UK firm ARM Holdings for a long time.Xu Zhijun, rotating chairman of Huawei, said in an interview in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, that the company has already obtained the perpetual license to ARM's V8 architecture technology, so the US government ban does not affect its current launch schedule of chips."If ARM's new technologies are not available in the future, we can also use RISC-V, an architecture which is open to all companies. The challenge is not insurmountable," Xu said.Huawei uses ARM's architecture to design many of its chips for smartphones, servers and other applications. But Washington banning Huawei from accessing any technologies originating in the US without special government approval has restricted its ability to use ARM's technologies. Though ARM is based in the UK, some of its crucial technologies are developed in the US and it has to comply with the US ban.As a possible backup option for Huawei, RISC-V is an open-source hardware instruction set architecture. It was originally designed to support computer architecture research and education, but now aims to become a standard open architecture for wider industry implementation.Huawei is already a member of the RISC-V Foundation, an organization dedicated to promoting the use of the chip architecture.But Xu also highlighted that the company still wants to use ARM, and has not started any efforts to shift to RISC-V yet.Xiang Ligang, director-general of telecom industry association Information Consumption Alliance, said if Huawei really adopts RISC-V chip architecture in the future, it will be a huge loss to ARM's chip ecosystem, given Huawei's sprawling size as the world's largest telecom equipment maker and the world's No 2 smartphone vendor.

                    Kunming might punish people who play loud music on subway

            <p class="style-content">
                Kunming, the capital city of Southwest China's Yunnan province, is mulling giving administrative punishment to passengers who play music publicly inside subways.The city held a hearing on a draft code to regulate music on on urban rail transit on Tuesday. The offenders, if the new code is passed, would be recorded in the national credit information sharing platform, the news portal thePaper.cn reported.The draft said that passengers are not allowed to make a loud racket and play music publicly in the train. Those who violate the code will be given an administrative punishment.According to the draft, the passenger flow on Kunming's rail transit system has been increasing and it is important to keep noise down in the subway as sound has a big impact on passengers' feelings. Some passengers, regardless of others' feelings, use electronic devices and create loud noise, which needs to be regulated.Earlier this year, Beijing and Lanzhou, the capital city of Northwest China's Gansu province, have also issued similar regulations to punish people who play video or music publicly with loud sound inside trains and subway.

                    Brazil's president demands Macron apology before mulling G7 aid
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                RIO DE JANEIRO - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday demanded that French President Emmanuel Macron apologize before considering an offer of financial aid to help put out fires raging in the Amazon rainforest."In the first place, Macron must retract his insults towards me. First, he called me a 'liar' and then, according to information I received, he said our sovereignty over the Amazon was an open question," Bolsonaro told reporters as he was leaving his home in Brasilia."To discuss or accept anything from France ... he will have to eliminate those words before we can talk," he added.The diplomatic spat between the two came to a head after Macron, who was hosting the Group of Seven (G7) summit over the weekend, proposed that the group of major economies take action to put out the fires devastating large swaths of the Amazon, including offering 20 million US dollars in aid.Earlier, Macron had described the fires as a global crisis, and called on the G7 to discuss the issue.On Monday, Macron floated the idea of giving the Amazon, considered the lungs of the planet, some type of international status.His comments alarmed Bolsonaro, who sees the international scrutiny as a threat to Brazil's sovereignty over the region.His chief of staff, Onyx Lorenzoni, said late Monday the government will decline the aid offer.However, during a meeting with Bolsonaro on Tuesday, governors from the Amazonian states of Amazonas, Para and Roraima said the aid was welcome.Governor of Roraima Antonio Denarium said "any resources and funds from any sources are important. There is just one objective: the preservation of the environment and the Amazon".Governor of Amazonas Wilson Lima agreed, saying "we need international and institutional support, and we welcome any aid".

                    Shenzhen mulls priority carriage for subway rush hours
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                A revision of a draft regulation is soliciting public opinion on whether to set up a priority carriage on subway trains in Shenzhen, Beijing Youth Daily reported.The revision on facilitating civilized behavior in Shenzhen was published on the official website of the Standing Committee of Shenzhen Municipal People's Congress on Sept 2.An entry reads that a priority carriage can be set up on subway trains. During rush hours, only disabled people, children, women and people with special concerns can ride the priority carriage. Subway station staff should direct other people away from the priority carriage.The entry added disabled people, children and people with special concerns apart from women compared with the previous regulation.The revised draft aroused discussion on the internet.Some expressed support of the change from a female-priority carriage to a priority carriage, while some expressed their worries. Sometimes disabled, pregnant and other passengers who need help do not go into a carriage alone, but if their companion is a man, he cannot enter the priority carriage. Some doubt the executability of the regulation. Shenzhen has piloted female-priority subway cars since 2017, but many photos uploaded on the internet showed that priority seats are occupied by men.Whether the entry will be included into the regulation depends on public feedback, said an official with the Standing Committee of Shenzhen Municipal People's Congress.
