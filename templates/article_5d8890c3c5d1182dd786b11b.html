                    Executives say tariffs will boost prices

                New duties by Washington target consumer goodsUnited States companies, from toymakers to fireworks dealers, are pleading to exempt certain items from the proposed new tariffs on Chinese imports, while officials are trying to ensure that alternative sources of supplies exist outside China.That is what is taking place at the US International Trade Commission in Washington, where at least 300 businesses and industrial groups have converged to testify in seven days of hearings since June 17 on the planned 25 percent duties to be levied on an additional $300 billion worth of Chinese goods.Executives and industrial leaders told officials that China is an indispensable and almost irreplaceable partner in the global market.However, to their disappointment, they are likely to fail in their pleas as analysts warned that most of the businesses' urgings would probably fall on deaf ears.As of Thursday, the US Trade Representative had received 2,714 written comments from companies, trade groups and individuals.Most of them are lamenting that the plan to impose additional tariffs on nearly all Chinese imports would lead to higher prices for consumers, disrupt supply chains and potentially ruin businesses.While in the first two rounds of up to 25 percent tariffs on Chinese products - $50 billion levied earlier last year and $200 billion kicked in early this month - have shielded consumers by largely targeting advanced goods and components, the new threatened duties have increasingly included consumer products.To get an appreciation of how extensive and broad the target list is, some business representatives said at the hearings that they were "surprised" that some of their items, already spared from the administration's previous tariffs on Chinese goods, are targeted again.The USTR office has said that product exclusions it granted on prior tranches wouldn't be affected.Stephen Knerly, a lawyer for Association of Art Museum Directors, said AAMD opposed the proposed imposition of a 25 percent tariff on works of art of Chinese origin, including paintings, drawings, collectibles and antiques.Nobody wants to spend 25 percent more for the same object, especially when they're bidding at auction, Knerly said, pointing to the impact of tariffs on one of the US's major sources of art works."The AAMD was surprised to see Chinese-origin artworks listed in the proposed tariff, as they were excluded from the prior 10 percent tariff," Knerly said. "The AAMD hopes that the inclusion of the art categories is simply a mistake, a mistake that will be rectified before tariffs are imposed."

                    US businesses pleased new tariffs off table

                Still, makers of apparel and child-safety related products remain concerned over prior tariffs on $250b worth of Chinese importsUS businesses expressed relief that further tariffs on Chinese imports have been deferred, but they continue to push for their products to be exempted from the possible duties list.US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday agreed at the G20 Leaders Summit in Japan to restart trade negotiations that have been stalled since the 11th round in May. The US side also said it would not start new tariffs on Chinese exports."While we are pleased there has been a stay of execution for the apparel and footwear industry — the end result of the G20 is that $250 billion worth of US imports from China continue to be hit with a 25 percent tariff, and we continue to find ourselves in a highly uncertain environment," Stephen Lamar, executive vice-president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, said on Tuesday.Tuesday was the last day for companies and trade bodies to submit rebuttal comments following the June 17-25 hearings by the US Trade Representative's Office on the planned 25 percent duties to be levied on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, on the top of $250 billion worth of products already targeted.The fact that many companies have followed up their hearing testimonies with supplemental documents to the USTR indicate that they have not relented in their efforts to have their products exempted from possible tariffs.The American Apparel & Footwear Association, which represents an industry that employs nearly 4 million US workers, reiterated in a statement to the USTR on Tuesday that it was "deeply disturbed" by the administration's proposal to include apparel, footwear and home textiles on the target list."Any tariff on these consumer goods — that are used by EVERY AMERICAN — will end up hurting US consumers, in addition to the companies and workers who support them," the association said in the statement. "We expect prices to go up, sales to go down, and jobs to be lost."In 2018, China accounted for about 42 percent of all apparel and 69 percent of all footwear imported into the United States. China has emerged as a top supplier because it has "unparalleled supply chains" that have been developed over generations, according to the statement."We feel it is important to take advantage of every opportunity to make sure our views are known," Lamar told China Daily. "We are looking forward to resolution of the underlying issues and continue to push for the elimination of all tariffs at the earliest possible opportunity."He said it is noteworthy that whether or not a deal is made, inflation has already been baked into the system."The result will still be increased prices for American consumers – including those least able to afford them," Lamar said. "We are demanding that the administration stop using tariffs as a negotiating strategy."Connie Bryant Breedlove, director of public relations for the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association (JPMA), said her organization was glad that the tariffs have been postponed."However, we remain concerned about the future uncertainty of these trade discussions, and strongly committed to our position that all 'childcare articles and protective child safety products' be exempt from tariffs," she told China Daily in an email.JPMA, the voice of the industry on quality and safety for baby and children's products, takes "nothing for granted" and continue to share the importance of ensuring products that help keep babies safe remain affordable for American families, she said.In her rebuttal comments, Jesse Spector, director of technology policy at the Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA), also highlighted the specific harms SIIA's member companies would face were the additional tariffs to be implemented.More than three-quarters of US imported mobile phones are from China; 90 percent of laptop computers; and more than 50 percent of connected devices, according to SIIA, the principal trade association representing software and digital information industries worldwide."Given this volume, there is simply insufficient capacity in the rest of the world to absorb production shifts of these high-demand devices in the short term," Spector said.That means that if the tariffs go into effect, US producers would have to either sacrifice profits on US sales or pass increased costs on to consumers by raising prices, Spector said.

                    Trump touts July 4 military 'salute' as critics see politics
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                It started when US President Donald Trump saw a military parade on Bastille Day in 2017 in Paris. Trump has since wanted one in Washington. He tried last year but that plan eventually was dropped, partly because of the estimated cost - more than $90 million - and objections from local officials because of the damage heavy armored tanks could do to city streets. On Thursday, 243 years from when the US adopted the Declaration of Independence - July 4, 1776 - Trump will get a version of his Fourth of July parade in the nation's capital. He has dubbed it a "Salute to America". "I'm going to be here and I'm going to say a few words and we're going to have planes going overhead, the best fighter jets in the world and other planes too and we're gonna have some tanks stationed outside," Trump said in the Oval Office on Monday. As for the tanks, Trump acknowledged on social media: "You've got to be pretty careful with the tanks because the roads have a tendency not to like to carry heavy tanks, ... so we have to put them in certain areas." District of Columbia officials had protested the 2018 plan and they are objecting this year. "Tanks but not tanks," the Washington City Council tweeted on Monday. Some military hardware will be transported from bases around the country, ranging as close as Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to as far away as the Naval Air Station in California. It was not known how much the use of the military will cost. A US defense official said that the current plan is to have a very small number of armored vehicles participate as part of a "static display" - parked - on the National Mall, the three kilometers of lawn stretching from the Capitol to the Washington Monument. In addition to the tanks, there will be a flyover of the Lincoln Memorial by the US Navy Blue Angels and an assortment of aircraft from different branches of the military and the Air Force One plane that is used by presidents. Trump will review the parade that goes down Constitution Avenue - without the tanks - and have his military chiefs standing next to him. The fireworks will go off just after 9 pm. Presidents typically have not been present for annual events staged at the foot of the US Capitol that attract thousands of tourists, feature entertainers and are broadcast live before a fireworks display over the Washington Monument. Singer and songwriter Carole King will be one of those entertainers this year, but in a tweet, she stressed: "I am appearing in 'A Capitol Fourth', the traditional event held annually on the lawn at the Capitol. I am not participating in t's political rally." A progressive group, Code Pink, received permission to float their round, diapered Donald Trump baby balloon above the Mall near where Trump will deliver evening remarks. The group said it protests the "politicizing" of the day by Trump. aiheping@chinadailyusa.com (China Daily Global 07/04/2019 page7)

                    Trump asks Americans to 'stay true to our cause'

                WASHINGTON — US President Donald Trump celebrated "the greatest political journey in human history" in a Fourth of July commemoration before a soggy but cheering crowd of spectators, many of them invited, on the grounds of the Lincoln Memorial. Supporters welcomed his tribute to the US military while protesters assailed him for putting himself center stage on a holiday devoted to unity.As rain fell on him, Trump called on Americans to "stay true to our cause" during a program that adhered to patriotic themes and hailed an eclectic mix of history's heroes, from the armed forces, space, civil rights and other endeavors of American life.He largely stuck to his script, avoiding diversions into his agenda or re-election campaign. But in one exception, he vowed, "Very soon, we will plant the American flag on Mars," actually a distant goal not likely to be achieved until late in the 2020s if even then.

                    More than 900 children separated at US border since policy halted
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                LOS ANGELES - The American Civil Liberties Union, or ACLU, on Tuesday asked a federal judge to stop the Trump administration's ongoing separation of families at the US-Mexico border, saying the government had taken more than 900 children from their parents since the policy officially ended last year. The ACLU said in a court filing in San Diego that the administration was accusing parents of minor criminal activity - including traffic violations - and neglect to continue separating children at the border. One example involved a father whose one-year-old daughter was taken from him because he failed to change her diaper. Another case concerned a three-year-old girl separated from her father on the grounds he could not prove he was a parent. The family took a DNA test that confirmed paternity, but meanwhile, the child was sexually abused while in detention, according to the court filing. Another four-year-old boy was separated because his father had a speech impediment that prevented him from answering questions by Border Patrol agents, the complaint said. "It is shocking that the Trump administration continues to take babies from their parents," said Lee Gelernt, an attorney with the ACLU. "Over 900 more families join the thousands of others previously torn apart by this cruel and illegal policy," he added. "The administration must not be allowed to circumvent the court order over infractions like minor traffic violations." 'Zero tolerance' Trump's administration began separating children from their parents in May of last year as part of a "zero tolerance" policy toward migrants who illegally cross the border. But six weeks into the practice that prompted a domestic and international outcry, Trump reversed course and announced that his administration would stop separating families unless the parents pose "a risk" to their child. A federal judge then issued an order for an estimated 2,700 children taken during that six-week period to be reunited with their parents. The Trump administration has said that it now separates children from their parents only if the adults pose a risk. But the ACLU says that only a small number of the more than 900 children taken from their parents since June of last year were at risk and have deplored the conditions in which the youngsters are held. In one case, the ACLU complaint says, a father was separated from his three young daughters after being diagnosed with HIV. It added that of particular concern was that the ongoing separations involve very young children, 20 percent of whom are under the age of five. "The impact of separation can be particularly devastating for young children," the complaint said, urging the court to clarify the standard by which children can be separated from their parents.

                    Delay in new China tariffs cheers Wall Street
                </p>

                In what one expert called a "course adjustment" by the Trump administration, the US trade representative's office announced Tuesday that a planned 10 percent tariff on a range of Chinese imports would be delayed, sending the stock market soaring."The announcement is Trump's olive branch," Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics told China Daily. "He sees how much damage the trade war is doing to the US economy and the stock market and wants a course adjustment without looking like a course reversal. If China reciprocates, so much the better."The Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) released a 21-page list of Chinese imports that won't face new tariffs until Dec 15 at the earliest, including cellphones, laptop computers, clothes, toys, baby products such as strollers, monitors, highchairs and diapers, microwave ovens, musical instruments, sleeping bags and fishing reels.A 10 percent tariff on products such as flat-screen TVs, contact lenses, lithium ion batteries and snowblowers still is scheduled to go into effect Sept 1.And some other imports were removed outright from the list."Certain products are being removed from the tariff list based on health, safety, national security and other factors and will not face additional tariffs of 10 percent," the USTR said. It did not specify which items would be removed.Based on a Reuters analysis, the tariff delay until Dec 15 would cover around half of the $300 billion list.Those imports totaled about $156 billion last year, according to US Census Bureau data."We're doing this for Christmas season, just in case some of the tariffs would have an impact on US customers," US President Donald Trump told reporters in New Jersey. "Just in case they might have an impact on people, what we've done is we've delayed it so that they won't be relevant to the Christmas shopping season."The USTR announced the decision shortly after China's Ministry of Commerce said Vice-Premier Liu He spoke by phone with American trade officials."China lodged solemn representations," the Ministry of Commerce said, about the Sept 1 tariffs.Liu agreed with Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to speak again by phone within the next two weeks, the ministry said.Trump has said the two sides still may meet early in September as scheduled.The Consumer Technology Association applauded the delay on some items, but added: "Next month, we'll begin to pay more for some of our favorite tech devices – including TVs, smart speakers and desktop computers. The administration should permanently remove these harmful tariffs and find another way to hold China accountable for its unfair trading practices."Shares of companies with strong business ties to China rallied on the news.Apple, heavily dependent on China for assembly of its iPhone and laptops, closed at $208.97 a share, up $8.49, or 4.2 percent. The latest round of tariffs would have hurt Apple's launch of this year's new iPhone line, which usually happens in late September.Apple's stock had fallen about 6 percent since Trump announced the tariffs Aug 1, or double the decline of the S&P 500 in that period.Last year, the US excluded smartwatches and wireless earbuds from tariffs, making Apple's current exemption the second it has received.Shares of Archer Daniels Midland, which has blamed the trade dispute for disrupting sales to China and distorting farm prices, rose just under 1 percent.Green Plains, which counts heavily on Chinese demand for its fuel additive, rose 4.7 percent.Mattel, a major toy company reliant on Chinese imports, rose 4.6 percent, and competitor Hasbro rose 2.8 percent.The USTR said the action was the result of its "public comment and hearing process".Hundreds of companies testified in June against the new tariffs, and many warned that additional tariffs would raise prices at home and cost a loss of American jobs.David French, senior vice-president of the Washington-based National Retail Federation, said unresolved trade issues continue to roil the economy."We are pleased the administration will delay tariffs on certain consumer products," he said in a statement. "Clearly, the administration understands the importance of avoiding higher taxes on American families during the holiday season. Still, continued uncertainty for US businesses and consumers is a drag on the economy."Rich Helfenbein, CEO of American Apparel & Footwear Association, a trade group based in Washington, said Tuesday's action wasn't enough to calm retailers and consumers."While the Trump administration is delaying tariffs on 'certain items of footwear and clothing' for 105 days and removing other items from the list entirely, it is still persisting with a destructive plan to impose tariffs on consumer goods used by every American and critical inputs used by US manufacturers," he said in a statement."Make no mistake, these tariffs, including the ones imposed in earlier tranches, are paid by US companies," Helfenbein said. "They create costs and uncertainty, forcing companies to delay or scuttle hiring and investment and ultimately hit the US consumer."Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the US Chamber of Commerce, called Trump's decision "welcome news''."Now, it's more important than ever that the two sides return to the negotiating table and recommit to achieving progress towards a comprehensive, enforceable agreement," he said in a statement.An analyst at Bank of America remained cautious."Recession risks are elevated," Michelle Meyer, head of US economics at Bank of America, told The Washington Post. "Uncertainty remains very high."The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 26,280, up 373 points, or 1.4 percent, on Tuesday. But on Wednesday, US stocks closed remarkably lower, as persisting fears over an imminent recession dealt a blow to the already-dampened investor sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 800 points, or 3 percent, the worst day of 2019 amid recession fears.The S&P 500 decreased 2.93 percent to 2,840.60, and the Nasdaq fell 3.02 percent to 7,773.94.The tariffs that Trump had proposed on Aug 1 would have been stacked on top of a 25 percent levy on about $250 billion in Chinese goods and would result in a duty on nearly everything the US imported from China.Reuters contributed to this story.

                Some imports, including laptops, won't face new levies from Washington until Dec 15In what one expert called a "course adjustment" by the Trump administration, the Office of the US Trade Representative announced Tuesday that a planned 10 percent tariff on a range of Chinese imports would be delayed, sending the stock market soaring."The announcement is Trump's olive branch," Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics, told China Daily. "He sees how much damage the trade war is doing to the US economy and the stock market and wants a course adjustment without looking like a course reversal.

                    Trump revives suggestion he'd end birthright citizenship

                WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump says he's looking "very seriously" at ending the right to citizenship for babies born to non-US citizens on American soil.Trump spoke to reporters Wednesday as he departed the White House for a speech in Louisville.He says birthright citizenship is "frankly ridiculous."This isn't the first time Trump has claimed he'd do away with it — he also said something similar in October.But the citizenship proposal would inevitably spark a longshot legal battle over whether the president can alter the long accepted understanding that the 14th Amendment grants citizenship to any child born on US soil, regardless of a parent's immigration status.AP

                    Cancer cases linger over 9/11 anniversary
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                NEW YORK - Jacquelin Febrillet was 26 years old on September 11, 2001 when jihadist hijackers flew two passenger jets into the World Trade Center just two blocks from where she worked.Fifteen years after the attacks that day, Febrillet, by then a mother of three, was diagnosed with metastatic cancer. The likely cause: A cloud of toxic ash that engulfed her."I was there (on) 9/11.… For years I have been working down there every day since 9/11. We were never told that something could happen," she says.Unlike Febrillet, Richard Fahrer, then 19, wasn't in the area on 9/11, but he regularly worked as a land surveyor between 2001 and 2003 in south Manhattan, where the Twin Towers came crashing down.Eighteen months ago, the young father, now 37, was diagnosed with aggressive colon cancer-a disease that usually affects older men and which there is no history of in his family.Febrillet and Fahrer represent a growing category of patient who were living or working close to the World Trade Center in the wake of the attacks, which killed almost 3,000 people.They were not among the thousands of emergency personnel who rushed to the site or who spent months clearing debris at Ground Zero, but their health is being similarly affected.As the 18th anniversary of the attacks approaches, New York continues to count the number of people who have developed cancer or other serious illnesses related to the toxic cloud that hovered over Manhattan for several weeks.'People are dying'The 9/11 attacks released unprecedented amounts of chemicals into the air, including dioxins, asbestos and other carcinogenic substances.Firefighters, other first responders and volunteers who helped with the monthslong cleanup were the first to be affected. Studies found they faced an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease.Ten thousand of them have been diagnosed with cancer by the World Trade Center Health Program, a federal treatment program helping survivors.At the end of June this year, 21,000 people not considered first responders were also in the program-twice as many as in June 2016. Of these, almost 4,000 have cancer, the most common being prostate, breast and skin.Febrillet, now 44, is one of them. She recalls that the message at the time was to get the city back to normal as quickly as possible."People were just going about their business a few days later. But look at what happened a few years later, people are dying," says Febrillet, who also lived close to Ground Zero.Fahrer, too, laments that city officials did not do more to protect residents and office staff in the vicinity."My wife asks me, 'Did terrorists cause your cancer?' I can't say 100 percent, but I do know there could have been better efforts to limit the exposure of healthy adults from entering into the disaster area," he says.Health experts say it is impossible to pinpoint exactly the cause of cancer in every patient, but note that there is a clear correlation between the rate and exposure to toxic debris.Compensation fundSeveral studies have shown that the cancer rate "has increased between 10 and 30 percent" among people who were exposed compared to those who weren't, said David Prezant, New York fire department chief medical officer.The rate is expected to increase further, he said, as exposed people get older. The risk of cancer increases with age and some cancers, including lung, can take 20 to 30 years to develop, Prezant added.It is because of this that US President Donald Trump signed a bill in July that extends a deadline for victims to file claims for compensation from December 2020 to 2090.The Victim Compensation Fund will be regularly topped up after exhausting its initial budget of $7.3 billion. The average compensation per patient is $240,000, or $682,000 for a deceased person.Lawyer Matthew Baione, who represents Fahrer and Febrillet in their pursuit of claims, said the extension recognized that it was appropriate to cover someone "who was a baby during the attacks for the rest of their life"."We have lost so many people, so many friends are sick," says Febrillet."We are so young, this shouldn't be happening."Agence France-Presse
