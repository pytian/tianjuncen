                President calls for all-­out relief efforts
            </p>
            <p>
                President Xi Jinping ordered all-out efforts to organize relief work and rescue operations for the injured on Tuesday after a magnitude 6.0 earthquake struck Sichuan province on Monday night.The quake struck Yibin's Changning county at 10:55 pm, killing 13 and injuring 199, including six who were still in critical condition as of 4 pm on Tuesday, the provincial Bureau of Emergency Management said.Most of the deaths were the result of collapsing homes, rescuers said. So far, 14 people have been rescued from the debris. More than 140,000 people have been affected by the quake. The temblor damaged homes and roadways, and interrupted power and communication services.Heavy rains may take place over the next several days in the earthquake zone, which may affect emergency rescue efforts, the China Meteorological Administration said on Tuesday.The disaster has drawn national attention, with Xi focusing on rescue work and providing instructions. He said relief and rescue efforts were the highest priorities, along with preventing further deaths or injuries.He said the People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police Force should support and assist the efforts of local governments. Related departments should work scientifically, strengthen earthquake monitoring to prevent secondary disasters, restore water and power supplies and get transportation and telecommunication up and running as soon as possible.He also said it was important to resettle people affected by the quake in safe areas. China has entered its rainy season, a time when downpours frequently occur in parts of the country, causing floods and landslides and as well as casualties and property damage.Xi asked leaders of the Communist Party of China and officials in affected areas to firmly establish a people-centered approach and actively organize flood control and relief efforts to safeguard lives and property.Premier Li Keqiang also instructed various departments to verify the disaster situation, do their utmost to rescue people, repair damaged transport and telecommunications infrastructure, publish timely updates and maintain social order in the quake zone. The Ministry of Emergency Management has activated an emergency response and sent work teams to stricken areas to provide guidance.The National Development and Reform Commission has allocated 50 million yuan ($7.2 million) to support emergency rescue and infrastructure construction. The quake rocked Yibin, and people in nearby cities, including Chengdu and Chongqing, felt the temblor.A series of aftershocks have been measured, including one of magnitude 5.1. Wei Lai, 25, an office worker at an IT company in Chengdu, 260 kilometers from the epicenter, was in bed on the fifth floor of an apartment building when the quake struck."I felt the bed shake violently twice in less than a minute. I was terrified and was in panic even after the shaking stopped," Wei said. Because of the earthquake and its aftershocks, some railway operations were affected, including in Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan provinces and Chongqing, where services were delayed or canceled, said China Railway Corp. Operations at Chengdu's airport were not affected.Sixty-one seconds before seismic waves generated by the quake reached Chengdu from Changning, some residents received an early warning. Such early warnings are designed to help provide people with an opportunity to move quickly to safety before being hit, said Chen Huizhong, a senior research fellow at the China Earthquake Administration's Institute of Geophysics.A man in Yibin surnamed Chen was playing mahjong when the quake struck. He rushed home and brought his wife and daughter to a public square."My daughter was very calm and ran down very fast," Chen was quoted as saying by Red Star News. "She and other students had learned in school how to respond to earthquakes.

            <p>
                I’m Robert from Germany, and I’ve lived in Shanghai for several years. My language school, GoEast Mandarin, decided to put me to the ultimate test: To let me use my Chinese skills in a rural village — all on my own — for two days.“My trip started early in the morning at the Shanghai Hongqiao station. After two hours on the high speed train to Ningbo and two more hours in the bus, I arrived at the village. Fengpuao is so small it isn’t even shown on Google Maps, but 2,000 wonderful people live there, next to a lake and forests.I stayed with my host family for two days, and they were extremely welcoming from the first moment. When I arrived they had already prepared lunch for me, and because I could talk with them well in Chinese, they told me I could call them Mama and Baba.

                Game of Mahjong: A hit in US culture
            </a>
            <p>
                 Mahjong, a tile game originated in China over a thousand years ago, is becoming a hit in New York City with simplified rules made for the Americans. The game was the sixth-biggest export from China in the 1920s, and it has played an important role in the enriching of modern American culture.

                Officials caught gambling amid gang sting operation
            </a>
            <p>
                Three senior officials in Xixiang county in Shaanxi province were found gambling at a hotel by an anti-organized crime team while it was on a mission to arrest suspected gang members.A national inspection team working on organized crime arrived in Shaanxi on June 3 and started inspection work. A squad working with the team went to Xixiang on June 13 for inspection.But one day later, when the squad was in the county to arrest criminal suspects at a local hotel, they knocked on the wrong room door and discovered the three officials and a person named Tang playing mahjong on a working day.The three officials are Xi Dongxing, head of the Xixiang Public Security Bureau; Wang Jianqing, chief procurator of the Xixiang people's procuratorate; and Qu Xiang, director of the natural resources bureau of Xixiang.The amount of money that was being gambled was about 38,000 yuan ($5,500), according a statement issued by Xixiang government.The four were detained for 10 days and fined. Furthermore, all the three officials were removed from their posts.Xi and Wang were also both placed on one year's probation by the Communist Party of China.Qu was also under investigation by the county's commission for discipline inspection and supervisory commission for other suspected disciplinary violations.In January 2018, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council launched a three-year campaign to crack down on organized crime. Since then, 34 national teams headed by ministerial-level officials have been sent to 34 provinces and regions around the country to conduct inspections in three rounds. The inspections will be completed this month.

                Mahjong a hit in US culture
            </a>
            <p>
                Game originating in China has contributed to cohesion in cities such as New YorkEvery Monday, about 100 women — mostly from the Upper East Side of Manhattan — gather at a Park Avenue restaurant for one thing: to play mahjong, a dominoes-like game that originated in China."My members, most of them are from Manhattan, and I'd say the majority of them are from the Upper East Side, but I've got West Siders, I have a few people from Brooklyn," said Linda Feinstein, organizer of the Manhattan Mahjong Club."I have a group that comes in from Beverly Hills every single year for 10 days and they play mahjong on one of the Mondays," she said.Feinstein, who learned mahjong when she was 9 years old on a family trip, immediately fell in love with the game. Her passion led her to start a mahjong club in 2005."It's just absolutely amazing how everybody just falls in love with it and becomes addicted to it," Feinstein said. "People don't just play here on Mondays — they play throughout the week.""And there are tournaments," she added.Originating in China during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the tile-based game has gained popularity among American players since it was first introduced to the US in the early 1920s.Feinstein prepares mahjong sets and everything else for her members, who come on Monday afternoon, and each member pays $45 for participating in the game, which includes lunch, drinks and the venue."I provide everything for them, and all they need to do is to bring their own mahjong card," said Feinstein.There are 144 tiles in traditional Chinese mahjong sets, while American mahjong sets have eight additional joker tiles and hands and rules scorecards published by the non-profit National Mahjong League."The rules [of American mahjong] are very, very different [from Chinese mahjong]," said Gregg Swain, co-author of the book Mah Jong: The Art of the Game."What's kind of sad is that back in the 1920s when mahjong was first being exported, Joseph P. Babcock, who really took mahjong to the world decided that the Chinese rules were going to be way too complicated for Americans and Europeans," Swain said.Babcock decided to simplify the game, and then every other company that made mahjong sets simplified the game even more."So there were too many ways to play mahjong and nobody could agree," Swain said, adding that in 1937, five women from New York got together and created the National Mahjong League."They took a few principles of the Chinese game, but they really made it be their own," she said.Starting in 1937 with only 32 members, the league now has more than 350,000 members and serves as the arbitrator for everything that relates to American mahjong."During the 20th century, a range of Americans engaged with the Chinese parlor game mahjong not only as an entertaining consumer good but especially as a way to build community," wrote Annelise Heinz, assistant professor of history at the University of Oregon.According to Heinz, the tile game helped redefine the meaning of race, gender, and material culture in modern America.Both Jewish-American and Chinese-American communities were built around mahjong during the 20th century, according to research conducted by Heinz when he was a doctoral candidate in history at Stanford in 2013.Heinz called mahjong a "remarkable game that has retained its core interest and beauty across time and distance", adding that it offers "a rich and compelling topic of historical inquiry".Unlike other leisure games in which "high-stakes partner relationships" pit players against one another, mahjong requires cooperation and strategy between players, which creates an "ideal forum for interaction between people", the report said.Heinz believes that the aesthetic appeal of the game and its enjoyable intellectual challenge, combined with its deep cultural heritage, has contributed to a renewed attraction of younger generations.Heinz noted that American mahjong is becoming increasingly diverse. Many veteran players are crossing ethnic and generational boundaries to learn other styles of play.Recently a talk show host asked Oscar-winning actress Julia Roberts what she did to relax."I play mahjong with my girlfriends once a week," Roberts said."The concept of it is to create order out of chaos based on a random drawing of tiles.""It's sort of like life," she added, "every day we try to make a little bit of order out of the chaos of life just with our random acts of hopefully wisdom and kindness."Roberts said she was taught by one of her girlfriends and she also would love to see more people play the game."It's a friendly game, it's about food, and we catch up and we play mahjong and it's just a great joy," Roberts said."I think mahjong is the most popular game in the US because we are all looking for ways to escape from our worries," Swain said."And when you sit at the mahjong table, all you are doing is thinking about those little tiles in front of you, and think about how you are going to win with those tiles," Swain said."It really keeps your mind active, and then you are always thinking. When you play, you don't think of anything else except for the game," Feinstein said."You can have fun doing it. It's a serious game, but yet there's a lightness about it. It's the best game."Feinstein said that in the US, mahjong is considered mostly as women's game, not for men.In the decades during and after World War II, Heinz found, mahjong became the basis of important community building among American Jewish women. As families moved away from crowded urban centers in the postwar years, they encountered feelings of isolation in new suburban areas. Young Jewish mothers often "turned to mahjong as a way of building new social networks", according to Heinz's research.The study also said that part of the reason mahjong was associated with Jewish women was that they held powerful positions as "leaders, entrepreneurs and game-smiths who created and nurtured American mahjong", especially through the development of the National Mahjong League in New York."I think that men don't consider it 'their game', it's mostly like poker, gin rummy, bridge is a men's game," Feinstein added."It's the escape that is important, but I really think it's the friendships that are developed around the table, that are what's key to the success of the game," Swain said."Because people are looking to connect with other people. Friendship is so important in life, and particularly as we age, social interactions are important, and the game of mahjong combines escape with social interactions, and you also have to use your brain a lot," Swain added. "There's dominoes, there's rummy, but nothing has the traditions surrounding it like mahjong," Feinstein said."It's the best game in the world, and it really fulfills the traditional sentiment of the game. I don't really know any other games that have such a past, such a history to it as mahjong," Feinstein said.Swain said she started getting interested in hand-carved mahjong sets from China when she saw an antique set belonging to one of her friends."I decided I really wanted a hand-carved set," Swain said. "And I bought some hand-carved sets and fell in love with them."Swain said she wanted to find out what the tiles represented, but she found no books on the topic."So I decided to do a book, but I didn't know anything about Chinese art," Swain added."To learn about Chinese art, I bought a lot of books," Swain said. "It's a fascinating journey and I kept learning all the time.""And whenever I teach mahjong, I teach how the suits are based on Chinese money, and then I have to tell them all about the flower tiles, how they can be landscapes and bits from opera — so they are all learning a little bit about Chinese culture at the same time," Swain said.Contact the writers at ruinanzhang@chinadailyusa.com.

                28-year-old finishes Yangtze walking challenge
            </a>
            <p>
                After covering around 6,400 kilometers on foot for 352 days, British adventurer Ash Dykes reached the finish line of his Yangtze River challenge in Shanghai on Monday. The 28-year-old Welsh, who walked the entire length of the river, was welcomed by fans from across the country, and friends and family members from the United Kingdom when he arrived at Nanhuizui Seaside Park, the east end of Shanghai, where the Yangtze, the longer river in China, joins the East China Sea. "I was born and raised right next to the sea. It's been a whole year that I have not seen the ocean, maybe the longest in my life," he said. His yearlong expedition started from the origin of the river in the uninhabited Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in August 2018, where he overcame temperatures as low as -20 C and an altitude of more than 4,800 meters. "There were many difficulties. There were the bear, the wolf and the wild yak. There was the difficulty with the terrain - floods, landslides and high altitude," he said. "I had to take things day by day, mile by mile, and not look at the big picture, which was 352 days." This was by far the longest trip that Dykes has undertaken. He had trekked across Mongolia from east to west in three months in 2014, and across Madagascar from south to north in five months between 2015 and 2016. According to Dykes, the highlight of his expedition was meeting the local people who helped him and taught him about their culture. "I was stuck in a blizzard in the plateau. The locals offered me shelter, hot tea and food, protecting me from harsh winds and temperatures," he said. Dykes posted photographs and stories about his journey on Chinese social media. A few people even joined him during his treks. Yang Ruidong, 50, a cross-country runner from Beijing, joined Dykes along with 30 others in March, and they trekked for three days in the mountains near Chongqing in Southwest China. "I found 'Little Dykes' an easygoing person who is optimistic and open-minded. He loves Chinese culture and learns to play mahjong and eat dumplings with us," said Yang. Dykes' father said: "The Yangtze mission is something he always wanted to do. After he went back from his first trip to China when he was only 19, he had said that he would return one day and go on an expedition." "Both his mother and I have always supported him," said Philip Dykes. "I feel relieved as well as excited to see him finish the challenge, but quite concerned about what he's going to do next." Besides the thrill, Dykes undertook the expedition to raise awareness on environment protection. He has partnered with the World Wildlife Foundation, the China Biodiversity Conservation and the Green Development Foundation to do a series of activities, including releasing endangered Chinese sturgeon fish into the river, and filming the conservation efforts for the Yangtze finless porpoise. The conservation organizations raise the sturgeon fish and release the matured fish into the river. During his expedition, Dykes always carried a bottle with a filter that allowed him to directly drink the water collected from streams and rivers. This helped him to avoid using plastic bottles. "I thought I would have negative stories about the human impact on the river, but what I saw was just the opposite," he said. He said that he noticed a change in people's behavior. "They are working with the conservation organizations. The population of those species that were feared to be on the brink of extinction has rather been increasing, especially of the finless porpoise." Dykes said when he shared photographs of beautiful nature in China, his overseas friends found it hard to believe. "When they think of China, they think of only big cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai. They don't think of the thousands and thousands of miles of pure nature." "Despite walking thousands of miles, I feel there is more for me to see." he said. "I think this is just the beginning. I feel my next mission will still be here in China." xingyi@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 08/15/2019 page3)
