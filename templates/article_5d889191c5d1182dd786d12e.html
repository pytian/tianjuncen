                Latest violence raises death toll in US mass shootings to 53 in August
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                The seven people killed near Odesa, Texas, by a gunman brings the number of victims of mass killings by firearms to 53 in the month of August.Texas, had four of the eight deadliest shootings in the US in 2019, according to the website Mass Shooting Tracker.In the shooting on Saturday in Odessa, authorities said the gunman — identified as 36-year-old Seth Aaron Ator, of Odessa — used an AR-type rifle. He shot and wounded three police officers before he was killed.Law enforcement officials said on Sunday that the death toll in the West Texas shootings may have been even higher had the shooter not been stopped and killed outside a crowded movie theater.The officials speculated the gunman may have planned to continue shooting inside the Cinergy Movie Theater in Odessa before the hijacked US Postal Service vehicle he was driving was disabled by law enforcement officers.Odessa Police Chief Michael Gerke said the gunman likely wouldn't drive to the theater unless he planned to go inside. He said the shooting remains under investigation but that his death outside the theater may have saved lives.The US Postal Service said a 29-year-old employee was among the seven people killed.Letter carrier Mary Granados was among those killed Saturday by the gunman who went on a more than 10-mile rampage. Authorities say he hijacked her mail carrier truck and fired at random as he drove in the area of Odessa and Midland. Among the 22 wounded was a 17-month-old girl, Anderson Davis, who was shot in the face, according to officials. The other shootings in August include one on Aug 3 at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, where 22 people were killed and 26 others wounded by a gunman who targeted shoppers, in the predominantly Hispanic border city. The suspect, a white man in his 20s who was taken into custody, wrote an anti-immigrant manifesto that was posted online shortly before the attack, the authorities said.On Aug 4, nine people were killed and 27 wounded in Dayton, Ohio, when a gunman wearing a mask and body armor opened fire in a busy entertainment district. The gunman's sister was among the dead, according to the police.

                    Iceland honors glacier lost to climate change
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The island country loses about 11 billion tons of ice per yearREYKJAVIK, Iceland - Iceland on Sunday honored the passing of Okjokull, its first glacier lost to climate change, as scientists warn that about 400 others on the subarctic island risk the same fate.A bronze plaque was unveiled in a ceremony to mark Okjokull - which translates to "Ok glacier"-in the west of Iceland, in the presence of local researchers and their peers from Rice University in the United States, who initiated the project.Iceland's Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir, Environment Minister Gudmundur Ingi Gudbrandsson, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson were also due to attend the event."This will be the first monument to a glacier lost to climate change anywhere in the world," Cymene Howe, associate professor of anthropology at Rice University in Texas, United States, said in July.The plaque bears the inscription "A letter to the future", and is intended to raise awareness about the decline of glaciers and the effects of climate change."In the next 200 years, all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it," the plaque reads.It is also labeled "415 ppm CO2", referring to the record level of carbon dioxide measured in the atmosphere last May."Memorials everywhere stand for either human accomplishments, like the deeds of historic figures, or the losses and deaths we recognize as important," researcher Howe said."By memorializing a fallen glacier, we want to emphasize what is being lost - or dying - the world over, and also draw attention to the fact that this is something that humans have 'accomplished', although it is not something we should be proud of."Howe noted that the conversation about climate change can be abstract, with many dire statistics and sophisticated scientific models that can feel incomprehensible."Perhaps a monument to a lost glacier is a better way to fully grasp what we now face," she said, highlighting "the power of symbols and ceremony to provoke feelings".Iceland loses about 11 billion tons of ice per year, and scientists fear all its 400-plus glaciers will be gone by 2200, according to Howe and her Rice University colleague Dominic Boyer.Stripped in 2014Glaciologists stripped Okjokull of its glacier status in 2014, a first for Iceland.In 1890, the glacier ice covered 16 square kilometers but by 2012, it measured just 0.7 square kilometers, according to a 2017 report from the University of Iceland.In 2014, "we made the decision that this was no longer a living glacier, it was only dead ice, it was not moving," said Oddur Sigurdsson, a glaciologist with the Icelandic Meteorological Office.To have the status of a glacier, the mass of ice and snow must be thick enough to move by its own weight. For that to happen, the mass must be approximately 40 to 50 meters thick, he explained.According to a study published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in April, nearly half of the world's heritage sites could lose their glaciers by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate.Sigurdsson said he feared "that nothing can be done to stop it"."The inertia of the climate system is such that, even if we could stop introducing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere right now, it will keep on warming for century and a half or two centuries before it reaches equilibrium."Iceland's Vatnajokull National Park, which was added to UNESCO's World Heritage List in early July, is home to, and named after, the largest ice cap in Europe.Agence France-presse

                    2020 election poll: Warren, Sanders catch Biden
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                With about 15 months to go before the 2020 US presidential election, the battle among Democrats over who will face Donald Trump is showing more clarity.A Monmouth University poll released Monday shows Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in a virtual dead heat.However, the poll also shows that the heretofore front-runner Biden has lost ground to Warren, US senator from Massachusetts, and Sanders, US senator from Vermont. They both polled at 20 percent, with Biden at 19."The main takeaway from this poll is that the Democratic race has become volatile," said Patrick Murray, who runs the polling institute at Monmouth in West Long Branch, New Jersey. "Liberal voters are starting to cast about for a candidate they can identify with. Moderate voters, who have been paying less attention, seem to be expressing doubts about Biden."Biden, former vice-president under Barack Obama, has had some verbal miscues on the campaign trail recently, mistaking his location in New Hampshire for Vermont and misidentifying the cities where two recent mass shootings occurred."But they are swinging more toward one of the left-leaning contenders with high name recognition rather than toward a lesser-known candidate who might be more in line with them politically," Murray said.Biden, 76, has looked to stake a more moderate ground, and his campaign has promoted him as the "most electable", meaning the candidate who would give the Democrats the best chance to defeat Trump, 73. Warren, 70, and Sanders, 77, an advocate of socialist policies, represent the progressive wing of the party.According to the Monmouth poll, Biden has lost support over the past two months among Democrats who call themselves moderate or conservative (from 40 percent to 22 percent), with the shift among these voters accruing to both Sanders (from 10 percent to 20 percent) and Warren (from 6 percent to 16 percent). Biden also lost support among liberals (from 24 percent to 15 percent).The poll of 800 voters included 298 people considered registered Democrats or Democratic-leaning. It had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.7 percent within that group and was conducted by telephone from Aug 16 to 20."It's important to keep in mind this is just one snapshot from one poll," Murray said. "But it does raise warning signs of increased churning in the Democratic nomination contest now that voters are starting to pay closer attention."The Biden campaign said in a statement that the poll was based on a relatively small sample size, and that an average of polls by RealClearPolitics has him ahead of the field, The New York Times reported.US Senator Kamala Harris was fourth in the Monmouth poll with 8 percent. Harris had gotten a bounce in the polls in June after she called out Biden in the first debate for his opposition to busing to racially integrate schools in the 1970s.But in the next debate, in July, Harris faced sharp criticism by another Democratic presidential candidate, US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, for her record as California attorney general. Harris has since dropped to single digits in several polls.The Monmouth poll is one of those approved by the Democratic National Committee for deciding which candidates qualify for primary debates.The next round of Democratic debates will be held Sept 12-13 at Texas Southern University in Houston. The 10 candidates who have already qualified for those debates are Biden, Sanders, Warren, Harris, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana; former HUD secretary Julián Castro; Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas; and entrepreneur Andrew Yang, whose parents were born in Taiwan.

                HOUSTON - Five people were killed and at least 21 people injured in an active shooting on Saturday afternoon in the Midland-Odessa area in the US state of Texas, local police said on Saturday.According to Odessa Police Department, one shooter -- a white male in his mid-30s -- was among the dead and "the threat has been contained".The police did not name the shooter or mention his motive.The shooting started on Saturday afternoon in Midland when a Texas Department of Public Safety (TxDPS) trooper attempted to stop a Honda. When the trooper pulled over the car, "he was shot by the occupant of the car," Odessa Police Chief Michael Gerke told a press conference.The vehicle continued westbound into the city of Odessa, and the driver shot random individuals.The suspect then ditched the vehicle he was using and "stole a mail truck and there were more victims after that", Gerke said.Odessa Police Department earlier issued an alert on the active shooting via Facebook, saying "at this time there are multiple gunshot victims. The suspect just hijacked a US mail carrier truck". It also urged people to get off the road and "use extreme caution".The shooter was encountered by and exchanged fire with law enforcement officers including those from Odessa, Midland police and TxDPS near a local movie theater named Cinergy, and "deceased at that location," Gerke said.Three of the injured were law enforcement officers -- a state trooper, an Odessa police officer, and a Midland police officer, Gerke said.U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday afternoon tweeted that he was just "briefed by Attorney General Barr about the shootings in Texas," and the "FBI and Law Enforcement is fully engaged."Texas Governor Greg Abbott said in a statement that he and his wife "are heartbroken over this senseless and cowardly attack," and they will go to Odessa on Sunday morning.Texas underwent one of the state's deadliest shootings less than one month ago. On Aug. 3, a 21-year-old gunman opened fire at a shopping center in El Paso, killing 22 people and injuring at least two dozen.Located in West Texas, the Midland-Odessa is a metropolitan area with a population of around 240,000. The economy of the area is heavily dependent on the petroleum industry.Odessa is a city in western Texas, about 30 km southwest of Midland. Located in the Permian Basin, it is an oil industry center.

                    Death toll in West Texas shooting rampage rises to 7

                MIDLAND, Texas — The death toll in a West Texas shooting rampage increased to seven Sunday as authorities investigated why a man stopped by state troopers for failing to signal a left turn opened fire on them and fled, shooting more than 20 people as he drove before being killed by officers outside a movie theater.Odessa police spokesman Steve LeSueur said that at least one of the shooting victims remained in life-threatening condition. The gunman has been identified as a white male in his 30s, but police have not released a name or possible motive.A news conference was scheduled for later Sunday in Odessa.The shooting began Saturday afternoon with an interstate traffic stop where gunfire was exchanged with police, setting off a chaotic rampage during which the suspect hijacked a mail carrier truck and fired at random as he drove in the area of Odessa and Midland, two cities in the heart of Texas oil country more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) west of Dallas.Police initially reported possible multiple shooters, but Odessa police Chief Michael Gerke later said there was only one male suspect.The suspect shot "at innocent civilians all over Odessa," according to a statement from Odessa police, which did not name the man or offer motive.The terrifying chain of events began when Texas state troopers tried pulling over a gold car mid-Saturday afternoon on Interstate 20 for failing to signal a left turn, Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger said. Before the vehicle came to a complete stop, the driver "pointed a rifle toward the rear window of his car and fired several shots" toward the patrol car stopping him. The gunshots struck one of two troopers inside the patrol car, Cesinger said, after which the gunman fled and continued shooting. Two other police officers were shot before the suspect was killed. The condition of the three law enforcement officers injured was not immediately released.Gerke said there were at least 21 civilian shooting victims.Shauna Saxton was one of the terrified drivers who said she encountered the gunman during his rampage, during which multiple witnesses described gunfire near shopping plazas and in busy intersections. Saxton was driving with her husband and grandson in Odessa and had paused at a stoplight when they heard loud pops."I looked over my shoulder to the left and the gold car pulled up and the man was there and he had a very large gun and it was pointing at me," she told TV station KOSA.Saxton said she was trapped because there were two cars in front of her. "I started honking my horn. I started swerving and we got a little ahead of him and then for whatever reason the cars in front of me kind of parted," she said sobbing. She said she heard three more shots as she sped away.Gerke did not go into detail about the chase, but the movie theater where the suspect was killed is more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) from where state troopers originally pulled over the gunman.The shooting comes just four weeks after a gunman in the Texas border city of El Paso killed 22 people after opening fire at a Walmart. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott this week held two meetings with lawmakers about how to prevent more mass shootings in Texas. He said he would visit the area Sunday.The shooting Saturday brings the number of mass killings in the US so far this year to 25, matching the number in all of 2018, according to The AP/USATODAY/Northeastern University mass murder database. The number of victims for this year has already reached 142, surpassing all last year.Seven people had remained in critical condition at one hospital hours after the West Texas shooting, said Russell Tippin, CEO of Medical Center Hospital in Odessa. He said a child under 2 years old was transported to another hospital.Dustin Fawcett said he was sitting in his truck at a Starbucks in Odessa when he heard at least six gunshots ring out less than 50 yards (46 meters) behind him.He spotted a white sedan with a passenger window that had been shattered. That's when he thought, "Oh man, this is a shooting."Fawcett, 28, an Odessa transportation consultant, "got out to make sure everyone was safe" but found that no one had been struck by the gunfire nearby. He said a little girl was bleeding, but she hadn't been shot, and that he later found out she was grazed in the face.Vice President Mike Pence said following the shooting that President Donald Trump and his administration "remain absolutely determined" to work with leaders in both parties in Congress to take such steps "so we can address and confront this scourge of mass atrocities in our country."Pence said Trump had spoken to the attorney general and that the FBI was assisting local law enforcement.Trump has offered contradictory messages in reacting to recent mass shootings. Days after the El Paso shooting he said he was eager to implement "very meaningful background checks" on guns and told reporters there was "tremendous support" for action. He later backed away, saying the current system of background checks was "very, very strong."Most recently, Trump has called for greater attention to mental health, saying that new facilities are needed for the mentally ill as a way to reduce mass shootings. However, some mental health professionals say such thinking is outdated, that linking mental illness to violence is wrong, and that the impact of more treatment would be helpful overall but would have a minor impact on gun violence.AP

                    Latest violence raises toll in US shootings in August to 53

                The seven people killed near Odessa, Texas, by a gunman brings the number of victims of US mass killings by firearms to 53 in the month of August. Texas was the site of four of the eight deadliest shootings in the United States this year, according to the website Mass Shooting Tracker. In the shooting on Saturday in Odessa, authorities said the gunman - identified as 36-year-old Seth Aaron Ator of Odessa - used an AR-type rifle. He shot and wounded three police officers before he was killed by police. Law enforcement officials said on Sunday that the death toll in the West Texas shootings may have been even higher had the shooter not been stopped and killed outside a crowded movie theater. The officials speculated the gunman may have planned to continue shooting inside the Cinergy Movie Theater in Odessa before the hijacked US Postal Service vehicle he was driving was disabled by law enforcement officers. Odessa Police Chief Michael Gerke said the gunman likely wouldn't drive to the theater unless he planned to go inside. He said the shooting remains under investigation but that Ator's death outside the theater may have saved lives. The US Postal Service said a 29-year-old employee was among the seven people killed. Letter carrier Mary Granados was among those killed on Saturday by the gunman who went on a more than 16-kilometer rampage. Authorities say the shooter hijacked her mail carrier truck and fired at random as he drove in the area of Odessa and Midland. Among the 22 wounded was a 17-month-old girl, Anderson Davis, who was shot in the face, according to officials. Daniel Munoz, 28, of Odessa, was headed to a bar to meet a friend when he noticed the driver of an approaching car was holding what appeared to be a rifle. "This is my street instincts: When a car is approaching you and you see a gun of any type, just get down," said Munoz, who moved from San Diego about a year ago to work in oil country. "Luckily I got down. ...Sure enough, I hear the shots go off. He let off at least three shots on me." Hundreds of people gathered at a local university in the Permian Basin region known for its oil industry on Sunday evening for a prayer vigil to console each other and grieve the loss of life. Odessa Mayor David Turner said: "We will get through the tragedy. We will show our beloved state and nation what it means to be Permian Basin strong." The other shootings in August include one on Aug 3 at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, where 22 people were killed and 26 others wounded by a gunman who targeted shoppers in the predominantly Hispanic border city. The suspect wrote an anti-immigrant manifesto that was posted online shortly before the attack. On Aug 4, nine people were killed and 27 wounded in Dayton, Ohio.
