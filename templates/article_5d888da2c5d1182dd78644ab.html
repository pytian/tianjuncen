                Social media roasted over US shootings
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Shootings that left 31 people dead and 53 injured in two US cities during a 24-hour period have prompted a national outcry over the role of social media in distributing white supremacist and extremist content online.Violent extremism online has dominated the news since the shootings on Aug 3 at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, killed 22 people and 9 people in Dayton, Ohio, raising questions about online platforms' responsibility to deal with extremism.The suspect in the El Paso case is accused of publishing an anti-immigrant "manifesto" on the web forum "8chan"' minutes before the attack took place.Patrick Crusius, 21, of Allen, Texas, has been charged with capital murder in the mass shooting that left more than two dozen injured. He is being held without bond and prosecutors are handling the attack as a case of domestic terrorism.Trump administration officials met with leaders from the technology companies last week and discussed efforts to combat online extremism.A four-page document, titled "The Inconvenient Truth," was published on 8chan about 20 minutes before the shooting in El Paso. Shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand, on March 15, and at a synagogue in Poway, California, on April 27, began with a post on 8chan.The suspect in the El Paso shooting claimed in the document that he was inspired by the Christchurch massacre that killed 51 people.It is filled with white supremacist language and racist hatred aimed at immigrants and Latinos. The author says he opposes "race mixing" and encourages immigrants to return to their home countries.The website 8chan has a history of use by extremists celebrating racist, anti-Semitic and white supremacist violence. The El Paso shooting prompted the site's founder, Fredrick Brennan, who no longer controls it, to urge its owners to "do the world a favor and shut it off".The site went offline after the cybersecurity company Cloudflare, which had been keeping the site online for years, decided to cut off services to 8chan under public pressure. The company Tucows, 8chan's domain name registrar, also said it would no longer provide services to the site."We have a white nationalist terrorism problem in this country and it's being aided and abetted by our largest technology companies," said the activist group Sleeping Giants in a tweet. "If you're doing business with a site that helps people spread violent, racist ideologies, you are just as culpable. Full stop," the group tweeted.The El Paso shooting came days after a shooter killed three people and injured 13 others on July 28 at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in California. The FBI announced on Tuesday it had opened a domestic terrorism investigation into the shooting.The shooter, who died in the incident, had a "target list" of religious institutions, political organizations and federal buildings, said the police.Authorities believe that the gunman in the Dayton shooting on Aug 3 was exploring "violent ideologies" before going on a killing spree. The shooter was killed in the incident, too."There is a direct correlation between the rise of hate groups on social media and the frequent attacks," Keegan Hankes, a senior research analyst for the Southern Poverty Law Center advocacy group, told USA Today.Hankes said Twitter "does one of the worst jobs of content moderation", calling it an "absolute cesspool" of hate.Joan Donovan, director of the Technology and Social Change Research Project at Harvard University's Shorenstein Center, said "posting to 8chan is a tactic" for attackers to gain attention.The manifesto of the El Paso suspect contains instructions and a weapons kit and a call for continued violence, said Donovan. "It is meant to inspire other white supremacists," she said.

                    Suspect in mosque attack filmed the shooting
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                OSLO - The man suspected of shooting at people inside a Norwegian mosque on Saturday, and of killing his Chinese-born stepsister, appeared in court on Monday with black eyes and wounds on his face and neck. A judge gave police permission to hold 21-year-old Philip Manshaus in custody for an initial four weeks while he is investigated on suspicion of murder and breach of an anti-terrorism law, the court's ruling later showed. Manshaus, who briefly smiled at photographers, does not admit to any crime, his lawyer said. Witnesses said Manshaus entered the al-Noor Islamic Center with several guns, but was overpowered by a 65-year-old member of the mosque, who managed to wrestle away his weapons in the fight that followed. Manshaus wore a helmet camera that filmed the shooting, but did not appear to have broadcast the attack, according to prosecutors. "This video is key evidence," police attorney Paal-Fredrik Hjort Kraby told a news conference. Manshaus, whose home is near the mosque just outside the Norwegian capital, had expressed farright, anti-immigrant views before the attack, police said. Online postings under Manshaus' name, made shortly before the attack, expressed admiration for the massacre of more than 50 people at two New Zealand mosques in March by a suspected white supremacist, who filmed and broadcast the killings live online. It could not independently be verified that the postings were made by Manshaus. A few hours after the Norwegian mosque attack, police discovered the body of a young woman at the suspect's address. Police later named her as his stepsister, Chinese-born Johanne Zhangjia Ihle-Hansen. The 17-year-old was adopted as a small child by a Norwegian woman, who is now married to Philip Manshaus' father, the woman's lawyer said. "These hours after what happened have been chaotic, unreal, a tragedy," said the lawyer, Elisabeth Hagen. "These are two tragedies, one with the girl and one with the mosque. I represent the mother of the girl," she said, adding that the girl's mother and Manshaus' father were together and surrounded by friends helping them cope. Hagen declined to comment on any possible motive for the killing. Manshaus did not speak while reporters were present, and has so far declined to talk to the police.

                    Rote words negate the intent: China Daily editorial

                Anyone anticipating anything new from Tokyo on the 74th anniversary of Japan's World War II surrender on Thursday, will have been disappointed as the message was the same as usual.In a speech that was closely scrutinized in many parts of Asia, the newly enthroned Japanese Emperor Naruhito merely expressed the same sentiment his father did using the same phrase, "...bearing in mind the feeling of deep remorse, I earnestly hope that the devastation of war will never be repeated". Prime Minister Shinzo Abe too employed wording he's used in past addresses when pledging: "We will never again repeat the devastation of war."Anyone on the Chrysanthemum Throne may have to be ultra prudent when choosing words for a speech meant to commemorate Japanese war dead. "Deep remorse" was the standard phrase in each of the former emperor's addresses since the 70th anniversary of Japan's surrender in 2015. The dawning of the new Reiwa era, named as one of harmony, may make no difference.Abe, for his part, never appears to be genuinely willing to go any further than he already has regarding his country's World War II record. While offering "heartfelt respect and gratitude" to Japan's war dead, the Japanese prime minister made no mention of those who suffered at their hands.Abe said his country had engraved the "lessons of history deep in our hearts". But, once again, he refrained from elaborating what those lessons are. Since taking office, he has consistently skirted around the atrocities committed by imperial Japanese troops during their occupation of neighboring countries. "Over 3 million of our countrymen's lives were lost during the war," Abe said, again avoiding any mention how many more lives were lost as a result of Japan's aggression.After his last visit to the notorious Yasukuni Shrine met with strong opposition from neighboring countries, he has been making offerings each year. This time in the form of a monetary offering called a tamagushi-ryo.As its ongoing spat with the Republic of Korea over war-time forced labor demonstrates, Japan's denial of its own past wrongdoing remains a seemingly insurmountable hurdle for it to overcome. The trade tit-for-tat between Tokyo and Seoul originated from their longstanding dispute over compensation for Koreans forced to work for Japanese companies before and during the war. But there is also the issue of "comfort women", which repeatedly sours bilateral ties.Until Japan stops paying lip service to the lessons of history, it will be impossible to develop truly healthy relations with the victim countries.

                BEIJING -- China on Thursday urged Japan to earnestly honor the statement and commitment it has made so far, after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent a ritual offering to the war-linked Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo."China has taken note of the negative move relating to Yasukuni Shrine from the Japanese side," said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, adding that this has once again reflected some Japanese politicians' erroneous attitude toward history.She said Japan needs to take practical actions to win the trust of its Asian neighbors and the international community.The offering by the Japanese prime minister came as Japan observed the 74th anniversary of its surrender in World War II. According to reports, some Japanese cabinet members and lawmakers also paid tribute to the controversial shrine.

                    San Francisco mayor backs advocacy group to press for gun control
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                SAN FRANCISCO - San Francisco Mayor London Breed on Saturday threw her weight behind an anti-gun violence advocacy group in the Bay Area to urge the federal government and lawmakers in Congress to take action to control gun-related crime.Addressing a rally by the Bay Area chapters of gun safety group, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, held in front of the City Hall in downtown San Francisco, Breed blamed in part the gun-related violence to an underground market of weapons and easy access to guns by people, including children."We also know that it's too easy to get guns, just more easy to get guns in this country than it is to get books," she told the audience at the rally attended by other city officials, supervisors and California state lawmakers.Recalling her own childhood in San Francisco where she grew up in public housing, Breed said she saw a person was shot and killed in a neighborhood when she was "just hanging out" with her friends."We experienced a lot of gun violence," she said.She hoped the lawmakers in Congress would take action and do their jobs in passing comprehensive legislation on background checks for people who want to own weapons, so that "our kids are not walking to school in fear.""Ultimately, what's most important is there has to be accountability for making sure that we create a better future for the next generation of young people," she said.California Assemblyman David Chiu said the American people, especially San Franciscans, are "sick and tired" of the lack of action by the government and Congress to take meaningful measures to curb gun violence.He said he has played a role in enacting the "most sweeping gun safety laws" in the United States, but "we are hamstrung because the federal government refuses to act and move forward."A 17-year-old high school girl in San Francisco spoke out at the rally, telling a story about her 15-year-old brother who was shot and killed in July this year."Nobody deserves to lose their life at 15 years old, and nobody deserves to lose their life at all," she chanted emotionally at the rally, vowing to do all she can to make a change and fight for gun control.Elizabeth Moore, community outreach coordinator for Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense, told Xinhua that the demonstrators from the group's chapters in the Bay Area were rallying here Saturday to press for two major policies related to gun control and safety -- a federal legislation of universal background checks for all gun sales and a red flag law dedicated to gun violence prevention.She said a resolution on background checks for people who intend to buy guns has been passed by the House of Representatives, and they want the Senate to take immediate action to make it get through Congress."The second thing we're advocating for today is red flag laws, where a concerned family that has a family member who suffers an acute mental health crisis or has made threats against themselves can ask a court to temporarily suspend that person's access to their guns," she said.The rally came after several mass shootings have taken place across the country this month -- in El Paso of Texas, Dayton of Ohio, Philadelphia and Chicago, in addition to a massacre in Gilroy city of California in July.Dozens of people have been killed and many more injured in gun-related violence this year, with the two shootings in El Paso and Dayton leaving at least 31 people dead over 50 others injured.

                    Some show ignorance of situation in Hong Kong
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                One thing that is worrisome about Hong Kong is the ignorance among some in the media regarding the current situation.For more than two months, I have been asked to comment on the situation in Hong Kong, a city with which I have a special relationship. I witnessed the ceremony of China's restoration of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, and later visited the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on several occasions.The State Council, China's Cabinet, commissioned me to translate the Arabic version of the Hong Kong Basic Law.Some mistakenly think Hong Kong is an independent country and ignorantly ask about the possibility of China "intervening" there.And some don't even know the reasons for the protests. On being told that the amendment the protesters cited as an excuse to demonstrate has been withdrawn, and therefore there is no justification for the protests, they talk about freedom and democracy.The biased media is trying to tarnish the image of China and the Hong Kong SAR's government. They refrain from condemning the violence perpetrated by protesters, while exaggerating the police action in maintaining public security and order.For instance, a BBC report on July 30 highlighted a police officer pointing a gun at a crowd of protesters, but ignored the fact that the officer had been attacked by protesters and was pointing the gun in self-defense.It appears that different parties want to exploit the Hong Kong situation to their advantage. There are those who want to use the protests to generate sympathy for their own problem, for example the attempt to compare the Egypt clashes of 2013 and the Hong Kong protests.Yahya Hamed, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist organization, wrote in Newsweek on Aug 20: "I survived Egypt's Rabaa massacre. And believe me, it could happen in Hong Kong." But that situation, in which more than a hundred people were killed, involved clashes between supporters and opponents of Egypt's ousted president Mohamed Morsi in the Rabaa al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.When I tell interviewers that protesters in Hong Kong stormed the airport and government buildings, destroyed public property, assaulted civilians and journalists and raised the British and US flags, and that the victims are the common people of Hong Kong, they seem to have a clear message: Condemn China.China is committed to the "one country, two systems" principle in Hong Kong. In accordance with the Basic Law, Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy. With the exception of external relations and national defense, which are the responsibility of the central government, Hong Kong has executive and legislative powers. It also has judicial independence.The author is a senior political researcher at Egypt State Information Service. The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.

                Bernhard Arp Sindberg might be little known in his home country of Denmark, but in China, the Aarhus native is revered for his humanitarian efforts of saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians during the Nanjing Massacre of 1937-38.To commemorate his heroism, a three-meter tall bronze statue of Sindberg was unveiled by Danish Queen Margrethe II on Saturday in Marselisbourg Memorial Park, Aarhus, Denmark.The memorial is the result of a Chinese-Danish artistic collaboration between three artists, Shang Rong, Fu Licheng and Lene Desmentik, and is a gift to Aarhus by the city of Nanjing, which wished to honor Sinberg, who has been called the Danish Schindler, and who is known as "Shining Buddha" and "the greatest Dane" to this day in China.During the horrific Nanjing Massacre, an estimated 300,000 Chinese were tortured, maimed, raped and murdered by occupying Japanese troops in the six weeks starting on Dec 13, 1937. But the young Dane from Aarhus – just 26 years old at the time – succeeded in saving thousands by protecting them in a Danish concrete factory in the city, where he worked as a guard.Speaking at the statue-unveiling ceremony, Jacob Bundsgaard, mayor of Aarhus, praised Sindberg "a man of extraordinary character" as history placed him in the middle of one of the most terrible massacres the world has seen."We do not know the reason why Bernhard Arp Sindberg reacted at the time as he did, and gave protection to the thousands who, during the massacre, sought refuge at the cement factory where he was a guard," he said. "Maybe even he never knew the reason himself, but simply reacted because it was once again what he had to do - solely for the reason that it was the right thing," he said.Peng Zhengang, director of the information office of the Nanjing Municipal Government, said: "During the 72 years of his adventurous life, Sindberg had 106 days closely interwoven with the people of Nanjing by witnessing the darkest moment in the history of human civilization - the Nanjing Massacre."In the face of catastrophe and death, Sindberg, who was only 26 years old, did not retreat or escape, he set up and took care of a refugee camp in Kiangnan Cement Works, increasing the chance of survival for hundreds of thousands of Chinese people," Peng said."While keeping on fighting back, he recorded everything he had witnessed, leaving behind irrefutable evidences for us to remember that part of the history and giving the best interpretation of the fraternity and courage to reach out to the people in need and assist the people in distress at the risk of his own life," Peng said.On behalf of the Municipal Government of Nanjing, Peng also presented the queen with a combination of precious gifts: Her Majesty's Royal Portrait made with traditional Chinese handicrafts and painting.Nanjing and Aarhus also signed a Memorandum of Understanding, with aims to provide a strong impetus to mutual understanding, enhance friendship and promote exchange and cooperation between the two sides.Both sides have agreed on advancing toward the goal of a twinning relationship by carrying out and supporting inter-governmental visit and the exchanges and cooperation in scientific research, education and healthcare, peaceful city-building, smart-city promotion, innovation and entrepreneurship, culture and other aspects so as to shore up the competence for the two municipal governments to serve their economic and social development goals.The "Nanjing-Aarhus" Twin Cities Friendship Promo, produced by students from the Film & Transmedia Academy of Aarhus-based VIA University, was premiered at the signing ceremony.

                Bernhard Arp Sindberg might be little known in his home country of Denmark, but in China, the Aarhus native is revered for his humanitarian efforts in saving the lives of tens of thousands of Chinese civilians during the Nanjing Massacre of 1937-38. In a gesture to commemorate his heroism, a 3-meter bronze statue of Sindberg was unveiled by Danish Queen Margrethe II on Saturday in Marselisbourg Memorial Park in Aarhus, Denmark. The memorial resulted from a Chinese-Danish collaboration involving three artists: Shang Rong, Fu Licheng and Lene Desmentik. It is a gift to Aarhus from the city of Nanjing, which wanted to honor Sindberg, who has been called the Danish Schindler and who is known as "Shining Buddha" and "the greatest Dane" in China. During the horrific Nanjing Massacre, an estimated 300,000 Chinese people were tortured, maimed, raped and murdered by the occupying Japanese troops in the six weeks starting on Dec 13, 1937. Sindberg, who was 26 at the time, succeeded in saving thousands of people by protecting them in a Danish cement factory in the city, where he worked as a guard. Speaking at the statue unveiling ceremony, Jacob Bundsgaard, mayor of Aarhus, praised Sindberg as "a man of extraordinary character" after history placed him in the midst of one of the most terrible massacres the world has seen. "We do not know the reason why Bernhard Arp Sindberg reacted at the time as he did, and gave protection to the thousands who, during the massacre, sought refuge at the cement factory where he was a guard," he said.

He said Sindberg recorded everything he had witnessed, leaving behind "irrefutable evidence for us to remember that part of history and giving the best interpretation of fraternity and courage to reach out to the people in need and assist the people in distress at risk of his own life." Sindberg, together with Karl Guenther, a German engineer who also worked at the cement factory, decided to open the factory gates to the people of Nanjing. After a few days, thousands had taken refuge there. To ward off Japanese bombs, Sindberg painted a huge Danish flag on the roof of the cement factory and raised both the Danish flag and two German swastika flags - two nations the Japanese respected and were not at war with. The flags helped deter Japanese troops from entering. Sindberg and Guenther set up a makeshift hospital for the Chinese refugees, and repeatedly risked their lives driving into the occupied city to collect food, medicine and supplies from the Red Cross. It is estimated that Sindberg saved tens of thousands of people during the massacre, which has been called "the forgotten Holocaust". He is still revered in China for his efforts. wangmingjie@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily Global 09/03/2019 page1)
