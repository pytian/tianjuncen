                Gun deaths outpace efforts for reform in US
            </p>
            <p>
                Two shootings in Washington highlight partisan divisions as accusations tradedWASHINGTON - Despite the increasing frequency of mass shootings which have shocked the nation, gun reform legislation in the United States remains uncertain, as bipartisan negotiations are moving slowly in Washington.Such a seemingly endless tug of war in Washington is taking a toll on the people of the country. On Thursday night, one person was killed and five others injured in a shooting in Washington, not far from the White House, according to police.Metropolitan police were searching for two men armed with a rifle seen at the shooting scene in a largely residential part of the northwest Washington neighborhood.Three others were wounded in another shooting, in northeast Washington, although police didn't know if the two shootings were related, The Washington Post reported."We're not moving on anything," US President Donald Trump said early on Thursday. "We're moving very slowly in one way because we want to make sure it's right."The Republican president blamed the slow progress on former congressman Beto O'Rourke, who said during last week's Democratic presidential primary debate that he would ensure mandatory buybacks for assault-style rifles, such as AR-15, if elected."Part of the problem that we have is because Beto O'Rourke's statement about taking away guns," Trump said. "All of the moderate Republicans and some Democrats are now afraid to do anything to go down that slippery slope."O'Rourke has made gun legislation a key aspect of his presidential campaign since a mass shooting at a Walmart store in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, left 22 dead in August."Here we are in 2019 and we still don't have universal background checks or 'red flag' laws or we allowed the assault weapons ban to expire, even though it did so much good and saved so many lives," O'Rourke told CNN on Wednesday.While his proposal raises a number of legal and logistical questions, including some from Democrats, O'Rourke said that he's willing to fight."No one in this country, including owners of AR-15s and AK-47s, think that what is happening right now is OK," he said.The remarks came as the government is reportedly circulating a memo on Capitol Hill describing a possible proposal to expand background checks to all advertised commercial sales, including sales at gun shows.If someone who attempts to buy a firearm fails a background check, it would be reported to law enforcement officials, according to the memo.The House passed a bipartisan background checks bill earlier this year but the Senate, controlled by the Republicans, hasn't taken up the House bill.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that the chamber is waiting for indications of what Trump is willing to sign.Xinhua - Agencies

                US House Speaker Pelosi urges Trump administration to release whistleblower complaint
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday urged the Trump administration to release a whistleblower complaint on the president's alleged inappropriate interactions with a foreign leader, an issue that continued to stoke speculations in Congress."We must be sure that the President and his Administration are conducting our national security and foreign policy in the best interest of the American people, not the President's personal interest," Pelosi said in a statement.Trump reportedly communicated with a foreign leader and made an unspecified "promise," which an unidentified intelligence official considered so troubling that the official filed a whistleblower complaint in mid-August with the inspector general for the intelligence community, an independent watchdog.Acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Joseph Maguire has been withholding the whistleblower complaint from Congress."The President and Acting (DNI's) stonewalling must end immediately, and the whistleblower must be provided with every protection guaranteed by the law to defend the integrity of our government and ensure accountability and trust," Pelosi said.At least part of the complaint involved Ukraine, The Washington Post and The New York Times both reported, citing anonymous sources.House Democrats, according to The Washington Post, have been probing a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to see whether Trump, and his attorney, Rudolph Giuliani, aimed to manipulate Kiev into helping his re-election campaign.The Wall Street Journal, in an exclusive report Friday, said that Trump had urged Zelensky about eight times in the phone call to work with Giuliani in seeking information about Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, which could be damaging to Biden senior's campaign.During joint press availability in the Oval Office with visiting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday, Trump said that his conversations with leaders around the world were "always appropriate... at the highest level, always appropriate.""It's just another political hack job. That's all it is," Trump said of the complaint.Trump told reporters that it didn't matter what he discussed with Zelensky and that the phone call was "a beautiful conversation."The president's response came amid heightened tensions between Congress and the White House over the scandal.On Thursday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, warned of possible legal action while lambasting Acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Joseph Maguire's decision to withhold the whistleblower complaint from the House committees."We do not have the complaint. We do not know whether the press reports are accurate or inaccurate about the contents of that complaint," Schiff told reporters. "We're determined to do everything we can to determine what this urgent concern is to make sure that the national security is protected."Michael Atkinson, the inspector general, wrote in a letter to Schiff dated Sept. 17, "I set forth the reasons for my concluding that the subject matter involved in the Complaint's disclosure not only falls within the DNI's jurisdiction, but relates to one of the most significant and important of the DNI's responsibilities to the American people."

                Biden urges investigation into Trump's alleged 'abuse of power' in whistleblower complaint
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - Irritated by being related to a whistleblower complaint involving US President Donald Trump's alleged misbehavior, Joe Biden, Democratic presidential candidate, accused Trump of "abuse of power" on Saturday and called for an investigation.At the center of the complaint, according to media reports, is Trump's phone call in July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump reportedly pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to seek information about business dealings between Biden's son, Hunter Biden, and a Ukrainian gas company. The information could potentially be damaging to Biden senior's White House bid."You should be asking him (Trump) the question: why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader?" Biden was quoted by Politico as saying Saturday in Des Moines, Iowa."This appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power. To get on the phone with a foreign leader who is looking for help from the United States and ask about me and imply things ... this is outrageous. You have never seen anything like this from any president," said the former vice president.Asked by reporters to comment on the whistleblower complaint, which was filed by an unidentified intelligence official in mid-August, Trump said Friday in the Oval Office that the revelation is "partisan" and "just another political hack job."Claiming that his phone call with Zelensky was "a beautiful conversation," the president reiterated the need to probe his potential competitor in the 2020 election."Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars he's not giving to a certain country, unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case," he said.According to an exclusive report by the Wall Street Journal on Friday, Biden, during his trips to Ukraine as vice president, had asked the Ukrainian government to oust former prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, who had investigated Burisma Group, a private Ukrainian gas company of which Biden junior was a board member during his father's vice presidency.The Journal said Trump's attorney Rudolph Giuliani suggested that the former vice president's motivation was to protect his son, although Shokin had already completed his investigation of Burisma Group before he left office.Biden on Saturday resolutely denied having spoken with his son about the latter's overseas business dealings. "You should be looking at Trump," Biden said, according to Politico. "Everybody looked at this and everybody who's looked at it said there's nothing there. Ask the right question."On the election, Biden said: "I know what I'm up against, a serial abuser. That's what this guy is. He abuses power any way he can."Trump slammed the Democrats and the media on Saturday, tweeting that they started what he termed "the Ukraine Witch Hunt" and tried to "protect Sleepy Joe Biden."Biden, for his part, said in Des Moines that Trump has been "using every element of his presidency to try and smear me."

                Trump joins India's Modi at Houston rally amid tensions in India-controlled Kashmir
            </a>
            <p>
                HOUSTON - US President Donald Trump on Sunday shared a stage with visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi here to address a large group of Indian-American community, as the situation remains intense over India-controlled Kashmir.Trump hailed the US-Indian ties while addressing the "Howdy, Modi!" rally in the NRG Stadium, which attracted approximately 50,000 people, mostly Indian Americans, to attend in a gesture of welcoming the Indian prime minister.Trump also revealed that the United States is working closely with India to enhance space cooperation.Outside the stadium, thousands of people were protesting against Modi over the alleged human rights violations in India-controlled Kashmir and other places targeting India's minorities, US media reported.Tensions remain high between India and Pakistan after the abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian constitution by India over India-controlled Kashmir in August. Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties, suspended trade relations and stopped train services with India as a reaction to India's decision.On Saturday, troops of India and Pakistan reportedly resorted to heavy fire and mortar shelling on the Line of Control, the de-facto border between the two countries in the disputed area.Modi is on a week-long trip to the United States, during which he will address the annual United Nations General Assembly and host a special event to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of India's Father of Nation Mahatma Gandhi.
