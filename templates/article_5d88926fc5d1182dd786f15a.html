                Twitterplomacy is less about resolving issues than playing to a domestic audience
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Welcome to the era of Twitterplomacy, in which major international issues are addressed in 280 alphabet characters or less.President Donald Trump, with his daily online responses to matters of the day, is often regarded as a pioneer in the field. In reality, the trend toward global politicians communicating via virtual one-liners was well under way before he transformed it into a surrealist art form.In a recent Twitter posting, Trump praised President Xi Jinping as a great leader who had the respect of his people before proposing, in connection with events in Hong Kong: "Personal meeting?"Stumped for a response to this unconventional approach to what it regards as a domestic issue, Beijing wisely chose to ignore it.There is a place for one-on-one encounters between world leaders to resolve issues of mutual interest. They can sometimes break the deadlock that tied up diplomats and negotiators lower down the line.But top-level meetings, proposed on little more than a whim, have little chance of progress without the diplomatic spadework required to give them any chance of success.Trump's critics have warned of the perils of his transactional approach to international relations in which he believes leaders should sit down together like company CEOs and hammer out advantageous deals with little regard for their wider global obligations.Maybe they are missing the point. Perhaps the attraction of Twitterplomacy is less about resolving issues than in playing to a domestic audience or diverting attention from more pressing problems.As a communications technique employed by certain world leaders, it is not entirely new. Before the internet there was "megaphone diplomacy" that involved loud, frequently threatening and very public exchanges between global antagonists.China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi used the phrase in 2015 to describe a series of public interventions by US officials and politicians criticizing China's policy in the South China Sea.The one virtue of megaphone diplomacy is that, in principle, it requires reflection and forethought. Wisely deployed, it can be used to warn others of the consequences of unprovoked aggression.Instant messaging apps such as Twitter, however, tend to reinforce the spur-of-the-moment thoughts and prejudices that even world leaders can be tempted to share in an instant, only to repent at their leisure.The Christian Science Monitor newspaper in the US spotted the trend as early as 2011, when Twitter was just five years old. It listed the then octogenarian Fidel Castro of Cuba as one of its most active users, alongside Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and North Korea's Kim Jong-il.Barack Obama, Trump's more reflective predecessor, had seven million followers on the messaging service just two years into his presidency.Trump, after signing up at the start of his term, now has almost four times as many people – the US citizens and others – following his messaging feed. Postings range from the characteristically self-congratulatory to the tersely cryptic, such as "We are doing very well with China, and talking!" from Sunday.Outside the US, instant messaging appears to have become the vehicle of choice for British and European politicians embroiled in the UK's continuing Brexit crisis at a time when their parliaments are in recess.It can all be seen as part of a wider trend, at least in the West, for political leaders to talk directly to their citizens – often in imprecise and emotional tones – over the heads of other politicians and bureaucrats.Boris Johnson, the United Kingdom prime minister, recently boasted – via Twitter – that he had hosted the first "people's parliamentary questions" – via Facebook.The mid-August exercise in direct democracy involved voters having an opportunity to put questions directly to Johnson via Facebook, in the same way that MPs can question the prime minister face-to-face in Parliament on a weekly basis.Critics countered that the technique allowed Johnson and his aides to pick the questions they chose to answer, while denying the questioners any right of reply. Not quite direct democracy, in other words.For large numbers of ordinary people, online social media is a valuable resource. But it is not clear that it has done anything to enhance the level of international interchange.It gives populist politicians an additional means to appeal directly to their base, often by insulting perceived enemies both foreign and domestic. Such messages are spread, amplified and frequently exaggerated by their own followers.A number of US commentators have made the point that Trump appears to have reversed President Theodore Roosevelt's dictum that a US leader should "speak softly and carry a big stick". Under Trump, they say, the US speaks loudly and carries a small stick.In any event, world leaders should follow the simple rule of thumb that applies to anyone who uses messaging and sharing apps: think twice before you press "send".

                The United States should stop selling arms to Taiwan and not have military links with the island, or it will bear all the consequences as China will certainly make a strong response, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Friday.Hua made the remarks in an online statement after the Trump administration informally approved an $8 billion arms sale to Taiwan involving dozens of new F-16 fighter jets, CNN quoted administration officials and others familiar with the matter as saying.The decision comes amid heightened tensions between China and the US because of continuing trade frictions. Congress was notified informally of the potential sale on Thursday, and it's expected to be reviewed and approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, it said.Beijing firmly opposes such the move, and has lodged solemn representations to Washington, Hua said.The US selling weapons to Taiwan interferes in the internal affairs of China and undermines security interests of the country, she added.The spokeswoman emphasized that the Taiwan question is related to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and concerning core interests of the country.China demands that the US fully recognize the high sensitivity and serious harm of the relevant issue and abide by the one-China principle and the three Sino-US joint communiques.Also on Friday, in response to Trump's saying in an interview that he would speak to President Xi Jinping "very soon", Hua said that the heads of states of the two countries have always maintained communication through meetings, phone calls and messages.

                    Some exploit situation, seek to discredit China

                Hong Kong and its 7.4 million residents have been facing troubled times over the past 11 weeks. Unlawful demonstrations and occupations by masked protesters with hard hats, makeshift weapons and laser lights targeting the police have become frequent occurrences in different parts of the special administrative region.Hong Kong's busy international airport was targeted and air services were paralyzed, causing untold hardship to thousands of travelers, damaging the region's reputation as a "world-class city".Despite these disturbances, some politicians in Britain, the United States and Europe have failed to condemn their illegality. Instead, they exploited the unrest in Hong Kong by expressing concern over democracy and for the law-breaking protesters, while trying to discredit China by saying the country is preparing to break away from the framework that established the SAR and will take action, military ones if needed, to restore law and order in Hong Kong.What they have expressed is disingenuous and false. How can they condone violence perpetrated by protesters who wore masks to hide their identities with the intention of causing destruction to property and harming people?Senior politicians from countries like the United Kingdom, the US, Canada, France and Germany, as well as the European Union, were among those who raised concerns over the protests.In the US, for instance, President Donald Trump was happy to link the fate of the so-called pro-democracy protesters to the trade deal with China. His suggestion that a "personal meeting" between President Xi Jinping and the protesters could help resolve the crisis was nothing but empty words.Meanwhile, Britain's Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab telephoned Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, Hong Kong's chief executive, on Aug 9 to discuss his concerns about the situation. Despite the fact that he expressed support for the SAR's high degree of autonomy under the "one country, two systems" principle and acknowledged that the protests were "not all peaceful", he went on to suggest that there was a "need to find a way forward through meaningful political dialogue".Common sense dictates that one can never reason with those whose raison d'etre for illegal and inconsiderate actions is to inflict as much mayhem as possible by damaging the fabric of peace and stability.One wonders if anyone in the Foreign Office had briefed Raab that the "one country, two systems" is a constitutional principle that facilitated Hong Kong's return to China sovereignty since 1997. Raab should realize Hong Kong is now the SAR of China.One can compare the similarities between Hong Kong's return to China and Britain's imminent exit from the EU. As a former Brexit secretary, Raab should know that once Britain exits from the EU, he will no longer have a role to play in telling the other 27 nations how they should or should not behave.Would Raab call French President Emmanuel Macron and share with him how to deal with the yellow vest movement in his country, or advise Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on how to deal with Catalonia's bid for independence?One would not think so. To put it simply, those are none of his business. The time for rhetoric and half-truths is over. What needs to be done urgently is for Hong Kong's citizens to pick up the pieces and work together to ensure the region's continued unity, stability and prosperity.The author was the first Chinese British citizen to be elected mayor of the London Borough of Redbridge (2009-10) and was a member of the Redbridge Council for 12 years.

                    Experts: Fresh trade threats by US will not work

                China won't give in to pressure by the United States on tariffs and will firmly defend its core interests, as it has sufficient countermeasures available, experts said.The reaction came after the Ministry of Commerce expressed strong opposition on Saturday to a new threat of additional tariffs by the US on about $550 billion worth of Chinese imports. The ministry urged Washington to reverse course immediately or be prepared to "bear all the consequences".The ministry said that China is "firmly opposed" to the US' "unilateral and bullying acts of trade protectionism and extreme pressure", and urged it to immediately stop its "erroneous practices".On Sunday, the White House moved to clarify comments made at the G7 summit in France by US President Donald Trump, saying he meant to say he wished he had raised tariffs on Chinese goods even more last week.Trump raised eyebrows on the sidelines of the G7 when he responded in the affirmative to questions from reporters on whether he had second thoughts about raising tariffs on Chinese goods by 5 percent.Trump also signaled he did not plan to follow through with a demand that American companies find ways to close operations in China.China Ministry of Commerce said that the latest tariff threat by the US violates the consensus reached between the countries' top leaders and severely undermines the multilateral trading system and normal international trade order, adding that Washington "will eat the bitter fruit of its own actions".Gu Xueming, head of the ministry's Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, said the pressure tactics will not work with China, which will "unswervingly protect itself".Going forward, the country's countermeasures will be more rational, firmer and more powerful, Gu said at a seminar in Beijing on Sunday.Gu said he hoped the US will see the situation clearly, "give up its illusions" and resolve its differences with China with mutual benefit and respect.Bai Ming, a senior researcher at the academy, said China has sufficient tools to counter the US administration's unilateral tariff actions. The "quality" of the tools matters most, he said.On Friday, the US administration said it will raise duties on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods from the current 25 percent to 30 percent beginning Oct 1, and on the remaining imports of $300 billion from the previously planned 10 percent, to 15 percent on Sept 1.The move followed Beijing's plan Thursday to raise tariffs on $75 billion worth of US goods in response to the US' planned levies on an additional $300 billion worth of Chinese imports, announced earlier this month.The US imported goods from China totaling $478.4 billion in 2018, according to China's General Administration of Customs."It is rational, as China did this to protect its own economic and social interests and safeguard its right of development, as well as to defend multilateralism and economic globalization," said Sang Baichuan, director of the Institute of International Business at the University of International Business and Economics. "The move is also powerful because additional tariffs on certain US products, like soybeans and oil, hit the US where it really hurts."Since the China-US trade dispute erupted about a year and a half ago, the world's two largest economies have slapped several rounds of import duties on each other.US trade groups spoke out about the latest tariff escalation, and a couple of American business executives compared Trump's latest move to a 1930 law that increased tariffs, which they said contributed to the Great Depression."Enough is enough — as evidenced by Friday's 623-point drop in the Dow," said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Technology Association in Arlington, Virginia."These escalating tariffs are the worst economic mistake since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 – a decision that catapulted our country into the Great Depression. Instead of making America great again, the president is using tariffs to make a great economic mistake – again," Shapiro said in a statement."How much longer will our families, companies and economy be forced to bear the financial burden of this misguided trade policy?" he asked.Rick Helfenbein, CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, said businesses are being subjected to "a 1930s trade strategy"."Meanwhile, the president has said he wants American businesses to stop working in China, yet he doesn't seem to understand that moving a supply chain is incredibly complicated and expensive," Helfenbein said, referring to Trump's tweet Friday in which he "hereby ordered" US companies to seek alternatives to doing business in China.At the G7 on Sunday, Trump softened that remark: "I have no plan right now (to order US companies out of China). Actually, we're getting along very well with China right now. We're talking," Trump said."President Xi is still his friend," US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Sunday. "But as it relates to financial issues and trade, we have become enemies. We're not making progress."Myron Brilliant, executive vice-president and head of international affairs for the US Chamber of Commerce, said that the 40-year trade relationship between the US and China has been for the most part "productive, constructive, and mutually beneficial"."While we share the president's frustration, we believe that continued, constructive engagement is the right way forward. Time is of the essence. We do not want to see a further deterioration of US-China relations," Brilliant said.Farmers for Free Trade said in a statement that the rapid evaporation of the Chinese market has for the first time in more than four decades "brought us to the brink of losing our agriculture trade surplus with the rest of the world".Chinese companies halted purchases of US farm produce early this month when the US planned to impose additional 10 percent tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports, which violated the consensus reached by the two heads of state in Osaka, Japan, at the end of July."While American farmers are on the sidelines, farmers in Brazil, Canada and Russia are reaping the benefits of the administration's trade policy decisions," it said. "Farmers want a win, not a war."Reuters contributed to this story.
