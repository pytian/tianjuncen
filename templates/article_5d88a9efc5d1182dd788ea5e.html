                Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May waits for the result of the vote in her constituency at the count centre for the general election in Maidenhead, June 9, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]LONDON - British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives are at risk of losing their overall majority, while remaining the largest party in Westminster, BBC forecasts suggest.The Conservatives are predicted to win 318 seats, Labour 262.Based on results so far, it remains unclear whether Theresa May's party will secure the 326 seats required for a majority.Theresa May said Britain needed a period of stability and that she would take responsibility for delivering it if she won the most seats."At this time, more than anything else this country needs a period of stability," May said after winning her own parliamentary seat."If, as the indications have shown, and if this is correct that the Conservative Party has won the most seats and probably the most votes then it will be incumbent on us to ensure that we have that period of stability and that is exactly what we will do," May said.There are 46.9 million registered voters in the UK and they will vote to choose 650 members of Parliament to represent them. In theory, if one party gets at least 326 MPs, it will be able to form a government. If the largest party gets less than 326, it may have to form a coalition. As Sinn Fein MPs from Northern Ireland and MPs appointed to the Speaker's office don't vote, the actual minimum number of seats for a practical majority is 322.The polls are not always reliable – in 2015 the same pollsters predicted David Cameron's Conservatives would be the biggest party, but 10 seats short of an overall majority.In the event Cameron won with an an overall majority of 17, which May inherited when she became prime minister in June last year.First results in today's election are expected around 23:00 local time, and an overall result could come in any time between 4:30 or 7:00.REUTERS/BBC

                    Ex-PM Cameron accepts senior role with Sino-UK fund
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Former prime minister David Cameron has accepted a lead role with a newly proposed 750-million-pound ($1 billion) China-UK fund at a time when the United Kingdom is strengthening its relationship with China amid uncertainties around its pending exit from the European Union.Announced on Saturday as one of 72 outcomes from the ninth China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue held in Beijing, the fund is being hailed as a new milestone in the "golden era" of China-UK relations that began in October 2015 when President Xi Jinping met Cameron during Xi's state visit to the UK.The new fund is a private-sector initiative involving institutional investors from China and the UK and involves no taxpayer money.According to a statement issued jointly by both governments, the new fund will"invest in innovative, sustainable and consumption-driven growth opportunities" in the UK, China, and other countries involved in the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative. The initiative seeks to increase international connectivity through infrastructure investment.British politicians, including Cameron, have voiced strong support for the initiative, with a view to positioning London as a financing hub supporting Belt and Road investments.Cameron resigned as prime minister in June 2016 in the wake of the referendum decision by UK voters for Britain to leave the EU.While Cameron was in office, several high-profile China-UK deals were struck, including China General Nuclear Corp's investment in the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. During Xi's visit to the UK, bilateral business deals worth 40 billion pounds were signed.Cameron has kept a low profile since stepping down. In January, he became the new president of the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, after taking a private-sector job in October when he joined the board of US payments technology company First Data.Cameron's involvement with the China-UK fund was at the invitation of his friend Peter Gummer, who is leading its establishment. In September, Cameron met Chinese Vice-Premier Ma Kai in Beijing to discuss proposals for the fund.Cameron will be the fund's vice-chairman, a role that allows him to "facilitate dialogue with the UK and Chinese governments ... at the invitation of the UK government", according to a statement from the UK government's advisory committee on business appointments, which regulates the new business roles of Britain's former politicians.In allowing Cameron to accept the job, the organization waived its usual two-year ban on former ministers liaising with the government after leaving office.A spokesman for Cameron said he remains "very proud of his work as prime minister launching the 'golden era' between the UK and China with President Xi".

                    China helping clear Brexit storm clouds
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Sino-British ties strengthening ahead of UK's European departureOn Thursday, June 23, 2016, the day of the referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union, parts of London were hit by a huge storm.Thunder, torrential rain, and lightning strikes saw the London Fire Brigade receive an entire day's worth of calls in 90 minutes. Roads were flooded and there was transport chaos. But the next day, people woke up to something even more shocking.Out of the 72 percent of eligible voters who turned out to take part in the referendum nationwide, a slim majority - 51.9 percent - had voted to leave the trading bloc. London, by contrast, had voted 60 percent in favor of remaining in the EU. The process known as Brexit had begun.Fast forward two years and the outlook remains unsettled. Then-prime minister David Cameron, the man who called the referendum, resigned as soon as its result became clear. His successor, Theresa May, who as home secretary had made a speech in April 2016 in which she said "remaining inside the European Union does make us more secure, it does make us more prosperous, and it does make us more influential beyond our shores", had inherited the task of overseeing Britain's departure from the EU, which is scheduled for the end of March 2019. This is proving to be a spectacularly complex process.The pronouncement of International Trade Secretary Liam Fox that Britain's post-Brexit free-trade deal with the EU would be the "easiest in human history" has proved to be anything but, and given the uncertainty over what divorce terms Britain will manage to secure, many international companies seem to be erring on the side of caution and drawing up plans to relocate from the UK to mainland Europe.Frankfurt, home of Germany's financial sector, seems to be benefiting, and in April The Independent newspaper quoted Tarek al-Wazir, the economy minister for the state of Hesse, where the city is situated, as saying "we've got 18 entities that have committed". He was confident more would follow.Morgan Stanley has confirmed it is moving up to 10 percent of its United Kingdom workforce, and Goldman Sachs has also shown signs of having itchy feet, gradually increasing its presence in mainland Europe.Given the uncertainty that surrounds Britain's future relationship with its nearest neighbors, and the unpredictable behavior of its previous best friend, the United States, the country is casting its eyes around for new trading partners and friends for the coming years. And few nations look quite as attractive as China.Fortunately for Britain, the cultivation of this relationship is not beginning from a standing start. Long before Brexit was a reality, President Xi Jinping had already made a high-profile trip to the UK and met Cameron, ushering in what is known as the "golden era" of Sino-British relations. And, early this year, May visited China to strengthen those ties.On the face of it, Britain would seem to be in a strong position. Xinhua News Agency this year reported that Britain is China's second-largest trading partner within the EU, and that China is the UK's second-largest non-EU trading partner.Trade between the two countries rose in 2017 to $79 billion, an increase of almost 6.2 percent on the previous year. And British exports to China went up 19.4 percent.Tony Samuels, a lawyer and notary public with Howard Kennedy LLP in the City of London financial district, has worked closely with many of China's leading financial institutions.He said that, despite the challenges posed by the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, London has always held a special allure for Chinese individuals and companies, and he expects this relationship to flourish in the years to come."London has always been very attractive," he said. "Pre-Brexit they were buying up lots of residential and residential block developments. For example, the area around the American embassy in Vauxhall was being consumed by the Chinese very quickly. They're still buying now, but not in such big numbers."That's because the Chinese are being wary. They don't plan five or 10 years ahead like some countries. With China, it's 20 or 30 years. It's all about capital appreciation - they're in it for the long term, so they'll come to London to buy serious sites for serious money and stay for the long term."Bigger pictureIn a turbulent world, the ability to look at the bigger picture, and stability, are key elements to ensuring security - and Samuels says these are factors that make Brexit an opportunity for Sino-British ties to become stronger than ever."With or without Brexit, Shanghai deals more with London than anywhere else in the world, so pre-or post-Brexit, China is crucial to our trade going forward," Samuels said." The EU and USA are our main trading partners at the moment, but my guess is that in 15 or so years, China might overtake them both."If a country's mood can be interpreted in any way by its movements, then the prospects for London's long history of good relations with China are encouraging.Earlier this month, city development 5 Broadgate was bought by Hong Kong's CK Asset Holdings for 1 billion pounds, meaning it joins such iconic London landmarks as 20 Fenchurch Street (the skyscraper also known as the Walkie Talkie) and 122 Leadenhall Street (another skyscraper, aka the Cheesegrater) in being Chinese-owned.Perhaps even more symbolic than these purchases, was the Chinese government's May announcement that its new London embassy will be on the site of the former Royal Mint, close to the financial heart of the city and the Tower of London, one of the capital's most famous landmarks. The past, it would appear, has a role in shaping the future - even if just now no one is entirely sure what that future looks like.Mark Tucker, group chairman of HSBC Holdings, said: "Establishing a long-term strategic plan for trade and investment relationships with China is vital, in our view, to clarify and secure the UK's place in this world."The UK's relationship with China requires a long-term approach. This long-term strategic approach will require a different mindset. The Belt and Road Initiative lays the foundation for sustainable growth for decades to come," said Tucker.So, while the storm clouds that accompanied the arrival of Brexit may not yet have fully cleared, Samuels says all the signals he is receiving are that its outcome will be an opportunity for both countries, and the long-term forecast is for much improved conditions.Cecily Liu contributed to this article.

                    Johnson 'could be prevented from becoming PM' due to lack of support from MPs
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Two of Britain's leading constitutional experts have said would-be Conservative Party leader Boris Johnson might not become the country's next prime minister even if he wins the vote to replace Theresa May as party leader.Johnson and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt are currently trying to win over the support of party members nationwide before a vote takes place at the end of July to decide who should succeed May and despite a problematic campaign, Johnson remains the favorite.However, several leading Conservative members of Parliament have said they would not be willing to support any possible Johnson administration because of his comments about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, which could potentially create the circumstances of someone who should be taking over a prime minister knowing from the outset that they do not command a majority in Parliament."Whether the new Conservative party leader can command parliamentary confidence is clearly in some doubt given comments from Conservative MPs that they may not be able to support the new government," wrote Robert Hazell and Meg Russell from the University College London Constitution Unit."One possible scenario is that a group of Conservative MPs is so concerned about the winning candidate that they declare their withdrawal of support immediately the result of the leadership contest is known-for example, before the new PM is appointed. This would pose a serious dilemma for the queen and those advising her, because it would not be clear that the new Conservative leader could command confidence."In the three years since the popular vote for the country to leave the European Union in June 2016, the Brexit crisis has claimed the political lives of two prime ministers-David Cameron and Theresa May-and could now scupper a third before it has even begun.With her Brexit proposals having been rejected by Parliament three times and the party more deeply divided than ever over the issue, on May 24 the current prime minister announced that she would step down as Conservative leader, and also national leader.May remains in Downing Street until her successor is chosen, and part of her role as incumbent prime minister is to recommend to the queen who should form the next government. But Johnson's comments about Britain's departure from the EU have only made the situation more complicated.The twice-delayed departure date is currently set for Oct 31, a date which Johnson described as "Do or die. Come what may," only to subsequently backtrack, saying he thought the prospect of a no-deal Brexit was a "million to one chance".Were a Johnson premiership to be ruled out, the alternative is unclear, as the opposition Labour Party does not have a sufficient number of seats to form a government in its own right.What looks more likely is that, should he win, Johnson would become prime minister at the end of July, but face a vote of no confidence almost as soon as Parliament returns from its summer recess. This could be followed by a general election-either called by Johnson to assert his authority, or forced upon him by rebel MPs.

                LONDON - David Cameron, former British Prime Minister finally broke his silence Friday and admitted that the 2016 Brexit referendum result made him depressed.The former Conservative Party leader walked away from 10 Downing Street less than a month after British people voted in June that year to leave the European Union (EU) by a 52-48 margin.More than three years later, nobody knows how the Brexit saga will end, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson remaining convinced that a deal with Brussels will be struck by the Oct 31 deadline when Britain is scheduled to leave the bloc, despite a multitude of hurdles to navigate.In an in-depth interview on Friday with British newspaper The Times, Cameron said he recognized some people will never forgive him for holding a referendum, but he thinks a referendum was "inevitable.""This issue needed to be addressed and I thought a referendum was coming, so better to try to get some reforms we needed and have a referendum," the Eton-educated politician said."But I accept that effort failed. I do understand some people are very angry because they didn't want to leave the EU. Neither did I," he said.Cameron admitted that he thinks every single day about the referendum and the fact that he lost."I worry desperately about what is going to happen next. I think we can get to a situation where we leave but we are friends, neighbors and partners. We can get there, but I would love to fast-forward to that moment because it's painful for the country and it's painful to watch," he added.Cameron, in his interview, also accused Johnson and Cabinet Minister Michael Gove of behaving appallingly during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, saying they had left the truth at home.He also said Johnson had expected Britain to vote to remain in the EU, adding that he hopes Johnson will manage to secure a deal with Brussels.Cameron also said he believes a second referendum might be the way forward.The interview came ahead of the upcoming publication of his memoir "For The Record," which details the Brexit debate before, during and after the referendum.

                    Former PM Cameron slams UK's Johnson in new book

                David Cameron, the former British prime minister, has launched a scathing attack on the United Kingdom's current leader, claiming in extracts from his memoir published in the Sunday Times that Boris Johnson is not committed to the nation exiting the European Union but is merely championing the cause for political expediency.Cameron, who led the UK for six years until 2016, says in For the Record that Johnson did not believe in Brexit during the 2016 referendum campaign but that he became a prominent member of the Leave camp "because it would help his political career".Cameron, who triggered the referendum following pressure from within his Conservative Party, campaigned for the UK to remain a member of the EU.He said, with the benefit of hindsight, he can see that it was easier to rouse voters by promising change than it was by promising the status quo, a bandwagon, he says, that both Johnson and senior minister Michael Gove soon joined."Whichever senior Tory (Conservative Party) politician took the lead on the Brexit side – so loaded with images of patriotism, independence and romance – would become the darling of the party," he wrote. "He (Johnson) didn't want to risk allowing someone else with a high profile – Michael Gove in particular – to win that crown."Cameron said both Johnson and Gove behaved "appallingly" during the campaign ahead of the referendum, which was narrowly won by the side wanting the UK to leave the EU after it made claims that have since been debunked; such as the exit meaning an extra 350 million pounds ($436 million) a week for the National Health Service."The conclusion I am left with is that (Boris Johnson) risked an outcome he didn't believe in because it would help his political career," Cameron wrote.He also criticized the employment minister at the time of the referendum, Priti Patel, who is now home secretary, saying she "used every announcement, interview and speech to hammer the government on immigration, even though she was part of that government".Cameron resigned immediately after the referendum result was revealed and has said little in the following three years.The BBC said neither Johnson, Gove, or Patel chose to respond to Cameron's claims.Johnson, meanwhile,was set to meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Luxembourg on Monday to discuss whether a new and improved Brexit divorce deal can be found.Johnson told the Mail on Sunday newspaper he remains hopeful he can get a better deal before a key EU summit on Oct 17.He insisted there had been movement in the negotiating positions of Germany, France, and the Republic of Ireland."I think that we will get there," he said.The Financial Times said Johnson hopes to secure a deal with the EU at the summit and then get it through Parliament in a 10-day window that will include late-night and weekend sessions.The paper said EU diplomats were also more optimistic. Following talks on Friday in Brussels some said more progress had been made than in previous meetings.

                    Ex-PM Cameron slams Johnson over Brexit
                </p>

                LONDON - Former British prime minister David Cameron launched a blistering attack on the UK's current leader Boris Johnson in extracts of his memoirs published on Sunday. Cameron accuses Johnson of only backing Brexit to further his career. He said Johnson, who took office in July, believed that campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union during the 2016 referendum would make him the "darling" of their Conservative Party. Damningly, he also said that Johnson privately believed there should be a second referendum to confirm the terms of Brexit - something the prime minister has strongly resisted since. In extracts published in The Sunday Times newspaper, Cameron - who as prime minister led the failed "Remain" campaign to stay in the EU - also accused his "Leave" rivals of lying to the public. He wrote that Johnson and one of his top ministers, Michael Gove - a former close friend of Cameron's - "became ambassadors for the expert-trashing, truth-twisting age of populism" during the campaign. Cameron, 52, has largely kept out of the public eye since stepping down in the wake of the historic Brexit vote in 2016. But the publication of his memoirs came at an explosive time, with Britain mired in political turmoil ahead of its scheduled exit from the bloc on Oct 31. Johnson is desperately seeking a divorce deal from Brussels but insists Britain will leave without one if necessary - even after parliament last week prohibited him from carrying out a "no-deal" exit. Cameron revealed he had tried to stop Johnson from joining the Brexit campaign by offering him the post of defense secretary. But Johnson went ahead, and "risked an outcome he didn't believe in because it would help his political career". Cameron claims Johnson believed the "Leave" camp would lose, and, if it won, "there could always be a fresh renegotiation, followed by a second referendum" - something he now rejects. In previous extracts of his long-awaited memoir, For The Record, to be published on Thursday, Cameron said he had no regrets on calling the referendum. But he said he was "desperately" worried about what happens next. His immediate successor as prime minister, Theresa May, negotiated exit terms with Brussels last year, but parliament rejected these three times, forcing her to quit. Johnson took over, vowing to get Brexit done, but he has also struggled as EU leaders warned they will not renegotiate, and with parliament still deeply divided over how to proceed. On Monday, he will meet European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker and Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Luxembourg. The Mail on Sunday newspaper reported that Johnson likened himself to an unruly comic book character, The Incredible Hulk, late on Saturday in an interview where he stressed his determination to take Britain out of the EU on Oct 31. He said he would find a way to circumvent the recent parliament vote ordering him to delay Brexit rather than take Britain out of the EU without transition details to ease the economic shock. "The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets," Johnson was quoted as saying. "Hulk always escaped, no matter how tightly bound in he seemed to be - and that is the case for this country. We will come out on October 31." Agencies (China Daily Global 09/16/2019 page6)
