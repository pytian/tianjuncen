                China, Colombia sign treaty on transfer of sentenced persons
            </a>
            <p>
                On behalf of their respective countries, Fu Zhenghua, China's Minister of Justice, and Carlos Holmes Trujillo García, Colombia's Minister of Foreign Affairs, signed a treaty on the transfer of sentenced persons between the two countries in Beijing on July 31.The treaty's signing was witnessed by the leaders of the two countries.As an important legal document on the judicial assistance between the two countries, the treaty lays the legal foundation for cooperation on the transfer of sentenced persons.Once the treaty is in force the two sides will be in a position to transfer citizens of one side who are serving sentences in the other side back to their home country to continue serving their sentences, so as to help them avoid difficulties in language and culture, habits of living, religion, correspondence and visits, which will be good for their correction and their reintergration into society.The two countries completed negotiations and initialed the treaty in December 2016. They agreed that the treaty would be officially signed during the visit by Colombian President Iván Duque Márquez to China.So far, China has signed bilateral treaties on the transfer of sentenced persons with 16 countries, namely Ukraine, Russia, Spain, Portugal, South Korea, Australia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Thailand, Kirghizia, Iran, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Belgium, and Pakistan and Colombia.The treaty with Colombia remains to be ratified by the legislative bodies of the two countries to become effective.

                Officer: Azerbaijan's businessmen eager to set up firms in China
            </a>
            <p>
                Having faith in China's new Foreign Investment Law, many Azerbaijani businessmen are getting eager and looking forward to establishing firms here as soon as possible, Azerbaijan's trade representative said recently.“No other country in the world encourages the import of foreign products like China does,” said Teymur Nadiroghlu, the Azerbaijan envoy and trade representative to China at the Embassy of Azerbaijan.Azerbaijan joined the Belt & Road Initiative in 2015 and has been among its strongest supporters ever since. During the Second Belt and Road Forum this year, companies from Azerbaijan signed ten agreements worth over $820 million with Chinese enterprises, forging stronger cooperation between the two countries.

                Extradition deals with Sri Lanka, Vietnam ratified
            </a>
            <p>
                China has expanded international legal cooperation by approving new extradition treaties with two countries on Monday to jointly fight transnational crimes.The extradition treaties - with Sri Lanka and Vietnam - were both ratified at the closing meeting of a five-day bimonthly session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the top legislature.Under Chinese law, a treaty takes effect only after it is reviewed and adopted by the country's top legislators.The treaties unveiled on Monday clarify extradition-related content, such as what crimes can trigger extradition and what materials need to be prepared while applying for one.The signing of the treaties is aimed at combating transnational crimes through more effective legal cooperation, said Le Yucheng, vice-minister of foreign affairs, as he explained the two treaties to the top legislature on Thursday.China began working on extradition treaties with Sri Lanka in September 2014 and Vietnam in October 2013. The treaty with Vietnam was reached in 2015, while the one with Sri Lanka was done a year later."We have had more exchanges in recent years with Sri Lanka in several industries, such as in trade, culture and defense, and we have also become closer with Vietnam in personnel and trade sectors in recent years, which made our needs for legal cooperation gradually greater," he said.He added that joining forces with Vietnam to fight transnational crimes has proved successful in some individual cases.In April, another two treaties - one with Barbados regarding judicial assistance on criminal cases and the other with Azerbaijan about transferring prisoners - were also passed by the top legislature.A statement released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in April showed that China has signed 161 judicial treaties with 77 countries, including for extradition, judicial assistance and asset return and sharing. Of those, 131 have taken effect, it said.The judicial treaties also provide a stronger legal basis for China in its anti-corruption fight to pursue fugitives and recover stolen assets around the world, it added.The Communist Party of China Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the country's top anti-graft watchdog, said 5,974 suspected fugitives and 59 of the top 100 wanted fugitives were returned to China from 2014 to June of this year.

                Germany, Netherlands win as Croatia drops points
            </a>
            <p>
                Germany flirted with defeat for a second straight European Championship qualifier before Marcel Halstenberg's first international goal lifted the team to a 2-0 win over Northern Ireland on Monday.Coming off a 4-2 loss to the Netherlands, Germany's recovery was unconvincing, helped by Northern Ireland wasting good chances.The Dutch delivered another impressive attacking display as Memphis Depay marked his 50th game for the Netherlands by scoring one goal and setting up two more in a 4-0 win over Estonia.Belgium made qualifying seem a pushover by beating Scotland 4-0 to keep a perfect winning record, but other favorites faltered. Croatia and Poland both dropped points but remained top of their increasingly competitive groups.Rebuild continuesGermany's still in rebuild mode.More than a year on from its embarrassing group-stage elimination at the World Cup, Joachim Löw's team still struggles to get what should be routine wins.Just as South Korea ran Germany into the ground at the World Cup, so hard pressing from Northern Ireland nearly earned an upset win in Belfast. The host had the better of the first half. Conor Washington had one good shot saved by Manuel Neuer, and later tripped over the ball in front of goal, missing the best chance of the game.Germany emerged from the break refreshed and needed just three minutes before Halstenberg volleyed the ball into the net after Julian Brandt flicked on a cross.Stuart Dallas then went close for Nothern Ireland, who continued to challenge until deep into stoppage time, when Serge Gnabry grabbed Germany's second goal on a counter."They pressed us hard in the first half, but at some point they got tired," Halstenberg said. Asked if Germany was getting back to the level of Europe's best, he was diplomatic. "It's hard to say."Ryan Babel was crucial in the Netherlands' come-from-behind win over Germany on Friday and he tore up another defense on Monday, scoring twice against Estonia.It was the first time Babel scored two in an international game and left the Dutch third in Group B, though they've played one game fewer than everyone else.The Netherlands' home-and-away games against Northern Ireland next month and in November will likely decide the automatic qualifying places in Group C.Croatia checkedWorld Cup finalist Croatia was held by outsider Azerbaijan to 1-1 on Monday, denting its chances of reaching next year's European Championship.Croatia won an early penalty for handball, converted by captain Luka Modric, but Azerbaijan wing back Tamkin Khalilzade cut in from the left in the 72nd minute and beat Dejan Lovren before shooting past goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic.For Azerbaijan, a Euro 2020 host, it was the first point of the qualifying campaign after four straight defeats.Croatia leads Group E by a single point from Slovakia and Hungary with two qualifying spots available. Slovakia beat Hungary 2-1 to move up to second. The other team in the hunt for qualification, Wales, was playing a friendly.Belgium takes it easyScotland's Hampden Park was a walk in the park for Belgium.The visitors were three goals up after just 32 minutes as they kept a perfect record of six wins from six in qualifying. With an 11-point cushion to third-placed Kazakhstan, Belgium could seal qualification in its next game against San Marino.Belgium's goal difference of +18 is the best of any team in the qualifying competition and its gone five competitive games without conceding.Russia kept second place in Group I, but was lackluster in beating Kazakhstan 1-0, needing an 89th-minute headed goal from right back Mario Fernandes.Cyprus beat San Marino 4-0.After a fourth defeat, Scotland was in fifth place. It has never finished a European Championship qualifying campaign below fourth.Poland scoreless againPoland looked a dead cert to qualify until last week, and now that seems a long time ago.After four straight wins, a 2-0 loss to Slovenia on Friday rattled the Poles. A 0-0 draw with Austria on Monday left Poland with its lead cut to two points.Slovenia earned a second big win in four days, beating Israel 3-2 to snatch second place in Group G.The competition's top scorer, Eran Zahavi, netted his ninth goal in qualifying as Israel turned a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 lead, but Roman Bezjak drew Slovenia level before winger Benjamin Verdic scored the winner.Fourth-placed North Macedonia kept long-shot qualifying hopes alive by beating Latvia 2-0.AP

                Azerbaijan gears up to attract Chinese tourists with diverse offerings
            </a>
            <p>
                The Azerbaijan Tourism Board, the national promotional body established under the State Tourism Agency of the Republic of Azerbaijan, is now carrying out its first-ever promotional campaign in China to showcase the country's diverse tourism offerings to prospective Chinese travelers.During an event in Beijing on Friday, the Azerbaijan Tourism Board signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Ctrip and Qyer, which are both popular online travel providers in China, to establish a cooperative partnership in the development of travel products targeting the Chinese market.As an Asian country with a Western outlook, Azerbaijan boasts an exceptional combination of antiquity and novelty. From Baku’s modern Flame Towers to the medieval UNESCO World Heritage Site, the wide-ranging tourism resources in Azerbaijan can satisfy even the most discerning travelers."China has a huge potential for outbound tourism. In 2018, we only had 13,000 visitors from China, but by the end of August this year, we've already received 17,000 Chinese tourists, so the trend is on the rise", said Florian Sengstschmid, CEO of the Azerbaijan Tourism Board, in an interview with China Daily Website.In view of the significance of China as a vital international market, specific measures are rolled out to attract more Chinese visitors. Azerbaijan recently implemented a simplified electronic visa procedure, and besides applying for visas online, Chinese tourists also can obtain visas upon arrival.Speaking of the role tourism plays in facilitating people-to-people exchanges between cultures, Sengstschmid contends that tourism is the most important tool in promoting mutual understandings between people."We have political borders, but when you look at natural wonders, you will realize that there is only one planet, that is what connect us and tourism can contribute a lot to peaceful exchanges between countries", he said.The promotional campaign conducted by the Azerbaijan Tourism Board began Monday and ends Saturday in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing.
