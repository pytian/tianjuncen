                    33 die in fire set at Kyoto animation studio

                TOKYO－A Japanese fire official says the death toll from the Kyoto Animation studio fire is now 33 and nobody else is believed to be still missing.Kyoto fire department official Kazuhiro Hayashi says 36 others have been injured, 10 of them critically.Hayashi says firefighters found the largest number of victims on the top floor of the three-story building, including some who had collapsed on the stairs leading to the roof. Two of the dead were found on the first floor, 11 on the second and 20 on the third floor.Japanese media reports said the suspect may have set the fire at the front door, forcing people to try to find other exits and slowing their escape.The outcome makes the case the deadliest fire since a 2001 fire that killed 44 in Tokyo's Kabukicho entertainment district.The suspect was injured and is in a hospital.Kyoto police said the suspect was injured and taken to a hospital. They are investigating the man, 41, who is not a company employee, on suspicion of arson, police said.Most were workers at Kyoto Animation, known for megahit stories featuring high school girls, with places featured in the stories even becoming "pilgrimage sites" for fans.Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took to Twitter to express his horror. "It's so dreadful that I'm lost for words," he wrote. "I pray for those who passed away."The fire department said it began receiving calls about the fire around 10:35 am. The blaze started in the three-story building in Japan's ancient capital after the suspect sprayed an unidentified liquid accelerant, Kyoto prefectural police and fire officials said.Kyoto Animation's president, Hideaki Hatta, told reporters "there have been emails with death threats", without giving further details. He said the gutted building was "the core of the company", which has produced several well-known television anime series including The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and K-ON!In China, Kyoto Animation's Doraemon and Crayon Shin-chan series are well known."It's unbearable that those who have led Japan's animation industry were hurt and lost their lives," Hatta said.A witness who saw the suspect being approached by police told Japanese networks that the man admitted spreading gasoline and setting a fire with a lighter. She told NHK public television that the man had burns on his arms and legs and that he was angrily complaining that something of his had been "stolen", possibly by the company. NHK footage also showed sharp knives police had found at the scene, though it was not clear if they belonged to the suspect.Survivors said the attacker was not their colleague and that he was screaming "(You) die!" when he dumped the liquid and started the fire, according to Japanese media reports. They said some survivors were splashed with the liquid.Kyoto Animation, better known as KyoAni, was founded in 1981 as an animation and comic book production studio, and its hits include Lucky Star. The company does not have a major presence outside Japan, though it was hired for secondary animation work on a 1998 Pokemon feature and a Winnie the Pooh video seen abroad.Fire department officials said more than 70 people were in the building at the time of the fire and many of them ran outside.An online fundraiser organized by an anime licensing firm in the United States had raised over $220,000 by Thursday night.Wang Xu in Tokyo contributed to this story.AP - China Daily

                    Anime studio hit by arson is known for skill, fan base
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                TOKYO - It may not be as famous as Japanese anime legend Studio Ghibli, but Kyoto Animation has many core fans and is known as a team of skilled animators that provides top-quality work for others and can produce its own hits, such as Lucky Star, K-On! and the Haruhi Suzumiya series. The company, which was hit by a suspected arson attack on Thursday that killed 33 people and injured 36 others, also has a unique founding history. It was started in 1981 by a former animator who recruited housewives from her neighborhood in Uji, a city south of Kyoto, where she married and moved from Tokyo, the center of the animation industry. Yoko Hatta previously had worked at Mushi Production, a studio for the works of anime legend Osamu Tezuka, who created Astro Boy and Kimba the White Lion. The company, better known as KyoAni, doesn't have a major presence in Japan but has won gradual recognition while providing secondary animation work for major productions. Their work included a 1998 Pokemon feature that appeared in US theaters and a Winnie the Pooh video. The attack, in which a man shouting "You die!" poured a flammable liquid near the entrance and set it ablaze, shocked animation fans across in and outside Japan. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe mourned for the victims as he said on social media that he was speechless at the magnitude of the damage. Anim�� fans expressed anger, prayed and mourned for the victims on social media. A crowdfunding site was set up to help the company rebuild. "It's a shock. It's like so impossible. I never heard of this kind of stuff in the past 25 years," said Levin Jean, a San Francisco anime vendor at Comic-Con in San Diego. "I have been in this business for 24 years and this is the first time I've seen this happen to the animation industry." Dale Scoville, an anime fan from Claremont, California, said anime illustrators and story panelists "have a lot of heart in all the stories that they bring to life". "It's just really hard to hear about people that want to help other people and that happening to them," he said. "It's really sad." While providing work for top artists, the company has been able to make and feature its own stories in Japanese TV anime and comic series. Some of its megahits include Lucky Star in 2008, K-On! in 2011 and Haruhi Suzumiya in 2009. The company was preparing for a planned release of a new feature animation film Violet Evergarden, a story of a woman who professionally writes letters for clients. Places featured in the hit animation stories have become pilgrimage destinations for anime fans. Among them is Washinoniya Jinja, a shrine in Saitama prefecture just north of Tokyo, a scene in the TV animation series Lucky Star, or Raki Suta, based on comics by Kagami Yoshimizu. Years after the TV animation ended, the area still attracts fans of Raki Suta girls, with goods featuring the characters sold at its neighborhood stores, and a portable shrine decorated with the anime characters appearing at an annual festival in September. Ryusuke Hikawa, a pop culture expert at Meiji University, said Kyoto Animation became a brand name for "a general company that can provide high-quality presentation and animation", while demonstrating its capability even away from Tokyo. "Kyoto Animation demonstrated that a top brand can come from outside the capital," Hikawa said in an interview with NHK television. "It was a major breakthrough, and was a revolutionary change to the Japanese animation industry." The company's 160 employees work at studios in Uji and Kyoto and an office in Tokyo. The company also trains aspiring animators, produces and sells novelty goods featuring its characters. A store selling such items is near the studio damaged by Thursday's fire.

                    Boss of torched Japan studio mourns bright, young staff

                KYOTO, Japan - Many victims of an arson attack on a Japanese animation studio were young with bright futures, some joining only in April, the shaken company president said on Saturday, as the death toll climbed to 34.Thursday's attack on Kyoto Animation, well known for its television series and movies, was Japan's worst mass killing in two decades.Many of the victims of the attack, in the ancient capital of Kyoto, were young women, company president Hideaki Hatta said."Some of them joined us just in April. And on the eighth of July, I gave them a small, but their first, bonus," he said."People who had a promising future lost their lives. I don't know what to say. Rather than feeling anger, I just don't have words," Hatta said.Fifteen of the victims were in their 20s and 11 were in their 30s, public broadcaster NHK said. Six were in their 40s and one was at least 60. The age of the latest victim, a man who died in hospital, was not known. The names of the victims have not been disclosed.The studio had about 160 employees with an average age of 33.Police have confirmed the identity of the suspect as Shinji Aoba, but have declined to comment further.Aoba lives in a modest, two-floor apartment building 500 km (310 miles) from Kyoto in a rural suburb just outside Omiya, a commuter hub north of Tokyo.A 27-year-old neighbour said Aoba had once grabbed him and yelled at him over a noise dispute."He started yelling at me to my face to shut up. He grabbed me by the collar and started pulling my hair. It was terrifying," the neighbour, who declined to be identified, said.PLAGIARISM CLAIM Aoba had been convicted of robbery in the past and is suspected of carrying out the arson attack because he believed his novel had been plagiarized, Japanese media have said.But Hatta, the company president, said he had no idea about any plagiarism claim, adding he had not seen any correspondence from the suspect.People living near the studio said they saw a man fitting Aoba's description in a nearby park the day before the attack.Police suspect he may have spent a day or more in the area to prepare.Resident Rie Bannai said her nephew saw the man sleeping on a bench in the park.Police have not formally arrested Aoba, as he is being treated for heavy burns, NHK said, but have taken the unusual step of releasing his name.Rui Yamaguchi, who works in a factory nearby, said he saw the suspect when he was detained."He looked like a mannequin with no hair and blackened. One of his pants legs had gone around his calf. It looked like it had burnt off," he said.'BEAUTIFUL AND WARM'Near the blackened studio building, where the smell of burning timber lingered over the neighbourhood, animation fans gathered to add to a growing pile of flowers, drinks and other offerings.Bing Xie, 25, a Chinese student at Kyoto University, said she could not forgive the arsonist."The criminal who does this seems to have been mentally disturbed, but I can’t forgive him. The young people at Kyoto Animation were beautiful and warm and it is hard to accept they are gone."Police guarded the site as investigators, some on the roof near where many died in a connecting stairwell, examined the blackened building.Hatta said the building needed to be torn down because it was so badly damaged.Tributes to the victims lit up social media, with world leaders and Apple Inc's chief executive offering condolences. The hashtag #PrayforKyoAni, as the studio is known among fans, has become popular.Kyoto Animation produces popular "anime" series such as the "Sound! Euphonium". It is also known for "Violet Evergarden", which has been shown on Netflix.Reuters

                The arson attack on Kyoto Animation was the worst mass killing for two decades in Japan, a country with one of the world's lowest crime rates. Fifteen of those who died were in their 20s, and 11 were in their 30s, public broadcaster NHK said. Six were in their 40s and one was at least 60. The age of the latest victim, a man who died in hospital, is not known, and the names of the dead have not yet been disclosed. The attack was all the more poignant because of the young age of many of the victims in a nation with one of the oldest populations in the world.
