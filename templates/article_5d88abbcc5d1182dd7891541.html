                BANGKOK - China's renowned Terracotta Warriors have arrived in Thailand for the first time for a three-month exhibition at Bangkok's National Museum. After the opening ceremony on Sunday afternoon for the exhibition Qin Shi Huang, The First Emperor of China and Terracotta Warriors, many Thais flowed into the Siwamokkhaphiman Throne Hall to take a glimpse of the over 2,000-year old funerary sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang. Held jointly by Thailand's Fine Arts Department of the Ministry of Culture and China's Shaanxi Provincial Administration of Cultural Heritage, the exhibition displays 86 artifacts from 14 leading museums around Shaanxi province, said Qian Jikui, deputy director of the Shaanxi Provincial Administration of Cultural Heritage, during the opening ceremony. "We are trying to show people the history and culture of the Qin Empire, from its beginning to its impact on the later history of China," Qian said. Wissanu Krea-ngam, deputy prime minister of Thailand, told the opening ceremony that it is a very rare chance in Bangkok to see the Terracotta Warriors and other Chinese artifacts of great value. He encouraged Thais to take the chance to learn more about China's history and culture. China has a long history and Qin Shi Huang is a prominent figure, the deputy prime minister said. "We call China 'Chin' in Thai and it is assumed to derive from Qin, the name of Qin Shi Huang's empire, which reveals how influential Qin was." He also hailed the Thailand-China exchanges and friendship that go back hundreds of years and said the exhibition came at a great year marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the 44th anniversary of the establishment of Thailand-China diplomatic relations. The Chinese Ambassador to Thailand, Lyu Jian, said during the opening ceremony that the exhibition showed that the China-Thailand friendship had reached a new height. The Terracotta Army, discovered in 1974, reveals the sophistication of ancient Chinese civilization and its conservation demonstrates the development of Chinese technology, the Chinese ambassador noted, adding that the exhibition would further promote mutual understanding between the Chinese and Thai peoples and their friendship. Thai Minister of Culture Itthiphol Kunplome said that the exhibition proves how close Thailand-China relations are and that it would provide a good opportunity for Thais to learn about history while also attracting tourists. Itthiphol said that 200,000 visitors are expected during the three-month exhibition, which will close on Dec 15 this year. Xinhua (China Daily Global 09/17/2019 page6)
