                US FedEx pilot detained at Guangzhou airport
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                The Foreign Ministry confirmed on Friday that a United States pilot for FedEx Corp was detained in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, on Sept 12 due to items found in his checked luggage.The pilot was held at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport after customs inspectors allegedly found 681 air gun pellets in his checked-in baggage as he was preparing to board a flight for Hong Kong, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular news briefing.He was later released from custody and ordered to remain in the country pending an investigation, Geng said.The FedEx cargo plane pilot arrived in Guangzhou on Sept 11, Geng added.Chinese authorities informed the US consul general in Guangzhou one day after he was detained, and the case is under further investigation, he said.AFP quoted a FedEx spokeswoman as saying the pilot's name is Todd Hohn, a former US Air Force pilot.The incident was not the first time that FedEx, which began operating in China more than three decades ago, has been accused of illegal activities in recent months.Earlier this month, restricted knives were discovered in FedEx parcels being transported to Hong Kong.In August, police in Fuzhou, Fujian province, said they seized a handgun found in a FedEx parcel being shipped to a company in the province.In early June, the company was placed under investigation after Shenzhen-based Huawei Technologies Co said the US company had diverted two parcels sent from Japan and addressed to Huawei in China to the US.

                    Huawei eyeing cutting edge in computing
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Huawei Technologies Co underlined its long-term commitment to computing on Wednesday, by unveiling the world's fastest artificial intelligence training cluster and its $1.5 billion investment plan to support third-party software and hardware developers.The move came as Huawei sees computing as a technology of the utmost importance to building a fully connected, intelligent world and it eyes an expanded presence in the computing market which research company Gartner Inc forecast will be worth more than $2 trillion by 2023."We believe that connectivity and computing will be woven into the fabric of everything and are worth our continuous investment," said Hu Houkun, rotating chairman of Huawei.According to Hu, Huawei already has made significant strides in connectivity for the past 30 years, from 2G all the way up to 5G.In terms of computing, Huawei will continue investing with a strategy that focuses on four key areas. "We will push the boundaries of architecture, invest in processors for all scenarios, keep clear business boundaries, and build an open ecosystem," Hu added.The senior executive highlighted that the evolution of computing has come to a inflection point, with AI-enabled computing becoming mainstream and offering tons of emerging opportunities for Huawei.On Wednesday, the company unveiled what it said is the world's fastest AI training cluster, Atlas 900, which will help make AI more readily available for different fields of scientific research and business innovation.Atlas 900 combines the power of thousands of Ascend processors, and Huawei showcased how fast Atlas 900 is with an example of using it in astronomy.Usually, if an astronomer wanted to find a celestial body with specific features in a sky map which contains more than 200,000 stars, it would take 169 days of full-time work.But Atlas 900 is able to scan through mountains of data to locate and identify a specific type of star in only 10 seconds, Huawei said.As part of its broader push to build a vibrant ecosystem, Huawei also announced that it will invest $1.5 billion to help cultivate five million more third-party software and hardware developers on its computing platform over the next five years, up from the current number of 1.3 million.The money will be used to help developers develop the next generation of intelligent applications and solutions. Half of the plan includes developers who use Huawei's Kunpeng server chips. Kunpeng is based on the ARM architecture, a chip design developed by the British company Arm Holdings and commonly used in smartphones and tablets.A string of companies had tried to develop server chips based on ARM, but most of them failed.Huawei said many experts are worried that ARM-based server chips can not deliver computing performance strong enough for internet data centers. But it has leveraged its own technological prowess to solve the problem, which can be seen in the increasing use of its Kunpeng products by many tech companies.Charlie Dai, principal analyst at Forrester, a business strategy and economic consultancy, said Huawei's computing strategy demonstrates the importance of leveraging holistic hardware and software spectrum and fully unleashing the power of AI in the cloud era.ARM-based chips have unique value for computing. Huawei's investment in ARM-based servers not only supports broader business scenarios. It also effectively improves business agility in the increasingly dynamic macroeconomic environments, Dai added.

                A number of technological cooperation activities will be held at the 16th China-ASEAN Expo opening on Sept 21, helping transfer China-developed technologies to neighboring countries in Southeast Asia. One such event is the seventh Forum on China-ASEAN Technology Transfer and Collaborative Innovation. This year's forum will highlight technological exchanges between China and ASEAN members, as well as other countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative. There will be an advanced technologies exhibition, a symposium for young scientists, an international forum for sustainable development and collaborative innovation as well as events for technology transfer.  Business representatives sign agreements during the first China-ASEAN AI summit. Provided to China DailyFor technology transfer, China's research institutions and tech companies will sit together with companies from seven ASEAN countries including Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Indonesia, to help the latter access cutting-edge technologies developed in China. Singapore, a technological powerhouse in Southeast Asia, will also hold a promotional event for its innovative technologies. The emphasis on technological collaboration is a result of cooperation in this field between China and ASEAN members in previous years. During the 14th China-ASEAN Summit held in Indonesia in 2012, science and technology administrations from China and 10 ASEAN members launched the China-ASEAN Science and Technology Partnership Plan, to foster deeper collaboration. For the implementation of the plan, the China-ASEAN Technology Transfer Center was established in Nanning in 2013. It is operated by the Guangxi Science and Technology Department. Guangxi has played an important role in the technological cooperation between China and ASEAN members. Since 2013, the China-ASEAN Technology Transfer Center has organized nearly 80 matchmaking events for technology transfer, with 516 agreements signed between 3,500 Chinese and overseas companies. The cooperation in the digital sectors is a key part of the partnership. The collaboration is gaining steady growth with the help of the China-ASEAN Information Harbor, a Guangxi-initiated program to help the digital interconnectivity and information sharing between China and ASEAN countries. Earlier this month, the information harbor organized the China-ASEAN Artificial Intelligence Summit, attracting the participation of more than 100 companies, according to the China-ASEAN Information Harbor Corp, which organized the event. The organizer said renowned Chinese companies including China Mobile, Ali Cloud and Huawei used the summit as an opportunity to promote its operations to Southeast Asian countries.
