                Iranian FM Zarif makes surprise visit to Biarritz
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stole the limelight on Sunday in France's seaside town of Biarritz, where G7 leaders were meeting for their 45th summit.Zarif made a surprise visit there and held talks with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and later French President Emmanuel Macron, who had been trying to mediate between Iran and the United States amid growing tensions.Zarif's plane departed Biarritz on Sunday evening. He posted on Twitter two photos of his meetings with both Macron and Le Drian. "Iran's active diplomacy in pursuit of constructive engagement continues," he wrote in the tweet.Zarif said he met Macron on the sideline of the G7 Summit after extensive talks with Le Drian. "Road ahead is difficult. But worth trying," he said.French officials have described the meetings as "positive", according to France24.US President Donald Trump last year pulled his country out of the Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The deal was reached in 2015 by Iran, China, Russia, France, UK, Germany and the US and ratified by the United Nations Security Council. The US has also reimposed sanctions on Iran and threatened to punish other nations which violated the unilateral US sanctions.The other parties of the agreement have opposed the US withdrawal and its renewed pressure campaign against Iran.France, the UK and Germany have launched a special purpose vehicle, known as Instex, to help European companies bypass US sanctions in their normal trade with Iran. But the mechanism still has to show its effectiveness given the US dominance in global financial system.Macron had already met Zarif in Paris on Friday. He also had held phone talks with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.Agence France-Presse reported that Macron has urged Trump to offer some kind of relief to Iran, such as lifting sanctions on oil sales to China and India in order to keep Iran in full compliance with the nuclear deal.French officials said Macron decided to make the "surprise" invite after hosting a dinner of G7 leaders on Saturday night, when G7 leaders agreed that Macron should hold talks and pass on messages to Iran. But Trump later denied that. Macron later noted that there was no formal mandate from the G7 leaders for the invitation."Yesterday, we had a discussion from which two priorities emerged. First of all, no member of the G7 wants Iran to ever get a nuclear weapon. Second, all members of the G7 are deeply committed to stability and peace in the region and therefore want to avoid actions that could compromise that," Macron said on Sunday."We will each continue to take initiatives to reach our two goals. That's what's important. The outcome of yesterday's discussions is that we will continue to all act, each in their own way."German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday evening also said that any attempts to ease tensions with Iran over the nuclear deal were worthwhile.In an interview with Euronews last week, Zarif said the crisis over the nuclear deal raises questions over Europe's independence from the US which is "imposing its will" on its allies. "We discussed with Macron how the US could come back, and how Europe and the international community can live up to their commitment, independent of the US," he said.Zarif is paying an official visit to China until Tuesday at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

                DAVOS, Switzerland - Talks over the future of Syria and Iran will occur on the sidelines of the annual gathering for political and financial elites in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, the founder of the World Economic Forum said Monday.Klaus Schwab said in an interview with the Associated Press that there will be crossover between the forum's 2,500 participants and the officials from the US, Russia and close to 40 other countries that are attending the start of the Syria peace conference several hours away in Montreux, Switzerland.Syria's main, Western-backed opposition group agreed Monday to attend this week's peace conference only after threatening to sit it out because of a last-minute UN invitation for Iran to join in.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was forced to withdraw the invitation Monday because the Syrian National Coalition had objected to Iran's participation because it keeps "troops and militias" in Syria and failed to endorse a 2012 UN -brokered roadmap to establish a transitional government.But Iran will still be able to interact at Davos with many of the key players trying to end Syria's devastating civil war."Here you have some of the true leaders with the influence on the region, so I am sure the results will have an impact on our own discussions," said Schwab, a German-born economist and engineer who founded the Davos forum in 1971. Since then, the five-day gathering, which attracts heads of state, royalty and top executives, has grown into a massive networking event - what some consider speed-dating for the political and corporate elites.China at Daovs: Chinese FM to join Syria peace talksChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will leave Beijing on Wednesday for the Syria peace conference in Geneva and the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos of Switzerland.Davos gears up for economic forumZhang Xiaoqiang, vice-chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission of China, Zhu Min, deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Liu Mingkang, former chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, Wang Weiguang, former chairman of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and Jiang Jianqing, former chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China will attend.Other highlights to be:China set to be focus of Davos 2014The theme for this year - "The Reshaping of the World: Consequences for Society, Politics and Business" - exactly sets out the three dimensions of the world's current circumstances, and it is in this context that the focus will be on China.Plenty of potential for crises The high level of public debt in the United States, the eurozone and Japan top the list of risks that will have the biggest impact this year and severely affect the stability of the global economy.

                    Iran, US agree final nuclear deal may be unreachable
                </p>

                Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the man who has the final say on all matters of state in the Islamic Republic, declared again on Monday that talks between Tehran and six world powers "will not lead anywhere."Hours later a senior US administration official also played down expectations, telling reporters in the Austrian capital that it will be a "complicated, difficult and lengthy process" and "probably as likely that we won't get an agreement as it is that we will."Their remarks came on the eve of the first round of high-level negotiations since an interim deal was struck on November 24 under which Tehran curbed some nuclear activities for six months in return for limited sanctions relief to allow time for a long-term agreement to be hammered out.Despite his scepticism about the chances for a lasting deal with the West, Khamenei made clear Tehran was committed to continuing the negotiations between Iran and Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States."What our officials started will continue. We will not renege. I have no opposition," he told a crowd in the northern city of Tabriz on Monday to chants of "Death to America".If successful, the negotiations could help put an end to years of hostility between Iran and the West, ease the danger of a new war in the Middle East, and open up vast new possibilities for Western businesses.During a decade of on-and-off negotiations with world powers, Iran has rejected allegations by Western countries that it is seeking a nuclear weapons capability. It says its nuclear work is for power generation and medical purposes.Tehran has defied UN Security Council demands that it suspend uranium enrichment and other sensitive activities, leading to a crippling web of US, EU and UN sanctions that has severely damaged the oil-producing nation's economy.Khamenei's decision to pursue negotiations with the six powers in spite of the scepticism he shares with his hard-line supporters, diplomats and analysts say, is a result of Iran's worsening economic conditions.

                A view of the meeting room before the start of a conference in Vienna February 18, 2014. [Photo/Agencies]Senior US and Iranian officials met separately for 80 minutes on the sidelines of the negotiations in Vienna.Details were not given, but such bilateral talks were inconceivable before the 2013 election of Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate, as president of Iran. US-Iranian dialogue is seen as crucial to any breakthrough nuclear agreement."The conversation was productive and focused mainly on how the comprehensive talks will proceed from here," a senior US State Department official said on condition of anonymity after Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman's meeting with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi.Sherman headed the US delegation, while Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and Araqchi led Tehran's negotiating team at the table with Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States.After Sherman's meeting with Araqchi, the Iranians met on Tuesday evening with all six powers to continue talks on how to approach future negotiations, diplomats said. The discussions will resume on Wednesday roughly at 10:30 am and could run into Thursday."Much of the first day was focused on discussions about process for how the comprehensive talks will proceed," a senior US official said. "We made clear that every issue is on the table as part of the comprehensive negotiations, and now it's time to dig into the details and get to work."In the evening session between Iran and the six "substantive issues began to be discussed", the US official added.A European diplomat said no decisions had been taken yet on how the talks will proceed in the future - the six powers led by the EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton want to get a deal done within six months."We had quite detailed discussions, productive and in a positive atmosphere," the diplomat said. "But this is day one and we have at least another day."Related readingsIran, US agree final nuclear deal may be unreachable

                LAUSANNE, Switzerland - A joint statement was being finalized on Thursday at talks between Iran and world powers over Tehran's nuclear program, but officials stopped short of suggesting that a deal had been reached.A US official and a Western diplomat said the joint statement was being drafted to be issued by Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and EU foreign police chief Federica Mogherini.An Iranian official also confirmed Zarif and Mogherini would issue a joint statement, suggesting it might fall short of an announcement of a deal."This is only a statement," the Iranian official said.Mogherini has acted as a coordinator for the six powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - negotiating with Tehran to prevent it from acquiring the means to develop a nuclear bomb.The diplomat said a full session between representatives of six powers and Iran was about to start at the talks in Lausanne, Switzerland.Neither official would confirm that a deal had been reached at the marathon talks, which aim to reach a preliminary political agreement before a final deal is reached by June 30.The Swiss talks were due to end by Tuesday but have been extended for two days, with sides saying they were making progress but having trouble agreeing on details.

                    Teheran rules out talks with Washington

                Iranian FM urges actions from other signatories to save 2015 nuclear dealIran has rejected the likelihood of any negotiations with the United States, amid escalating tensions in the Gulf and sanction pressures."There is no possibility of negotiations," Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Thursday when asked by reporters whether Iran would be open for a dialogue with the United States to ease tensions in the Gulf, according to Press TV.Zarif said Iran was showing "maximum restraint" despite Washington sending extra military forces to the Gulf earlier this month and unilaterally withdrawing from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal last May.He said the US government is a "bully" that tries to make other countries do what it likes, adding that the US sanctions over Iran is "economic terrorism, pure and simple".He said his country was committed to an international nuclear deal but the escalating US sanctions were "unacceptable".On Friday, he urged the remaining signatories to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal to take concrete action to save the deal.However, both Teheran and Washington have ruled out the possibilities of going to war, and said they are not interested in escalating regional tensions.In an interview on National Public Radio in the US, Majid Takht-e Ravanchi, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, said the country is not interested in escalating region-al tensions, but has the "right to defend ourselves".He Wenping, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the time for Iran and the US to go back to negotiations has not arrived yet, and frictions between them are likely to continue."The US will keep putting maximum pressure on Iran," she said."Its goal is to draw Iran back to the negotiation table and seek a new deal that could meet the US expectations. Going by past experiences, Iran will not easily compromise this time either."Tensions between Teheran and Washington escalated dramatically on May 5, when US National Security Adviser John Bolton announced that the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a bomber task force would be rushed from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf region.The US said the deployment was in response to "a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings" related to Iran, but gave no further details.Teheran warned on May 8 it would resume production of uranium enriched to a higher level, which would mean enrichment beyond the permissible 3.67 percent under the 2015 nuclear deal.Trump withdrew the US from the deal in May last year. Since then, the US has intensified its sanctions against Iran.There have been allegations of Saudi oil tankers being targeted off the coast of the United Arab Emirates and a drone attack on a Saudi oil pipeline claimed by Yemen's Iranian-backed rebels in the past week.

                    US extends Iran waivers but hits FM Zarif
                </p>

                The United States on Wednesday extended waivers allowing foreign firms to work at Iranian nuclear facilities without US penalties while hitting Iran's foreign minister with sanctions. A series of contradictory actions will not change the tense situation between the two sides, an expert said.The US State Department said in a notice sent to Congress that it had extended for 90 days waivers that permit European, Russian and Chinese companies to conduct work at several Iranian civil nuclear sites."The action today will help preserve oversight of Iran's civil nuclear program, reduce proliferation risks, constrain Iran's ability to shorten its 'breakout time' to a nuclear weapon, and prevent the regime from reconstituting sites," US State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said.The waivers, which were due to expire on Thursday, had been the subject of heated internal debate with Iran hawks opposed to their extension but others arguing that more time was needed to allow companies to wind down their operations, according to The Associated Press.The exemptions are also the last remaining elements that the US still recognizes from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal from which the US President Donald Trump withdrew last year.White House National Security Adviser John Bolton described them as "a short 90-day extension" while the US will "watch those nuclear activities very, very closely".Paradoxically, almost at the same time, the US announced new sanctions against Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.The sanctions freeze any of Zarif's assets in the US or that are controlled by US entities, the government announced, saying it also will curtail his international travel, according to Agence France-Presse."The United States is sending a clear message to the Iranian regime that its recent behavior is completely unacceptable," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.Zarif responded through his social media account that the reason for designating him is that he is Iran's "primary spokesperson around the world" and reiterated that the move "has no effect" on him or his family as they "have no property or interests outside of Iran".Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Thursday slammed US financial sanctions on Zarif."They have started doing childish things," Rouhani said in a speech."Every day they claim: 'We want to negotiate with Iran, without any preconditions' and then they put sanctions on the country's foreign minister."Tao Wenzhao, a Chinese senior researcher on US studies, said the US is playing a two-track strategy of trick-and-treat with Iran.He said the extension could to some extent help Iran alleviate domestic economic problems, and is also a step Washington has to take when considering the benefits of its alliances."If the US completely bans Iran's oil trade, the outcome will not only harm Iran but also US allies as they are main buyers of Iran's oil or need to ship oil through the Strait of Hormuz."Meanwhile, the sanctions, although they have no substantial effect, is a posture Trump gives to show his determination of pressing Iran, Tao said."Zarif has no assets in the US while the sanctions can't inhibit his travels to New York for official United Nations business next month," he said. "But whether useful or not, the move indicates that Washington is still pressing Teheran."
