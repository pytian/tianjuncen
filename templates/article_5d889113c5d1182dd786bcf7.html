                CAIRO - The recently announced intention of US President Donald Trump to designate the Muslim Brotherhood group as a terrorist organization has raised debate among key players in Middle East.About three weeks after the visit of Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi to Washington and his talks with Trump, the White House said last week that the US president is working to label the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization.In response, the 90-year-old Islamist group said in a statement on its website that it will stick to its "moderate and peaceful" approach despite Trump's plan.The US plan is welcomed by Egypt and its allies in the Gulf region, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which largely supported the Egyptian army's ouster of former Brotherhood-oriented president Mohamed Morsi in July 2013.The Egyptian authorities blacklisted the group a few months after the army removed Morsi in response to mass protests against his one-year controversial rule, launching a massive security crackdown on the group's loyalists.Since then, Egypt has been facing a wave of terrorist activities that killed hundreds of policemen, soldiers and civilians, while the Egyptian forces killed hundreds of terrorists and arrested thousands of suspects in the country's anti-terror war declared by Sisi.Meanwhile, Cairo's ties with Washington improved under Trump after a rift during the time of former US president Barack Obama whose government rejected Morsi's popularly-backed military removal."The anticipated move is a big change in the US policy toward groups that the former US government dealt with as political entities," said Samir Ragheb, head of the Cairo-based Arab Foundation for Development and Strategic Studies, or AFDSS.The Egyptian expert referred to a state of "closer understanding" between the United States and Arab allies like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, which led to a change in the US position in their favor.Most terror activities in Egypt over the past few years have been claimed by a Sinai-based group loyal to the Islamic State regional militant group.The Egyptian leadership considers the Brotherhood the source of all evil and terror while the group denies it."If the US decision is implemented, it will be considered a big victory for the Egyptian diplomacy," the AFDSS chief said.It took Egypt a lot of diplomatic efforts to dissuade the US Democrats who used to see the Brotherhood as part of the solution in fighting terrorism, Ragheb added.Meanwhile, regional players Iran and Turkey rejected the US plan to classify the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization, arguing that Trump's move would undermine the region's stability and promote extremism.Ties between Egypt and Iran have been cut for decades, since Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.Egypt is also at odds with Turkey and Qatar for hosting and sheltering fleeing Muslim Brotherhood members, accusing the two countries of supporting terrorism and interfering in the Egyptian domestic affairs.The charges have been dismissed by both countries.Xinhua

                CAIRO -- The Egyptian parliament approved on Sunday a three-month extension of an already-imposed state of emergency due to security challenges facing the Arab country, official MENA news agency reported.The parliament approved a presidential decree to extend the emergency state by another three months, starting from Jan 15, according to MENA.Under the decree, military and police personnel should take the necessary measures to face terrorism and maintain security across the country.Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi first imposed a three-month nationwide state of emergency in April 2017, following a twin bombing at two churches in northern provinces of Gharbiya and Alexandria that killed at least 47 and wounded over 120 others.Terrorism prevailed in Egypt since the military ousted former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July 2013 in response to mass protests against his 12-month reign and his currently outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group.Terror attacks killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers in restive North Sinai province northeastern Cairo before they gradually extended to other provinces, where dozens of civilians, mainly Christians, were killed.Most of the attacks were claimed by Sinai State group, which is based in Egypt's North Sinai province.

            <p class="style-content">
                CAIRO - The Egyptian army killed two major terrorist leaders in an airstrike in the country's North Sinai province, a statement by the army said Sunday.Egyptian armed forces spokesman Tamer al-Refaie said the two men were killed in the airstrike that targeted a terrorist hideout.According to the statement, the strike came upon confirmed intelligence of terrorist elements gathering in the hideout.The spokesman did not mention the names of the terrorists.Last week, Egyptian authorities announced the killing of 64 terrorists during anti-terror campaigns across the country.Terrorism started to grow in Egypt following the military ouster of former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in July 2013 in response to mass protests against his one-year rule and his currently banned Muslim Brotherhood.Terror attacks gradually expanded from North Sinai to other provinces, including the capital Cairo, and started to target the Coptic minority via church bombings and shootings.

                CAIRO－Standing before a rapt crowd, Ahmed Adel oozes charm with his passionate performance of an Egyptian classic, evoking a romantic nostalgia for Arabic songs of the past.After a melodious introduction on the oud, the famed oriental lute, Adel croons his way through a "mawal", a traditional melody boasting long vowels."Ya leil" ("O night"), he sings, with the dreamy languor of the original performer, Egyptian legend Mohamed Abdel Wahab.With cheers of "Allah!", the mesmerized audience shows its appreciation."Modern songs are a hit for a day or two, a month, or maybe a year, but then we do not hear about them any more."But Abdel Wahab and (Egyptian diva) Umm Kulthum have lasted until today," said Adel, before his performance in the tiny Mamlukera hall at the Arab Music Institute.Egypt, a cultural powerhouse in the Arab world, has long enjoyed a booming music industry.In the past, the rise of revered singers, such as Umm Kulthum, Abdel Wahab and another Egyptian, Abdel Halim Hafiz, saw Cairo billed as the Hollywood of Arab song, attracting talent from across the region.But in the 1990s, Gulf countries vying for cultural dominance emerged as rivals to Egypt's music industry, and Rotana, the Arab world's largest record label, was formed in 1987.Yet the Egyptian metropolis remains alive with the sound of music.Every day, in local cafes and homes the melancholic songs of Syrian-born star Asmahan and the tender rhythmic melodies of Egyptian singer Najat al-Saghira mix with animated conversations, modern pop music and Islamic chants.Luring the youngTorn between stage fright and joy, Adel performs regularly at the Arab Music Institute paying tribute to his music idols.During events such as the "Khulthumiat" (the music of Umm Kulthum) or "Wahabiyat" (the music of Abdel Wahab), organized by the 100-year old institute, Adel is often the lead singer with an entire troupe from the Cairo Opera House accompanying his powerful vocals."These events are very successful," said Jihan Morsi, the seminal director of the opera's Oriental Music department.Music production companies are also seeking to preserve the country's music heritage through younger generations.Sawt al-Qahira, or Sono Cairo, a historic record company, is betting on the internet, despite financial setbacks and ongoing legal battles over the copyright to Umm Kulthum songs.Younger generations have also shown a renewed interest in the classics thanks to popular televised talent shows."Arab Idol, The Voice and others show people singing old songs," said Doaa Mamdouh, the company's internet services head, adding this has prompted many fans to dig out the original versions.ASSPCIATED FRANCE - PRESSE

                    Morsi, Egypt's ousted president, buried after courtroom death

                CAIRO - Egypt's former president Mohammed Morsi was buried early on Tuesday, a day after his collapse and death inside a Cairo courtroom following the conclusion of a trial session in an espionage lawsuit.Morsi's family attended funeral prayers in the mosque of Cairo's Tora prison, followed by the burial at a cemetery in the city's eastern district of Nasr City, said Abdul-Moneim Abdel-Maqsoud, a member of Morsi's defense team.Morsi's son, Ahmed, said his father was interred at a Cairo cemetery dedicated to prominent Islamists.Morsi, 67, hailed from Egypt's largest Islamist group, the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, and was elected president in 2012 following the ouster the year before of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak.Morsi was ousted by the army in 2013 in response to mass protests against his rule. Critics accused the Brotherhood of using violence against opponents and seeking to monopolize power and Islamize the state. Massive protests grew against Morsi's rule, until the military - led by then-defense minister Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi - ousted Morsi, dissolved parliament and eventually banned the Muslim Brotherhood organization. Sisi was elected president and reelected last year.Since 2013, Morsi and top leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood have been kept in prison, facing trials over charges of murder, violence and spying.Morsi was serving a 20-year jail sentence for inciting deadly clashes between his supporters and opponents in late 2012, and a 25-year jail term for leaking classified documents to Qatar. He denied all these charges.On Monday, Morsi was attending a retrial session in Cairo criminal court along with 22 other people.Local media said the former president had suffered a heart attack in the courtroom."The former president had asked to speak and the judge gave him the permission," state TV reported, adding that Morsi fainted later and was taken to hospital.Nabil Sadek, the public prosecutor, said in a statement that Morsi collapsed in a defendants' cage in the courtroom after speaking for five minutes and was pronounced dead at the hospital at 4:50 pm."The initial medical examination of Morsi showed that he had no pulse, no indications of breathing and his eyes were open and unresponsive to light or stimuli," the statement said.An autopsy showed no signs of recent injury on his body, Sadek said. The prosecutor ordered an examination of Morsi's body, footage from surveillance cameras at the court, as well as an investigation of those who were present at the time of Morsi's death.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas paid tribute to Morsi and Iran expressed regret over Morsi's death.On Tuesday, Egypt's authorities also criticized a Western human rights advocate over her comments following Morsi's death.Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director with Human Rights Watch, criticized the Egyptian government's "failure to allow him adequate medical care, much less family visits".Egypt's state information service said Whitson's statements were "nothing but false claims" and reaffirm what it called the organization's tradition of "circulating lies".The service added that a court had approved Morsi's medical request in 2017 asking that he be "treated at his own expense".Ap - Xinhua - Reuters

                CAIRO -- The Egyptian police identified on Thursday the terrorist who killed 20 people using a booby-trapped car in the Egyptian capital Cairo earlier this week.The man was named as Abdul Rahman Khaled Mahmoud who belongs to Hasm, an armed group affiliated to the banned Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's interior ministry said in a statement.The terrorist's identity has been confirmed after matching his DNA with his family members, the ministry revealed.The ministry said that its security forces have identified two hideouts of the terrorist cell behind the attack, adding that one of the hiding places was located in Fayoum province, 100 km southwest of the capital Cairo, while the other was in Shorouk city near Cairo.According to the ministry, eight of the terrorists were killed during a shootout while attacking their den in Fayoum.The statement said that "seven others terrorists were also killed during a shootout when the police forces approached their hideout in Shorouk city."A number of the cell members have been arrested, the ministry said.A total of 20 people were killed and 47 others were injured when a booby-trapped car driving from the opposite direction exploded Sunday night after hitting three other cars near the National Cancer Institute in downtown Cairo.Right after the attack, Egyptian police said Hasm group had prepared the car, which was reported as stolen months ago, to carry out a terrorist attack.Terrorism has been plaguing Egypt since the military ousted former President Mohamed Morsi in July 2013 in response to mass protests against his government and his currently outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group.Terror attacks, killing hundreds of policemen and soldiers in the restive North Sinai province, have gradually spread to other provinces in recent years. Most of these attacks were claimed by a Sinai-based group affiliated with the regional Islamic State militant group.
