                            Attempts by the US Congress to interfere in China's internal affairs with the proposed Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act are not only "inappropriate", but also against accepted international practices, a major political party in Hong Kong said on Tuesday. Holden Chow Ho-ding, who is the DAB's vice-chairman and also a legislator, said the proposed act aims to pressure both the government of the Hong Kong special administrative region and the central government, which could lead to the escalation of tension between China and the US and harm both countries and the rest of the world. What is happening in Hong Kong is not a crisis of human rights but a crisis of rule of law, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular news conference in Beijing on Tuesday

"When the ice wall is completed, we estimate that the amount of underground water flowing into the complex will be less than 100 tons," a company spokesman said. Even now, with the ice wall almost complete, about 140 tons of underground water flows into the plant daily, forcing the company to pump it out and store it in on-site tanks

Even then, it will continue to be prevented from selling its products to US companies and to those in nations supporting the US-led boycott

Although the investigation by the State Post Bureau has reportedly discovered violations of the regulations by FedEx, before the police in Jin'an conclude their investigation, it would be too early to jump to conclusions in this instance.But what has made headlines is the parcel was sent from the United States via FedEx, a US express delivery company that has been under investigation by the State Post Bureau since June on suspicion it illegally held back and misdirected to its US headquarters packages of the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei that Washington is intent on attacking
