                Overseas Chinese marks Mid-Autumn Festival
            </p>
            <p>
                NEW YORK - China's Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon Festival, which fell on Sept 13 this year, has brought joy where it was celebrated by overseas Chinese communities around the world on Friday and over the weekend.In the United States, a variety of Mid-Autumn festivities have eased the homesickness of the Chinese communities. In New York, Illinois, California and elsewhere, festival-themed carnivals, galas and markets started from last weekend. Streets in Chinatowns were closed, cruise ships were rented, and top floors of landmark buildings were reserved for get-togethers.In the east African country of Ethiopia, the celebrations of the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival has coincided with the country's New Year. The double festivals have provided a moment for both Ethiopians and Chinese expats to celebrate the two events under a single roof, enjoying the two countries' rich cultural and historical values.On Saturday, Ethiopian and Chinese staff from the local office of a Chinese construction giant, China Civil Engineering Construction Company, gathered in Addis Ababa to mark the two events. Attending the joint celebrations, Chinese and Ethiopian colleagues enjoyed the festive ambience by exchanging gifts and learning each other's language."We celebrated our New Year and the Chinese Mid-Autumn cultural festival together. The ceremony was unique as both events are related to each other," Selam Simegn, assistant to the Manger at the construction office's Ethiopia branch said."The Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival manifests the coming of new harvest season as the full moon glows," said Simegn, an Ethiopian, who added that she is happy to taste the mooncakes baked by her Chinese colleagues.In Turkey's capital city Ankara, celebrations events took place from Saturday to Tuesday in the Hilton Hotel and Atakule, a tower which is one of the landmarks of the city.Attendants of the festival had the pleasure of seeing traditional Chinese folk art related to food, such as dough modeling, sugar painting and music. A face mask changing dance was also presented and very much appreciated by the crowd."This is real art. I marveled at what I'm seeing. I called my staff to see how this gentleman is presenting this centuries-old craft," said a Turkish chef, Erhan Kahraman, in front of the stand where a Chengdu master was meticulously exhibiting his sugar painting craftsmanship.Xinhua

                Ethiopian Ambassador on cooperation with China
            </a>
            <p>
                Teshome Toga Chanaka, Ethiopian Ambassador to China, talked with China Daily recently about bilateral trade and cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative.The ambassador wanted to expand exports to China and believed Ethiopia's high-quality products would find a ready market here. Yet the greatest challenge is to increase output, which he believed China could help as well.Toga was particularly impressed by one project between the two sides under the Belt and Road Initiative: the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway. With the Chinese-built railway, export commodities can be transported to the port of neighboring Djibouti overnight, a drastic reduction of cargo transportation time. It used to take seven days.The investment of Chinese enterprises, especially in infrastructure construction and the manufacturing industry, has contributed to the overall development of Ethiopia. "They're contributing to our growth of the economy (and) they're benefiting our people on the ground," the ambassador said in the interview.He also talked about China's achievements in economic growth and its significant transformation in the past 40 years and expressed his appreciation of the hard work of the Chinese people.

                MAX certification flights could come in October
            </a>
            <p>
                Certification flights for the Boeing 737 MAX are likely to be conducted in October following approval of the software update to the plane's anti-stall device implicated in two fatal crashes, according to news reports.But the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said that there is no schedule to return MAX jets to service and declined to comment on the news reports."The certification flights are part of the return to service, so we aren't going to speculate on when they will occur," Lynn Lunsford, spokeswoman for the FAA, told China Daily.Boeing also declined to comment on the scheduling of the certification flights for the MAX jet. Peter Pedraza, a spokesman for Boeing, told China Daily: "There has been no change to our best estimate of a return to service in the early fourth quarter, and progress in the software continues to support that timeframe."As for test flights, Bloomberg, citing "people briefed on the matter", said conducting them in October would be consistent with Boeing's plan to return MAX jets to service by the fourth quarter.The Seattle Times reported that the FAA plans to issue standards for pilot training in September. If the MAX is cleared to return to service, the newspaper said Boeing plans to increase production to 52 planes a month by February 2020 and to 57 planes a month by next summer. Boeing cut production to 42 planes a month following the MAX's worldwide grounding.Boeing and the FAA have been criticized since MAX crashes in Indonesia in October 2018 and Ethiopia on March 10 killed a total of 346 passengers and crew. The FAA was the last regulator to ground the 737 MAX. China's regulators were the first.American Airlines said it has canceled MAX flights through Nov 2 and will follow FAA directives. Analysts estimate it will take at least 45 days to return the grounded aircraft to service after receiving regulatory approval."According to Boeing, they will submit their final certification package to the FAA in September," American Airlines told China Daily. "Once submitted, the FAA will determine when the MAX returns to service in collaboration with other global regulators."A preliminary investigation suggests the aircraft's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, an automated anti-stall device, apparently forced the noses of the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines flights down and into a fatal plunge when it erroneously determined the planes were about to stall. The MCAS points the nose of the plan down to gain air speed to avoid a mid-air stall.

                Russian company sues Boeing over MAX planes
            </a>
            <p>
                A Russian aircraft-leasing company has filed the first lawsuit by a company against Boeing over the plane maker's grounded 737 MAX jets.Avia Capital Services told the state-owned Tass news agency on Tuesday that Boeing failed to disclose information about the jets' "defects" and failed to deliver 35 safe, serviceable MAX jets as promised, according to The Associated Press.Boeing declined to comment on the suit filed in Chicago on Monday. Boeing's headquarters is in the city.Family members of some of the 346 passengers and crew killed in the two crashes of MAX jets have filed wrongful-death lawsuits against the aircraft maker.Steven Marks, an attorney with the Miami law firm Podhurst Orseck, who represents 30 families of victims of the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes, told the Financial Times: "I think you will see a number of other operators filing suit in coming months. This will be the first of many to come."Boeing has attempted to negotiate compensation deals with customers, but Avia rejected the offer as inadequate, according to the FT.The Avia lawsuit alleges that Boeing "intentionally" failed to inform its customers, including Avia, about the safety of the MAX jet. It alleges Boeing was "negligent", designed a "defective" plane and withheld "critical information" about the aircraft's safety from regulators and customers.Avia asks the court to allow it to cancel the deal without penalty. Avia said it made a cash deposit of $35 million and seeks return of the amount with interest, $75 million in lost profits and "several times the amount" in punitive damages.Boeing took a $4.9 billion charge in the second quarter to cover settlements and posted a $2.94 billion second-quarter loss, the largest in company history.

                US airlines cancel more 737 flights
            </a>
            <p>
                          Friction between Boeing and international air-safety authorities reportedly may delay the return of the 737 Max fleet in time for the year-end holiday travel season. Both American and United airlines have canceled flights for the jetliner into December.              The Wall Street Journal, citing government and pilot union officials, reported on Monday that aviation authorities from the United States, Europe and Brazil have complained that Boeing has failed to provide technical details about modifications to the Max's flight-control system. The system was implicated in crashes of flights of Lion Air in 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines this year. A total of 346 people were killed.                  The complaints stemmed from a Boeing meeting last month in Seattle, which was cut short by regulators, the newspaper said.                      Boeing will have to resubmit documents describing proposed software changes, which then must be reviewed by the US Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, the Journal said.                          A Boeing spokesman declined to comment on the newspaper's report.                              Boeing has promised it will have the software fix ready next month. Even if approved by regulators, it will take time to train pilots on the new software and get the planes ready to fly again.                                  American Airlines on Sunday removed the 737 Max from its schedule for another month. The grounding through Dec 3 affects about 140 flights per day, the airline said. American initially grounded the planes in March after the crashes.                                      The airline said it "remains confident" that impending software updates to the 737 Max, along with the new training elements Boeing is developing, will lead to recertification of the aircraft this year.                                          Southwest Airlines, which has operated more Max flights than any other US airline, previously canceled about 180 daily flights through Jan 5.                                              The grounding of Boeing's bestselling jet has forced the cancellation of thousands of flights around the world and has halted delivery of new planes.                                                  Canceling the flights this far ahead gives airlines time to assign other aircraft to 737 Max routes or rebook customers whose flights were canceled. American said customers on canceled flights can be rebooked or receive a refund.                                                      Last week, Boeing told US public radio network NPR that it is delaying the release of its 777X long-haul jet as the company focuses resources to getting its Max 737 jets back into service.                                                          "We reviewed our development program schedule and the needs of our current 777X customers and decided to adjust the schedule," Boeing spokesman Paul Bergman said in a statement on Aug 29.                                                              NPR said the delay complicates plans for Australia's Qantas Airways, which had planned to start the world's longest commercial flight in 2023, from Sydney to London. It would take 21 hours.                                                                  "The adjustment reduces risk in our development program," Bergman said. "We continue to engage with our current and potential customers on how we can meet their fleet needs."                                                                      aiheping@chinadailyusa.com                                                                          (China Daily 09/04/2019 page11)

                Ethiopian PM hails China's support for education, human resource development
            </a>
            <p>
                ADDIS ABABA - Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Thursday praised China's support for Ethiopia's efforts in human resource development.At the Chinese Government Training Program Fellowship Reception organized by the Chinese embassy, Ahmed extended appreciation to the Chinese government and the ambassador "for their great effort to make this program happen.""I am sure this is the right investment; these bright Ethiopians will help us to bridge the people of Ethiopia and the people of China," he said at the National Palace in Addis Ababa. "I am sure both the government and people will harvest from this investment."This year, 228 Ethiopians are admitted to long-term degree programs, including 66 PhD and 162 master degrees, accounting for 16.52 percent of the total scholarships China offers across the world."This is the time when the Ethiopian government is making special efforts to expand education, to enhance educational quality," the prime minister said. "Efforts have been done to send more people abroad for scholarships to pursue overseas studies, and this Chinese scholarship is part of the efforts."Ahmed gave advice to the scholarship recipients on actively learning from China's experience and practices of different development activities, even outside classroom, at airports, or on streets.He also expressed hope that the recipients would come back from China with knowledge that enables them to contribute to Ethiopia's development endeavors."Human resource development is an important component in the Belt and Road Initiative and within the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation framework," Chinese Ambassador to Ethiopia Tan Jian said. "The purpose is not only to build capacity, but also to strengthen people-to-people bond."By Aug 30, the Chinese government has invited over 800 Ethiopians to participate in 200 short-term seminars, training courses and workshops, and offered scholarships to about 400 Ethiopians, including government officials for longer-term bachelor's, master's and doctorate degree programs, according to the ambassador.

                Foreign airlines encouraged to consider new Beijing airport
            </a>
            <p>
                The Civil Aviation Administration of China encourages overseas airlines to open international flights to Beijing Daxing International Airport, which will begin operations before Sept 30, whether going all-in or operating in Beijing's two airports, a senior official said.Gu Xiaohong, deputy director of the administration's general affairs department, said Monday at a press conference that overseas carriers, in line with their strategic planning and market demands, are free to move their services to the newly built airport, with the option of having a presence in both Daxing Airport and Beijing Capital International Airport.So far, British Airways has announced it will move all its operations from the current Beijing Capital Airport to the new airport, and Ethiopian Airlines, Polish Airlines, Finnair, Malaysia Airlines and Royal Air Maroc haven't made a decision on Daxing Airport alone or both, he said.Starting from the winter and spring season, a total of 16 domestic airlines and eight overseas carriers including China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Royal Brunei Airlines and Himalaya Airlines, plan to operate out of Beijing Daxing International Airport, and the airport will then serve a network of 116 routes and 112 domestic and foreign destinations, according to the administration.

                Brexit lies 'fueling surge of migrants to UK'
            </a>
            <p>
                 A total of 86 people were intercepted trying to cross the English Channel from France illegally in five separate incidents on Tuesday, the British Home Office has reported, which is said to be the highest ever total for one day.Two small boats containing 23 people, who said they were from Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Philippines, were picked up in the first incident, with another boat found later in the day containing 14 people claiming to be Iranian nationals, 3 Iraqi and 1 Vietnamese.In a third incident, a boat with 23 Iranian and Ethiopian migrants on board was intercepted.More than 1,100 people have crossed the Channel in small boats this year, with 336 attempting the journey last month. French politician Pierre-Henri Dumont, whose constituency is in Calais, from where many of the migrants begin their crossing, said numbers were rising because of the traffickers spreading untrue rumors about the impact of Brexit."Smugglers say to migrants: 'If the UK leaves the EU, you will not ever be able to cross the Channel'," he said. "It's a lie, because it won't change anything. Smugglers are giving fake news to migrants, but it's for them to earn money."He said French police were doing all they could to keep the problem under control. "We need to understand that we cannot monitor 400 or 500 kilometers of coast," he added.The Strait of Dover, where many of the attempted crossings take place, is officially recognized as the world's busiest shipping lane, with between 500 and 600 ships going through it each day.In recent weeks, there have been at least two deaths resulting from people trying to cross, with Dutch authorities having recovered the body of an Iranian woman who fell out of a dinghy and drowned, and the body of an Iraqi man having washed up in Belgium, wearing a home-made life jacket made of empty plastic bottles."Crossing the Channel in a small boat is a huge risk," said a spokesman for the British Home Office."The criminal gangs who perpetuate this are ruthless and do not care about loss of life."We are working closely at all levels with the French authorities to tackle this dangerous and illegal activity. In addition, Border Force cutters are patrolling the Channel and we have already deployed equipment including drones, CCTV and night vision goggles."The latest reports of crossings came at the same time as Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan called for more help trying to control the influx of refugees from Syria, saying he would reopen the route for them to cross into mainland Europe if more international aid was not forthcoming.Turkey currently has more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees, driven out of their homeland by the conflict raging since 2011. But Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said Erdogan was trying to threaten his country and the European Union, and added that the EU had already given Turkey 6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) to help deal with the crisis.

                Ethiopian Day unveiled with a cup of coffee
            </a>
            <p>
                Visitors tasted pure Ethiopian coffee last Friday to celebrate Ethiopian Day during the ongoing International Horticultural Exhibition in Beijing.As one of the Ethiopian Day celebrations, the Ethiopian embassy offered plain Ethiopian coffee at its exhibition area where Ethiopian art crafts and specialties are showcased.Ethiopia is the fifth biggest national coffee producer, with an average annual export of about $800 million, accounting for 25 to 30 percent of the country's total export income.Ethiopia targets the Chinese market for more investment and sales as China has seen a double-digit growth in coffee consumption.Ethiopian Ambassador to China Teshome Toga expressed his gratitude for China organizing the Horticultural Expo in a speech and also vowed to upgrade bilateral cooperation to a new level in investment, trade, tourism and cultural exchanges.Ethiopian Day coincides with the country's New Year -- Ethiopia has a calendar around seven to eight years later than the Gregorian calendar adopted by most countries. A gala event was held with Ethiopian artists dancing and singing to mark the occasion.Themed "Live Green, Live Better", the Beijing horticultural expo is the world's largest of its kind. It opened to the public on April 29 in Yanqing district and will last until Oct 7.Video by Dai Yuanyuan
