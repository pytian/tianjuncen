                WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama is set to seek economic and political strength in Asia - and more cooperation with China - during his post-election trip as he and his administration are under more pressure than ever to fix the United States economy before the 2012 Presidential elections.Though there is no doubt the US seeks to contain the rise of China while looking for a leadership role in the Asia-Pacific region, a sound and stable bilateral relationship can benefit all, experts said.Obama will leave Washington on Friday for a 10-day tour to India, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan to enhance US partnerships and alliances in the region and to attend the G20 summit in Seoul and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Yokohama.On Nov 11, President Obama will meet Chinese President Hu Jintao in Seoul on the sidelines of the G20 summit. It will be the seventh time they have met since Obama took office in 2009.The two leaders will likely to touch on a broad range of topics - including economic, trade, security and political issues - as well as the state visit of President Hu Jintao to the US early next year, Obama's top Asia advisor Jeff Bader and Ben Rhodes, deputy national security advisor for strategic communications said at a White House news briefing.Exploring the huge Asian markets to help the recovery of US economy is a key part of the president's trip, they added.Related readings: Vote unlikely to affect Sino-US ties US-China ties: Trustworthy friend is final goal China, the US and ASEAN US signals urgancy of US-SKorea free trade deal"We see this very much in the context of the focus we put on Asia as a region of the world with the most dynamic and growing markets that are going to be fundamental to our export initiative of doubling exports in the world," he added, "but also fundamental to a number of political and security concerns that will a subject of the President's travel."Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also said before her ongoing Asia tour that the fast-paced economic and social change in the region is creating "a future in which the United States must lead."With China's expanding political and economic influence in the region, she added, the US administration is not seeking to gain anything at Beijing's expense.There is no "zero-sum calculation to our relationship - so whenever one of us succeeds, the other must fail", she said. "That is not our view. In the 21st century, it is not in anyone's interest of the US and China to (view) each other as adversaries."After the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the US largely reduced its presence in the region - especially after the Sept 11 attacks which led to costly military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan. After President Obama took office in January 2009, the US government launched its back-to-Asia strategy as many people in his administration believed Asia had become more important to the US and that it should occupy more place in US foreign policy.Analysts said it is critical for the US to keep strong ties with both China and other major powers in the region.Nicholas Burns, the former state department spokesman and an international politics professor at Harvard's Kennedy School, said the US should fully engage China - instead of trying to contain it - and that other countries in the region should work together to ensure the peaceful and stable rise of China. "It is important for the US to have a priority relationship with China - but it is also important that US should pay a lot of attention to India, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia because of their strategic importance."However, he added, in the past few years, China's rise has stirred regional anxiety, and there appears to be an interest on the part of neighboring countries in asking for the US to remain a dominant power there. "You cannot go to Asia without talking about China," said Abraham Denmark, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank close to the Obama administration."China's rise is the most important development in the region in the past 30 years. But China is not all of Asia, so the US must visit their partners and allies in the region without the accusation of being hostility."Regardless, the US is not interested in "containing" China, simply because such an effort would be impossible, given its extensive economic ties with every single nation in the region, according to Dean Cheng, an Asian studies expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, another Washington think tank.Bonnie Glaser, a senior fellow of China studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said people should not exaggerate that view that the trip represents a strategic encirclement of China."I don't think it aims to contain China," according to Glaser.

                VIENNA - A near tripling of new HIV infections in Eastern Europe and Central Asia over the past nine years is frightening, the UN's top AIDS official said Wednesday.Related readings: China pledges more efforts to control AIDS UN chief asks SKorea to lift HIV test requirement HIV discrimination case verdict reflects ingrained prejudice HIV job seeker to hear verdict soonThe UN also said about 76,000 people perished from AIDS-related causes in the region last year, compared to 18,000 in 2001."When we are seeing a positive movement happening in a different part of the world, we are scared of what is happening in Eastern Europe and Central Asia," Michel Sidibe, head of the UN's AIDS agency, known as UNAIDS, told reporters in Vienna."When we are seeing a decline in the rest of the world, we are seeing an increase of new infection in this part of the world."A new UNAIDS report released Tuesday showed that the global AIDS epidemic has slowed, with a 20 percent decrease in new HIV infections over the past decade.However, it found there are still 7,000 new infections each day and that approximately 10 million people - double the number on treatment - are still waiting to be initiated onto the drugs.The increase in Eastern Europe is largely due to the fact that prevention measures for most at risk populations are not working and that only about 30 percent of people in the area have access to such programs, Sidibe said."That is very, very low if you want to change the trajectory of the epidemic," he said.He also warned that drug users have become transmitters of the virus because they don't have access to services and "have to go underground."Sidibe was in Vienna to sign a cooperation agreement between UNAIDS and AIDS Life, a group that organizes the Austrian capital's annual Life Ball gala that raises money for people with HIV and AIDS.

                SEOUL, South Korea - South Korean police say a series of explosions in the capital last week may have been orchestrated by a man seeking to gain profits by crashing stock markets.Small fires erupted Thursday at two Seoul transportation centers and police believe the incidents were caused by explosives made of firecracker powder and butane gas canisters stored in lockers.No casualties were reported.Police said Sunday that they had arrested a 43-year-old man who allegedly attempted to use the blast to send stock prices plummeting and reap profits from his investments in future options.Police also arrested two other men who allegedly bought explosive materials and placed them in the lockers at the order of Kim.

                NATORI, Japan - The leaders of China and South Korea, in Japan for a weekend summit, toured Japan's devastated north Saturday to show their support for earthquake and tsunami recovery efforts.South Korean President Lee Myung-bak arrived in Sendai city late Saturday morning and immediately headed to devastated nearby areas, offering a wreath of flowers and a silent prayer.Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao arrived later and followed a similar schedule. The two leaders were to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan in Fukushima City and return to Tokyo for a banquet before summit talks on Sunday.The March 11 earthquake and tsunami left more than 24,000 people dead or missing and sparked an ongoing crisis at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant. China and South Korea have been critical of Japan's response to the nuclear crisis, particularly about the release of radiation into the ocean.Japan hopes the visit by the two leaders will help smooth over concerns. The summit was expected to focus on the nuclear crisis and ways for each country to help Japan's recovery.Tokyo had reportedly wanted to formally start the summit in Fukushima, but that plan had to be scrapped because of logistical issues. Fukushima City is about 40 miles (60 kilometers) from the crippled nuclear plant.After placing the flowers in a rubble-covered neighborhood, Lee said South Korea would do all it can to help Japan.

                MIYAGI, Japan - China is ready to extend more material and economic support to Japan in its disaster relief task, and will consider more import from the country recently affected by a nuclear crisis, said Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.In an impending effort, China will soon send two business groups to Japan for opportunities in cooperation in the disaster relief and reconstruction sector as well as investment to Japan.Related readings: China, SKorea leaders tour devastated Japan region Wen arrives in Japan for trilateral summitThe county was the most severely jolted in the March earthquake and tsunami, with its buildings flattened and destroyed vehicles piled up along the main roads of the city.Wen paid tribute to the more than 10,000 lives lost in the disaster in the area and wishes "better life for those alive"."Disasters can destroy the homelands, but they can no way destroy the wills of the people," said Wen."I firmly believe that the Japanese people can rebuild their homelands through their own efforts and supports from the international society," said Wen.Answering questions from Japanese reporters, Wen said that China is ready to extend more material and other kinds of support for Japan's disaster-relief task.On the concerns of the Japanese business, Wen said China is ready to restore and expand the tourism between China and Japan, and to import more agriculture and other produces from Japan under the pretext of safety.In a more concrete move, China will soon send two business groups to Japan for opportunities in cooperation in the disaster relief and reconstruction sector as well as investment to Japan.Wen also pledged to enhance joint research and cooperation in disaster prevention, earthquake and tsunami monitoring, nuclear safety and new energy development.China has offered in-time support for Japan's disaster relief.Wen said he brought to Japan during the current visit about 61 million RMB donated by Chinese people to the Chinese Red Cross for the Japanese people."A friendship in need is more previous. I hope the friendship forged between Chinese and Japanese people through joint effort in disaster relief will be long lasting and solid," said Wen.Wen arrived in Japan Saturday for the 4th trilateral leadership meeting among China, Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK).Wen will visit Fukushima later Saturday afternoon, where the March 11 earthquake and tsunami crippled the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.Fukushima is still struggling to control nuclear radiation.Chinese foreign Ministry said earlier that the visit to Fukushima is a personal choice of Premier Wen, to show China's support for the nation's reconstruction efforts.Wen will hold a bilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan on Sunday morning. It will be the first formal meeting between the leaders of China and Japan since their tie worsened last year after Japan's coast guard arrested the captain of a Chinese fishing trawler whose boat had collided with Japanese patrol ships near the Diaoyu Islands in East China Sea.Observers said the visit is an important step in improving China-Japan relations.

                My late father said “China-must-be-strong” was a stolen 10 year old child in Guangdong to labor for warring Japanese butchers overseas. I voluntarily self-retired in Australia on my 50th birthday to revisit South-East-Asia and China!In 1995, was invited to Indonesia to assist/advise Himpurna of retired RI Generals on funding projects and brokering prospects. Among Himpurna were LtGen Tjokro-(ex-Jakarta-Mayor), Vice-Admiral Prapto-(ex-Ambassador-to-SKorea) and Vice-Air Marshal Slamat-(ex-Attache-to-UK). In 1996, was invited by SinoChem to advise it on ways to fund China’s first GSM to get off the ground in Beijing. In Zhejiang, GSM licensee thus became ChinaUnicom! In 2009, was invited by IET(China_Branch) to deliver a speech/talk at the Fudang_University_Shanghai. Since Year-2000 wherever and whatever I witnessed in China, I would write and tell others the truths behaving like a freelance mentor, especially in China.
