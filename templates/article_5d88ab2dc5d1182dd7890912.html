                The United States and China must work together to advance mutual interests and, more importantly, to promote world stability and prosperity, Xu Chen, chairman of the China General Chamber of Commerce-USA, also president and CEO of Bank of China USA, said on Tuesday at the Vision China forum in New York.By working together and sharing "state social responsibilities", the world's two largest economies can promote growth in the context of a "community of shared future", he said at the event, held at the Asia Society and co-hosted by China Daily and Bank of China.Xu disagreed with those who argue that China's growing economic strength poses a threat to the US and therefore should be contained.

                USMCA trade deal awaits OK from Congress
            </a>
            <p>
                US business groups support passage of a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, but some fear the deal could get lost in the fallout from the continuing US-China trade dispute and 2020 US presidential politics.American farmers, drug companies and large businesses want the US-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement to be ratified, but Democrats remain wary.Drawing support from labor groups, they want further discussions with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on ways to strengthen the agreement to assure new labor rules can be enforced in Mexico.Democrats supported the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993, but some had second thoughts, as many US workers lost their jobs to cheaper labor in Mexico and overseas."If you can't enforce the language in any treaty, you can't protect American workers," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat from California, told reporters last week.Congressman Jim Banks, a Republican from Indiana, said provisions to improve working conditions in Mexico are already part of USMCA. "Democrats are grasping at straws," he told reporters last week.US President Donald Trump is seeking approval of the deal to show progress on trade.Pelosi must balance concerns about the deal with the political future of new members of Congress who helped Democrats regain the majority in the House of Representatives by winning races in districts last year that supported Trump in 2016, analysts said."In my opinion, the chances of USMCA being approved are fair," Usha Haley, professor and Barton Distinguished Chair in International Business at Wichita State University, told China Daily."The Democratic House of Representatives is reviewing a revised agreement that hopefully addresses its concerns on enforcement of labor and environmental issues, and on pharmaceuticals. Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly stated the House plans to approve (it) once the revisions allay these concerns. Mexico has approved the revisions. Canada's approval appears more prone to deadline pressure than the USA's. Canada will hold national elections October 21."  Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington, said the fate of the treaty that would replace the NAFTA largely depends on the views of former vice-president Joe Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the top three contenders for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination."If two of the three come out against it, Pelosi will not allow a vote," he told China Daily. "For sure, USMCSA is out of the headlines thanks to the trade war with China. This probably improves its chances of passage. If the vote gets postponed until 2020, then I think the chances of passage drop substantially. Failure of USMCA won't make much of a difference to North American trade, provided Trump doesn't blow up NAFTA."Farmers rallied last week in Washington to show support for the USMCA. Dairy workers said the deal likely would boost American exports to Canada by about $250 million, or one-third higher than current levels.Major pharmaceutical companies like the deal because it gives biologic drugs 10 years of exclusivity from companies seeking to market similar products. US trade with Canada is second only to trade with China. Mexico is the third-largest US trading partner."Our domestic and global competitiveness is dependent on the ability to move vehicles and parts across borders duty free," Shane Karr, director of external affairs at the North American unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, told The Wall Street Journal.The US Chamber of Commerce backs the USMCA, and its regional affiliates have held 93 meetings with lawmakers during Congress's summer recess, including 40 Democrats."The flow of commerce across the (North American) continent supports 12 million American jobs," the US Chamber of Commerce said in a statement."The two countries accounted for 40 percent of all US export growth over the past decade. USMCA will lock in free trade across North America for virtually all goods. Canada and Mexico purchase more made-in-America manufactured goods than our next largest export markets combined."

                Goodwill efforts raise hopes for a deal
            </a>
            <p>
                Editor's Note: The United States has deferred the planned increase in tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods from Oct 1 to Oct 15 and China withdrew the tariffs on pork and soybean imports from the US in response. Many believe these moves will de-escalate tensions. Two experts share their views on the new turn of events in the China-US trade war with China Daily's Liu Jianna. Excerpts follow: Move encouraging and raises hopes That both sides have shown their intention to defuse the trade tensions is a relief to not only the two economies but also the world beyond. The US move also shows a subtle change in the attitude of the US leader, who while triggering the trade war against China didn't believe that the US would also have to pay a high price for it. It seems the US administration has deferred the planned increase of tariffs on Chinese imports because it has realized the trade war is detrimental to US consumers. Which in turn shows the US can still act with discretion. The fact that the US leader stopped the airstrike on Iran adds credence to this belief. It is hoped the two countries will hold the next round of trade talks based on reason in order to reach a deal, at least an interim deal. Still, the deep-rooted conflicts between the world's two largest economies, especially on China's developing economy status, are likely to continue. The conflicts could even intensify in the long term. Many say the US is staring at recession. Indeed, the US' more than 100 months of economic growth could come to an end according to the laws of economics. If the White House recognizes this fact, the US administration would more strongly feel the need to strike a deal with China at the trade talks. Tao Wenzhao, a researcher in US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences More goodwill gestures needed China seems to be less affected than expected by the trade war that it has been dragged into against its will. That is because it boasts a huge domestic market with a complete supply chain, which has ensured its strong and lasting attraction for foreign investment. According to the US-China Business Council, 46 percent of the US enterprises operating in the Chinese market reported a higher profit margin from China than their overall profit margin. Besides, despite the decline in China's exports to the US, its exports to other economies such as the European Union and the ASEAN member states increased considerably. Thanks to the complete supply chain, foreign enterprises have realized that relocating their production units from China to another country would not be cost-effective. Apart from the measures to further open up its economy, China has also increased investments abroad; its outbound direct investment was $143 billion in 2018 alone. And China's cooperation with other economies has increased the possibility of the China-EU Investment Agreement being inked next year and negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership being completed by the end of this year. Also, the efforts to strengthen intellectual property rights protection and improve the business environment are expected to help consolidate China's partnerships and collaboration with other countries. On the other hand, 300,000 jobs have been lost in the US and 0.3 percent of its growth shaved off, according to Moody's Analytics report. Therefore, it is likely that the US' economic rebound could take longer without the trade war. And the possibility of its economic boom coming to an end cannot be ruled out. Both countries want a trade deal. However, only a mutually beneficial deal is acceptable to China. More work needs to be done to reach a deal.

                China chamber heads calls for more Sino-US cooperation
            </a>
            <p>
                The United States and China must work together to advance mutual interests and, more importantly, to promote world stability and prosperity, Xu Chen, chairman of China General Chamber of Commerce-USA (CGCC), said Tuesday at the Vison China forum in New York.By working together and sharing "state social responsibilities", the world's two largest economies can promote growth in the context of a "community of shared future", he said at the event held at the Asia Society and co-hosted by China Daily and the CGCC.Xu disagreed with those who argue that China's growing economic strength poses a threat to the US and therefore should be contained."China's remarkable growth has offered great opportunities to the US, for China is now capable of sharing more ‘social responsibilities' on the world stage and has become a stronger partner for the US," he said. "Our two countries can take the world's challenges and risks and contribute more to global economic growth, political stability and social progress."Xu said China stood with the US during financial crises, benefiting both nations and the world.In 1997, the Thai baht fell sharply and financial markets in Japan and Hong Kong were threatened with collapse. The Japanese yen fell to about 150-to-1 against the US dollar and that threatened other economies in the region. Had the Chinese yuan depreciated as sharply as the yen, the global economy probably would have fallen into recession, he said."China withstood the pressure of depreciation and even narrowed the floating range of the yuan against the US dollar," Xu said. "China's move helped East Asian countries stabilize financially and avoided the spillover of a current crisis."The result, he said, was that the US and European economies escaped major fallout from the Asian crisis.In 2008, the collapse of the subprime mortgage market hammered the US economy and the Federal Reserve adopted Quantitative Easing to avoid a looming liquidity crisis, a problem China did not face, he explained."China had every reason not to echo America's easy monetary policy," Xu said. "At that crucial time, China worked in concert with the quantitative easing measures of the United States by adopting a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent and moderately easing monetary policy from the standpoint of maintaining a stable global economic ecosystem."Cooperation between the world's economic giants helped to stabilize the world's economy while "vicious competition" would have deepened the crisis and damaged both nations, he said.Citing a pertinent Chinese saying that "No eggs could stay intact under an overturned nest", Xu said no one would have benefited from confrontation rather than cooperation during past financial crises."If China and the US see each other as a threat and refuse to work with each other, to the degree as the extremist voices had wished, then whoever is the winner, the downfall of the global economy would be the ‘overturned nest' where no single country in the world would escape," he said.Xu concluded, "I believe that China will gladly work hand-in-hand with the US and jointly promote a more peaceful, stable and prosperous global economy."

                Which way are Sino-US ties headed?
            </a>
            <p>
                In view of the interests of both countries, it is a rational and beneficial choice to seek mutually acceptable solutionsBidding farewell to 40 years of friendship, some in the United States want to replace cooperation with competition as the tone of Sino-US ties in future.At present, with right-wing conservatism and nationalism peaking, the US has listed China as a strategic competitor and the recent Sino-US economic and trade conflict is a clear manifestation of this accusation. The US has adopted a flurry of radical and inappropriate policies and measures to counter China, exposing Washington's short-term overanxiety. Whenever the US calms down, China and the US will come back to seeking rational major power relations, but it will take time.The US should not hold the unrealistic expectation that trade negotiations can resolve all major issues and concerns between the two countries. The current trade negotiations are the first ones opened under the threat of tariffs. The difficulty is unprecedented.It is even more difficult to resolve anything in months if the negotiations cover issues like tariff and non-tariff barriers, investment and market access, agriculture and the service industry, intellectual property protection, technology transfer, exchange rates and enforcement mechanisms.The US should not set an unrealistic negotiation schedule, which reflects its anxiousness and greed for success. It should recognize that it is impossible to find a complete solution to structural problems in the short term. It is also unrealistic to expect trade negotiations to resolve all major issues and concerns between the two countries.The Sino-US economic and trade negotiations could head in one of three directions:The first is the resumption of negotiations and conclusion of an agreement in the following several months, something the market expects. China and the US are complementary in terms of economy and trade. In fact, economic sectors of both countries as well as the global market expect a trade agreement acceptable to both sides to emerge in the near future. However, this scenario will emerge if only the two countries truly respect each other and hold realistic targets. It is particularly crucial for the two sides to arrive at an agreement on the elimination of punitive tariffs and on implementation mechanisms.In the second scenario, negotiations could lead to a stalemate. The negotiations could continue till next year. China and the US might require a long time to arrive at an agreement. During this period, the US will maintain tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China will continue to implement counter-measures. The US is likely to impose tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods and crack down on Chinese technology companies as a lever to maximize pressure.The Chinese side will continue to maintain rational restraint but the economies of both China and the US will suffer continuous damage, and the global economy will continue to face uncertainty and unpredictability.In the third scenario, it might be difficult for China and the US to arrive at an economic and trade agreement approved by both sides. The US will continue to implement a hawkish policy and impose punitive tariffs on all Chinese goods. China will be forced to adopt comprehensive counter-measures.In such a scenario, the Sino-US economic and trade conflict will not only undermine the economic growth of China and the US, but will also bring horrific damage to the global economy. A man-made economic crisis will force the global economy into a recession.China must work hard toward the best situation, but at the same time it must prepare itself for the worst. In the past year, China responded rationally to unilateral actions by the US, taking countermeasures on the same scale. But it also actively sought dialogue, consultation and negotiation. The Chinese side also conveyed to the US that if it wants to fight, China will accompany it to the end.China has the confidence to fight the US because it boasts an enormous manufacturing capacity and a large global market share and holds the interests of US companies in China as a bargaining chip.Sino-US competition in high-tech industry is normal market competition. But the US is trying in vain to combat the development of China's high-tech industry by imposing higher tariffs. On the one hand, China's high-tech products are exported not only to the US market, but also to the global market.On the other hand, China's high-tech industry development has its own unique development track and characteristics, and is supported by China's comprehensive industrial system. In recent years, with the expansion of R&D investment from the government and enterprises, China's overall innovation and R&D capabilities have been continuously enhanced.The US trying to slow down the development of China's high-tech industry with tariff policies can only stimulate China's indigenous innovation capability and increase its efforts to expand the global market.Economic globalization means that the global trade order and economic order are of paramount importance. China currently advocates maintaining the existing order and promoting World Trade Organization reform. China, together with its global value chain partners, will jointly safeguard the multilateral trading system.The author is director of the Regional Economic Cooperation Research Center at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.
