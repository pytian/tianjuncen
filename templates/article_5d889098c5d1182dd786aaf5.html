                Chinese tourists' shopping in Turkey surges 85% in first 7 months
            </p>
            <p>
                ANKARA - The shopping activities of Chinese tourists in Turkey have jumped by 85 percent year-on-year in the first seven months, state-run Anadolu Agency reported Wednesday.The Chinese visitors also accounted for 22 percent of tax-free shopping in Turkey in the same period, registering an increase of 2 percent, Selim Seyhun, head of the Global Blue Turkey, a shopping tax refund firm, was quoted as saying.Chinese visitors have shown interest in luxury shopping, and the average spending of Chinese tourists in Turkey has exceeded 5,000 Turkish liras ($874), he added."For Chinese people, digital payment methods are important. If digital payment points are increased in Turkey, Chinese people's spending will be easy," Seyhun noted.Meanwhile, global tourists raised their shopping activities in Turkey by 70 percent from January to July, the report said.In addition, travellers from Gulf countries contributed to 24 percent of foreigners' shopping in the country in the first seven months, down from 27 percent the year before.Global Blue is a major company that provides tax-free shopping services in many countries around the world, including Turkey.

                Liverpool beats Chelsea on penalties to lift Super Cup
            </a>
            <p>
                Adrian may never play more than a smattering of games for Liverpool, but he'll be remembered for his "crazy week".The backup goalkeeper turned penalty hero with a save on the final kick of the shootout as Liverpool beat Chelsea to win the Super Cup and kick off a new European season.After Champions League holder Liverpool and Europa League winner Chelsea finished extra time at 2-2, Adrian made the crucial save with his leg to deny Tammy Abraham and give his team a 5-4 win on penalties in a game which finished after midnight Turkish time on Thursday.It was a dramatic turnaround after Adrian fouled Abraham to concede a penalty in extra time.Adrian was signed just nine days before as backup for Alisson, but when the Brazilian injured himself last Friday in the English Premier League opener, he was thrust into the spotlight first as a substitute, then as a Super Cup starter."Welcome to Liverpool," Adrian said. "It's been a crazy week. I'm really happy for the team, I'm happy to play for Liverpool and happy for the fans."The 32-year-old Spanish goalkeeper was a free agent after leaving West Ham, where he didn't play a single Premier League game last season and last appeared in an FA Cup loss to lowly AFC Wimbledon."The goalkeeping coach told me he needs time to get fit, but he didn't have time. He played so well tonight," Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp said. "His performance over 120 minutes was incredible and the penalty save was the icing on the cake."Even before the shootout, Adrian kept Liverpool in the game with a 113th-minute save from Mason Mount to stop Chelsea winning in extra time. Still, he's expected to relinquish his Liverpool starting spot to Alisson when the Brazilian returns from his calf injury in a few weeks.Liverpool played its second penalty shootout in three games, having lost to Manchester City for the Community Shield on Aug 4.Chelsea took the lead in the 36th minute when Christian Pulisic exposed poor positioning by Liverpool right back Joe Gomez to pass for Olivier Giroud to shoot low past Adrian.Liverpool stormed back after the break, Fabinho's 48th-minute pass opening up the Chelsea defense and leaving Sadio Mane with an easy finish off Mohamed Salah's flick.

                20 years after deadly quake, Istanbul not ready for 'Big One'
            </a>
            <p>
                ISTANBUL - Twenty years after a devastating earthquake ravaged the northwest of Turkey, Istanbul people live with the knowledge that another "Big One" is unavoidable, and that their city of 16 million is not prepared.On Saturday, Turkey will mark the anniversary of the magnitude-7.4 quake that hit Izmit - around 100 kilometers east of Istanbul - on Aug 17, 1999, killing at least 17,400 people, including 1,000 within the economic capital of the country.The question for seismologists is not if another earthquake will hit Istanbul, which lies along the volatile North Anatolian tectonic plate. The only question is: When?Sukru Ersoy, a specialist at the city's Yildiz Technical University, estimates it could come within the next decade. "In the worst case, the quake could reach a magnitude of 7.7," he said. "Is Istanbul ready for that? Sadly not."According to Ersoy, such a quake would destroy thousands of buildings, leaving a "terrifying" number of dead and paralyzing Turkey's economic and tourist hub.The former capital of the Ottoman Empire has suffered many earthquakes through its long history. In 1509, the city was shaken so badly that the Ottoman authorities referred to the incident as "the little apocalypse".Since then, a rapid-response unit - the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority - has been created, quake-proof hospitals have been built, and systems to cut gas lines installed.But experts say the main problem is that Istanbul has tens of thousands of poorly-built buildings, thrown up during the construction boom of recent decades with little regulatory oversight.The 1999 quake showed how many buildings had been built using dodgy cement made from unsuitable sand dredged from the sea."There was a moment of reflection just after the 1999 earthquake," said Nusret Suna, head of the Chamber of Building Engineers for Istanbul. "But with time, fatalism took over again. People said 'It's destiny' and people moved on to other things."Although regulations have become stricter in the past 20 years, the collapse of a residential building in Istanbul this past February, in which 20 people were killed, renewed fears about the solidity of the city's infrastructure.Agence France-Presse

                Turkey's 'Microangelo' turns tiny objects into artworks
            </a>
            <p>
                ISTANBUL－For Turkey's "Microangelo", any tiny, discarded item might be the canvas for his next mini-masterpiece, from a matchstick to a pumpkin seed.The delicate, impeccably detailed miniature paintings of Hasan Kale often require a magnifying glass for viewers to see the nuances but can take months to complete.Some of the artist's best-known pieces are a scene from the movie Pulp Fiction on the side of a piece of popcorn and the silhouette of Turkey's founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk on a grain of rice."I started this journey 25 years ago with the goal of establishing a new language in art ... by transforming the objects that we put aside or see as trash into little capsules of art," he said, at his Istanbul studio."It is a blend of experience and hand discipline. I can work on a single object for up to six months."The 60-year-old artist, who has never had a formal art teacher, began researching miniature art in the 1980s.He was stunned, he said, by how tiny details and touches can change a form of artistic expression.But it was not until 1995 that he had the idea of doing it himself on unconventional objects.He had been looking at an empty cup of coffee and noticed how the remains at the bottom formed what he thought were beautiful patterns in the small space."I started working on a bean. I sat down and engraved a picture of Istanbul on it."I enjoyed it so much that I started trying other objects," he said.Kale has since used nearly 300 items and revels in the idea that any forgettable item－from a pebble from the sea, to a fish bone that gets stuck in your teeth－could become a work of art."Imagine the noise of hundreds of seeds as you bite into a fig. Can you dream an Istanbul view on one of them?" he said enthusiastically.'Enormously patient'Kale, who works just with the naked eye and "the glasses given by his doctor," says that his greatest muse is Turkey's historic hub, Istanbul, which he has depicted on sugar cubes, dice and sunflower seeds."Istanbul is a brand on its own. It is a rare city which never sleeps, which straddles two continents and harbors the traces of many cultures," he said.He learned his trade by studying Ottoman artists from the past, like Nakkas Osman, nicknamed "Osman the Miniaturist", who was featured in Orhan Pamuk's famous novel My Name is Red.As it was for Osman in the 16th century, it remains painstaking work and Kale often paints for 16 to 18 hours a day and goes without sleep."First of all, you must be enormously patient. Second, you must love the work, and third, you should have no economic expectations," Kale said.That said, his work has attracted worldwide interest and his pieces have sold for thousands of dollars.Kale, who also designs jewelry, said he especially liked the way people recalled his work during mundane moments of their day.Agence France - Presse
