            <p class="style-content">
                LUXEMBOURG - The fourth annual meeting of the China-initiated Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) kicked off here on Friday, for the first time outside Asia, drawing over 1,000 AIIB officials, representatives from members and partner institutions, business leaders and experts.Under the theme "Cooperation and Connectivity," this year's annual meeting highlights stronger Asia-Europe cooperation and connectivity, digital connectivity, climate change, sustainable infrastructure and mobilizing finance for circular economy transitions.AIIB President Jin Liqun pledged at the opening ceremony that with the cooperation of its members, AIIB will become "the bank that connects Asia to the world."Research and analysis on the constraints affecting growth in developing Asia have pointed to lack of infrastructure investment as the main cause.Jin cited a converging view that developing countries should invest around eight percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) in infrastructure to drive sustainable growth."Our best analysis points to many lower and lower-middle income members needing to boost infrastructure investment by a third," he noted, adding that "a well-coordinated investment program in infrastructure and other productive sectors in low-income countries will boost growth."On global growth, the AIIB president said: "Overall, global growth is stabilizing, but protectionism and disruption of trade and cross-border investments constitute a major risk to many countries."However, Jin noted, "the complexity of our global political and economic situation should not inhibit the AIIB from investing in priority projects where its members need them most."Jin spoke highly of the bank's partnership with European shareholders, including Luxembourg, one of AIIB's first European founding members."European shareholders have prodigiously contributed to the creation of this new multilateral development bank," said Jin.He announced that the AIIB intents to list the "Euro Medium Term Note Program" on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.Luxembourg's Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna underlined that his country's AIIB membership "is a testament to Luxembourg's long-lasting commitment to multilateralism."In his view, holding the meeting in Luxembourg, a leading financial center hosting the world's second largest investment fund, "will help create synergies in mobilizing the financial resources of governments, international institutions and the private sector to achieve better connectivity between Europe and Asia."The AIIB, a multilateral development bank investing in sustainable infrastructure and other productive sectors in Asia and beyond, began operations in January 2016. It now has 97 approved members worldwide.

                    AIIB reaches milestone of 100 members
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                Bank approves applications of three African nations at meeting in EuropeJin Liqun, president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, said he wants AIIB to become the bank that connects Asia to the world as it marked a total of 100 approved memberships during the past weekend.The AIIB Board of Governors approved on Saturday the applications of three African countries — Benin, Djibouti and Rwanda — at the bank's annual meeting in Luxembourg. This would bring the total number of AIIB members to 100, including 70 whose memberships have been ratified by their parliaments."AIIB members collectively account for 78 percent of the world's population and 63 percent of global GDP. With the backing of all of our members, we are building a lean, clean and green institution that can help to support their sustainable development," Jin said.Finance Minister Liu Kun said at the meeting on Saturday that he hopes the AIIB will give play to its own advantage as a multilateral development bank to link its strategy with the development blueprints of its members, the Belt and Road Initiative and the Connecting Europe and Asia Strategy of the European Union."China, an AIIB shareholder and a country that hosts AIIB's head office, will continue to support the bank's development," Liu said.Liu suggested that AIIB come up with an overall strategy based on previous operating experiences to guide its further development, its features, new trends of global growth and the diversified requirements of members.Uzziel Ndagijimana, Rwanda's minister of finance and economic planning, called AIIB "a great bank"."We are happy to join as the 100th member. We are looking forward to not only having fruitful cooperation with the bank, but also with the member countries to promote infrastructure and promote trade and investment between Asia and Africa," he said on Saturday.The three new prospective nonregional members will officially join AIIB once they complete the required domestic processes and deposit the first capital installment with the bank.At the annual meeting, the first held outside of Asia, Luxembourg Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna praised AIIB as "arguably the most modern and international financial institution in the world"."The bank has emerged as a beacon of multilateralism while surpassing expectations of growth," he said. Luxembourg was the first European nation to join the AIIB, as the United States government was trying to lobby European countries not to join the multilateral development bank initiated by China.Gramegna said membership of European members has been beneficial for both European and Asian countries, especially given the AIIB's motto of being lean, clean and green. "Looking at the results of the past three and a half years, we can all be very pleased with what has been achieved, both in terms of financial operations and the quality of the work that has been done," he said.Since January 2016, the AIIB has provided $8.5 billion in loans to 45 projects in 18 member countries, many in renewable energy and green infrastructure. It also has received the highest credit ratings from the world's three biggest rating agencies — Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch Group. In May, the AIIB's five-year dollar bonds drew investors from dozens of countries.Jin said the bank has a good working relationship with other multilateral development banks such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. "We set the bar at the par with other multilateral development institutions and other institutions, so we can work together," he said. "We are happy to see that we are recognized as such a bank."But he also said there is no room for complacency. "We are the new kid on the block, and we have a lot to learn from our sister institutions," he said.Jin said people should take a realistic view, that it takes time to help developing countries in their transition from high-carbon to low-carbon to zero-carbon economies. "So it's really a very tough job. And we are doing our very best," he said in response to criticism that AIIB is not doing enough.The two-day annual meeting had some 30 sessions, including on climate change, debt sustainability, digital connectivity and private equity for sustainability infrastructure.The bank's next annual meeting will be held in Beijing in 2020, the AIIB Board of Governors announced on Saturday. Liu, the finance minister, was elected chairman of the fifth Board of Governors.By the end of 2018, the AIIB's total investment had reached $7.5 billion, up from $4.196 billion a year earlier, according to the AIIB's annual report released on its website.Moody's affirmed the bank's rating of Aaa with a stable outlook in March. "AIIB will maintain the health of its stand-alone credit metrics beyond its initial growth phase into the next decade," the agency said.

                    SBI bullish on Chinese market

                India's top lender seeks fresh growth opportunities to boost bilateral trade, investmentsAmid a wave of closures of various Indians banks' China operations, India's largest lender said it will not only stay committed to serving the mainland market but seek fresh growth opportunities, to boost both bilateral trade and the growing Chinese investments in Indian startups."The deepening of reforms and opening-up in China's financial services sector, and the rise of the AIIB(Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank) and the NDB (New Development Bank) are encouraging signs in China. Despite slowing economic growth, China remains a key destination for foreign banks. Prospects for bilateral trade growth are bright, so we are looking at trade finance," said Venkat Nageswar, deputy managing director in charge of international operations of the State Bank of India.SBI, which ranks 57th among the world's top 1,000 lenders, will consolidate its China operations by integrating its Tianjin operations into its Shanghai branch, which will push its 2020 business target to $1 billion from the current $700 million, said Swaminathan, CEO of the bank's China unit.SBI's digitalization drive will enable various banks in China involved in bilateral trade to make direct remittances to India. "We hope to garner at least 10 percent of the $90 billion annual transaction volume," Nageswar said. Besides, SBI is also targeting Chinese utilities such as China Gas for loan syndication services.India's annual imports from China are valued at $60 billion, and SBI will focus on trade finance activities for a business of up to $1 billion. Toward this end, it is in talks with the AIIB, the NDB, China's Exim Bank and the China Development Bank to jointly offer project finance and refinance services. Indian joint ventures in China as well as Chinese subsidiaries of Indian companies are expected to benefit, which in turn would help cement bilateral trade ties, he said.With recent and projected future GDP growth rates of 7 percent or above, India continues to shine in the global economic landscape, with a "very doable" GDP target of $5 trillion by 2024. This represents a big opportunity for Chinese overseas investments, he said.China's ICBC operates a $200 million startup investment fund in India, while Bank of China received Indian regulatory approval for its retail banking services last week. Given that Bank of China is expanding its India footprint, SBI, which is Indian's pre-eminent "financial conglomerate", will explore potential joint ventures with Chinese entities, he said.Of particular interest would be dedicated stressed asset funds that can take over floundering businesses, turn them around, and make reasonable profits by reselling them to strategic investors. It is a win-win situation for all the stakeholders. This market is currently estimated at $143 billion, which should interest Chinese investors, including banks, he said.SBI is aware of Chinese investors' tremendous interest in funding Indian startups. Given the bank's and its subsidiaries' presence across India's financial ecosystem via custodial, brokerage, advisory, legal and regulatory consulting, and capital market services, SBI is the go-to bank for Chinese investors, he said.

                    Nation to strengthen bilateral financial ties with Germany
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China will continually strengthen economic and financial relationship with Germany, to consolidate bilateral financial cooperation and jointly promote international economic governance in face of challenges, said a statement from the Ministry of Finance on Wednesday.The statement was issued before German Chancellor Angela Merkel's official visit to China from Sept 6 to 7 at the invitation of Premier Li Keqiang. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang announced the visit on Sept 2."At present, the international situation is complicated and changeable, uncertain and unstable factors are rising amid trade frictions. Protectionism is intensifying, while economic globalization and the multilateral system are facing severe challenges," said an announcement from the Ministry of Finance.Against this background, it is of great significance for China and Germany, as the major global economies, to jointly hold high-level dialogues in the financial field. The dialogues can also promote and strengthen communication and coordination of macroeconomic policies, as well as deepen practical financial cooperation between the two countries, according to the ministry.In 2014, President Xi Jinping and German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced the establishment of a comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Germany. To implement the important consensus of the two leaders, a high-level financial dialogue mechanism was established between the two countries.In January, Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He and German Vice-Chancellor and Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz successfully hosted the second dialogue in Beijing.Over the past five years, the China-Germany High Level Financial Dialogue mechanism has played an important role in promoting cooperation between the two countries in macroeconomic policy, strategic cooperation, fiscal policy and financial regulation.Under the dialogue mechanism, although China and Germany have differences in their views on global governance, strategic cooperation and financial regulation, the two sides did not fall into the trap of "conflict confrontation", but expanded cooperation on the basis of reciprocity and mutual benefit, always focusing on consensus rather than emphasizing conflicts, it said.As of today, only three foreign banks have the "B-class" licenses of lead underwriters in China's interbank bond market. The German leader said during the previous bilateral dialogue that financial institutions from Germany are expected to receive this license."The two sides agreed that China will actively consider the application of German banks in accordance with relevant domestic procedures and standards," a senior official from the Ministry of Finance told China Daily."Even China cannot immediately meet Germany's demand at that time, our explanation has won the trust and understanding of Germany," he said.China issued measures to further expand the opening up of the financial sector in July, allowing qualified foreign investment institutions to obtain the "A-class" licenses of lead underwriter, which can provide a broader service, and B-class licenses. "So the German demand is no longer a problem now, and the German institutions will receive more permission in the future," said the official.Under the dialogue, since 2014, financial institutions from the two countries have maintained communication on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), third-party market cooperation and financing cooperation of small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the ministry said.China and Germany are willing to strengthen cooperation under the framework of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and explore opportunities for third-party market cooperation, according to the announcement.The Export-Import Bank of China and Deutsche Bank will jointly provide services related to the BRI, and discuss the third-party market cooperation in the field of project financing and trade financing.The China Development Bank has implemented the second phase of special loans for SMEs in China and Germany, and provided financing support to SMEs through cooperation with DG Bank AG.China Europe International Exchange and Eurorex have set up a joint working group to initially put forward a proposal for issuing offshore A-share index derivatives, said the ministry.By the end of the first half of this year, Germany's BMW held 75 percent of the shares of Brilliance Auto, becoming the first foreign automobile manufacturer with a majority stake in a joint venture in China.German chemicals giant BASF is accelerating the building of a base in Guangdong province, with 100 percent shares and independent operation. The German Allianz (China) Insurance Holding Co Ltd will become the first newly established foreign insurance holding company in China."German enterprises have taken the lead in benefiting from China's new round of opening-up," said the ministry. "It has been proven by the facts that China and Germany have come to the forefront in bilateral financial cooperation. The commitments made by China in the dialogue are not confined to words, but to action."In the first half of this year, Sino-German trade volume reached $90.64 billion, an increase of 3.2 percent compared with the same period last year. Investment from Germany in China grew by 70.7 percent year-on-year, and investment from China in Germany rose by 11.1 percent, according to the data provided by the Ministry of Finance.
