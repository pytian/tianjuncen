                Chinese liquor brand Wang Mao has bolstered its fashionista credentials this week with the first-ever sponsorship collaboration between London Fashion Week and a Chinese spirit maker.Wang Mao, a sub-brand of well-known baijiu maker Moutai, has become an official spirit partner of London Fashion Week September 2019.Usually distilled from sorghum and wheat, baijiu contains between 40 and 60 percent alcohol by volume, and is a mainstay of special social occasions in China, from Spring Festival dinners to weddings and business banquets.Founded in 1879, Wang Mao was merged to become the State-run Moutai Distillery in the early 1950s, and the brand was relaunched in 2018 by Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd to target the 30-to 50-year-old customer group.Yuan Bin, chief executive of Wang Mao, hailed the collaboration, saying the brand takes pride in the heritage of Chinese culture while also valuing the creativity and fashion sense."London Fashion Week, from what we see, is a unique one amongst the four big international fashion weeks, because on one hand it highlights the history and tradition, but at the same time it absorbs innovative ideas and concepts, which fits in very well with our brand," Yuan said.As part of the collaboration, Wang Mao was able to promote its products at the London Fashion Week September 2019, with two cocktails being created using the liquor as their base ingredient.Gemma Juviler, commercial director at British Fashion Council, which organizes London Fashion Week, said it was a win-win partnership."What the British Fashion Council has done, with our international strategy, is really focus on China, because when we're helping designers to build and grow their business, one of the most important structures that they can think about is how to successfully enter the Chinese market," she said."Given its resonance with an international market, specifically in China, I think associating Chinese brands such as Wang Mao with the British Fashion Council and particularly London Fashion Week is a really good message for the audience back in China."Drinks columnist Douglas Blyde welcomed the partnership, saying: "It is a vote of confidence from China to the UK to invest alongside the catwalk here. With the right guidance, Wang Mao could create some amazing, memorable drinks which will be as flamboyant and distinctive as the fashion spectacles they may be enjoyed alongside."With more Chinese businesses keen to make inroads into the international arena, Wang Mao is not alone in tapping into the potential of the major fashion platforms.Since 2018, Alibaba's Tmall has held special China Day events at the last four New York Fashion Weeks, showing the best in Chinese fashion.And Chinese e-commerce giant JD has a three-year partnership with the British Fashion Council that runs until the end of 2021, to provide a channel for Chinese brands at London Fashion Week.

                    Nepal's ruling party leaders hail China's achievements, Belt and Road Initiative
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                KATHMANDU - Leaders of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) have spoken highly of the achievements which China has made over the past several decades as well as the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.Speaking at a program here Saturday, Janardan Sharma, a standing committee member of the NCP, highlighted the capabilities of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in setting up its priorities with achieving socialism topping the list over the past 70 years."China is advocating the peace, economic development and shared prosperity by launching mega initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative," he said, adding that as a neighboring country, Nepal can learn a lot from China's experience of reform and opening-up for the past 40 years.Sharma, also a former minister, said Nepal's active participation in the Belt and Road Initiative would greatly contribute to the country's socio-economic development through enhanced cross-border rail and road connectivity.Ghanshyam Bhusal, also a standing committee member of the NCP, said the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative will play a great role in strengthening international cooperation and maintaining world peace."China can shape a new world order based on humanity, peace, win-win situation, good neighborliness and shared benefits," said Bhusal.Another former minister and NCP leader Surendra Pandey said that China has become a model for those who attach great importance to China's intellectual, political and economic experience in achieving socialism.The Belt and Road Initiative, proposed by China in 2013, comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, aiming at building a trade, investment and infrastructure network connecting Asia with other parts of the world along the ancient Silk Road trade routes and beyond.More than 150 countries and international organizations have signed Belt and Road Initiative cooperation documents with China.
