                FAA chief to personally test new software for MAX 737
            </p>
            <p>
                  The recently appointed head of the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) plans to climb into a flight simulator to test software updates for the Boeing 737 MAX jet's anti-stall system when he visits the company in Seattle this week, a move one analyst called "theater".Stephen Dickson, named to head the regulatory agency in August, said he plans to test the MAX's newly configured software and stressed that there is no schedule for getting the grounded jetliner back in the air."I can guarantee you that the airplane will not be flying again until I'm satisfied that it is the safest plane out there," Dickson, a former US Air Force and commercial pilot qualified to fly the Boeing 737, told CNBC. "I can tell you that I will not allow this airplane to fly unless I would fly it myself and put my own family on it."Robert Mann, president of R.W. Mann & Co, an aviation consulting firm in Port Washington, New York, said Dickson's decision is both an attempt to burnish the FAA's image and to gain hands-on experience with the new software."It's theater," he told China Daily. "He's the lead at FAA and hopes to maintain its primacy in recertifying the MAX. His action is understandable, but at the margins it's theater. Dickson has more experience in this area than his predecessor, and therefore it's understandable that he wants to get hands-on experience."James Hall, former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board and now managing partner of Hall & Associates in Washington, praised Dickson's decision to personally test the new software."I think it's the responsible thing to do," Hall told China Daily. "He's used simulators in the past and I hope he'll have some experts with him to evaluate the accuracy of the simulator. He's focusing on what he wants to accomplish for the American people, but life is public relations."Patrick Ky of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency has said the FAA's worldwide reputation is in a "very difficult situation", and international regulators will reach their own conclusions about the safety of the MAX independently of the FAA."It's likely that international authorities will want a second — or third — opinion," he told CNN. "And (that) was not the case one year ago."China was the first to ground MAX jets last March after crashes in Oct 29, 2018, in Indonesia and March 10 in Ethiopia killed 346 passengers and crew.Investigators have focused on the MAX's anti-stall device that may have erroneously pointed the nose of the planes down to gain speed to avoid a midair stall and into a fatal plunge.It's unclear what additional training the pilots will receive before the MAX jet is recertified for commercial service. Some regulatory agencies may demand flight simulator training, but others may require only a laptop refresher course.Requiring simulator training probably would delay the plane's recertification in some nations because of the time needed to schedule pilots on the device, analysts said.Regulators worldwide therefore may recertify MAX jets for commercial service at different times, creating a staggered return of the plane. In the past, overseas regulators have generally followed the lead of the FAA and accepted its findings, but that changed after the fatal crashes.Boeing said it hopes to have MAX jets back in the air by the fourth quarter of the year, but the FAA has long stressed that there is no timetable for recertification.Southwest Airlines, which operates more MAX flights than any other US airline, previously canceled about 180 flights through Jan 5. American Airlines and United Airlines have canceled MAX flights into December.Boeing said it plans to conduct a recertification flight this month but has not set a date. The manufacturer has announced plans to reorganize its engineering department so that top officials, including the CEO, receive faster feedback about potential safety concerns. The company's board of directors has not yet approved the plan.Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Oregon and chairman of the House Transportation Committee, invited Boeing officials to testify at a House hearing Oct 30.

                Regulators said aware of risk of 2nd Boeing 737 Max crash
            </a>
            <p>
                Federal regulators realized the likelihood of a second crash involving Boeing's 737 Max 8 was high but thought telling pilots of the hazard posed by the plane's anti-stall system and how to respond to it would be sufficient to ensure the aircraft's safe operation, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. The initial review by the US Federal Aviation Administration of the Lion Air crash on Oct 29, 2018, concluded that it would not "take much" for a similar malfunction to cause another crash, the newspaper said, citing an unnamed FAA official familiar with the issue and others briefed on the matter. The Indonesian jet went down in the Java Sea, killing all 189 passengers and crew. The crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max 8 near Addis Ababa on March 10 killed all 157 on board.

                Seats on next MAX flights reportedly for sale
            </a>
            <p>
                Major airlines reportedly are selling seats on future Boeing 737 MAX flights even as the planes remain grounded worldwide, but US carriers said they have taken no such action and hope to return the aircraft to service later this year.The London Times reported Sunday that airlines have scheduled about 32,600 flights using MAX jets by the end of year, an apparent bet the planes will be returned to service quickly despite lack of approval from regulators in the US, Europe and Asia.Major US airlines discounted the report."We have no current plans to operate MAX revenue flights for the remainder of 2019," Southwest Airlines said in a statement. "We are in the process of removing all MAX flying through January 5, 2020, and notifying affected customers to offer rebooking options."American Airlines said it has canceled MAX flights through Nov 2 and hasn't yet made an announcement about rebooking canceled flights. The airline said it "remains confident" MAX jets will be recertified for commercial service this year.United Airlines said it has canceled MAX flights through at least Nov 3. In July, the airline said it planned to buy 19 used Boeing 737-700 jets to fill the gap created by the worldwide grounding of MAX aircraft.Boeing said it has completed the software update for MCAS and is working with the FAA to get the plane back in the air.In June, the US Federal Aviation Administration said there is no "prescribed timeline" for returning MAX jets to commercial service and noted it "will lift the aircraft's prohibition order when we deem it is safe to do so"."Our best current estimate is a return to service of the MAX that begins early in the fourth quarter," Boeing said in a statement. "Timing on return to service will be driven by the FAA and global regulators."Analysts estimate it would take at least 45 days to return the grounded aircraft to commercial services after securing regulatory approval.Boeing MAX jets were grounded worldwide following crashes March 10 in Ethiopia and Oct 20, 2018, in Indonesia that killed a total of 346 passengers and crew.

                Certification flights for Max may be in October
            </a>
            <p>
                Certification flights for the Boeing 737 Max are likely to be conducted in October following approval of the software update to the plane's anti-stall device implicated in two fatal crashes, according to news reports. But the US Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, said there is no schedule to return Max jets to service and declined to comment on the news reports. "The certification flights are part of the return to service, so we aren't going to speculate on when they will occur," Lynn Lunsford, a spokeswoman for the FAA, told China Daily. Boeing also declined to comment on the scheduling of the certification flights for the updated Max jet. Peter Pedraza, a spokesman for Boeing, told China Daily: "There has been no change to our best estimate of a return to service in the early fourth quarter, and progress in the software continues to support that time frame." As for test flights, Bloomberg, citing "people briefed on the matter", said conducting them in October would be consistent with Boeing's plan to return Max jets to service by the fourth quarter. The Seattle Times reported that the FAA plans to issue standards for pilot training in September. If the Max is cleared to return to service, the newspaper said Boeing plans to increase production to 52 planes a month by February 2020 and to 57 planes a month by next summer. Boeing cut production to 42 planes a month after the worldwide grounding in March. Boeing and the FAA have been criticized since fatal Max crashes in Indonesia in October and Ethiopia on March 10. A total of 346 passengers and crew were killed. The FAA was the last regulator to ground the 737 Max. China's regulators were the first. American Airlines said it has canceled Max flights through Nov 2 and will follow FAA directives. Analysts estimate it will take at least 45 days to return the grounded aircraft to service after receiving regulatory approval. "According to Boeing, they will submit their final certification package to the FAA in September," American Airlines told China Daily. "Once submitted, the FAA will determine when the Max returns to service in collaboration with other global regulators." scottreeves@chinadailyusa.com (China Daily Global 08/28/2019 page6)

                MAX jet return could vary by region
            </a>
            <p>
                Regulators worldwide may recertify the Boeing 737 MAX jet for commercial service at different times, creating a staggered return of the plane and underscoring a lack of trust in the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), an industry expert said.In the past, overseas regulators have generally followed the lead of the FAA and accepted its findings, but that may change after crashes of MAX jets in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed a total of 346 passengers and crew.Investigators have focused on the MAX's anti-stall device that may have erroneously pointed the nose of the planes down to avoid a mid-air stall and into a fatal plunge."The FAA and its oversight by Congress resulted in destroying the reputation built on half a century of certification expertise," James Hall, managing partner of Hall and Associates in Washington and former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, told China Daily. "When the FAA failed to ground the aircraft after the first accident or immediately after the second — and everyone in aviation knew that had either accident happened in the US, the plane would have been grounded immediately — the FAA forfeited its leadership on aviation issues."China was the first to ground MAX jets. The US grounded the plane only after regulatory agencies around the world had done so.Hall has been critical of the FAA's use of manufacturer's employees as part of the process to declare a plane safe. In an opinion article published in The New York Times, he called it a "worrying move toward industry self-certification".Patrick Ky of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said the FAA's worldwide reputation is in a "very difficult situation"."It's likely that international authorities will want a second — or third — opinion," he told CNN. "And (that) was not the case one year ago. I think that's going to be a very strong change in the overall worldwide hierarchy or relationship between the different authorities."Some analysts said technological innovation in contemporary planes has outstripped the ability of regulators to keep up with advancements. They note that the FAA's practice of relying on industry insiders is no different from the US Food and Drug Administration's reliance on experts from the companies it regulates or state bar associations that certify attorneys and take disciplinary action when needed."I think it's just concern on the part of some regulatory agencies that withdrew their airworthiness certificates before the FAA did," Robert Mann, president of RW Mann and Co in Port Washington, New York, told China Daily."It shows their comfort level is different from the FAA's comfort level. I don't see it as anything other than having a different point of view on how the aircraft is tested for recertification and how pilot training ought to be handled. For example, should regulators require use of flight simulators or is computer training enough?"The FAA said review of the software update continues for the MAX jet's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), the anti-stall system implicated in the two crashes."The FAA has a transparent and collaborative relationship with other civil aviation authorities as we continue our review of changes to software on the Boeing 737 MAX," the agency said in a statement. "Our first priority is safety, and we have set no time frame for when the work will be completed."In a statement given to China Daily on Tuesday, Boeing said it's working "diligently with the FAA and global regulators to support the safe return to service of the MAX".Boeing believes the MAX will be certified to return to commercial service in the fourth quarter.

                Airplane market rapidly expands in China
            </a>
            <p>
                Chinese carriers will need 8,090 new airplanes in the next 20 years worth nearly $1.3 trillion, to meet rapidly growing airplane passenger traffic in the country, which is expected to grow by 6 percent annually, US aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co said in Beijing on Tuesday.In the next two decades, China, Boeing's largest market, will need 5,960 new single-aisle airplanes, representing 74 percent of total new deliveries. Demand for wide-body airplanes is 1,780, which will triple the country's current fleet size. In addition, China will need a significant number of regional aircraft and cargo aircraft."China is one of the world's most dynamic and fastest growing markets," said Randy Tinseth, vice president of Commercial Marketing at Boeing."An expanding middle class, significant investment in infrastructure, and advanced technologies will continue to drive tremendous demand for air travel," he said.Meanwhile, Tinseth said the globally-grounded troubled B737 MAX aircraft is expected to receive approval to resume flying by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the early fourth quarter, and the final decision will depend on the authority. Regulators of each country will make their own decisions on when to resume the plane's commercial services.
