                Rwanda advises citizens against travel to Ebola-hit areas in DRC
            </p>
            <p>
                KIGALI - All travels to Ebola-hit areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) should be avoided due to the Ebola outbreak in the country, Rwandan Health Minister Diane Gashumba said Thursday."Unessential travels to eastern DRC, including cross-border trade should be highly avoided. Rwandans should think twice before crossing to DRC just to buy or sell a few pair of shoes or a few food stuff items," said Gashumba while addressing a press conference in Rwandan capital Kigali.She reiterated that Rwanda's border with DRC remains open, adding that the government would issue a statement in case of a temporary closure at the border.Traffic at the border slowed down on Thursday morning as measures were put in place to reinforce screening procedures and public safety at entry points, she said.The minister also cautioned against illegal crossings from or to DRC.She emphasized the need of seeking immediate medical advice when falling ill during or immediately after traveling to DRC.The presidency's office of DRC said in a statement earlier on Thursday that Rwanda has closed its border with its western neighbor after a man died of Ebola in the eastern DRC city of Goma, which borders Rwanda to the east.The man, in his 40s, has tested positive for the deadly virus and died on Wednesday in the populous city of Goma. He was the second confirmed Ebola case in the city.The DRC health authorities announced late Wednesday night the confirmation of a third case in Goma.This week marked one year since the start of the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the DRC that has already killed more than 1,700 people, making it the second worst Ebola outbreak in history.Rwanda has a detailed National Preparedness Plan for Ebola in place and has trained health workers in early detection and response, educated communities about Ebola, vaccinated health workers in high-risk areas, equipped health facilities, and continues to conduct simulation exercises to maintain a high level of readiness.Screening for Ebola symptoms at points of entry has been ongoing since the beginning of the outbreak in DRC, and has been reinforced since the confirmation of a case in Goma.An Ebola Treatment Center was put in place in the country and 23 isolation units are being prepared in hospitals in 15 priority districts. Ebola response simulation exercises are on a regular basis within the community, borders, airport and treatment center to test Rwanda's preparedness in response to a case, which includes emergency operations center activation, active surveillance, case management and laboratory testing.About 3,000 health workers in high-risk areas have been vaccinated as a preventive measure, and over 23,000 people including doctors, nurses, hospital staff, community health workers, religious leaders, Red Cross volunteers and security organs have been trained.

                Rwanda closes border with Congo over Ebola
            </a>
            <p>
                KINSHASA — A Rwandan official says his country has closed its border with Congo because of the deadly Ebola outbreak.The state minister for foreign affairs Olivier Nduhungirehe confirmed the border closure to The Associated Press on Thursday.The closure comes after a man died of Ebola in Congo's major city of Goma, which is on the Rwandan border. He was the second confirmed Ebola case in Goma.The World Health Organization, which declared this yearlong Ebola outbreak a global health emergency last month, has recommended against travel restrictions.It also says the risk of regional spread is "very high."A Congolese official says a person who had contact with the second confirmed Ebola case in the city of Goma is at an Ebola treatment center after showing signs of the disease.If this suspected case is confirmed, it could be the first transmission of Ebola in this yearlong outbreak inside Goma, a city of more than 2 million people on the Rwandan border.Witnesses say border crossings with Rwanda near the city now appear to be closed.AP

                Mozambique peace agreement signed, paves way for elections
            </a>
            <p>
                The government of Mozambique and the Mozambican National Resistance, the armed opposition group known as Renamo, on Tuesday signed a peace agreement ending six years of war.The deal was signed between Filipe Nyusi, the president of Mozambique and Ossufo Momade, the leader of Renamo in Maputo's Peace Square. The ceremony was witnessed by former presidents and several African leaders.The pact, a result of three years of negotiations, is expected to end hostilities between the Mozambican Defense and Security Forces and Renamo, which formerly waged a civil war from 1975 to 1992.Signed two months ahead of the national and provincial elections, the agreement allows Renamo to participate in the provincial election scheduled for Oct 15.It also includes constitutional changes and disarmament of more than 5,000 Renamo rebels, some of whom will be integrated into the army or police."With this agreement we are saying that we may disagree, but we always use dialogue to settle our differences. Never again should election results dictate the state of peace in Mozambique," Nyusi said, according to a report from Agence France-Presse.Moussa Faki Mahamat, the chairman of the African Union Commission, welcomed the signing of the peace agreement, which he termed as a historic milestone toward silencing the guns in the country.Mahamat reiterated the AU's commitment to support the peace process and the government's efforts toward development. "We look forward to deploying election observers to monitor and generally support the electoral process in the country in October," he said.Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa, said the pact will pave way for peaceful election in the country."The Peace Accord and visit at the peace deal signing, presents an opportunity for South Africa to cement its support for peace and reconciliation in Mozambique," he said.Paul Kagame, the president of Rwanda, said the peace deal brings promise for an end to decades of conflicts and uncertainty as well as renewal of national unity and cohesion."Even if previous efforts have not succeeded, it's always never a waste of time, to give a shot at peace, one more time. These achievements matter to all of us in Africa and show that we can find solutions to our problems, no matter how protracted and difficult," he said.Kagame said dialogue and inclusion cannot be imposed from anywhere else and once consensus is reached, it can only be sustained from within.Mozambique has deposits of coal, graphite, iron ore, titanium, apatite, marble, bentonite, bauxite, kaolin, copper, gold, rubies, and tantalum. The country's mineral potential is largely untapped.Renamo first signed a peace agreement with the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique. or Frelimo, in 1992. It ended the civil war that broke in 1975 after Mozambique gained independence from Portugal. More than 1 million people died in the ensuing war. Renamo participated in multiparty elections in 1994.However, Renamo abandoned the peace treaty in October 2013 after the government troops attacked its base, where its decadeslong leader, Afonso Dhlakama, was staying. A truce was signed in late 2016, but the violence has erupted ever since.
