                Following President Xi Jinping's visit to Erhai Lake in 2015, local officials and residents teamed up to tackle pollution and restore the ecosystem at the Yunnan beauty spot, Fang Aiqing reports.Editor's Note: As the People's Republic of China prepares to celebrate its 70th anniversary on Oct 1, China Daily is featuring a series of articles about regions that President Xi Jinping visited in recent years. They explore what has happened since.Not all human effort yields an immediate effect, and when it comes to environmental protection, it's clear that for any endeavor to succeed, there must be a communal will to persevere.In the case of the Dali Bai autonomous prefecture, where tourism income reached 79.5 billion yuan ($11.1 billion) last year, the protection of Erhai Lake and its poetic setting against the backdrop of Cangshan Mountain in Yunnan province, has become a focus for everyone living in the area since 2015.During his visit to the prefecture in January that year, President Xi Jinping highlighted the importance of protecting Erhai Lake, which marked a key turning point in the salvage battle to improve water quality there.Erhai Lake is the seventh-largest freshwater lake in China, and the main source of domestic water for locals in the region.Yet for years mass tourism, population growth, agricultural pollution and the direct discharge of domestic sewage into the lake had resulted in a significant deterioration in water quality.Two massive outbreaks of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) occurred separately in 1996 and 2003, causing water visibility to drop to as low as around 1 meter.Since President Xi's visit in 2015, local government officials, entrepreneurs and ordinary residents rallied behind efforts to reduce pollution, restore the ecosystem, improve monitoring methods, and rebuild eco-friendly, value-added agricultural and tourism industries.

                The city has come a long way since 1949 Lin Xiaoying first fell in love with Kenya in the late 1980s when the movie Out of Africa left her with a deep impression of the East African nation. However, the first personal connection between Lin and the country came decades later when she accompanied the then deputy prime minister of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta, to the opening of the Shanghai Expo in 2010. Lin, a researcher at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, had another Kenyan encounter last year at the China International Import Expo in Shanghai, the world's first import-themed national-level expo. During the event, which attracted more than 3,600 exhibitors from 172 countries and regions, the city received 168 groups at deputy minister level in a week. To cater to thousands of foreign guests, Shanghai recruited specialists and more than 5,000 volunteers from higher education institutes. Lin worked as a communications officer responsible for coordination with the Kenyan delegation. "It was a challenge in view of the number of events being held within a very short period of time," she said. But the city made the expo a success by calling on its decades of experience in hosting major international events and receiving important foreign guests, Lin added. With a variety of events being held to commemorate Shanghai's Liberation Day, when the People's Liberation Army entered the city on May 27, 1949, many people have been recalling Shanghai's contributions to China's internationalization. The city has been at the forefront of this. Over the past seven decades, it has witnessed numerous historic moments in the nation's international relationships - from Sino-Soviet friendship in the 1950s to establishing diplomatic ties with France in 1964, the first major Western country with which it formed such a relationship. Shanghai also witnessed the signing of the Joint Communique of the United States of America and the People's Republic of China in 1972. Known as the Shanghai Communique, it is regarded as the key diplomatic document that led to the normalization of relations between the two countries. Since China adopted the reform and opening-up policy in 1978, Shanghai - the showcase for the country's economic success - has continued to experience an increasing number of visits by foreign leaders. It has become a major city for the country to host international events, such as the 2001 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Economic Leaders' Meeting, the 2010 World Expo and the China International Import Expo last year. Those who have experienced hosting the events, including seasoned diplomats, specialists and university student volunteers, share one thing in common to ensure the reception of foreign guests is a success - attention to detail.  Many of them cite former premier Zhou Enlai, known for his diplomatic charisma and achievements, as saying, "There is no petite (small) matter when it comes to foreign affairs." Le Jin'gen, a retired official with the Shanghai Foreign Affairs Office, took part in the reception for then US President Richard Nixon during his trip to Shanghai on Feb 27 and 28, 1972. A special working group comprising more than 12 teams was formed to prepare for Nixon's visit, Le said. The work took three months. Even after 47 years, Le, now 89, can still recall the event vividly because the group spent so much time considering every detail for the reception. These ranged from restoring the city's "appearance" by removing various slogans as the country was in the middle of the "cultural revolution" (1966-76) to educating the public to understand the meaning of the visit, and deciding on the choice of dishes. "It was two days before the Lantern Festival when the American delegation arrived, so we treated them to the traditional Chinese snack tangyuan (glutinous rice balls)," Le said. "Nixon had one bowl of tangyuan with meat stuffing, and another one stuffed with sweet red beans." Le also supervised printing of the Shanghai Communique. He recalled that he and another official from Ministry of Foreign Affairs brought the original copy to the printing house on Kangping Road and proofread it 10 times before printing 100 copies. "We couldn't risk there being a single typographical error, not even a punctuation mark," he said. The Shanghai World Expo, which attracted more than 73 million visitors from May 1 through Oct 31, 2010, was the biggest international event the city had hosted before last year's China International Import Expo. A record 189 countries and regions took part in the 2010 event along with 60 cities, a range of corporations and groups. For the occasion, the city called on its population of more than 20 million to take part in various volunteer work to ensure the expo was a success. Shanghai's rich resources in higher education and cross-cultural talent gave it an advantage, experts said. The city, which is considered one of the country's most cosmopolitan municipalities, is home to more than 50,000 multinational companies. More than 210,000 expatriates from 167 countries and regions live and work in Shanghai, the largest number among Chinese cities and accounting for nearly 25 percent of the national total. Their experience served as a good reference point for the city to host the 2018 expo, according to Zhang Xiaosong, the director general of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government.Tang Xinning, a postgraduate from Fudan University in Shanghai and a volunteer for the Indonesian delegation during the import expo, said she and many of her classmates took part in the training and organizational work nearly two months before the event opened. The preparatory group set clear goals for its work: to ensure the foreign guests arrived and departed smoothly; had convenient transportation arrangements during the expo; comfortable accommodations; and reliable catering. Each volunteer was given a guideline for their duties during the expo, including how they should greet foreign guests and how to act in cases of emergency. "In the few days before the delegates arrived, messages started pouring in by phone, email, fax and WeChat, and we did a lot of work in collecting various information and summarizing it to submit to volunteer teams," Tang said. "It required great attention to detail and created a lot of pressure. Because the delegations came from different countries and had different cultures and considerations, to respect, understand and communicate with them was not a simple matter of ethics, but required down-to-earth work." Xu Tingfang, a doctoral student at Shanghai International Studies University who also worked at last year's import expo as a volunteer, liaised with journalists from Croatia during the event. Because the journalists had many special interview requests and a tight schedule, Xu said she was always pushing them from one place to another, which won her the nickname of "nervous Chinese woman" among the journalists. "I told them that it was not only me, but the whole city that was devoting every effort to the event and we wanted to take good care of them," Xu said. "Then the journalists stopped joking about me and expressed their gratitude, and in the following days, they became more cooperative." Lin, a seasoned official in receiving foreign guests, said each experience is memorable. "The 2010 world expo is a fond memory for me," Lin said. "I was also lucky to serve a Kenyan delegation again at the 2018 expo." During the delegation's three-day stay, Lin acted as a bridge between delegates and workers at the hotel, drivers, security guards and expo organizers. "Those were three tough and unforgettable days for me," she said. "But I felt happy to make a group of Kenyan friends. They were passionate, sincere, optimistic and always smiling." xingyi@chinadaily.com.cn   Michaelle Jean, the then governor general of Canada, visits the Shanghai World Expo in 2010.Gao Erqiang/china Daily   An Australian booth at the China International Import Expo last year.Gao Erqiang/china Daily(China Daily Global 05/27/2019 page1)

                Horgos was a remote outpost which 'the camels passed by' until President Xi's blueprint was turned into a realityEditor's note: As the People's Republic of China prepares to celebrate its 70th anniversary on Oct 1, China Daily is featuring a series of stories on the role regions have played in the country's development and where they are today.The Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, which covers one-sixth of China's territory and borders eight countries, was a key link on the ancient Silk Road. Many ancient kingdoms thrived because of the famous trade route connecting China, Central Asia and Europe.Nowadays, the wealth generated by the Silk Road is being replicated by the Belt and Road Initiative, which is bringing financial rewards to workers and businesses along its routes.The dramatic transformation of the land port of Horgos, Ili Kazak autonomous prefecture, which has grown out of the Gobi Desert in only five years, is one of the great success stories of the BRI.Yu Chengzhong, CEO of Jinyi International Trade which exports fruit and vegetables from China to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Russia, has reaped the rewards of the new Silk Road. He is known locally as the "fruit king"."The fruit sourced from Ili can arrive at the market in Almaty, Kazakhstan, via Horgos within six and a half hours. This is the perfect example of how the initiative has taken effect," he said.Yu first heard about Horgos, which is 300 kilometers from Almaty, when he was wholesaling fruit to Kazakh buyers at a market in Yining in 1999. He then formulated the idea of relocating his business to the border town.In Mongolian, Horgos means "Where the camel train passes" and in Kazak it translates to "the land of wealth".Yu said his first impression of Horgos when he arrived in 2000 was of an underdeveloped outpost in the middle of the desert. "Besides a few one-story buildings and small shops, there was nothing but Gobi Desert in Horgos, which was only a land port," he recalled.

                    After LSE's sharp rebuff, HKEX begins investor charm
                </p>

                LONDON - Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing is embarking on a three-week charm offensive with London Stock Exchange investors as the Asian trading house tries to salvage its proposed $39 billion takeover offer.LSE's board is refusing to engage with HKEX after emphatically rejecting its approach on Friday. The LSE described HKEX's offer as fundamentally flawed, saying it would not meet its strategic objectives and came with a high risk of being blocked by regulators.LSE has said it wants to stick with its plan of buying data and trading company Refinitiv for $27 billion.But HKEX has vowed to press on, and has set up meetings with a series of LSE's top investors over the next few weeks, according to two people familiar with the matter, raising the chances that it could make a hostile offer.One top-25 investor told Reuters they had a meeting booked with HKEX later this month and that there could be a hostile approach. Others said they were keen to hear more rather than dismissing the deal immediately in favor of the Refinitiv tie-up."We would expect there to be some synergy (in the HKEX deal) both in terms of corporate overheads and technology," said James Bevan, chief investment officer at CCLA. He added that while he was broadly supportive of the Refinitiv deal, he had some concerns about the data firm's growth strategy.HKEX has until Oct 9 to make a firm offer or walk away.HKEX declined to comment on the deal beyond its statement on Friday that it would continue to engage with LSE shareholders and that its offer was in their best interests.LSE did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday.REGULATORY RISKA source close to HKEX said the Asian trading house was confident some LSE investors were interested in their offer and that it had a chance of success. They pointed out that around 15 of the top 20 LSE shareholders also had stakes in HKEX.But the past decade has seen a series of attempts at cross-border exchange deals fail, thwarted by regulators and politicians even when both companies have favored the deal.HKEX says it has had "constructive" initial discussions with regulators and policymakers. However, regulatory sources in Britain and Italy - where LSE owns Borsa Italiana - said they had yet to hold substantive talks with HKEX on the deal.HKEX will be counting on its lead banker - Moelis's Caroline Silver - to help it pull off what would be a major coup if it succeeds.One of the most prominent exchange bankers, Silver worked on LSE's takeover of Borsa Italiana in 2007 when at Morgan Stanley, and represented London Metal Exchange when HKEX bought it in 2012."Her modus is quite simple: she knows everybody in the exchange and financial infrastructure world, she understands the markets ... and she runs a very disciplined process," said Martin Abbott, London Metal Exchange's former chief executive.Reuters
