                'Hero and hustler' Maradona in Cannes spotlight
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                In-depth portrait of Argentine superstar includes rare footage, new interviewsPARIS - Diego Maradona is sure to cause a stir when he turns up at this week's Cannes film festival for a new documentary about his jaw-dropping life by the Oscar-winning maker of Amy.It is only one of a wave of new works about the flawed Argentine soccer genius that include a just-wrapped Amazon biopic series that chronicles every step of his dramatic rise and fall.The poster for Asif Kapadia's striking documentary Diego Maradona also pulls no punches, calling him both hero and a "hustler".Yet Maradona will still walk the Cannes red carpet with the man who won plaudits and prizes for his insight into the life and tragic death of singer Amy Winehouse.Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bono and Iggy Pop will climb the same carpet during the festival, which starts on Tuesday, but few if any of them can draw the crowds or stir the passions as the short man born in a Buenos Aires slum.It is this complex yet unshakable adoration, forged in Maradona's frequent flirtations with death, that drew Kapadia to his story.After his acclaimed portrait of Brazilian Formula One ace Ayrton Senna, who lost his duel with death at 34 as he was leading the San Marino Grand Prix, the filmmaker said he had to steel himself to tackle another sporting hero who lived life on the edge.Despite swearing never to make another sports film after Senna, Kapadia caved in when he discovered a cache of footage from Maradona's mythic period playing for Napoli.Partying with the Camorra "It was infamous," he told a documentary conference in Copenhagen earlier this year, with some sequences showing the player partying with dons from the Camorra, the Neopolitan mafia.The footage was meant to go into a 1991 documentary that was never produced."We managed to get our hands on those films and thought, 'Diego is really interesting and his journey is incredible.' What he gets up to, and what happens to him, has much wider themes," Kapadia said.Maradona also agreed to talk, sitting down for three long interviews "because he liked Senna. That was one of the reasons we were able to get through the door," said the producer.Kapadia, who has invented his own genre of "true fiction" documentaries, concentrates on Maradona's Naples years, the most operatic part of his career.

                    Maradona hits out at Argentina 'horror film'

            <p class="style-content">
                MEXICO CITY -- Diego Maradona says Argentina's current squad of players are undeserving of wearing the Albiceleste shirt, likening the team's 3-1 loss to Venezuela on Friday to a "horror" film."It hurts me because I feel Argentinian to the core but compared to past generations that had players like [Oscar] Ruggeri, [Gabriel] Batistuta, [Claudio] Caniggia... the current players don't deserve to wear the shirt," Maradona, who is now the head coach of Mexican second-tier club Dorados, told reporters.The 58-year-old added: "I prefer not to watch horror films but I don't know how the inept bunch who are in charge of Argentina thought they were going to beat Venezuela."Argentina's defeat to Venezuela in Madrid came despite the return of talisman Lionel Messi to international football following a self-imposed break lasting almost eight months.The Barcelona forward will miss the Albiceleste's next friendly against Morocco in Tangier on Tuesday because of a groin problem.

                    French Open: Federer, Nadal sweep into quarters, Wawrinka wins epic over Tsitsipas
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                PARIS - Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal discovered an easy path into the men's singles quarterfinals, but Stan Wawrinka battled through a five-hour five-setter to knock Greek promise Stefanos Tsitsipas out of the French Open here on Sunday.Federer reached his 12th quarterfinal at the tournament with a 6-2, 6-3, 6-3 win over Argentina's Leonardo Mayer, also becoming the oldest man to reach the quarterfinals at a Grand Slam since Jimmy Connors at the 1991 US Open."Big serving, windy, it was a tough condition. We didn't have many baseline rallies. Either one was always pressing and the other guy was defending," Federer commented.Nadal, bidding to win a record-extending 12th French Open title, swept another Argentinian Juan Ignacio Londero 6-2, 6-3, 6-3."It's a very difficult day. Very windy out there. So it's not easy to find the feelings. But with that condition, I think I did a lot of things well," said Nadal. "He's good and very intense. Good shots from the baseline. Very aggressive."Nadal will next face Japanese No. 7 seed Kei Nishikori or Frenchman Benoit Paire, whose duel had to be suspended due to darkness.Federer and Nadal are just one match away from their 39th career head-to-head in semifinals.But prior to that, Federer had to eliminate in-form Wawrinka, who registered an epic victory of 7-6 (6), 5-7, 6-4, 3-6, 8-6 over Tsitsipas in five hours and nine minutes, concluded by his backhand on the baseline and was called "in" by the umpire afterwards."Today we saw only one centimeter can change the winner," Wawrinka admitted."He would have deserved as much as me to win the match today. It's for sure a tough loss for him, but it was something that was a big battle. I'm happy with everything that I have done today, the way I was fighting and staying with him, even if I was tired, the way I started to play a little bit more aggressive," he added.Wawrinka finished 16 aces and 62 winners, also conceding 55 unforced errors in this topsy-turvy battle. The sixth-seeded Tsitsipas recorded 61 winners and 48 unforced errors."I've never experienced something like this in my life. I feel very disappointed at the end. Long time since I cried after a match, so emotionally it wasn't easy to handle. I will try to learn from it as much as I can," the 20-year-old Greek noted.In the women's singles, Petra Martic advanced to her career first Grand Slam quarterfinals by overcoming Estonian veteran Kaia Kanepi 5-7, 6-2, 6-4.Her next opponent will be Marketa Vondrousova from the Czech Republic, as the latter eased past Anastasija Sevastova 6-2, 6-0.The other quarterfinal in the bottom half will be played between No. 26 seed Johanna Konta and seventh-seeded Sloane Stephens.It was a day to celebrate for Chinese players in doubles, as Zhang Shuai partnered Australian John Peers to sail through mixed doubles second round.

                    Argentina's first World Cup point could prove priceless
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                PARIS - At the final whistle of their Women's World Cup opener on Monday, Argentina's players dropped to their knees as if they'd won the entire tournament.They didn't even win the game.But for the first time ever, they didn't lose, either.Argentina played to a 0-0 draw against 2011 champion and 2015 runner-up Japan to earn its first ever point at a World Cup. Argentina lost its previous six World Cup matches in 2003 and 2007 when it was outscored 33-2 in the process, and missed the 2011 and 2015 tournaments.For a nation that loves the game and worships its often successful men's team, the draw against Japan can be as good as a win. "I think we can really inspire people a lot," said playmaker Estefania Banini. "We can also start a new process."Argentina wants far more than points at the World Cup. The bigger goal is to touch more hearts and minds back home."For women's football in Argentina it is great that we are starting to flourish," coach Carlos Borrello said. "We are starting on our way and just starting to face up to these powerful forces in football."Borrello said he hopes for a push for equality between the men's and women's games - and across Argentine society as a whole."We have started getting support now from the Argentinian football federation for the team. It's true that results help a lot, and this will definitely help and reinforce all the work," he said."It will help us to continue on the great path. We have to also strengthen the grassroots of our game."Things are changing in Argentina.Previous concerns about a lack of uniforms and inadequate training conditions have been addressed, two years after players went on strike because stipends went unpaid.A movement for equality pushed the country's soccer association into giving professional status to the national women's league. This coincided with the country's feminist movement taking to the streets with marches against violence and inequality.Both national teams are in action this month - and maybe next month if they go far - with the men in Brazil at the Copa America.Before their respective departures, the two teams met.Sharing a table were two No 10's - women's captain Banini and five-time Golden Ball winner Lionel Messi, among the all-time greats of the game."We were together with Messi and the whole team, the men's and the women's teams," Borrello said. "We had a meal together before we left and were able to exchange together."The men's team has not won the World Cup since 1986 - its second victory - and won the last of its 14 Copa America titles in 1993.Hence the understandable relief at holding 2011 champion Japan, evident as players mobbed goalkeeper Vanina Correa.The 28-year-old Banini, who plays club soccer with Spanish side Levante, hopes this is just the start."We can become a national team that aspires to so much more," said Banini, who was voted player of the match against Japan."This point is really important for us. I think we're able to reflect upon what Argentina is and what it means to us as a team,"Argentina on Friday faces England, which labored to a 2-1 win over Scotland in its Group D opener, while Japan will face the Scots.Japan coach Asako Takakura made it clear to her players how disappointed she was with Monday's performance."We never look to play defensive football but in the first half we were very cautious," said Takakura."We were not good enough to break down Argentina's defense today."The areas that have to be changed will be."Associated Press

                    Film bridges gap between Chinese and Argentines
                </p>
            </a>

                Have you ever seen an Argentine supermarket on the streets in China? If the answer is no, you may be surprised to know that in Argentina, a Latin American country thousands of miles away from China, Chinese supermarkets abound.There are about 11,000 supermarkets in Argentina belonging to Chinese families and nine million out of the country's total population of 43 million shop there daily, Diego Ramiro Guelar, Argentine ambassador to China, said in an interview with China Daily website.Now you might be wondering why are there so many Chinese supermarkets in Argentina? When did those Chinese emigrate there? Which part of China are those immigrants originally from? Above all, how did those immigrants feel in the new country?From Here to China, an Argentine drama comedy directed by Federico Marcello, may help satisfy your curiosity and offer answers to your questions through quite an atypical way.Inspired by his observation that most of Chinese immigrants in Argentina are engaged in the retail trade, Marcello interviewed nearly 400 Chinese supermarket owners before he made up his mind to tell a story about the Chinese community, a reticent ethnic group that is often ignored or even misunderstood in his country.However, instead of directly bringing those Chinese immigrants into focus in his film, the director blazed a trail by telling a story of an Argentine man Facundo who travelled to Xiamen, East China's Fujian province, with his friend and opened the first-ever Argentine supermarket there.The duo's act is part of Facundo's revenge for his father's business failure back in the 1990s when the arrival of a slew of Chinese supermarkets in Argentina elbowed many local ones out of business and the one owned by Facundo's father was unfortunately one of them.To the director's mind, a mockumentary portraying two Argentines' struggle to establish a business in an utterly different cultural milieu on the other end of the world can help put his countrymen into the shoes of their Chinese neighbors whose stores dot the neighborhood.The indie production, made on a tight budget of $80,000, nearly emptied the director's pocket. But to ensure authenticity, the team did not simply opt for the China Town in Argentine as the setting for the film; instead, they packed up some Argentinian delicacies such as mate tea and dulce de leche (caramel), and then embarked on an eastward journey to China's Fujian province, where nearly 85 percent of the first-generation Chinese immigrants originally hail from.To get by on the tight budget, the film also stars the director himself and his friend Pablo Zapata, producer of the film. Plus, many of Marcello's family members acted in the film and his house was used as the filming location.Despite a script test and some preparations, everything seemed topsy-turvy when the team first arrived in Xiamen. Their efforts of running an Argentine supermarket were beset by a series of problems – language barriers, falling behind the shooting schedule, low supermarket patronage and more.

                    Man full of beans
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Since the age of 8, Martin Dolz, now a chef, has enjoyed stewed beans, which are considered a national dish in Argentina. Although different regions of Argentina have different recipes depending on the produce and cattle available, every recipe results in a robust and flavorful stew. Dolz's recipe for stewed beans comes from his uncle. And he brings this recipe half way across the globe to Beijing, in the hope that foodies here will also enjoy the flavor. "I'm not only acting as a chef now, but also bringing the delicacies and culture from Argentina to China," says the 36-year-old Argentine who joined the China Grill restaurant in Beijing as the executive chef in May. "In China, food is a philosophy and even more than that, but in Argentina, food is a tradition - people sitting at a big table and enjoying a lot of food, mostly meat," he says. According to him, the food in Argentina is simple, with not much dressing or spices. In June, Dolz added several new dishes to the a la carte menu inspired by the flavors of his hometown in Argentina. Stewed beans is one example, where he slow-cooks all the ingredients for a minimum of two hours to infuse all the flavors, and adds pumpkin for a hint of sweetness. For an indulgent touch, he tops the stew with fragrant and nutty pan-fried foie gras. Dolz honed his culinary skills at the University of Buenos Aires. But he began his culinary career in 2003 in Santa Cruz, southern Argentina, before gaining experience in a number of hotels and restaurants in Buenos Aires. He continued to boost his leadership and culinary skills when he moved to the Grand Hyatt Sao Paulo in Brazil where he had the opportunity to work with Michelin-starred chefs, including three-star Allan Passard and two-star Michell Sarran. In 2011, he was named the head chef and restaurant manager at Cavas Wine Lodge, a unique residential vineyard complex in Mendoza. Speaking about his culinary influences, Dolz, who also picked up knowledge about wine pairing on his culinary journeys, says: "I've been traveling and living around the world, and I bring all my experience to my dishes." His new dishes at the China Grill build on the wealth of his experience. Dolz's version of ceviche is just one example. One of South America's best kept secrets for centuries, ceviche is believed to have originated from Peru and Ecuador, due to their amazing varieties of fish and shellfish. Every Latin American country has given ceviche its own touch, just as Dolz's. Incorporating line-caught wild sea bass from local waters with a traditional olive dressing, Dolz adds even more color and a citrus punch with tropical mango and passion fruit. This refreshing dish is perfect to enjoy at any time of the year, but especially during the summer season. "Traditional ceviche uses onion, tomato and pepper, but I'm inspired by my experience in Brazil, since it has very good mango, so I use mango, orange and lemon to give the dish a fresh flavor," says Dolz. Dolz also brings his modern interpretation of the humble Argentinian-style blood sausage. A must-have in most Argentine barbecues, the sausage is made with pig's blood, ground pork meat or offal and a secret seasoning. The ingredients are then wrapped in regular sausage casings that are then cooked before serving. Dolz uses the sausage and blends it with flour, eggs, and bread crumbs to make a croquette before deep-frying the patties until they are crispy and golden-brown. The croquettes are then paired with a tangy and creamy homemade lime chili mayo with grated almond. In the kitchen Dolz likes to talk with his Chinese colleagues, hoping to learn more about Chinese ingredients, and also asks them to try his creations and offer feedback. "I like to do controversial things with food, as I like to show people a different way so they can taste something they are not used to," says Dolz. liyingxue@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 07/15/2019 page15)

                The people-to-people exchange program "Meeting people, expanding friendship" concluded in Dunhuang on July 19. In the seven-day trip, a group of Chinese and foreign academics and journalists traveled from Ningbo to Nantong and eventually Dunhuang, all of which are located in the Belt-and-Road area.Academics from Chinese think tanks, universities, and journalists and vloggers from China, Ghana, Turkey, and Egypt and Argentina have participated in this Belt-and-Road themed trip.During the round-table discussion on the 19th, participants exchanged their views and insights about the development of Belt-and-Road Initiative.Wang Lei, researcher of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations commented that to implement the Belt-and-Road Initiative, Chinese manufacturing capacity should go global, Chinese capital to engage in the international market, and the Chinese story need to be told to its international audience.Cong Peiying, a commentator from China Youth University of Political Sciences claimed that the academia should study the Belt-and-Road Initiative and its development in different contexts.Pablo Levinton, an Argentinian researcher with China University of Geoscience, said that he was glad to have saw and shot videos of the development of the Belt-and-Road cities. He wanted to tell the China story in his eyes with the cameras.The sentiment is echoed by the Turkish journalist Sedat Aydin whose goal is to help his audience to gain more understanding of China by his videos about China.

                MADRID -- Lionel Messi has been included in the FC Barcelona squad to travel to Germany for Tuesday night's Champions League match away to Borussia Dortmund.The news means Messi joins up with a Barcelona squad for the first time since last season's Copa del Rey final against Valencia, and 46 days after suffering a calf injury in his first training session of pre-season.The Argentinian was given the all-clear by Barca medical staff after completing Monday morning's training session with the rest of his teammates, meaning he has been able to get through two consecutive sessions with no problems.Although he is included in the squad, it is unlikely Messi will start against the side that is currently second in the German Bundesliga, with his first start likely to be away to Granada in La Liga next Saturday night.
