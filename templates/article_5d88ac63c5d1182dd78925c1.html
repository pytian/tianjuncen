                After impressive showing against Ostapenko, the future looks bright for young ChineseChina's You Xiaodi walked away from her first battle with a Grand Slam champion with her head held high - and possibly the frustrated roars of Jelena Ostapenko still ringing in her ears.You romped to a second-set bagel to tie the match against the 2017 French Open champion and ignite the passion of the home crowd at the inaugural ICBC Credit Card Zhengzhou Open on Tuesday night.Latvia's Ostapenko was forced to draw on all her experience and eventually prevailed 6-3, 0-6, 6-2 to advance to the second round of the Premier 700 event.After negotiating three qualifying rounds and giving Ostapenko a mighty scare, You was left to reflect on an immensely encouraging effort in the Henan province capital."It was a tough match and I just didn't want to give up," You told China Daily."I kept adjusting my strategies and putting her under pressure. When I knew that I was going to play Ostapenko, I was more excited than nervous."It's the first time that I've played a WTA Premier main-draw match and the first time that I encountered a Grand Slam winner."Following her second-set mauling, a flustered Ostapenko yelled in annoyance at the humiliating scoreline while You remained impressively calm during the outburst."I think she played pretty well today, and it was not my best match, not my best performance," said Ostapenko, who struggled to find her rhythm on the windy outdoor court and at one point called a medical timeout."It was not easy because the conditions were a little bit tricky, like the wind and all the other stuff. But I think she played good."I felt dizzy and my head was spinning, so I did not feel so well. I think that's probably from traveling, jet lag, tiredness. It was very difficult. But I'm glad I managed to win today."For world No 232 You, climbing the rankings is now the immediate goal. When asked about her dream, the usually soft-spoken player answered loud and clear: "Of course, it's a Grand Slam.""I'm steadily improving this season and I just want to make more breakthroughs," the 23-year-old added."I hope I can play more WTA matches in China, but it's not easy given my current ranking."The next step for me is to level up my ranking to 180 or so, then 150. I'll just try my best to go higher and higher."You first picked up a racket when she was 5 years old but, coming from a non-athletic family, she was not pushed into pursuing a professional career by her parents. Unlike some players on the circuit, it seems You's passion for tennis comes almost entirely from within.Beneath her quiet demeanor lies a steely determination to succeed in the sport she loves, inspired by her idol, Spanish superstar Rafael Nadal."Nadal has been my hero since I was a little girl. He's the kind of player who can stand up and fight no matter how hard the situation is," said You."Every time I'm exhausted on the court, I just think what he would do under those circumstances. So I just need to move faster and hit the returns harder, with stronger will."I met Nadal years ago at the French Open when I played in the girls' draw. Although I was preparing for the qualifying matches of the Zhengzhou Open, I still watched his US Open final that morning. Then I won my match that afternoon."I'm so happy for him to win the title. It was a tough match."shifutian@chinadaily.com.cn

                    Variety show, 'The Big Band', gets rock rolling again
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Frequent rainfall across China has not been able to dampen the enthusiasm for rock music this summer.Rock music is thumping on more Chinese eardrums than ever before and becoming more "word on the street" than "underground culture" as it moves into the mainstream. This is thanks, in part, to the variety show The Big Band, which has captivated Chinese audiences with its focus on indie music and rock culture.Aimed at bringing lesser-known rock and indie bands to the fore and giving them a platform to perform for the masses, the show took the format of a competition among 31 bands whose styles range from indie rock, metal and punk to funk, British pop, reggae and more. Concluding earlier last month, the program has indeed ignited heated discussion this summer.On China's micro-blogging platform, Sina Weibo, the hashtag #TheBigBand has been posted over 5.2 million times. The show has also garnered more than 400,000 "bullet words"－a way that viewers respond to live videos online－on the streaming platform iQiyi."It has succeeded in building a platform to let audiences see China's authentic band culture and the people behind it," Cui Longyang, an indie musician in Beijing, says."But rock 'n' roll has been there all along, thanks to hundreds of thousands of rock lovers who have never given up on their dreams," Cui adds, referring to all the hardworking musicians who ply their trade in bars and clubs across the length and breadth of China.Much like drummer Wang He, 31, and his band Zhi Ren. To realize a rock 'n' roll dream that he harbored for more than a decade, Wang co-founded the band earlier this year, recruiting rock-loving friends and colleagues that include an employee of a State-owned company, a senior manager and a firefighter.In July, the band made their debut in Beijing and entertained a full house of around 500 people. "We enjoyed the performance and decided to continue," Wang explains. "Even my boss was there to support us and one of our friends got so excited that he jumped onto the stage and danced with us."With most of the members having a day job, Wang's band has to set aside time to practice."Every Saturday our firefighting guitarist travels 30 minutes by train from another city to meet us, and four weeks before the performance, everyone took leave from work," Wang recalls.As the main meeting place for the band, Wang's home is always filled with laughter and music. Dozens of postcards from fans and friends pile up in a metal basket that hangs on the wall.Ren Lu, who fronts the band, says apart from support from friends and fans, it is their unswerving passion for music that keeps the band together."If you trace back to the very beginning, the 1980s and 1990s were the heydays of Chinese rock 'n' roll. At that time, the genre, which was full of idealism and vitality, exploded like a musical bomb among Chinese people born in the 1960s and 1970s," says Wang Jiang, a pop music critic in Shanghai.The genre's influence, however, has since withered, as the new millennium ushered in an era of rapid economic growth in the country. People were too busy for the so-called rock 'n' roll spirit, Wang adds.Some suggest that China's rock spirit is once again returning, echoing its golden era, but this is much more than 40-and 50-somethings getting nostalgic. According to Maoyan, a movie and TV rating platform, people aged between 18 and 30 account for 58 percent of The Big Band's audience, and one-quarter of the audience is aged between 18 and 24."Bars and clubs are now flooded with the songs of the bands on the show, such as The Face, and my favorite, Hedgehog," says Hu Qihong, a 26-year-old rock fan. "Beyond the music, the show lets me know who the rockers really are.""Variety shows and mobile music apps have brought indie music to the public, especially young people, and has broken down cultural barriers," Wang He says. "Underground and indie music can now reach a wider audience, instead of a group of niche listeners."In 2018, China hosted 263 music festivals, more than three times the total in 2011, with Shanghai, Chengdu and Beijing being the most popular cities for putting on live shows, according to a report released by China Music Business News earlier this year.Zuo Ye, a music critic and live music venue manager in Beijing, says his club held more than 150 live concerts last year, a number that has grown by around 10 percent annually over recent years."Given the better overall environment, the success of The Big Band is understandable," Zuo says. "Since 2010, China's rock bands have matured in almost every aspect, including the quality of their music and their performances."

                    5 dead, 21 hurt in Texas shooting
                </p>
            </a>

                Attacker opened fire at random before he was shot dead by police WASHINGTON - A gunman hijacked a US postal truck and opened fire at random in the US state of Texas on Saturday, shooting dead at least five people and wounding many others before dying in a shootout with officers. Police identified the suspect as a white man in his mid-30s, but could not yet name him or say why he carried out the attack in the West Texas cities of Midland and Odessa. Coming less than a month after a gunman killed 22 people in the Texas city of El Paso, the latest bloodshed immediately ignited fresh calls for gun control to stem the US scourge of mass shootings.  Authorities control traffic on the street after the shooting in Odessa, Texas, on Saturday. Mark Rogers / AP"We have at least 21 victims, 21 shooting victims and at least five deceased at this point in time," said Odessa city Police Chief Michael Gerke. Three police officers were injured, he said. The Odessa Police Department had earlier reported that a suspect was "driving around Odessa shooting at random people" and "just hijacked a US mail carrier truck". Troopers had initially tried to pull over a passenger vehicle on the Interstate 20 highway but before it stopped, "the male driver (and only occupant in the vehicle) pointed a rifle toward the rear window of his car and fired several shots toward the DPS patrol unit," the Texas Department of Public Safety said in a statement. One trooper was wounded, the suspect fled the scene, "and continued shooting innocent people", the department statement said. Some of the shots were fired on the highway linking the cities of Odessa and Midland, where cars were left with bullet holes. "I just found out a friend of mine passed away," David Turner, the mayor of Odessa, told Fox News. "This coward pulls up beside" and opens fire on the car where the man and his family were waiting at a stop light, Turner said. During his rampage, the suspect had switched vehicles by hijacking the postal van, and Gerke said he "would assume" the postal worker was among the victims. Police said the suspect died during an exchange of fire with law enforcement at a movie theater in Odessa. Shauna Saxton was one of the terrified drivers who said she encountered the gunman during his rampage, during which multiple witnesses described gunfire near shopping plazas and in busy intersections. Saxton was driving with her husband and grandson in Odessa and had paused at a stoplight when they heard loud pops. "I looked over my shoulder to the left and the gold car pulled up and the man was there and he had a very large gun and it was pointing at me," she told TV station KOSA. Saxton said she was trapped because there were two cars in front of her. "I started honking my horn. I started swerving and we got a little ahead of him and then for whatever reason the cars in front of me kind of parted," she said sobbing. She said she heard three more shots as she sped away. US President Donald Trump tweeted that he had been briefed by Attorney General Bill Barr. A day earlier, at least 10 people were injured in a shooting at a high school football game at Ladd-Peebles Stadium in Mobile, Alabama. A 17-year-old suspect was arrested on Saturday. Mobile Police Chief Lawrence Battiste said the shooting stemmed from a fight, and the suspect pulled a gun and started "indiscriminately shooting". "This is a cowardly act by an individual who didn't know how to deal with a situation," Battiste said. The latest incidents came after the early August mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart store, where many victims were Hispanic. In that case, officers arrested Patrick Crusius, 21, a white Texan, who told police that he was targeting "Mexicans", according to an arrest warrant published by US media. The tragedy in El Paso was committed on the basis of "racist" anti-Mexican rhetoric, Jesus Seade, Mexico's foreign ministry undersecretary for North America, said during a memorial after that shooting. Critics of Trump have accused him of stoking such hatred. The shooting in El Paso came hours before a gunman in Dayton, Ohio killed nine people, again reigniting calls for gun control in the country where firearms were linked to nearly 40,000 deaths in 2017. "We need to end this epidemic," former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke reacted on Twitter after the latest killings. O'Rourke, a Democratic presidential hopeful, expressed sympathy with "everyone in West Texas who has to endure this again". Another Democratic contender, former San Antonio mayor Julian Castro, appealed on Twitter to the Republican-controlled Senate "who refuse to move on gun reform." "What is the number? How many Americans are you willing to sacrifice to the NRA?" NRA is the National Rife Association. After a series of mass shootings since late July Trump had expressed provisional support for implementing universal background checks. The president's position is crucial, because congressional Republicans, who count on gun rights supporters for votes, cannot move on tougher firearms legislation without his support.

                    College student's demand for higher living expenses sparks debate
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                A recent online post about a female college student asking for 4,500 yuan ($630.16) for monthly living expenses has ignited public debate on how much a student really needs for college life, and most believed that demand is too much.According to the post, the new college student said her school is in a new top-tier city and complained her mother gave her too little, 2,000 yuan, as she had to eat in the school canteen through the end of the month.She explained the expenses included skin care products and new clothes, and that her roommates used good products too, but her mother refused to give her the 4,500 yuan.She said spending on after-school classes exceeded 4,000 yuan a month during high school, and her mother gave it without the least hesitation, while now her tuition and accommodation fees reached 30,000 yuan a year in college."Is 2,000 yuan enough for a student's life in college" soon became a hot topic on the list of top trending searches Wednesday since the new semester started this fall.Some internet users shared their living expenses, and except for some outliers, most ranged from 1,000 to 2,000 yuan a month. Some questioned whether the female student could even earn 4,500 yuan after graduation.Some internet users have pointed out that a student's spending should depend on the family's financial situation, and they should learn about how to manage their money.According to a survey from Chengdu-based Red Star News, students from colleges in the city, such as Sichuan University, Chengdu University and Sichuan Conservatory of Music, had expenses ranging from 1,500 to 2,000 yuan.Data from Wacai, an app focusing on financial advice, showed that students in 15 cities spent over 1,500 yuan a month on average, topped by Beijing at 2,400 yuan, Shanghai at 2,300 yuan, and Hangzhou at 2,250 yuan.

                    Safety lapses on California diving boat: Newspaper report
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                A preliminary investigation into the scuba diving boat that burned and sank off the coast of Southern California reportedly suggests serious safety deficiencies aboard the vessel.The deficiencies on the Conception include the lack of a "roaming night watchman" who is required to be awake and alert passengers in the event of a fire or other dangers, according to several law enforcement sources familiar with the inquiry, The Los Angeles Times reported on Friday.The investigation also has raised questions about whether the crew was adequately trained and whether passengers received a complete safety briefing, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not have approval to comment publicly about the case, the newspaper said.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB is) seeking to determine the cause of the fire. They are examining potential ignition sources for the fire, including electronics, kitchen stoves and the vessel's wiring systems. Investigators know photography equipment, batteries and other electronics were stored and plugged in on the Conception.Meantime, the owners of the Conception — Truth Aquatics Inc of Santa Barbara — filed a lawsuit in US District Court in Los Angeles that uses a pre-Civil War provision of maritime law to limit their liability from any victims' claims. The lawsuit argues the company and owners Glen and Dana Fritzler made the boat seaworthy and the craft was properly manned and equipped.Searchers recovered 33 bodies and continued searching Thursday in the waters just off Santa Cruz Island for the remaining victim.The crew of the ship told a "harrowing story" of their failed attempts to save 34 people trapped below deck in a bunk room already engulfed in flames, investigators said on ThursdayAll those lost in the Labor Day tragedy aboard the Conception were sleeping in a bunkroom below the main deck when fire broke out around 3 a.m. The captain and four crew were above and survived.Crew members told investigators what Jennifer Homendy, a member of the NTSB, on Thursday called a harrowing story of the moments after the fire erupted on the vessel.One said he awoke to a noise — but did not hear a smoke alarm — and saw flames "erupting" from the ship's galley below, Homendy said. He tried to get down a ladder, but flames had engulfed it.Crew members then jumped from the ship's bridge to its main deck — one breaking a leg in the effort — and tried to get through the double doors of the galley, under which the ship's 33 passengers and a 26-year-old crew member slept. A stairway and escape hatch from the bunkroom both exited into the galley.With the galley's doors on fire, the crew went around to the front of the vessel to try and get through windows but couldn't."At that point, due to heat, flames and smoke, the crew had to jump from the boat," Homendy said.Two swam to the back of the vessel to retrieve a skiff and rescue the remaining crew. They took the skiff to a boat named the Grape Escape that was anchored nearby and called for help and then steered the skiff back toward the burning Conception to see if they could rescue any survivors. None were found.Earlier this week, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said the captain of Conception made a mayday call before leaving the boat.The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this story.

                Hunan province has developed its culture, arts, media and creative industries to create a high-profile image worldwide. Over the past decades, Hunan has cultivated a unique cultural and creative industry, which involves films and television, publishing, comics and animation sectors. China South Publishing and Media Group, restructured and reformed by Hunan Publishing Investment Holding Group, launched its initial public offering at Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2010. It was the first listed company in the Chinese publishing industry. The group has grown into one of the biggest media giants in Asia, gaining an international reputation.  Winners of the Chinese Proficiency Competition for Foreign College Students, an annual event known as the Chinese Bridge held in Hunan, pose for a group photo. Provided to China DailyHunan TV is one of the province's calling cards and has been a top-rated channel in China since 2003. It has produced high-quality programs including variety show Happy Camp and reality shows Super Girl, Singer, Super Vocal and The Sound, which had a large number of viewers across the world. Changsha, the capital of Hunan province, was granted membership of the Creative Cities Network launched by UNESCO in 2017. It was recognized as a City of Media Arts. Other winners of the title include Lyon in France, York in the United Kingdom and Austin in the United States. Changsha is the first city in China to be awarded the prestigious UNESCO title. Du Yue, secretary-general of the National Commission for UNESCO in China, said the city has done an excellent job promoting cultural development and has become internationally competitive in this area. Local authorities are advancing the construction of cultural industrial parks and arts towns. The move will encourage mass participation in cultural events and integrate local culture with urban development, the authorities said. According to local statistics, there are more than 10,000 companies in the cultural and creative industry in the city. The Malanshan (Changsha) Video Cultural and Creative Industrial Park was established in Changsha in 2017 to promote the construction of cultural innovation platforms. To date, the park has attracted more than 2,000 video production companies and provided jobs for more than 30,000 people. Its video cultural and creative industry created an output value of more than 35 billion yuan ($5.07 billion) last year. Jian Guijun, deputy director of the administrative committee of the park, said that the park will expand by 200,000 square meters next year. This will create employment opportunities for 20,000 people, Jian added. A 150-meter-high building of TVZone Media, the Hunan startup design plaza and three 198-meter-high skyscrapers at Mango Malanshan Square will begin construction or operation in the near future. These will become new cultural landmarks along the Liuyang River. Jian said the park is attracting more startup project initiators. In the next three to five years, the park is expected to cultivate one or two unicorn enterprises or startup companies with an estimated value surpassing $1 billion. Hunan and Changsha governments have vowed to provide financial support to selected companies and professionals at the park. The financial aid is expected to reach 5 billion yuan in the next five years. High-level professionals will be provided with up to 2 million yuan in bonuses and housing subsidies. Project funding is valued at up to 10 million yuan. Innovation has given a new lease of life to the traditional firework industry in Hunan province. The city of Liuyang is home to about 1,000 companies producing all types of fireworks. An estimated 90 percent of the globe's pyrotechnics are designed and produced in China, with the majority in Liuyang. A large number of Liuyang fireworks have been sold to other countries. Europe, Southeast Asian countries and the United States are among major export markets. Hunan exported 217,000 metric tons of fireworks in 2018, an increase of 16.5 percent from 2017. It earned the province a record 3.27 billion yuan from the overseas sales, up 20.8 percent year-on-year. The province contributes 57.3 percent of Chinese firework exports. Local firework companies said that exported firework orders increased significantly last year. Many were from a growing number of new buyers. For example, Zhaofeng firework trade company exported 13,000 tons of fireworks last year, 8.5 times more than 2017. In recent years, Liuyang fireworks have featured technological and cultural creativity. Equipped with an intelligent spray machine featuring zero emissions, intelligent ignition technology and digital firework text-forming technology, Liuyang fireworks have become a popular cultural product. According to the Hunan Provincial Department of Culture and Tourism, there were more than 600 Liuyang firework displays staged at home and abroad last year, across more than 40 countries and regions.  Top: A Western Zhou Dynasty (c.11th century-771 BC) themed cultural park in Ningxiang, Hunan province, is a shining example of the combination of culture and tourism.
