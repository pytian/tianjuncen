                74th session of UN General Assembly opens
            </a>
            <p>
                UNITED NATIONS - The 74th session of the UN General Assembly opened at UN Headquarters in New York on Tuesday.Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, president of the 74th session of the General Assembly, declared the opening of the 2019-2020 session of the most representative body of the United Nations.In his remarks to the opening plenary meeting, Muhammad-Bande asked for action in line with the theme of this year's General Debate: "Galvanizing multilateral efforts for poverty eradication, quality education, climate action and inclusion.""Our vision statement focused on the implementation of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), particularly poverty eradication, zero hunger, quality education, climate action and inclusion," he said."Accordingly, I will ... pay close attention to the effective implementation of inherited mandates and the following priorities, which I initiated in my vision statement and at the dialogue with member states prior to my election: promotion of peace and security, particularly prevention, and collaborate and coordinate with the Security Council, the (UN) Secretariat to ensure that greater attention is paid to prevention rather than reaction to full-blown conflict."I will also advocate for effective early detection and warning systems as well as mediation, negotiation, and peaceful settlement of ongoing conflicts. I will work to engender cooperation that addresses drivers of conflict, such as poverty, exclusion and illiteracy, increase partnership for the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals, particularly poverty eradication, zero hunger and quality education."In his remarks, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stressed the need to convince people that the United Nations is relevant to all and that multilateralism offers real solutions to global challenges."The General Assembly is a unique and indispensable forum where the world can come together to advance on sensitive and important issues," he said. "It is vital that the world has strong and effective multilateral institutions and architecture, and that international relations are based on international law."The General Assembly is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations, and the only one in which all member states have equal representation.The General Debate at the beginning of each session is considered the largest gathering of world leaders. This year, 143 heads of state and government are believed to have registered to speak at the high-level week.The 74th session of the General Assembly will also feature other high-profile events, including a Climate Action Summit and a high-level meeting on universal health coverage.

                UN’s Afghanistan mandate extended by Security Council
            </a>
            <p>
                The UN Security Council on Tuesday unanimously adopted a resolution extending the UN political mission in Afghanistan.The technical resolution renews the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) for one year.It asks the UNAMA to provide assistance to Afghanistan with elections, connectivity, regional cooperation, security, anti-narcotics and reconstruction, promote partnership on connectivity, and welcome joint efforts to enhance dialogue and collaboration and to advance shared goals of economic development across the region.The resolution also stresses the importance of supporting capacity building by the Afghan government on security to maintain stability and combat terrorism.Zhang Jun, permanent representative of China to the UN, said in an explanatory statement:"China is glad to see the unanimous adoption by the Council of the resolution on a technical renewal of the mandate of UNAMA. The result meets the expectation of the Afghan people and enables UNAMA to continue doing its job. It has also accommodated the concerns of all parties.""As a direct neighbor, China most wants to see peace, stability, development and prosperity in Afghanistan. China cares most about the interests and well-being of the Afghan people," the ambassador said.Thinking of Afghanistan's position, Zhang emphasized "China believes that to achieve lasting peace, economic development must be boosted; to achieve security and stability, the country's security concerns must be addressed; to maintain unity of the Security Council, existing consensus must be respected."Zhang said that China has been emphasizing that it is not a good time to adopt a comprehensive resolution; technical renewal is the way.China took part in the consultations on extending the mandate of UNAMA and proposed revisions."To China's regret, a few countries refused to keep the text of consensus previously agreed and refused to accommodate the core concerns of the parties. The draft also failed to address possible security vacuum in Afghanistan. All this led to serious division among the parties," Zhang told the council."The argument that supporting Afghanistan in taking part in regional cooperation and promoting connectivity is unrelated to the mandate of UNAMA is a complete misunderstanding of UNAMA's mission," he said."China welcomes the fact that the relevant parties have then come back to the track of consultation in seeking a solution and reached consensus on a technical renewal of the mandate," he added.Zhang said that it must be pointed out that helping the Afghan economy is vital to achieving lasting peace and stability in the country. "That is what the Afghan people want, and no country has the right to deny them a better life," he said.He said that China supports Afghanistan in holding a general election, advancing peace and the reconciliation process and strengthening capacity-building of the Afghan security forces.

                UN Security Council divided over Syria
            </a>
            <p>
                The UN Security Council on Thursday did not adopt either of two competing resolutions on a cessation of hostilities in Idlib, Syria, the last city in the war-torn nation that is still largely held by rebel forces.Germany, Belgium and Kuwait proposed a humanitarian cease-fire, which got 12 out of 15 votes. Permanent Security Council members China and Russia vetoed the draft, blocking its adoption.The other resolution, proposed by China and Russia, highlighted terrorism concerns by extremist groups operating inside the region. Nine members voted against it, and four abstained.After voting against the draft resolution, China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Zhang Jun said that regarding the Idlib issue, starting on Aug 31, the Russian and Syrian governments had implemented a cease-fire in Idlib, which has been maintained in general.The diplomatic efforts by relevant parties of the international community is ongoing, and the situation in Idlib is moving in a positive direction, he said."Under such a context, to steamroll a draft resolution that has major controversies, to a vote, is clearly unconstructive, and this move will not achieve the expected result," Zhang said."Terrorist organizations continue to expand their sphere of influence in the northwest region of Syria," he said. "This is the source of the humanitarian issue in Idlib. It also poses a grave risk to the safety and security in the region."Zhang called the council to unite in tackling the "grave challenge" together."China has constructively participated in the negotiation of the text and has proposed reasonable revisions. However, unfortunately the draft resolution just put to a vote did not touch upon the essence of the issue and did not address China's core concerns. For this reason, China voted against the draft resolution," he explained.Zhang said the humanitarian situation in Syria is a complicated and sensitive issue. All categories of humanitarian issues in Syria should be considered in a comprehensive manner and be addressed in a balanced way, instead of only selectively focusing on certain issues, much less to politicize humanitarian issues."The international community must fully respect the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Syria, fully listen to the views of the Syrian government, and seek a comprehensive solution to the Syria issue through political means," he said."At the same time, we should pay high attention to the postwar reconstruction of Syria and its economic and social development and to help Syrian people lead peaceful, stable and happy lives," he added.Zhang underlined that China also attaches great importance to the humanitarian situation in Syria, and that's why Russia and China proposed an alternative draft resolution, which took into consideration the humanitarian and counterterrorism issues of Syria in a comprehensive manner."This draft includes the call for observance of international law in counterterrorism and assurance of humanitarian access and reflects the humanitarian needs of the Syrian people," he explained.Zhang said China firmly rejects the "groundless" accusation made by the UK and the US against China."China has the right to make an independent decision on how it votes, according to the rights and wrongs of a situation, and preceding from the interests of the Syrian people. No country has the right to make a willful accusation on this," he said."I would like to point out that the current situation of Syria and the sufferings of the Syrian people are exactly the results of the wrongful conduct by some countries. It is these countries that should reflect on their own behavior," he said.Ursula Mueller, the UN assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, who spoke prior to the vote, said a unilateral cease-fire announced by Russia on Aug 30 has reportedly led to a decline in fighting in the northwestern region. However, insecurity and an "alarming" humanitarian situation persist."The fragile cease-fire has brought into focus an outlook that, for this Security Council, should be all too familiar: Further fighting will endanger and displace thousands of civilians. Further displacement will create even more needs. Further needs will stretch humanitarians that are already at their limit," she told the chamber."The world is watching … in hopes that a more humane outlook for Syria will be created, one where civilians are safe, needs are addressed, and humanitarians are protected."

                China issues white paper on human rights progress over 70 years
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - China on Sunday published a white paper on its progress in the field of human rights over the past 70 years.The white paper, titled "Seeking Happiness for People: 70 Years of Progress on Human Rights in China", was released by the State Council Information Office."Living a happy life is the primary human right," the document said, adding that China regards the rights to subsistence and development as the primary and basic human rights and has been improving the rights of its people in a coordinated manner since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, especially after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 2012.Seventy years ago, under the leadership of the CPC, the people of China were emancipated and became masters of their country.Over the past seven decades, the Chinese nation has stood up and grown prosperous and is becoming strong; all basic rights of the people are better respected and protected; and China has made regular contribution to the international cause of human rights, the white paper said.China has opened a new path of human rights protection based on its national conditions, and increased the diversity of human civilizations, it said.China ensures its people enjoy their rightsSince the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has continued to improve the protection of the people's economic, political, social, cultural, and environmental rights, said the white paper.Personal rights and dignity are well respected and protected, workers' rights are fully safeguarded, a social security system that covers the largest population in the world has been established, universal education expands remarkably and public cultural services benefit more people, according to the white paper.Chinese people enjoy real democracy, the white paper said, adding that China protects people's rights to know, to participate, to express, and to supervise.The freedom of religious belief is protected in accordance with the law and environmental rights are also better protected, according to the white paper.Rights of special groups well protected in ChinaSince the founding of the People's Republic of China, targeted measures have been taken to effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of ethnic minority groups, women, children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities, ensuring their equal status and giving them the equal opportunity to participate in social life, said the white paper.China effectively guarantees the rights of ethnic minority groups in administering state affairs, enables the ethnic minorities and ethnic minority areas to leapfrog in social and economic development, as well as education, the white paper said.The freedom of ethnic minorities to use and develop their own spoken and written languages is fully protected, their cultural heritage and relics are effectively protected, and religious freedoms of ethnic minority groups are protected, according to the white paper.China has improved the protection of women and children's rights to health, and women's rights to participation in the administration of public affairs and social and economic development, the document said.The mechanism for protecting the rights and interests of the elderly is improving, it said.China has also improved the social security system for persons with disabilities, made rehabilitation universally available to them, ensured their right to employment and given strong support to creating an accessible environment and providing assistive appliances, the white paper said.China strengthens rule of law for human rightsIt said that after the founding of the People's Republic of China, socialist rule of law was established to protect human rights by law.Noting that a relatively complete legal system to protect human rights has been established in the country, the white paper said China upholds law-based governance, law-based exercise of power, and law-based government administration.To promote social fairness and justice, China has endeavored to ensure that a well-conceived approach is taken to legislation, that the law is strictly enforced, that justice is impartially administered, and that the law is observed by everyone, the white paper said.China has built a service-oriented government with limited powers and clear responsibilities, the white paper said.Efforts have been made to ensure independent and impartial exercise of judicial and procuratorial powers, guarantee the right to fair trial for all parties and the legitimate rights and interests of criminal suspects, defendants, prisoners, patients abstained from drugs and people released after serving their sentence, the white paper said.The system of right remedy and assistance is being improved, quality and more convenient public legal services are being provided, public awareness of legal protection of human rights is enhanced and corruption is being fought to safeguard people's interests, it said.China fully participates in global governance of human rightsChina has been active in UN human rights undertakings, fulfills its international human rights obligations, conducts extensive international cooperation on human rights, actively offers Chinese wisdom and solutions for global governance of human rights, and advances through concrete actions the global governance of human rights in a fairer, more rational and inclusive direction, said the white paper.China advances international cause of human rightsSince the founding of the People's Republic of China, in addition to advancing the human rights of its people, the country has earnestly supported the just cause of other developing countries to break free from colonial rule, achieve national independence, and eradicate racial segregation, said the white paper.China has helped the developing countries to build up their capacity for development and provided the countries with development assistance and humanitarian relief, making great contribution to safeguarding world peace and development and furthering the international cause of human rights, the white paper said.

                EU is 'in no way responsible' for Brexit consequences, Juncker says
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON - The European Union (EU) is "in no way responsible" for the consequences of Brexit, and the bloc should not be held accountable for what is a "British decision," European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Sunday."The European Union is not leaving the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union," Juncker said in an interview with Sky News, which was broadcast on Sunday."The EU is in no way responsible for any kind of consequences entailed by the Brexit," he said."That's a British decision, a sovereign decision that we are respecting but don't try to charge the European Union with the responsibility," he said.The statement came as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is leaving for New York on Sunday to attend the annual high-level debate of the UN General Assembly, and he is expected to use the visit for an informal Brexit summit.Johnson is expected to hold discussions with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and European Council President Donald Tusk on the sidelines of the General Debate of the General Assembly, which is slated to begin on Tuesday at the UN headquarters.Juncker said earlier this week that he was "doing "everything" to help secure a withdrawal agreement because he felt a hard Brexit, or a no-deal Brexit, would be "catastrophic" for both sides."It's better for Britain and for the European Union to have an organised deal," he said.

                Boris Johnson heads to UN, urging world to see beyond Brexit
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson headed for the United Nations in New York on Sunday to argue that post-Brexit Britain will be a dynamic world power taking the lead on tackling climate change and an unstable Middle East. But he and his country face some big hurdles.He is struggling to strike a withdrawal agreement with a skeptical European Union, and a looming verdict from Britain's Supreme Court could derail his Brexit plans.Johnson is likely to be dogged by Brexit throughout his three-day trip to the General Assembly, the UN's annual gathering of world leaders.More than three years after Britain voted to leave the EU, the departure date has been postponed twice, and the UK Parliament has repeatedly rejected the only divorce deal offered. The country is facing a chaotic exit on Oct 31 unless Johnson's government can, against the odds, secure a new agreement.In search of a deal, Johnson is scheduled to hold talks at the UN with EU leaders, including European Council President Donald Tusk, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.But many leaders of the 28-nation bloc mistrust Johnson, a brash Brexit champion who played a big role in persuading British voters in 2016 to opt to leave the EU. And they say Britain has not come up with workable ways to maintain an open border between EU member Ireland and the UK's Northern Ireland — the key sticking point in the dispute.A senior British government spokesman said talks with the EU so far have been positive, but "there is an awful lot of work still to do"."What is obviously encouraging is that all sides do want to try and achieve a deal," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the government's thinking.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said a no-deal Brexit "would have catastrophic consequences," including customs posts and other barriers between Ireland and Northern Ireland. But he said it would be Britain's fault."We did not invent the Brexit," Juncker told Sky News in an interview broadcast Sunday. "We were never pleading in favor of any kind of Brexit. That's a British decision, and so it has to be dealt with in that way."Johnson also has a meeting scheduled with President Donald Trump, who has called the British leader "a really good man" and claimed that some refer to Johnson as "Britain Trump".AP
