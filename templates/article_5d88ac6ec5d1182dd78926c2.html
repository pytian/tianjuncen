                Seoul quits intelligence agreement with Tokyo
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                SEOUL - The Republic of Korea's presidential Blue House put the blame on Japan on Friday for the termination of the military intelligence-sharing pact between the two neighbors amid the ongoing trade spat and the controversy over historical issues.Kim Hyun-chong, deputy director of the National Security Office of the Blue House, told a news conference that there was "no longer any justification" to maintain the General Security of Military Information Agreement as it was an agreement to exchange sensitive military intelligence based on "a high level of trust."Seoul decided on Thursday to end the GSOMIA, which was signed in November 2016 to share military intelligence on nuclear and missile programs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.The GSOMIA had been automatically renewed each year in August. If either party wants to scrap the pact, the party will be required to notify the other of its intention 90 days ahead. This year's notification deadline falls on Saturday.Kim said Japan took "unwarranted economic retaliation" against the ROK while claiming that the ROK top court's ruling on the wartime forced labor victims ran counter to the 1965 treaty and violated international law.Japan tightened regulations last month on its export to the ROK of three materials vital to manufacture memory chips and display panels, which are the mainstay of the ROK's exports.Earlier this month, Japan dropped the ROK off its white list of trusted trading partners that are given preferential export procedure. In response, Seoul took Tokyo off its white list of trusted export partners.Japan's export curbs came in an apparent protest against the ROK top court's ruling that ordered some Japanese companies, including Nippon Steel and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries among others, to pay compensation over Korean wartime forced labor.Hundreds of thousands of Koreans were forced by Japan into hard labor without pay during World War II. The Korean Peninsula was colonized by Japan from 1910 to 1945.Japan claimed that the forced labor issue was settled through the 1965 treaty that normalized diplomatic relations between Seoul and Tokyo after the colonial era, but Seoul said the treaty did not involve individuals' right to compensation.Kim said the ROK government adhered to the position that "crimes against humanity" perpetrated by the Japanese government and its military had not been resolved through the 1965 treaty.The Japanese government demanded that the ROK government rectify the top court's ruling, but it was simply unimaginable in the country with the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers guaranteed, Kim added.Xinhua - AP

                SEOUL - More than half of South Korean consumers joined a boycott campaign against Japanese products amid the Seoul-Tokyo trade row, caused by Japan's export restriction on materials to South Korea, a survey showed Thursday.According to the Realmeter poll, 54.6 percent said they participated in the campaign to boycott Japanese products, up 6.6 percentage points from the previous week's survey.The result was based on a poll of 503 voters conducted on Wednesday. It had plus or minus 4.4 percentage points in margin of error with a 95 percent confidence level.Those who replied that they plan, or will continue, to join the boycott movement, was 66 percent, almost unchanged from the prior week.The movement of "Boycott Japan" to encourage people here not to go to Japan for trip nor buy Japanese products spread across the entire South Korea in protest against Japan's export curbs.Japan tightened regulation on its export to South Korea early this month of three materials vital to produce memory chips and display panels, which affect the manufacturing of smartphone, TV and other tech products.The Japanese export restrictions came in protest against the South Korean top court's rulings that ordered some of Japanese companies, including Nippon Steel and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries among others, to pay compensations to the South Korean victims who were forced into hard labor without pay during the 1910-45 Japanese colonization of the Korean Peninsula.

                SEOUL -- A South Korean man in his late 70s died Friday after setting fire to his own car near the Japanese embassy in Seoul and suffering burns, according to local media reports.The 78-year-old, only identified by his surname Kim, drove his van onto the sidewalk in front of the entrance to the building housing the Japanese embassy.He set fire to the inside of the vehicle, where about 20 cans of butane gas and 40 liters of gasoline were found, at about 3:24 am local time.The fire was extinguished some 10 minutes later, but the elderly man was rushed to a nearby hospital as he suffered burns all over his upper body.He died of respiratory failure and burns shock later in the day at the hospital despite treatments.The police were quoted as saying the deceased told one of his acquaintances over phone before the immolation that he would set fire "with hostility against Japan."Kim's family told the police that Kim's father-in-law was one of the South Korean victims who were forced into hard labor without pay during the 1910-45 Japanese colonization of the Korean Peninsula.The incident came amid the escalating trade row between South Korea and Japan, following Japan's stricter control early this month on its export to South Korea of materials vital to produce memory chips and display panels, which are the mainstay of the South Korean tech industry.Japan's export restriction came in protest against the South Korean top court's rulings that ordered some of Japanese firms, including Nippon Steel and the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries among others, to compensate the South Korean forced labor victims.The anti-Japan sentiment mounted here among the public as seen in the movement of "Boycott Japan" to encourage people not to go to Japan for trip nor buy Japanese products that spread across the entire South Korea.According to the Realmeter poll, 54.6 percent said they participated in the campaign to boycott Japanese products this week, up 6.6 percentage points from the previous week.The result was based on a poll of 503 voters conducted on Wednesday.

                SEOUL - US National Security Adviser John Bolton will make a two-day visit to South Korea from Tuesday to discuss the Korean Peninsula situations, the presidential Blue House of South Korea said Sunday.Blue House spokesperson Ko Min-jung told reporters that Chung Eui-yong, top national security adviser for South Korean President Moon Jae-in, will meet with Bolton in Seoul on Wednesday.During the meeting, Chung and Bolton will consult on major bilateral issues, including ways to build the permanent peace regime on the Korean Peninsula through the peninsula's complete denuclearization and to solidify the South Korea-U.S. alliance.Bolton will also have meetings with Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha and Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo of South Korea during his two-day trip to Seoul.Bolton's visit would come amid the escalating trade row between South Korea and Japan. Japan tightened regulation early this month on its export to South Korea of materials vital to produce memory chips and display panels, which are the mainstay of the South Korean economy.Japan's export restriction came in protest against the South Korean top court's rulings that ordered some of Japanese companies, including Nippon Steel and the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries among others, to pay compensation to the South Korean victims who were forced into hard labor without pay during the 1910-45 Japanese colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.US President Donald Trump said earlier this week that he would get involved in the Seoul-Tokyo friction if both sides want him to do, indicating his possible involvement in the dispute.According to the Blue House, Moon asked Trump to pay attention to the recent South Korea-Japan conflict during their summit in Seoul on June 30.

                    Tokyo vows actions if Seoul hurts companies in escalating dispute
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                TOKYO - Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Kono said on Friday that Tokyo will take "necessary measures" against South Korea if interests of Japanese companies are harmed in an escalating dispute over colonial-era forced labor.The neighboring countries and US allies are quarreling over South Korean court decisions ordering Japanese companies to compensate victims of forced labor during Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.Kono said after summoning South Korean Ambassador Nam Gwan-pyo that Tokyo is prepared to take "necessary measures" to protect the interest of Japanese companies, without giving details.Their talks were held in an icy atmosphere, briefly turning confrontational."It is extremely problematic that South Korea is one-sidedly leaving alone the situation that violates the international law, which is the foundation of our bilateral relationship," Kono told Nam. "The action being taken by the South Korean government is something that completely overturns the order of the international community since the end of the World War II."Kono urged Seoul to immediately take action to stop the court process, under which the plaintiffs of the lawsuit are preparing to seize assets of the Japanese companies, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industry.Nam defended his government and mentioned Seoul's proposal of creating a joint fund as a way to settle the dispute. Kono raised his voice, saying Tokyo had already rejected the idea. He also criticized the ambassador for being "rude" to suggest it again.Responding to Kono's remark, South Korea's Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying Japan still hasn't done enough to make amends for the suffering South Koreans had gone through during the colonial past and that it should discuss ways to find solutions acceptable to both sides."To genuinely resolve the problem, Japan must look straight into the unfortunate past and make efforts to heal the pain and scars of the victims," the ministry said. "We hope that the Japanese government would withdraw its unilateral pressure including the export restrictions of retaliatory character and return to the stage of diplomatic resolutions."In Washington, President Donald Trump said on Friday he had been approached by South Korean President Moon Jae-in asking if he could help with the dispute with Japan."If they need me, I'm there. Hopefully, they can work it out. But they do have tension, there's no question about it," he said, adding "it's a full-time job getting involved between Japan and South Korea".Associated Press

                    S. Korea removes Japan from whitelist of trusted export partners

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                SEOUL - South Korea on Monday decided to remove Japan from its whitelist of trusted export partners after Tokyo's such removal earlier this month.South Korean Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Sung Yun-mo told a press briefing that Seoul's export control of strategic materials will be run to meet the basic principle of the international export control system.Sung said it will be hard to closely cooperate with a country, which violates the basic principle of the international export control system or continues to run the system inappropriately.Under the revised act on the export and import of strategic materials, Japan was dropped off South Korea's whitelist of trusted export partners that are given preferential export procedure for strategic materials.It came after Japan took South Korea off its whitelist earlier this month. Japan tightened regulations early last month on its export to South Korea of three materials crucial for manufacturing memory chips and displaying panels.The Seoul's revised act was slated to take effect next month after the collection of public opinion and the legislation office's deliberation on it for about 20 days.Sung noted that if the Japanese government calls for consultation during the deliberation period, the Seoul government would be ready to accept it at any time and any place.Japan permitted the shipment of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photoresist to South Korea last week, the first approval of a chip material export to South Korea since its tighter export control of such materials in early July.However, South Korea still saw uncertainties despite Japan's approval.Japan's export curbs came in protest against the South Korean top court's rulings that ordered some of Japanese companies, including the Nippon Steel and the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries among others, to compensate the South Korean victims who were forced into hard labor without pay during the colonization.The Korean Peninsula was colonized by Imperial Japan from 1910 to 1945.

                Chengdu auto show showcases latest eco-friendly vehiclesGlobal carmakers showcased their determination to shift toward electrification and prospects of the new energy vehicles in the world's largest auto market at the 22nd Chengdu Motor Show in Sichuan province, running from Sep 5 to 14.German carmaker Mercedes-Benz announced on Thursday that the Mercedes-Benz EQC, its first fully electric sports utility vehicle model, opens to booking. The EQC is scheduled to be delivered to Chinese customers in November as German auto giant dashes forward into electrification.Equipped with the MBUX intelligent man-machine interactive system, the EQC can optimize navigation routes based on the real-time information about energy consumption, road conditions and the service condition of charging stations.Mercedes-Benz said it is to provide tailored electric auto services for Chinese customers, including installing intelligent charging piles, providing public charging piles and Mercedes-Benz exclusive charging stations, as well as a 24-hour road rescue charging service.BMW is another German auto magnate that affirmed its determination to develop electrification."BMW has announced that by 2023, it will launch 25 electric vehicle models. And most of them will come to China," said Johann Wieland, president and CEO of BMW Brilliance Automotive, in an interview at the Chengdu auto show.Its joint venture in China, BMW Brilliance will produce the BMW iX3 - the first fully electric model of the BMW X family - in Shenyang next year, which is a big step for the company. The BMW iX3 is produced for the world, Wieland added.With the country cutting subsidies for new energy vehicles in late June, the new energy vehicle sector has shown signs of a slowdown. According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, sales of new energy vehicles in China fell for the first time in 30 months, sliding 4.7 percent in July from a year earlier.The association cut its whole-year sales estimate from 1.6 million to 1.5 million for the new energy vehicle sector.Facing fluctuations in the Chinese new energy market, Wieland noted that the long-term trend of electrification is absolutely right, and that he believed the sales of electric cars and hybrids will continue growing.The CEO added that the new energy market needs sustainable solutions, which refer to high-quality products, solid working processes, correct company structures and an appropriate level of growth.

                    Nissan CEO Saikawa to step down over compensation scandal
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                TOKYO - Nissan Motor Co. President and CEO Hiroto Saikawa will resign from his post on Sept 16, the chairman of the automaker's board Yasushi Kimura told a press conference Monday.The announcement from Kimura follows the board convening regarding Saikawa and other executives at Nissan being overcompensated by a scheme connected to stock appreciation rights.Earlier on Monday, Saikawa himself indicated that he planned to step down from his post after admitting he was hugely overpaid by the scheme used to incentivize executives at the embattled automaker."I will do what I must do while still at the helm at Nissan and hand over the job as early as possible," Saikawa told a press briefing on the matter, with his remarks coming on the heels of his admission of being massively overpaid just days earlier.The latest revelation of financial indiscretions at Nissan come as the Yokohama-headquartered Japanese automaker is already struggling to deal with slumping earnings and the high-profile arrest of its former chairman, Carlos Ghosn, in November last year, on allegations of a string of financial improprieties.According to sources close to the matter, Saikawa expressed his intention to resign over the matter to some Nissan executives on Sunday, although he did not mention an exact timeframe for his departure or who might take over from him.A probe by Nissan, sources have said, revealed that Saikawa, who became CEO in April 2017 and was once a member of Ghosn's inner circle, had received tens of millions of yen more through stock appreciation rights than he was entitled to.Nissan's stock appreciation rights scheme allows directors to receive a bonus if the company's share price performs well. It was purportedly introduced to raise morale among executives.In a press briefing on Thursday Saikawa said that "the operation of the remuneration scheme was different to how it should have been," with regards to him being grossly overpaid.The under-fire CEO, however, has denied ordering the shady payments, and was quoted as saying, "I thought the procedures were handled properly and I didn't know about the misconduct."Saikawa said he will reimburse Nissan for the excessive amount of potentially illicit funds he received.At the board meeting on Monday, it was also discussed whether Nissan needs to impose disciplinary measures on Saikawa and other executives, sources close to the matter said.Nissan's shareholders have called for Saikawa to resign to take account for not reining in Ghosn and allowing him the autonomy to allegedly fleece Nissan in multiple cases of financial misconduct.Ghosn is facing trial for allegedly under-reporting his remuneration by around 9 billion yen ($84 million) over eight years through March 2018 and for diverting company funds to himself.The once-feted auto tycoon, who led Nissan from near bankruptcy, created one of the world's largest automaker alliances along with Renault SA and Mitsubishi Motors Corp., in the two-decades he served at the firm.Ghosn has denied all charges against him, saying that executives at Nissan had conspired against him.
