                New guidelines target rogue recruitment agenciesMohsine el Baghdadi always wanted to be an English teacher in China, considering such a job to be ideal.A friend who taught English in China told the 27-year-old Moroccan that foreign teachers are in high demand, there are boundless opportunities and the jobs are well paid.Baghdadi's own experience confirmed this. Replies flooded in after he posted a message on Facebook, stating: "Hello from Morocco. I am an English-language teacher searching for a good job with a good salary in China."Many of the replies were job invitations from recruitment agencies, while others came from language institutes. For the most part, they told Baghdadi that applying for a job in China was straightforward. It was sufficient merely to submit a resume.The salary also was tempting. Baghdadi teaches English in Morocco, where he is paid $500 a month. However, those who approached him from China offered a monthly salary ranging from $1,500 to $2,500, with a bonus.But he said some of those who replied appeared too eager to hire foreign teachers, and Baghdadi said he was even given "illegal advice" about getting a job.The regulation on foreign experts' work permits states that overseas language teachers in China must obtain a work visa and be a native speaker with a bachelor's degree or higher, have at least two years of related teaching experience and no criminal record.This means that Baghdadi, who is not a native English speaker and does not have sufficient experience in teaching the language, may never have the chance to work in China as a teacher."But some agencies told me that they could help me apply for a Chinese business visa, and I could become a teacher in China, come what may," he said.Teaching English is a lucrative business in China, as the country's opening-up to the world means more people are looking to learn the "universal language". For foreigners, their nationality and even their skin tone can, at times, be their ticket to securing a teaching job.According to a report last year from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 300 million people in China were learning English. There were 50,000 English-language training institutions in the country and the training market was worth as much as 500 billion yuan ($72 billion), the report said.The high demand for English-language instruction had made finding a job for most foreigners, particularly those who are white, little more than a formality.According to a survey by Banyuetan, a Xinhua News Agency magazine, in 2017, there were more than 400,000 foreign teachers working in the education sector in China, but only one-third of them were employed legally.In recent years, the country has been rocked by a number of high-profile scandals resulting from a lack of vigilance in hiring foreign teachers. In some cases, people with questionable backgrounds have landed jobs.The latest such case occurred last month. On July 23, an English-language teacher from Colombia working at the Hong Huang Lan Kindergarten in Qingdao, Shandong province, was arrested for allegedly molesting a 4-year-old girl.Earlier in July, 16 foreigners were detained in Xuzhou, Jiangsu province, for allegedly taking drugs. According to Xuzhou police, seven of them work for an education company, and the remaining nine are students.Media reports later said a number of foreign teachers from the EF Education center in Xuzhou had been detained by police for allegedly taking drugs. According to the company's website, EF is an international education company based in Sweden, and has centers in many Chinese cities.In April 2013, media reports said that Neil Robinson, from the United Kingdom, had taught at the Beijing World Youth Academy, an international school, for nearly four years while being wanted for questioning by British police in connection with child sex offences.Such cases have aroused widespread concern among parents and students, with many of them calling for the qualifications of foreign teachers at English-learning organizations to be subject to nationwide inspection.On some online expatriate forums, topics such as "How to become an English teacher in China without a work permit", or "nonnative speakers can also teach in China" are popular. They offer tips for those who want to work in the country without the required documentation or experience.One of the items stated, "Although a Chinese work visa is the only visa that it is technically legal to teach with, there is also the possibility that they might offer you an alternative one instead, such as a student visa or a business visa."These are easier and less costly to obtain, which is why this option is sometimes preferred by schools. Additionally, these visas may also be issued if you don't meet the requirements for a work visa (i.e. you don't have a bachelor's degree). While these alternative visas are not technically legal for work, they will permit you to remain in China for an extended period of time, making it easy to find work as a teacher."Alan Coleman, an Australian who is a qualified teacher in Beijing, said many people are teaching because the jobs are well-paid and relatively easy. "It is the fault of the schools, as they employ people who shouldn't be teaching," he added.Most teachers are not qualified. For example, they have not been certified by an internationally recognized English-language teaching and testing program, but still land jobs due to the high demand for native English speakers, Coleman said.Under the law, only foreigners with teaching qualifications or a TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) certificate or TESL (Teaching English as a Second Language) certificate, are allowed to teach in China.Huang Minjiao, who works for a startup English-language teaching institution in Dongguan city, Guangdong province, said, "The truth is, parents seldom ask an agency to look at a teacher's credentials, but want to see if the teacher 'looks like a native English speaker'."Some families in China spend a considerable amount on foreign English-language teachers for their children, but sometimes parents mistakenly think any foreigner－regardless of the level of their skill in the language－can provide quality education in English," Huang said.Coleman added: "Even if someone is a native speaker, I don't believe that they can necessarily become an English-language teacher. Teaching a language is not easy. It's very difficult and you need to work hard to be able to do a good job."With more than 10 years' teaching experience in Portugal, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, Coleman found his job in Beijing through a recruitment agency.A report in China Education Daily said the contracts of the majority of foreign English-language teachers at Chinese schools are still handled by for-profit, third-party recruitment agencies, rather than the schools directly.Eager to make money, many such agencies place applicants' appearance ahead of their teaching qualifications. For them, hiring English-language teachers simply means recruiting foreigners, no matter where they come from. They often hire from countries such as France, Germany or Cuba, and then pressure the recruits to lie to schools about their backgrounds.A Ukrainian student who studied in China wrote on her blog that when she was looking for a job in the country, one agency wanted her to "disguise" her identity and state that she came from the UK. A member of staff told her: "You're blonde and pale-skinned. Anyway, students can't tell which country you're from."According to some media reports, these agencies also offer contracts to foreigners who do not qualify for work visas, and instruct potential teachers to lie on their visa applications to avoid disclosing their work plans. They also fake documents to employ teachers on tourist or business visas rather than the legally required work visas.He Chugang, general manager for the South China region at Amber Education, an overseas study consultancy, said, "Chinese parents remain enthusiastic about English-language acquisition, as 'monotonous' public education cannot satisfy their diverse demands."He said this has led to cases of unqualified, unmotivated and sometimes even non-English-speaking foreigners tutoring Chinese children.He Shu, an associate professor at Peking University who teaches English as a foreign language, said Chinese parents often think that foreigners can introduce their children to Western cultures and improve their English."However, some parents are not educated or experienced enough to tell the difference between a professional teacher and a foreigner who lacks many teaching skills," she said."Also, some non-English-speaking parents believe in the stereotype that every foreigner is supposed to speak English. This phenomenon is not only commonplace in big cities, where overseas tutors are in high demand amid an overwhelming number of foreigners, but English-language tutors are also being sought in smaller provincial towns."However, the situation is expected to change soon. On July 15, the Ministry of Education, together with five other central authorities, issued new guidelines on after-school training to specify the qualifications, requirements and supervision needed for such services.The guideline states that educational institutions must publicly display the personal details of any foreign teachers they employ, including their names, photographs, teaching qualifications and previous academic and professional experience.Institutions should rectify any "problems" before the end of June next year, or could face punishment ranging from a fine to being suspended or closed, the guideline added.

                Kenya's envoy visits South Sudan for peace deal
            </a>
            <p>
                Kenya's special envoy to South Sudan Kalonzo Musyoka is in the east-central African country to follow up on implementation of the September 2018 peace agreement.Musyoka held a discussion with South Sudan's President Salva Kiir and other senior government officials on Thursday upon arrival to the country's capital Juba, on the progress of implementation of the peace deal.South Sudan's presidency said in a statement that the consultative meeting between Musyoka and the stakeholders as well as signatories to the revitalized peace agreement is meant to ensure the formation of a transitional government of national unity by Nov 12.Musyoka's visit to South Sudan comes three days after the body monitoring South Sudan's ceasefire, the Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring Mechanism, expressed fears over the slow implementation of the peace deal.Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 13th technical committee meeting of cease-fire monitoring body in Juba on Monday, Abiche Ageno, chairman of the monitoring mechanism, said even though much had been achieved in the last three months as the moves toward peace gather momentum, a great deal of work still needs to be done.Ageno said they had assessed 33 cantonment sites out of which two were found unsuitable due to lack of water or a suitable location. The sites are used for screening, training and integrating of troops and rebels into one force.He said despite the challenges posed by the rainy season, a number of civilian buildings had been vacated by the South Sudan Army and the National Security Service.He said out of the 83 buildings identified by the cease-fire monitoring body as being occupied, 47 have been vacated.President Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar signed a peace deal on September 2018 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to officially end the conflict.National armyThe agreement, referred to as the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan, and endorsed by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, gave the parties eight months to unify a national army and resolve internal boundaries.On May 3, the warring parties agreed to extend the pre-transitional period for six months to address outstanding issues such as security arrangements, including screening of forces, determining the number of states and demarcation of boundaries.A nationwide cease-fire between the signatories has been holding since the signing of the agreement, even though fighting has been ongoing between the government and smaller groups clustered in South Sudan's Equatoria region who remain outside the peace deal, according to the International Crisis Group.Africa's youngest nation descended into civil war in December 2013, after President Kiir claimed that Machar was plotting a coup. This led to removal of Machar as vice-president, leading to the eruption of violence between presidential guard soldiers from the two largest ethnic groups in South Sudan.Soldiers from the Dinka ethnic group allied with Kiir while those from the Nuer ethnic group supported Machar. The violence spread to various parts of the country.The conflict has so far claimed over 50,000 lives and internally displaced about 4 million people, with 2.3 million fleeing to neighboring countries as refugees and asylum-seekers.

                Tanzania mourns 69 killed in tanker blast
            </a>
            <p>
                MOROGORO, Tanzania - Tanzania was in mourning on Sunday, preparing to bury 69 people who perished when a crashed fuel tanker exploded as crowds rushed to siphon off leaking fuel. Tanzania's President John Magufuli declared a period of mourning through Monday following the blast near the town of Morogoro, west of Dar es Salaam. He will be represented at the funerals by Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa, an official statement said. "We're currently mourning the loss of 69 people, the last of whom died while being transferred by helicopter to the national hospital in Dar es Salaam," Majaliwa told residents in comments broadcast on Tanzanian television. The burials would start on Sunday afternoon, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Jenista Mhagama announced during the morning after relatives identified the dead. "The preparations for the burials have been completed. Individual graves have been dug and the coffins are ready," Mhagama said, adding that experts would be available to offer psychological counseling to the victims' relatives. DNA tests would be carried out on bodies that were no longer recognizable, Mhagama said, adding that families could take the remains of their loved ones and organize their own burials if they preferred. In the latest in a series of similar disasters in Africa, 39 seriously hurt patients had been taken to hospital in Dar es Salaam while 17 others were being treated in Morogoro, 200 kilometers west of the economic capital of Tanzania. Footage from the scene showed the truck engulfed in flames and huge clouds of black smoke, with charred bodies. The burnt-out remains of motorcycle taxis lay scattered on the ground among scorched trees. A video posted on social media showed dozens of people carrying yellow jerricans around the truck. "We arrived at the scene with two neighbors just after the truck was overturned. While some good Samaritans were trying to get the driver and the other two people out of the truck, others were jostling each other, equipped with jerricans, to collect petrol," teacher January Michael said. "At the same time, someone was trying to pull the battery out of the vehicle. We warned that the truck could explode at any moment but no one wanted to listen, so we went on our way, but we had barely turned on our heels when we heard the explosion." President Magufuli called on Saturday for people to stop the dangerous practice of stealing fuel in such a way, a common event in many poor parts of Africa. He issued a statement saying he was "very shocked" by the looting of fuel from damaged vehicles. "There are vehicles that carry dangerous fuel oil, as in this case in Morogoro, there are others that carry toxic chemicals or explosives, let's stop this practice, please," Magufuli said. Last month, 45 people were killed and more than 100 injured in central Nigeria when a fuel tanker crashed and then exploded as people tried to take the fuel. Among the deadliest such disasters, 292 people lost their lives in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo in July 2010, and in September 2015 at least 203 people died in the South Sudan town of Maridi.
