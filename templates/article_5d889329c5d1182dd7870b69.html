                Startup develops medical device for food safety
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                With a device as small as half a toaster, a Silicon Valley-based medical device startup aims to rival pricey existing technology that tests for infectious diseases in food, agriculture and the environment."Until now, molecular testing such as DNA or RNA, relied on traditional bulky and expensive lab-based equipment," said Yuping Chung, co-founder and senior vice-president of business operations at Anitoa Systems, LLC."The outbreak of Ebola, E. coli and African swine fever in the world proves the urgent need for globally affordable tools to rapidly and accurately identify infectious pathogens on site," he said.His Menlo Park, California-based company develops a bio-optical sensor, which, based on the latest molecular methods, allows precise and timely testing of pathogens on site, even in the field.The Anitoa sensor achieves a high level of sensitivity, which is a million times higher than the sensors in consumer digital cameras or smartphone cameras, Chung explained.The technology is originally meant for medical applications, but Chung said they have seen opportunities in new applications in food safety and environmental monitoring, thanks to the technology's low cost and portability."Today's molecular testing systems are designed for use in professional labs. It usually takes one or two hours to send the samples from a farm or ranch to the lab, and it will take one day to receive the diagnostic report," said Chung.Anitoa's device gives a test result within 10 minutes and requires a smaller amount of sample, he said."The technology can also be used for water treatment on farms or ranches, so that infectious pathogens can be detected before the used water is discharged into the ocean," he said."Strengthened regulations relating to food safety (in China) have brought increasing demand and many opportunities for us," said Chung.The company, established in 2012, currently has a research and development team in Hangzhou. It has partnered with Zhejiang Nano-systems Institute and the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University in China for clinical validation and field deployment.Partners in Beijing, Shanghai and Zhuhai are developing products using the company's integrated semiconductor chip, the core technology behind the molecular testing device."Food safety has been a top concern for the Chinese people. We are confident of the potential of our product, because there are not many choices for similar products on the market right now," said Li Liu, director of system engineering at Anitoa.Last week, the Chinese government released regulations establishing a system that holds accountable leading officials of local governments across China to ensure food safety within their jurisdictions.The officials will also be rewarded for major improvements in food safety or preventing food safety accidents from happening.The new regulations have encouraged Anitoa to develop the China market. The company will mass-produce its device in China this year and hopefully revenues will be "greatly boosted", said Liu.China not only offers a huge market but also a large opportunity for development, said Roger Royse, a Silicon Valley-based attorney and founder of Royse AgTech Innovation Network, where Anitoa is headquartered."China as a country is a quick adapter of new tech, so companies that might struggle to create a market in the US have an opportunity to get quicker market acceptance in China," he said.

                A ferry and recreational boats pass in front of the Sydney Opera House September 28, 2014. [Photo/Agencies]The Demystifying Chinese Investment in Australia report, released by KPMG on Monday, said that Chinese investment grew to more than $11.1 billion in 2015, up 32.9 percent on the previous year in terms of the US dollar (or up 59.5 percent in terms of Australian dollars). Real estate and property continues to be the leading area of investment for Chinese buyers, with 45 percent of total investment falling in this category, while renewable energy (20 percent), material investment in the healthcare sector (17 percent), mining (9 percent), infrastructure (3 percent), gas and oil (3 percent) and agribusiness (3 percent) were all prominent. The state of New South Wales remains the Chinese investor's state of choice, accounting for almost 50 percent of all investment in Australia, while Chinese money poured into the Northern Territory for the first time in 2015. More than 90 percent of total real estate investment also occurred in New South Wales. According to the KPMG report, Australia is the second most favored country for Chinese investment, behind only the United States ($118 billion in 2015). The report also showed that while investment in agriculture was small, the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA), as well as pending deals for agribusiness firms such as S Kidman and Co, had paved the way for a leap in this year's figures. KPMG co-author of the study Doug Ferguson said Chinese investment would only continue to increase on the back of government initiatives such as the Australia Week in China (AWIC) expo being held this week, and the innovation revolution announced by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull last year. "ChAFTA has helped to cement the strong relationship between our two countries, and our national Innovation Agenda is challenging Australia to commercialize fintech, medtech, agtech and cleantech products and services that can help China address its national objectives," Ferguson said. "This augurs well for continued trade with China, and continued investment by Chinese enterprise in Australia."

                    China mulls lifting ban on online lottery sales this year

                People buy lotteries at a sports lottery shop in Baoji city, Shaanxi province, on Nov 21.[Photo/VCG]Want to try your luck online? It seems that lady luck could soon be smiling as the government mulls lifting the ban on online lottery sales, said the business newspaper The Economic Observer quoting a source. According to the report, officials plan to launch new pilot programs this year to restart the sale of online lottery and held a seminar in January to discuss regulations. The paper quoted a source as saying authorities have a supportive attitude toward restarting online lottery sales.Companies will not have to get approvals from authorities, the source said, but they must come through the qualifications checks from lottery issuers - the National Welfare Lottery Center and the National Sports Lottery Center.China has two State-run lotteries: Welfare lottery from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and sports lottery from the General Administration of Sport. The two authorities and the Ministry of Finance approve lottery sales across the country.In April last year, eight central government agencies banned online lottery sales, citing risks to lottery players' interests.The Ministry of Finance pointed to "rampant irregularities" in online lottery sales and said that lottery sales organizations had also entrusted internet companies with sales services without official authorization.Lottery sales have been suspended on large platforms such as Sina.com, Taobao.com, 163.com and the lottery sales website 500.com that had been approved by the Ministry of Finance to sell lotteries online in a pilot program.The Ministry of Finance previously approved two companies, 500.com and China Sports Lottery Operation Co, to engage in online lottery sales under a pilot program.The country's online lottery sales surged before the 2015 April ban. Online lottery sales reached 85 billion yuan ($13.1 billion) in 2014, a 102-percent increase from 2013. The figure was only 3.8 billion yuan in 2009.But the country's auditors found many problems in the booming lottery industry in a largest-ever national audit covering 18 provinces and municipalities.Hundreds of websites had popped up to sell tickets online in recent years, but most of them operated in a grey area because they lacked approval to operate from the Ministry of Finance.Some companies sold fraudulent lottery tickets, and some cheated buyers through not actually buying lottery tickets.An industry source said that the pilot programs needed to have breakthroughs in the sales system, distribution channels, terminals, products and user experiences. Internet companies that have huge number of online users and advantages in big data technologies could be selected into the pilot programs, the source said.Chinese internet giants are also expected to re-activate the online lottery sales business. In March, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd took a controlling stake in Hong Kong-listed lottery operator AGTech Holdings Ltd.No matter how many companies will be approved this year to sell lotteries online, they are only in pilot programs, the source added, and authorities should announce regulations on online lottery sales as soon as possible.

                    China will need to push agtech innovation: insiders
                </p>
            </a>

                From precision agriculture and food safety, to energy efficiency and water conservation, Silicon Valley and China have much to collaborate on through agtech innovation, insiders say.Both countries face common challenges in agriculture, such as a shortage of farm labor, water scarcity risks, rising temperatures and a decrease in arable land per capita.Over the past 50 years, arable land has decreased 60 percent as a result of population growth and rapid urbanization."The major discrepancy between supply and demand for food creates a major opportunity for innovation to come up with new ways of farming and delivering food," said John Hartnett, founder and CEO of SVG Partners, a Silicon Valley-based investment and advisory firm.The current world population of 7.3 billion is expected to reach around 9.7 billion by 2050, according to a report by the United Nations' Department of Economic and Social Affairs.The middle class is projected to increase from 1.2 billion people to 4.5 billion by 2050, which is "very much led by China", Hartnett said.This is creating a massive demand – over 70 percent more food has to be produced by then – and the No 1 country being affected by the challenge around supply of food and population is China, he added."The solution is going to be innovation, as technologies will improve logistics, robotics and information to farmers," he said, "We must partner together to solve these problems between Silicon Valley, the Salinas Valley and China."Hartnett founded the Thrive Accelerator program in Salinas, California, home to some of the world's pioneering agricultural firms, to help agtech and food-tech startups deploy their technologies and improve their businesses.This year, the program has attracted 200 participants from 38 countries, double the number of the previous year. Three winners in "overall innovation", "sustainability" and "operational excellence" will be announced Wednesday during the demo day.Partnered with some of the big names in agriculture and technology, including Land O'Lakes, Verizon and Taylor Farms, the program will mentor the startups in marketing, finance and other areas.Hartnett said the firm expects "greater participation with Chinese startup companies. "We are actively looking to partner and work with Chinese accelerators, investors and government to help fund some of the startups in China," he said."China-US collaboration in agricultural technology is a natural trend, because we share one global village," said Qian He, a professor of food safety and quality control at China's Jiangnan University. "We have reached consensus that it takes every country's efforts to meet the food demand while considering the environment and people's health."Now is an opportune time to push for agtech innovation and collaboration," she said. "Chinese people are increasingly aware of the significance of innovation, as the government has been actively promoting mass innovation and entrepreneurship."Silicon Valley is the No 1 location in the world in creating technologies and attracting entrepreneurs, said Hartnett. "So on the technology front, we would like to build a strong gateway between Silicon Valley and China to identify some of the top tech companies and solutions and deploy the technologies in the industry," he said.There's also great momentum for investment, according to Hartnett. "Two years ago, investment in agriculture and agtech was less than $1 billion in the US, and this year, it attracts $4 billion. So this is a forward-looking indicator for a new ‘big opportunity' area," he said."We see investment both ways," Hartnett said. "We'd also like to partner with Chinese investors who are looking at other companies through our program and potentially bring those companies to China and deploy their technologies."liazhu@chinadailyusa.com

                    Silicon Valley works to strengthen US-China agritech cooperation

            <p class="style-content">
                SAN FRANCISCO - Agriculture experts in Silicon Valley are working with their Chinese counterparts to further collaboration in agritech innovation between the United States and China.The United States and China can collaborate with each other to tackle their common challenges in food and agriculture, such as farm labor shortages, scarce resources, and food security and safety, John Hartnett, an agritech expert in Silicon Valley, said Saturday.Hartnett sees agritech innovation as the only solution to those challenges.He visited Chinese cities of Beijing and Nanjing last month, where he met with government officials and leaders in agriculture."The meetings were very positive. They were very engaged and very focused on driving leadership in agtech," said Hartnett, founder and CEO of SVG Partners, an investment, technology and advisory firm. "I was impressed with their work and initiative, and how quickly they are moving with this initiative."The initiative he referred to is the Nanjing Modern Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Pilot Park, the first national-level agricultural innovation zone in China.Launched in July last year, the park consists of a scientific innovation center, an incubation center and a trading center. It is expected to be built into China's "agricultural Silicon Valley" by 2025."This is a big move, a big investment," said Hartnett. He has been appointed to the expert committee of the park. For the next three years, he will help with working out strategies and building a bridge between Silicon Valley and Nanjing, capital city of China's Jiangsu Province.Hartnett said his Chinese partners are interested in Silicon Valley's ecosystem and the expertise to accelerate the startups that are engaged in improving agriculture and food chain.MicroGen Biotech, a startup that joined his "Thrive" accelerator program in 2017, is an example for the type of company that is going to be successful in China, said Hartnett.The company, which applies constructed functional microbiome technology to increase crop yield and health while protecting food safety, has a specific target market in China. It has established partnerships with several Chinese state-owned companies.Hartnett noted that he sees "two-way opportunity" between the two sides. "We are interested in having access to China, where we can bring our startups solving some of the greatest challenges in agriculture," he said.

                    Pigs and technology unite for the Lunar NewYear
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The Year of the Pig has begun, and all around the world nations have been celebrating the start of the Chinese Lunar New Year. Those who hold the animal zodiac dear will no doubt be hoping for luck in wealth, love and success, and the same holds true for technology involving pigs too.Such technology may be seen as niche, but pigs play a vital role in industrial science and agricultural tech, not to mention providing an interesting area of research for AI and machine learning which can then be applied to countless other areas. Facial recognition technology is rapidly being applied to agricultural development. As fittingly, the fact that human beings are not the only animals with unique individual facial structures.AI is now being used to analyze and track pigs to monitor their movements and feed and water intake to maximize the ideal program yield for farmers. Innovative AI start-ups such as the Iowan SwineTech have also meant that farmers can also be alerted if sows accidentally sit on her babies and prevent deaths through smothering or being crushed. Such AI movement tracking abilities can also be used to prevent biting and other undesirable behaviors preemptively.Last year 2018 saw the rise of "Fitbit" technologies, wearable devices which provide the users with information regarding their health and fitness. Beloved by twentysomething joggers and anxious undersleeping corporate types, such devices are now this year being used in agriculture to further animal welfare, and especially within the pig farming industry. Farmers are able to track an animal's health animal by animal, alerting them to any sudden illness as well as monitoring vital health signs such as heart rates and signs of dehydration.Virtual reality is also another unlikely area where pigs are becoming tech superstars. Companies such as McDonald's are offering educational VR tours of swine agricultural facilities, providing consumers with an insight into how animals are reared and where exactly their food sources come from.Companies such as the North Carolina Pork Council also use such VR tours for training purposes, speeding up employee initiation and aiding learning for veterinary medical areas too. Such VR initiatives are also being deployed in many other food industries, where employee turnover is faster and rapid training is necessary to maintain a constant level of productivity. In a similar vein, Augmented Reality is being used with similar purposes within AgTech. Augmenting virtual data with a user's real life vision, one can add information to a user's vision which allows the viewer to see and gain insight into things which the human eye cannot do alone.This can enhance decision making abilities for production workers, and provide an additional layer of context for mechanical repairs and inspection processes. When combined with AI, the ability to reduce hazards in agricultural production is invaluable, and provides our beloved pigs and ourselves with additional safety. Such technology is especially valuable in China to prevent food scares by increasing the potential to spot bacterial foodborne diseases.I hope that this new year, whether you are born in the Year of the Pig or not, brings you the same success that pigs are bringing to so many different areas of technology.Precision agriculture is an area of industry which the world will increasingly rely on, given the global rapidly increasing population. As people tuck into their pork jiaozi around the world, just know that the latest cutting edge technology is allowing you to continue spending quality dinner time with your friends and family for years to come.

                    Global agri-food challenges aided by 'disruption'
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                As technology increasingly disrupts the agriculture industry, the situation also poses opportunity, which hinges on agtech innovation, according to experts."Disruption is our opportunity, and innovation is our advantage," Beth Ford, president and CEO at Land O'Lakes Inc, said at an agtech and food-tech summit at Santa Clara University in Silicon Valley.The strong industry headwinds are posing substantial challenges for agriculture sector, such as the record low farm income which has caused producers and growers to lose their business, she told the Thrive Innovation Summit, which attracted hundreds of agribusiness leaders, investors, startups and growers.Market and policy uncertainty also add to pressure, said Ford, using soybeans as an example. On average, 60 percent of soybeans produced in the US are exported to China annually, but sales to China have declined by 94 percent this year due to tariffs in the trade dispute between the two countries, she said.The solution lies in innovation, which is driven by the level of disruption, she said.Facing shared challenges in agriculture, such as a labor shortage, scarce resources and food safety, China is working to promote agtech and food-tech innovation to drive economic growth.The Chinese government reiterated its strategy to ramp up the rural economy and improve rural income in the No 1 document issued by the State Council early this year.Innovation is highlighted in the document as a strategy to boost the agriculture industry, including building agtech innovation platforms and industrial parks and nurturing agtech innovative companies.The Nanjing National Agriculture Science and Technology Demonstration Zone, the first agricultural innovation park at State level, was launched in May."We have been working actively to introduce innovative technology and recruit talent," said Wang Liwen, deputy director-general of the administrative committee of the demonstration zone, at the summit."Silicon Valley is the center of global innovation. We hope to work with Silicon Valley to build an agricultural Silicon Valley in China," said Wang, who is heading a delegation to the area.Biotech, smart agriculture, nutrition and health agriculture are among the key areas of the Nanjing demonstration zone, which will be built into a science and research center, technology transformation center, talent center and innovation center, according to Wang.He said the demonstration zone is working with SVG Partners, a Silicon Valley-based investment and advisory firm and organizer of the Thrive Innovation Summit, to facilitate exchanges and collaboration between the two sides."We have focused on the future of agriculture, where technology meets agriculture, for the last seven years," said John Hartnett, founder and CEO of SVG Partners.Through their "Thrive" platform, an acceleration program, the firm has built a community of more than 1,500 startups from 67 countries."The focus is on solving some of the biggest challenges — from field to fork, from food safety to supply chain," said Hartnett, who is also a member of the expert committee of the Nanjing innovation park.Among the nine companies that SVG Partners has selected for this year's seed accelerator cohort are two from China.The Beijing-based Alesca Life Technologies creates next-generation urban farming solutions using advanced software technology.Tensorfield Agriculture, a startup based in California and China, is working on collaborative robots that perform non-invasive, no-herbicide weeding with thermal micro-dosing.The company is finishing the development of its prototypes in Shenzhen now, said Jonathan Hua, Thrive program manager.

                    Agtech is bright spot amid trade dispute
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                In South China's Shenzhen, a Silicon Valley company is busy building its second weeding robot to be used for field trials in California spinach fields later this year."Our robot kills weeds without herbicides, using only heat energy and food-grade canola oil. One robot provides the equivalent labor of 40 workers at once," said Xiong Chang, CEO of Tensorfield Agriculture.The reason why the company chose Shenzhen is "the fastest and most capable production timelines for prototyping that we've seen anywhere in the world", said Chang.Though agriculture is among the worst sectors hit by the trade dispute between the US and China, collaboration on agriculture technology has been relatively untouched in the past year.Chang said the technology will help address a labor shortage and the proliferation of herbicide-resistant weeds — common challenges for the US and China."Agriculture is such a big import and export market. When we're talking about 'trade wars' and political tensions, agriculture will always be a big topic on a national level," said Aaron Magenheim, founder of Ag Tech Insight, a Salinas, California-based agtech consulting firm."When you're looking at the big picture, it's a lot harder than if you're looking at smaller pictures," said Magenheim. "But when you break it down to a state-by-state and commodity-by-commodity situation, it's much easier to build relationships."He said a good example is Kentucky, whose governor visited China earlier this year and met with leaders of several provinces on boosting agriculture business."Both sides picked the top 10 commodities to do business with each other," he said.The tensions between the two countries put the US at a disadvantage, as China is increasing imports from South America, which will "help grow the South America infrastructure and ag-business and economies", he said.Magenheim also acknowledged that it's "short-lived" because China will produce a lot of food it needs over the time. "The biggest opportunity will be there in Asia in five to 10 years from now," he said.Roger Royse, lawyer and founder of AgTech Innovation Network in Silicon Valley, agreed, saying that there's a "real good tech sector going on" in Hangzhou and other Chinese cities.But a problem for both the US and China is that "agriculture was that last frontier of technology", he said."Some big software companies have told me that agriculture is behind the times," said Royse. "Even now in some parts of the US, the way people collect data is walking through a field with the pad and a pencil, and they would observe and take notes, and bring it back."It's the same with China."As people leave the country, farmland consolidates and farms get bigger. That requires technology to manage," he said."When you look at Alibaba and Tencent in China's digitalization space, you know these giant companies have pretty much transformed the way data is collected in China. But that's not being done very much in the agriculture sector," said Jonathan Hua, accelerator manager of Silicon Valley-based investment advisory firm SVG Ventures."So we need that kind of level of connectedness on a farm; we need to be able to pull data from everywhere on a farm. But a lot of these farms in China have not really gone through the digital revolution, using the IoT (internet of things) sensors, data and farmland management platforms," he said.One of the examples of digital revolution in agriculture is applying Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) in farming, said Claire Pribula, managing director of the Yield Lab Asia Pacific, an agrifood tech accelerator.The remote sensing method used to measure distance, which is also fundamental to self-driving cars, allows growers to view the health and the potential yield of a crop by looking for damage from weather or looking at the chlorophyll levels and trunk dimension of trees, she said.

                    Indoor farming companies set sights on China

                Safety is a selling point as indoor space creates a pesticide-free environmentWhile indoor farming companies race to transform the future of food production, they have set their sights on China to capitalize on the country's growing demand for food production and food safety."Vertical farming is going to become important everywhere, and China does have these massive populations inside cities because people are leaving the countryside into the cities," said Roger Royse, a lawyer and founder of AgTech Innovation Network in Silicon Valley.In vertical farming facilities, plants, such as vegetables, flowers and herbs, are grown in stacked layers with a software-managed system regulating temperature, water, nutrients and LED lighting that replaces sunlight."The technology is getting so good that people are able to grow crops in the inner cities. I think that's going to be another big thing," said Royse.One of the advantages of vertical farming is that the controlled environment won't be affected by adverse natural conditions that conventional farmland often faces, said Wu Zhongbo, vice-general manager of Shanghai Xinghui Vegetables.His company purchased an aeroponics system from a US indoor farming company in 2017 and has since been exploring the technology. Aeroponics is the process of growing plants in an air or mist environment without the use of soil or an aggregate medium."We have verified the technology and now we are studying the economic feasibility," said Wu. "The cost for infrastructure and equipment depreciation is still too high, compared to conventional farming."But to Chinese consumers, safety would be a selling point since the confined indoor space creates a pesticide-free environment, he said.Despite the cost challenges, some Silicon Valley indoor farming startups are gearing up to tap into China's growing demand for organic foods as the fast-growing middle class with more buying power is willing to spend more on higher-quality produce."A head of organic lettuce sells at 35 yuan ($4.9) in high-end grocery stores in Shanghai. Our targeted customers are those who are price-insensitive," said Wendy Chen, vice-president of AEssenseGrows, an indoor farming company in Silicon Valley.Demonstration The company has a facility in Shanghai, primarily for demonstration of their indoor growing systems. Some of the vegetables produced in the facility are sold in local grocery stores.The lettuce grown in that facility, though not labeled as "organic", sells for about 25 yuan ($3.5) per head, said Chen. To appeal to consumers and to increase economic value, the company is growing seasonal salad greens or exotic varieties, such as ice plants, she said.The company has recently partnered with a major state-owned company in Shanghai to build a vertical farming facility covering a space of 5,000 square meters in the city. The project, which is in the process of getting authorities' approval, is expected to enter production next year, said Chen, who didn't disclose further details.

He also plans to employ AI technology to analyze growth data and optimize the growing condition for specific plant varieties."I hope the Chinese government can give more support to indoor farming technologies. Like solar technologies and electric vehicles, I think vertical farming will be a trend of the agricultural industry," he said.Plenty, another Silicon Valley-based agriculture startup, announced last year that it planned to build at least 300 vertical farms in or near major cities across China, and it expected the China market to contribute 25 to 50 percent of their business in the future, according to a Reuters report."China is both a good big market and a source of supply," said Royse.
