                China's Greater Bay Area seeks to catch up with world's leading economic clusters
            </p>
            <p>
                BEIJING - Since its start in March 2017, the Chinese government's initiative to develop the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA) has sought not only to turn the region into a massive cluster for advanced industries, but also to catch up with the world's leading economic hubs.In early July 2017, Chinese President Xi Jinping witnessed the signing of a framework agreement between the National Development and Reform Commission and the governments of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao on deepening Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao cooperation.The GBA development plan was officially released in February this year as part of China's overall reform and opening up strategy, aiming to build the country's southern region into a model of unique development, an international first-class bay area and a world-class city cluster."The building of this area is one of the major national strategies under the 'one country, two systems' policy. We're working hard on it and we're doing our best to catch up with those bay areas of New York, San Francisco and Tokyo in the near future," Tang Shihong, deputy director of Guangdong office for GBA promotion, told Xinhua in Zhuhai city of Guangdong Province.Tang added that the massive project provides a great opportunity to push forward reform and opening up and a new starting point for high growth development in the region.Outlining and guiding the current and future measures for the GBA cooperation and development, the plan covers the period from 2019 to 2022 in the immediate term and extends to 2035 in the long term.The fast-growing bay area consists of nine cities in Guangdong and the two special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macao, and it is expected to become a world-class city cluster by 2022 and an innovation-based region with a complete, comprehensive and integrated economic system by 2035.The GBA development plan is a manifestation of China's efforts to build an open community for coordinated innovation in the region through boosting technology carriers and platforms to enhance an innovation-based environment.The inauguration of the newly-constructed 55-km-long Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) in October last year after about nine years of building, including a 6.7-km-long immersed tunnel, marks a landmark in the development plan of the GBA."The bridge connects the coasts of Hong Kong, Macao and Zhuhai together, combining the diversified industrial characteristics of the three areas," said Min Yuntong, executive deputy chief of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Zhuhai Municipal Committee.The HZMB construction used over 400,000 tons of steel and consumed more than a million cubic meters of cement. In the end, it has become the longest sea-crossing bridge in the world.The bridge runs between two huge artificial islands, the east island and the west one, with about 400 shuttle buses running back and forth everyday carrying thousands of people between Hong Kong, Macao and Zhuhai."The HZMB connects Hong Kong and Macao with the west coast of Zhuhai, which narrows the distance between the east and west coasts and leads a rapid economic development of this bay area," Min told Xinhua.He explained that the GBA is different from other world bay areas like those of Tokyo and New York due to its diversified industrial characteristics, various development bases and larger population."This integration of these elements will make the GBA a real competitor with the world's top bay areas in the future," Min said.Yu Lie, deputy director of HZMB administration, said that the supergiant bridge will lead to a "balanced development" between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, building an economic belt and a tourism corridor in the region.The massive bridge strengthens exchange and communication between people on both sides of Taiwan Strait and promote cooperation between them in various fields, according to Yu."It also strengthens the integration of Hong Kong and Macao into China's mainland, economy, tourism and transportation," Yu told Xinhua in a recent interview during a tour on the bridge.

                Bay Area's business leaders call for Chinese participation in US high-tech development
            </a>
            <p>
                SAN FRANCISCO - As the US high tech map is evolving with some behemoths on the West Coast expanding eastward, top local business representatives think it is a good time for Chinese to come and do business.Mutual benefitIn recent months, the hot talk in Silicon Valley has been that West Coast giants like Amazon, Apple and Google have been expanding eastward to locate younger talents, political capital, business-friendly environment and cost-effective places to establish its headquarters II (HQ2) for larger shares of the market.The time is good for Chinese counterparts to expand cooperation either with the traditional West Coast or the emerging East Coast and some central states, said Jim Wunderman, head of the San Francisco Bay Area Council (BAC), and Del Christensen, who leads the Global Business Development for BAC."We think one of the advantages of the Bay Area of physical location is its proximity to China, even though it's very far away. It's the next place you go to after you cross over the Pacific Ocean. And there's a lot of relationship between here and China," said Wunderman.For example, San Francisco is a longtime sister city of Shanghai -- "a good existing strong relationship" that BAC could build on, and from Beijing, it's a shorter air trip than to New York City, he said."I would imagine that the California-based CEO would stay more connected to China just because we're closer and there's also the overlap of time. So you can take calls here in the afternoon and talk to your team in China in their morning. That's a significant advantage for the West Coast of the United States as far as doing business with China and communicating" are concerned, Christensen said.Regarding the East Coast, Christensen said, "I know that China does a lot of business in New York."This will help China become part of the so-called ongoing US high-tech "eastward expansion", which also targets other cities like Washington D.C., Boston, Austin and Pittsburgh. Companies like Uber, Facebook and LinkedIn are also trying to stoke the movement, according to him.More with ChinaWhile welcoming Chinese counterparts to both coasts to tap new and more potential for doing business, BAC itself keeps reaching out to China to forge closer ties.The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is one of their targets, with a new office mulled to be opened there.BAC currently has four offices in China -- in Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou and Nanjing -- to help US tech companies handle public affairs, catch opportunities and expand business."I think China is a terrific, exciting country for the speed of technological changes and infrastructure. We're pretty amazed by the high-speed rail system, the buildings, architecture and the excitement of people. You can really feel it from the people," said Wunderman.A lot of BAC's member companies are operating in China today. "I think the most important thing is to understand the culture of how you're doing business in another country, and understand how decisions are made," said Christensen.He recalled participation in the first China International Import Expo (CIIE) held in Shanghai in November."California is open for business. ... This year, we're gonna go again, but much bigger. A much bigger delegation, because we want to sell products. We want to erase the trade deficit by having California sell a lot of products to China," he said.In the eyes of Wunderman, "China has an incredible market."

                Nanjing promotes tech, cultural ties with Bay Area
            </a>
            <p>
                China's Nanjing is seeking more exchanges and cooperation opportunities with the San Francisco Bay Area through a series of events during "Nanjing Tech Week".Organized by the Nanjing government, the event is aimed at showcasing "the contemporary spirit and urban appearance" of the city, deepening mutual understanding and enhancing friendship, Bao Yunhai, vice-president of the Nanjing International Cultural Exchange Association, said at a conference at Stanford University on Tuesday.The Nanjing City Promotion Conference, employing the theme "exploring infinite possibilities of innovation", attracted local entrepreneurs and innovators as well as tech finance professionals."I think Nanjing is an amazing city. There's a tremendous educational foundation. It certainly is an area that international businesses have found to be very appealing," said Michael Yoshikami, CEO and founder of Destination Wealth Management, a San Francisco Bay Area-based financial services firm.He said the "catalyst"for the events is dialogue. "I think any time you have an opportunity for dialogue, particularly on a local level, in terms of the ability of working together, there's a natural synergy that occurs. It's fair to say that countries working together can be a positive way that companies can try to learn how to be better global competitors," Yoshikami said.The dialogue on a local level is "bound to have a positive impact" and "spill upwards towards more national dialogues", he added.Conference attendees also exchanged ideas at roundtable meetings.Roy Jewell, president and CEO of Palma Ceia SmiDesign Inc, said he has been in the industry for more than 30 years, but he is concerned that the US is not investing in hardware as much as in software.He said he traveled to many Chinese cities for business and found the foundries in Nanjing "very impressive". "What TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) is doing is very advanced," he said."The fact that TSMC is in Nanjing is naturally motivating for us startups," said Ming Zhang, co-founder and CEO of Mountain View, California-based zGlue Inc, which focuses on addressing the affordability and quick development of chips.Zhang's company has set up an office in Shanghai to expand business in the country. The demand of building up an industry network and learning about China's policies attracted him to the event, he said."As a Chinese American startup founder, I often find there's a lack of information about the market and related policies and regulations (in China)," said Zhang. "Such an event is very helpful for us to get first-hand information."The Bay Area is part of Nanjing's efforts to promote itself as an "innovative city and beautiful ancient capital" to the world. Nanjing, the capital of East China's Jiangsu province, was called Jinling in ancient times and was a capital for six dynasties.The city also put on an exhibition — "Light Integration" — at Union Square in San Francisco, to showcase its modern image and ancient legacy. It will run through Friday.In the theme "One City and One River", the 650-year-old Ming City Wall and the Qinhuai River are depicted through a modern art installation fusing culture and technology.

                No stopping China now
            </a>
            <p>
                US-provoked trade frictions aimed at halting the rise of a challenger to its political, economic and technological supremacy will ultimately prove futile The Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu said: "Who wishes to fight must first count the cost", yet the United States has progressively escalated its trade attack with China along with the cost to itself. In an article published in July 2018, I stated that the "trade war" that the US administration was going to start would put in peril not only the economies of both the US and China, but the economies of the entire world. At that time I labeled these frictions as a "trade war". But, right now, it is not that anymore, but something worse. It is a desperate attempt by the US administration to halt China's unstoppable rise by any means - both fair and foul. It is really a battle for political, economic and also technological supremacy. The US has been perceived for decades as the hegemon of the democratic and liberalized world, but a new alternative has risen: China. Unlike the US, China champions its principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, noninterference and assisted development for poorer countries as a hallmark of its global leadership. It has proved to be quite attractive for many countries in both the African and Asian continents whose unhappy memories of the exploitation of their land by colonial rulers are still very fresh. China's rise is undeniable and inevitable, thanks to its long-term strategic planning for national development. I could cite hundreds of different statistics to support this affirmation. Its most remarkable achievement is having lifted more than 800 million people out of abject poverty since initiating market reforms in 1978, according to the World Bank. Its poverty eradication strategy is now being eagerly copied by various developing countries. Also, according to a report released by Standard Chartered Bank in January 2019, China is poised to overtake the US as the world's top economy as early as next year; its analysts arrived at this conclusion by surveying countries' purchasing power parity exchange rates and nominal GDP (using PPP alone, China is already considered the world's largest economy, but on a nominal basis the US retains the lead). What's most impressive is the fact that China has experienced double-digit growth for most of its last three decades. It is now generally accepted as the most rapid economic development period in human history within such a short space of time. Little wonder many developing countries are adopting China's development model. Another irrefutable indicator of China's rise pertains to its technology and innovation. A study by the World Intellectual Property Organization analyzed the addresses of inventors named in all 950,000 international patent applications published between 2011 and 2015 under the Patent Cooperation Treaty: inventors in the Tokyo cluster had 94,079 patent filings, well ahead of Shenzhen-Hong Kong with 41,218 and San Jos��-San Francisco (Silicon Valley) with 34,324. Now with the Greater Bay Area project prioritizing innovative and technological successes, China will surely advance much faster under these two indicators of national modernity and economic might. The trade conflict, manufactured by the current US administration, is both needless and futile, as well as being a significant threat to global economic growth. The economies of many countries tightly integrated into the global value chain will be adversely affected. Also, fears about a further escalation have rattled investors and hit stock markets these past few weeks. In this sense, the International Monetary Fund had already predicted in October that a full-blown trade conflict between the US and China would put a significant dent in the global economic recovery. Analysts from Morgan Stanley have recently said that the collapse of the US-China trade talks and hike in tariffs on Chinese goods will push the world economy toward recession and see the Federal Reserve cut US interest rates back to zero within a year. The bank's analysts said in a note last month that "if talks stall, no deal is agreed upon and the US imposes 25 percent tariffs on the remaining circa $300 billion of imports from China, we see the global economy heading toward recession". The US nominally triggered these trade frictions to force China to stop its "unfair and abusive trade practices". The reality is that it is but a thinly disguised battle for political, economic and technological supremacy. The Huawei ban will finally give us some indication of whether China can develop its own technology in general (operating systems, microprocessors, everything else), or if the whole China tech boom was built on stolen intellectual property with no significant innovation of its own, as the US alleges. In my opinion, China will be able to develop its own advanced IT technology despite Washington banning some US tech companies from supplying Chinese companies with critical components because the latter have the potential capacity to rise to the challenge. These trade frictions may slow down China's growth, but they will not stop it. The West (basically the US) should try to collaborate with China for win-win outcomes rather than fighting it.

                Silicon Valley grapples with car break-in surge
            </a>
            <p>
                Outside a Chinese supermarket at a popular shopping mall in Milpitas, California, a volunteer came up to every shopper, reminding them to leave nothing of value in their vehicles.The mall, close to two freeways, has experienced an increase in car break-ins this year. Local authorities have partnered with the retail center by posting signs in the parking lot and cautioning shoppers about leaving belongings in their cars.In Silicon Valley, one of the wealthiest regions in the US, residents have been increasingly frustrated with "smash-and-grabs" — in which a car's window is broken and valuables inside stolen.Photos of vehicles with signs indicating the car is unlocked and there is nothing to steal circulate on social media in attempts to deter thefts.In the Twitter account "SF Car Break-ins", people post photos of their smashed vehicles and others' daily. Lost property includes cellphones, laptops, jewelry, projects they were working on, and items of sentimental value."Since a year and a half ago, we have noticed the spike (in auto burglaries)," Captain Sean Washington of the Fremont Police Department told China Daily. "Over the last year, there's been a tremendous increase in the Valley, as you can tell. All the jurisdictions are experiencing that same increase."San Jose, the largest city in Silicon Valley, reported 6,721 cases in 2018, a 14 percent increase from 2015, according to data provided by the office of California Assembly Member Kansen Chu, who successfully pushed recently for $3.75 million in state funding for several Silicon Valley cities to address the problem.The city of Santa Clara saw 125 percent car break-in increase the first three months of 2019 compared with the same period a year ago.The Newark Police Department projected a 93 percent increase this year due to the high number of incidents from January to February.Police generally blame the vibrant economy and criminals taking advantage of the situation for the spike in the smash-and-grab crimes."It's a combination of community members leaving items of value in their cars as a crime opportunity, and the profit that these individuals are able to achieve by grabbing property and then reselling it on the black market. All of that has led to the spike," Washington said."More people have cellphones and laptops now. It's more commonplace. Go backwards 10 years from now, there were not so many cellphones to steal," he said.The Fremont Police Department recently intercepted a container full of more than 1,000 laptops headed overseas, and the container was filled in just one weekend of criminal activity.The shopping centers that get hit the hardest are those near expressways and freeways because it's convenient for suspects to flee those areas, and it's usually more difficult to investigate, said Washington.Police also have found that freeways have become a more common venue for gun violence in the San Francisco Bay Area. There were 189 freeway shootings in the region between November 2015 — when the California Highway Patrol began keeping track — and April 2019, according to a report by The Guardian last month.The number of freeway shootings has increased on nearly every major highway in the region, such as the north-south Route 101 corridor linking San Francisco and Silicon Valley and the Interstate 880 corridor connecting Alameda County to Silicon Valley.Though elected officials and law enforcement could not determine the root cause for the rise of car break-ins and freeway shootings, Mary Knox, deputy district attorney for Contra Costa County, points to the displacement of longtime residents from cities, where the average cost of rent has exceeded many working-class families' budgets.Gun violence has become "more transitory and regional" in recent years, much like the lives of people who have been displaced from the Bay Area's gentrifying urban core to far-flung suburbs and now rely on highways to get around, Knox told The Guardian.In Silicon Valley, home to the headquarters of some of the world's most valuable public companies, chiefly in technology, more residents are now struggling to afford the growing costs of living as home prices continue to skyrocket.Median home prices in Silicon Valley increased by 21 percent to $1.18 million in 2018; the rental rates in the San Francisco and San Jose metro areas were significantly higher than in any other metro area in the nation, according to the 2019 Silicon Valley Index by Joint Venture Silicon Valley.Fremont Vice-Mayor Raj Salwan told China Daily that the suspects involved in those cases mostly experienced a breakdown in family structure due to an increasing income gap, displacement and other reasons."I haven't studied it, but it's something that certainly we should be looking into," said Washington.

                US faces immigration dilemma
            </a>
            <p>
                The US administration has adopted a hard-line anti-immigration stance, imposing severe restrictions even on legal immigration and hounding out illegal immigrants.The United States has implemented a string of policy measures to reduce immigration, including but not limited to banning nationals of eight Muslim countries from entering the country, reducing the annual number of H-1B visas (for temporary employment of foreign skilled workers), and enhancing the discretionary power of immigration officers in denying or delaying immigration applications.It appears that a segment of US citizens harbors strong anti-immigration sentiments and supports the restrictive policies, although the US economy is reaping the benefits of the presence of highly skilled professional immigrants. While Washington has repeatedly claimed that it still welcomes professional and well-educated immigrants, the anti-immigrant climate can have an adverse effect on this group.This climate might not only discourage potential talents from coming to the US but also prompt those who are currently working in the US to leave the country for other places. As the leaders of many US high-tech businesses have said, any barrier undermining the attraction for international talents can reduce their competitiveness in innovation and technological advancement.Anti-immigrant sentiments risingUntil the 1960s, the US had limited immigration to whites from Northwestern Europe－not even Italians or Greeks were welcome. After the racial restrictions were lifted, there was a significant inflow of immigrants from all over the world. The immigrants over the past half a century or so have been predominantly non-Europeans and their arrival in some communities has led to incremental resentment among the whites.Many factors have contributed to the rise of anti-immigrant sentiments in recent decades. While some natives are worried that immigrants are taking away their jobs and depleting the social benefits, many are concerned about the rising share of the non-white population in the country and blame it on recent immigration flows.It appears the immigrant-native ratio (I-N ratio) is a key factor in the sentiments of the "native" people toward immigration. As the number of immigrants from visibly different ethnic and cultural backgrounds has grown in recent years, the I-N ratio has ramped up, and the attitude of the "natives", who earlier were either in favor of immigration or indifferent to it, is changing because they fear their numerical majority could be threatened.This concern is also rooted in the "native" group's fear of losing its majority status in the political, cultural and economic spheres.White backlash on immigrantsAs a result, immigrant families who initially felt welcomed and accepted are gradually facing rejection, discrimination and hostility. Some American suburbs have undergone a visible transformation by virtue of the rapid influx of high-wealth, highly educated professional families from non-European ethnic groups.As the number of these visibly different residents in a community increases, the "natives" become more anxious about their "different-looking" neighbors. They try to minimize their interactions with these new neighbors and, as many social scientists have observed, the large number of non-native neighbors could lead to the atomization of these communities. Gone are the days when neighbors knew each other and had occasional, if not frequent, social interactions.Many don't even know their neighborsIn a typical street in a suburban town, you can find families of Chinese, Indian, Russian, Iranian, Arab and other ethnic groups plus ordinary European-Americans. However, it is rare to see social interactions, such as social gatherings, between two neighbors of different ethnic backgrounds. Many residents don't even know the name of their next-door neighbors. This is happening at the same time when residents are well aware of the growing ethno-isolation. If the ethnic balance of these communities shifts further in favor of new immigrants, the situation is likely to worsen.The social and political consequences of I-N ratio anxiety among the majority white ethnic group should not be ignored. The anti-immigrant groups frequently play on this ratio anxiety of the majority population to gain support for their "cause" and recruit members.This ratio anxiety (or the fear of becoming a minority as a result of immigration and higher birth rates among some ethnic communities) has shown a rising trend in European countries and the US since the 1970s, and is increasingly referred to as the "fear of replacement". As a result of the fear, political movements which call for immigration freeze or expulsion of immigrants have become more popular in Europe and North America in recent years.However, the anti-immigration movement will ultimately lead to repercussions for the US itself, as the immigrants constitute a significant percentage of the US' skilled workforce. Rejecting immigrants will deteriorate the soil for innovation and hamper the US' potential for technological development.Immigrant talents behind success of Silicon ValleySince the US abolished the Immigration Act of 1924 (which limited the number of immigrants) in 1965, the country has allowed a huge number of global talents to migrate to the country and contribute to its economy. As a result, the US has become the go-to-place for talents in mathematics, biology, pharmaceuticals, computer science and many other fields since the last quarter of the 20th century. A series of high-tech hubs have flourished under this diverse and inclusive atmosphere, which is best exemplified by Silicon Valley.According to a 2017 report by The Silicon Valley Competitiveness and Innovation Project, 57 percent of the highly skilled workers in the San Francisco Bay area were born outside the US. Another study cited by Senator Spencer Abraham found that between 1973 and 1977, more than 60 percent of the top electrical engineering graduates from the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, migrated to the US. This abundant highly skilled workforce is the key factor that ensured the technological and military dominance of the US in the ensuing decades.The rise of anti-immigrant sentiments, however, might reduce the supply of science and engineering talents that sustains the US' technological leadership in the world. The US' business leaders openly acknowledge the invaluable contribution of immigrants to the US economy. A group of top business leaders, including Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, and Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, appealed to the secretary of homeland security in August 2018: "As the federal government undertakes its legitimate review of immigration rules, it must avoid making changes that disrupt the lives of thousands of law-abiding and skilled employees, and that inflict substantial harm on US competitiveness."Immigration policy could create hostile environmentHence, in the coming years, the US policymakers will have to find a balance between the growing anti-immigration sentiment of a large segment of white voters and the need for skilled immigrants. Ignoring the ratio anxiety and replacement fear of the "natives" might increase their interests in populist and extremist political groups.This development will not only lead to the victory of populist leaders, but also can create a hostile and intimidating social environment for the immigrant community. Ultimately, it could encourage skilled immigrants to leave the US for more hospitable environments. The alienation and then outflow of skilled immigrants might eventually harm the US economy.Nader Habibi is a professor of practice in economics of the Middle East, Crown Center for Middle East Studies and Department of Economics, Brandeis University (US).

                Golden State Warriors officially open their new arena
            </a>
            <p>
                SAN FRANCISCO - Golden State Warriors Tuesday held a grand ribbon-cutting ceremony to officially launch Chase Center as their new home in San Francisco's Mission Bay neighborhood.The new 18,064-seat privately financed sports and entertainment arena, which was completed after more than two years of construction, is a new landmark on the waterfront of the Mission Bay, which will hold about 200 games, concerts, and other events every year.California Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco Mayor London Breed attended the opening ceremony, together with Warriors officials including CEO Joe Lacob, Co-Executive Chairman Peter Guber, and President Rick Welts.Newsom said the official launching of the arena, which was a megaproject that cost about $1.5 billion, marks the Warriors' return to the city from Oakland, where they played for nine years after moving west from Philadelphia in 1962.The Warriors, who have been located in the San Francisco Bay Area since then, played their home games at Oracle Arena in Oakland, east of San Francisco, from 1971 to 2019. They are moving "back to the city" from Oakland to San Francisco for the 2019-20 season.The new Chase Center arena will house the entirety of the Warriors' operations as their office headquarters will be based there.Chase Center is expected to open its doors to the public on September 6 with an inaugural concert featuring Metallica and the San Francisco Symphony. Following the opening month, the Warriors will begin their first preseason game on October 5, hosting the Los Angeles Lakers.Before Tuesday's ribbon-cutting ceremony, Warriors President Welts witnessed the unveiling of Seeing Spheres, a new outdoor public artwork consisting of five 15-foot (about 4.6 meters) polished steel balls created by Danish artist Olafur Eliasson, which stand in a circle around a central space in front of the arena.Welts told Xinhua the art piece represents the Warriors' commitment to public art, which they want to be a big part of the experience of tourists when "they come to visit Chase Center along with seeing the Warriors or seeing a concert"."When all of our friends from China come visit San Francisco, one of the things that have to be on their list is coming to see this art," he said.
