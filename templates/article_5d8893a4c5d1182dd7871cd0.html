                Sri Lanka braces for tourism recovery after blasts
            </p>
            <p>
                With more Chinese tourists flowing in, Sri Lanka looks forward to a strong tourism bounce-back as it ends a four-month long state of emergency that followed the Easter Sunday terrorist bombings and opens more airports to international traffic.Tourist arrivals from China have already propped up a slow recovery, according to industry insiders. As China and other countries have relaxed their travel advisories, more tourists are expected during Sri Lanka's peak tourism season before and around the end of the year.Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena on Friday announced the end of the state of emergency. It began after the suicide blasts set by Islamists at three Christian churches and three luxury hotels on April 21. More than 250 people were killed. Police said more than 100 people are in custody over the attacks to date.Tourism Development, Wildlife and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga on Saturday told Xinhua that ending the state of emergency sends a clear message to the world that Sri Lanka is safe for travel.As the hardest hit sector of the island nation since April, tourism is witnessing a steady increase of tourist arrivals from China, according to Ms Randima Udunuwarage, Junior Manager of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority."Out of the 1,008,449 tourists that arrived in the country by June, 97,560 were Chinese," she said. Therefore, the agency "has launched special programs in June and July to attract more Chinese tourists".Vice-President of Sri Lanka Airport and Aviation Services Priyantha Kariyapperuma said all international flights from and to Sri Lanka are operating as usual.He confirmed that the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation in Sri Lanka has issued a gazette notification allowing three more airports to accept international flights. Airports in Ratmalana, Palaly and Batticaloa join existing international airports in Katunayake and Mattala.Unlike Westerners who are seasonal travelers, Chinese tourists travel in all seasons and as Sri Lanka is a tropical country with no seasonal impact, "it is important to attract more Chinese tourists," he said.Dr Amila Kankanamge, consultant of South Asia Travel Awards, recalled a local phrase - spending like a "sudda" (foreigner), which is usually referred to spendthrifts who spend like wealthy Western tourists. Kankanamge said that the time has dawned to rephrase this to "spending like a Chinese" as more global wealth is circulating among the Chinese now.Government figures show that tourism accounts for 4.9 percent of Sri Lanka's GDP. Around half a million Sri Lankans depend directly on tourism and two million indirectly.The author, a freelance journalist for China Daily, is editor-in-chief of srilankamirror.com.

                China, South Asia to promote manufacturing upgrading
            </a>
            <p>
                KUNMING - Manufacturing upgrading is the hottest topic at the 14th China-South Asia Business Forum held in Kunming, capital of Southwest China's Yunnan province, that closed on Thursday."About 60 to 70 percent of the South Asian population live on agricultural incomes. However, more and more young people prefer to seek employment opportunities in manufacturing industries," said Rajeev Singh, director general of the Indian Chamber of Commerce, adding China's experience in upgrading manufacturing industries is worth learning from.At the forum, the Yunnan provincial sub-council of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) inked a memorandum of understanding with the chambers of commerce of six South Asian countries to build a business cooperation database, which will provide information for much-needed investment projects in the South Asian countries.There is a huge demand for infrastructure and investment in South Asian countries which involve power, communications, transport and many other fields, said CCPIT vice president Chen Zhou.He added that all parties can boost the regional economy through co-construction of overseas economic and trade parks and pilot bases for capacity cooperation.Song Guodong, general counsel of China Railway International Group (CRIG), said that infrastructure is the foundation of industrial development in South Asia.CRIG has built a number of large projects in South Asia, including the Padma Bridge in Bangladesh and the Bheri Babai Diversion Multipurpose Project in Nepal."Chinese companies will play an important role in the upgrading of Sri Lanka's manufacturing sector," said Shrima Jean, senior vice president of Sri Lankan chamber of commerce and EC member of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Economic trade between China and South Asian countries has maintained an upward momentum in recent years, with imports and exports exceeding $140 billion in 2018, up 10.5 percent year-on-year.

                Water project will benefit over 600,000
            </a>
            <p>
                China Development Bank provided 85 percent of funds in Sri LankaDeep in the hilly woods of Sri Lanka, a water plant project is under construction by Chinese and local workers. By early next year, it aims to bring clean and safe water to 600,000 nearby residents.The China Machinery Engineering Corporation, or CMEC, is the largest company involved in building the pipe-borne water treatment plant 40 kilometers north of the capital city of Colombo in the western part of the country.According to Yang Wei, executive manager at the site of Gampaha, Attanagalla and Minuwangoda integrated water supply plant, or GAMIWSS, it is one of the biggest China-Sri Lanka cooperation projects and aims to elevate the local people's livelihood.About 200 workers are presently working with steel and cement at the site. The peak phase of the project engaged 300 workers, including 200 or so local staff. The purification tank has been cThe island nation of Sri Lanka has abundant freshwater. Over two-thirds of the nation receives an annual rainfall of more than 1,500 mm and most areas are usually green. Yet, it is essential to clean existing water resources for public use.According to the World Health Organization, acidity and heavy metal residue in drinking water is one of the main causes for chronic kidney disease of unidentified etiology, or CKDu, one of the most serious non-communicable diseases affecting thousands of people in Sri Lanka and a major burden on the country's health system.Dr Kamal Gammanpila, a researcher at Imperial College University in London, said high use of chemical fertilizers also contributes to CKDu.Data from the National Water Supply and Drainage Board show 35 percent of households in the nation of more than 20 million people are in dire need of clean, pipe-borne fresh water.Yang said the water treatment plant will have a daily processing capacity of 54,000 tons and a daily water supply of 85,000 tons. It includes a comprehensive infrastructure for the supply and laying of 720 kilometers of pipe network apart from the plant itself.The builders have "to cut paths through mountains and build bridges across rivers", Yang was quoted by a report on cmec.com website."If there is no road, we build one. If there are low-lying areas, we fill them up. If the hillside goes beyond the elevation, we move it away. If the construction space is small, we increase the comprehensive utilization. Methods are always more than difficulties!" Yang said.So far, 70 percent of the construction has been completed and upon completion, he said. "After this is complete, it will cover water supply for 197 square kilometers."The Attanagalla water project, initiated in 2014, uses the water source of a branch of the Attanagalu Oya to divert water from Karasnagala. Its main objective is to solve the water needs in the Attanagalla, Mirigama, Minuwangoda and Mahara areas of Gampaha District in the Western Province.The project is 85 percent funded by the China Development Bank. The Bank of Ceylon will provide the government with the rest 15 percent. The total estimated cost of the project is $34 million.Sacred bodhi treeAt the construction site a bodhi tree is often seen draped in protective "armor" despite limited space. Yang said their staffs specially provide a piece of land for this tree because they've learned that local people see the bodhi tree as sacred because Buddha found enlightenment under a bodhi tree.Yang said usually one tower crane is sufficient for such a limited site. However, due to the special geographical location of the project, a tower crane cannot cover the whole construction area with affecting the surrounding trees. "We have no choice but to provide another tower crane in the diagonal position," he said.As one of the earliest Chinese companies operating in Sri Lanka, CMEC is keen on local public welfare while undertaking important construction projects. Whenever there is a natural disaster in Sri Lanka, CMEC is always the first foreign company to donate relief supplies to the affected people, Yang said.At the end of last year, CMEC donated a batch of water purification equipment to Mihintale Temple and the people of surrounding areas in the North-Central part of Sri Lanka.

                Clean water on way for Sri Lankans
            </a>
            <p>
                Deep in the hilly woods of Sri Lanka, a water plant being constructed by Chinese and local workers is offering 600,000 nearby residents the hope of a better life with clean drinking water. The water treatment project is being carried out by China Machinery Engineering Corp about 40 kilometers north of the capital, Colombo, in the western part of the country. Yang Wei, the executive manager at the site of the project, known as the Gampaha Attanagalla and Minuwangoda Integrated Water Supply Scheme, is one of the biggest China-Sri Lanka cooperation projects and is specifically aimed at improving local people's livelihoods. It will benefit more than 600,000 people after completion, said Yang. The plant is scheduled to be completed by early next year. Yang said the project has entered a crucial period, and the Chinese and Sri Lankan staff members are working together to guarantee that the project will be finished on time, thus helping to solve the local people's urgent need for clean drinking water. About 200 people are now working with steel and concrete at the site, and the purification tank has been completed. At its peak, the project employed 300 workers, including about 200 local people. Over two-thirds of the island nation receives annual rainfall of more than 1,500 millimeters, and most areas are usually green. However, purification is essential before the public can use the plentiful water. According to the World Health Organization, acidity and heavy metal residue in drinking water is one of the main causes of chronic kidney disease of unidentified etiology, one of the most serious noncommunicable diseases affecting thousands of people in Sri Lanka and a major burden on the country's health system. Kamal Gammanpila, a researcher at Imperial College University in London, said the high use of chemical fertilizers contributes to the chronic kidney disease. Data from the National Water Supply and Drainage Board shows that 35 percent of households in the nation of more than 20 million people are in dire need of clean, pipe-borne fresh water. The Attanagalla water project, launched in 2014, gets its water from a branch of the Attanagalu Oya River. Its main objective is to provide clean water in the Attanagalla, Mirigama, Minuwangoda and Mahara areas of Gampaha district in the country's Western province. The project is 85 percent funded by the China Development Bank. The Bank of Ceylon will provide the government with the remaining 15 percent. The total estimated cost of the project is $34 million. Yang said the water treatment plant will have a daily processing capacity of 54,000 tons and a daily water supply of 85,000 tons. The project also includes infrastructure for a pipe network of 720 kilometers. The builders have "to cut paths through mountains and build bridges across rivers", Yang was quoted as saying on China Machinery Engineering Corp's website. "If there is no road, we build one. If there are low-lying areas, we fill them up. If the hillside goes beyond the elevation, we move it away. If the construction space is small, we increase the comprehensive utilization," Yang said. So far, 70 percent of the construction has been completed. Upon completion, the project will provide the water supply for 197 sq km, he said. CMEC, one of the earliest Chinese companies operating in Sri Lanka, said it pays close attention to local public welfare while undertaking construction projects. And whenever there is a natural disaster in Sri Lanka, CMEC is the first foreign company to donate relief supplies to the affected people, it said. At the end of last year, CMEC donated purification equipment to Mihintale Temple and the people of surrounding areas in north-central Sri Lanka to help solve the problem of clean drinking water. "This measure was highly appreciated," Yang said. He also said Sri Lanka should build more purifiers and a proper sewage system to ensure clean water. Noting that many Sri Lankans use shallow wells to draw drinking water, Yang said the country has many suitable locations where water purification facilities could be built instead.
