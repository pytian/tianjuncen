                Fonterra to trim Beingmate stake
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Move part of NZ dairy giant's plan to turn around business in the Chinese marketNew Zealand-based global dairy giant Fonterra on Wednesday announced its intention to sell part of its stake in Beingmate Baby and Child Food Co Ltd, which market insiders believe may lead to the end of their four-year collaboration.Fonterra's Chief Executive Miles Hurrell said the decision is part of the company's plan to turn around its business. Fonterra currently has an 18.8 percent stake in Beingmate."This started with a strategic review of our relationship with Beingmate, which has been disappointing. The first action in this review was bringing the distribution of Anmum in China back in-house under our management," the Fonterra CEO said.Hurrell said they ended the Darnum joint venture with Beingmate, bought back Beingmate's share of the Darnum facility in Australia, and entered into a multi-year agreement for Beingmate to purchase ingredients from Fonterra.He said the company has talked to a number of parties regarding the potential sale of their entire stake in Beingmate, but has been unsuccessful in finding a buyer.Fonterra's global financial performance has been dragged down by its investment in Beingmate. In the 2017-18 year, Fonterra reported a net loss after tax of NZ$196 million ($125.5 million), with a NZ$439 million write-down on its investment in Beingmate.Beingmate reported a loss of 1.05 billion yuan ($148.9 million) in 2017 and has just recovered to post a profit of 41.1 million yuan in 2018.Song Liang, an independent analyst covering the dairy sector, said Fonterra's business in China has been thriving in recent years despite the decision at this time to end its investment in Beingmate. He said Fonterra should continue to localize its business in China to reduce market risks and consolidate its growth in the Chinese market."For Beingmate, this would serve as an opportunity to secure new strategic partners and strengthen its financing channels to keep its independence in terms of operations," Song said.Another dairy analyst, Zhu Danpeng, said it is inevitable for the two parties to grow apart, especially when Fonterra has developed its own supply chain and marketing capacities so that it became less dependent on its domestic partner's distribution channels.Hurrell said China will always be one of their most important markets. "We have a strong business in China and are still very much focused on the market," he said.In the 2018 fiscal year, the Chinese market contributed 18 billion yuan of Fonterra's total revenue. Its Anchor UHT (ultra high temperature) milk, which has entered China for six years, ranked as No 1 among imported milk brands in terms of product sales volume last year. Its food business, which includes cheese and butter, has almost 50 percent of the market in the sector in China.In June, Fonterra started a strategic review of its two wholly owned farm hubs in China, which might lead to the sale of the two farms and possibly pose a threat to its growing fresh milk and food service businesses in the country."Fonterra has contributed to China's dairy industry by developing high quality farms and showing there is a valuable opportunity for fresh milk in China's consumer market. However, we don't shy away from the fact that we've invested heavily in our China farms over the past 10 years. We will consider whether we still need to have large amounts of capital tied up in the farms," Hurrell said in replying to a question from China Daily.He said it is too soon to speculate on potential outcomes. Their fresh milk products will continue to be sold in retail stores such as supermarket chains Hema Fresh and Carrefour."The farm-to-table concept remains viable and in the future our fresh milk could be sourced from our two joint venture farms in China that are not subject to the strategic review," he said.But lack of control of dairy sources such as self-operated farms could lead to risks in Fonterra's fresh milk and food service businesses, said market analyst Shen Meng.

                    New Zealand government acknowledges the importance of NZ-China relations
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                AUCKLAND - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern reiterated on Monday the importance of New Zealand-China relations and the mutual respect and trust when dealing with disputes.Speaking at the annual China Business Summit in Auckland, Ardern retrospected her whirlwind trip to China and the mutual understanding and agreement she had achieved with her Chinese counterpart.Ardern said that the New Zealand-China relation is "in good shape", and New Zealand always regards its cooperation with China open and transparent, and abiding by the rule of law."China is New Zealand's most important and far-reaching partner," Ardern said, "It is normal that there are some disputes on some issues. But we solve these disputes on the basis of mutual respect and trust and in a mature way.""New Zealand-China relationship is dynamic. Don't define us by the bumps on the road, but define us by the things that we have achieved", said Ardern.The prime minister also expressed the New Zealand government's enthusiasm in exploring potential opportunities in the Belt and Road Initiative.Wu Xi, Chinese ambassador to New Zealand, also delivered a key note speech in the summit by pointing out the highlights as well as challenges in the China-New Zealand relations."The China-New Zealand relationship is built on decades of forward thinking, pragmatic actions and bold ideas. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, we've taken great strides to cooperate on many fields, and have an impressive list of 'firsts' among China's relations with other developed countries," she said."However, we cannot be complacent in what we have achieved. We need to look ahead, step up our pace, seize new opportunities and take concrete actions to turn them into benefits for both countries," she added.Wu also talked about how New Zealand could take part in the Belt and Road Initiative. "China and New Zealand are highly complementary in terms of our economies and skill sets. New Zealand's own development strategy can only benefit from the many natural points of cooperation that exist under the BRI", she said.New Zealand Trade Minister David Parker also gave a speech at the summit, briefing the latest New Zealand-China two-way trade and negotiation around FTA updating.By introducing his most recent trip to China and attendance at the Belt and Road Summit about two weeks ago, Parker is convinced that New Zealand should learn more about the Belt and Road Initiative and look for mutual beneficial ways of cooperation.Raymond Huo, Chair of Justice Committee at the New Zealand Parliament, resonated Ardern and Parker's position on the Belt and Road Initiative.He said New Zealand geographically sits in between China and South American countries, which are eager to explore the opportunities that the Belt and Road Initiative is bringing."New Zealand could well serve as a transfer station between China and South America to facilitate a modern time marine silk route in terms of tourism and transportation cooperation," he suggested.

                    China leads in green bonds among emerging markets
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The global green bond market has grown at a rapid pace since the first issue in 2007. Globally, new green bonds worth $167 billion were issued in 2018, with the Asia-Pacific region accounting for around 30 percent of the total.China has been leading the region's shift toward financing with green bonds, whose proceeds are used to fund environmentally friendly projects.The rapid growth of the global green bond market has been boosted by the policy commitments of 195 sovereign governments to the UN COP-21 (21st meeting of the Conference of the Parties) Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2015.The total issuance of green bonds in the Asia-Pacific region rose from an estimated $43 billion in 2017 to around $50 billion in 2018. The rapid growth of green bonds has been driven by large-scale new green bond issuance in China in 2017 and last year.China is by far the largest issuer of green bonds among the world's emerging markets. Total Chinese green bond issuance in 2018 is estimated at $31 billion, amounting to around 19 percent of total global green bond issuance last year.Hong Kong has also emerged as an Asian capital markets hub for green bond issuance, with an estimated $11 billion in green bonds issued in 2018. Chinese mainland companies are playing an important role in boosting Hong Kong's position as an international market, since an increasing number of non-Hong Kong entities choose Hong Kong for their green bond issuance.The Association of Southeast Asian Nations has also started playing a more significant role in the green bond market, after the introduction of ASEAN Green Bond Standards in 2017. Indonesia issued a $1.25 billion sovereign green sukuk bond in 2018 and a $750 million sovereign green sukuk bond in February 2019. Sukuk refers to Islamic financial certificates that are issued and traded in compliance with Islamic religious law.Australia and Japan are among the largest sources of green bonds. The Treasury Corporation of New South Wales, an Australian state government issuer, successfully placed a A$1.8 billion ($1.3 billion), 10-year green bond in November that was heavily subscribed by domestic investors as environmental, social and governance mandates become increasingly important for the asset allocation strategies of Australian asset managers.Environmental, social and governance criteria refer to main factors that investors consider regarding a company's ethical impact and sustainable practices.In 2018, the Auckland Council became the first local government in New Zealand to issue a green bond to successfully raise NZ$200 million ($132 million) to fund investment in electric trains and associated infrastructure.The decision taken by ASEAN finance ministers at a meeting in Chiang Mai, Thailand, on April 4 to launch a $1 billion ASEAN Catalytic Green Finance Facility in partnership with the Asian Development Bank highlights the increasing momentum in the Asia-Pacific region to mobilize green finance for sustainable development.The finance facility will be used to fund green and environmentally sustainable infrastructure projects such as clean energy and water sanitation. ASEAN institutional investors are also gradually adopting environmental, social and governance principles in their investment strategies, which will accelerate the development of the ASEAN green bond market.India has been a relatively late entrant to the green bond market, with its first green bond issued in 2015. In 2016, the Securities Exchange Board of India, the country's market regulator, released guidelines related to disclosures required for listing green bonds, helping to lay the foundation for further development of the green bond market.The total cumulative green bond issuances in India grew significantly in 2017 and 2018, exceeding $7 billion. The policy shift under Prime Minister Narendra Modi toward ambitious renewable energy targets also helped to boost the domestic green bond market.China has been at the forefront of using green bonds to finance sustainable development. In addition, ASEAN nations have been intensifying efforts to develop an ASEAN green bond market.At the same time, an increasing number of major institutional investors in the Asia-Pacific region are adopting environmental, social and governance guidelines for their investment strategies, increasingly putting pressure on governments and the private sector to issue green bonds that meet such standards, notably the UN Principles for Responsible Investment.At the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing in April, the International Coalition for Green Development on the Belt and Road was launched by China to promote greater use of green financing for Belt and Road infrastructure development.Thus, the momentum for growth in the Asia-Pacific green bond market is likely to increase over the medium term. The total cumulative issuance is likely to exceed $200 billion this year, and surpass $500 billion by 2025.The author is Asia-Pacific chief economist with IHS Markit.

                    NZ unveils plan to go carbon neutral by 2050
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                New Zealand's government on Wednesday introduced an ambitious climate change bill that aims to make the nation mostly carbon neutral by 2050 while giving some leeway to farmers, The Associated Press reported. However, some farming industry groups say the measures remain too onerous and threaten the future of regional communities, while some environmentalists say the bill doesn't go far enough because there are no penalties for noncompliance. The bill represents a campaign promise from the liberal government that was elected 18 months ago. The government has also promised to plant 1 billion trees over 10 years and ensure that the electricity grid runs entirely from renewable energy by 2035. The bill would require all greenhouse gases except methane from animals to be reduced to net zero by 2050. Methane emissions would be reduced by 10 percent by 2030 and by between about one-quarter and one-half by 2050. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said climate change was the single biggest challenge facing the world. "We know the climate is changing. People can see that," Ardern said. "This legislation makes a start on tackling climate change because the alternative is the catastrophic cost of doing nothing." Agriculture is a key source of overseas revenue for New Zealand, which is home to just under 5 million people but more than 10 million cows and some 28 million sheep. Those animals burp and fart methane, resulting in an unusual greenhouse gas emission profile for the country. Almost half of total emissions come from agriculture. The bill says the lower targets for methane reduction reflect that it stays in the atmosphere for a much shorter time than carbon dioxide. To come into effect, the bill would need to be passed by a majority in the Parliament. A final vote is expected later this year. Meanwhile, New Zealand Defence Minister Ron Mark announced on Wednesday that the security implications of climate change will be firmly on the agenda at South Pacific Defence Ministers Meeting, held from Wednesday to Friday in Fiji, according to Xinhua News Agency. "With the coalition government's Pacific Reset and the release of the Strategic Defence Policy Statement 2018, active engagement between New Zealand and South Pacific nations across all areas of cooperation has become more important than ever," said Mark.

                    Accused Christchurch gunman pleads not guilty to all charges in NZ court

                CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand - An Australian man pleaded not guilty on Friday to 92 charges stemming from a massacre in two mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch three months ago and will stand trial in May next year.A lone gunman armed with semi-automatic weapons attacked Muslims attending Friday prayers in Christchurch on New Zealand's South Island on March 15, killing 51 people in the country's worst peace-time mass shooting. The attacker broadcast the shooting live on Facebook.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern introduced tough new firearm laws banning semi-automatic weapons after the attack, which also wounded dozens more people.Brenton Tarrant, 29, a suspected white supremacist, appeared by video link from a maximum security facility in Auckland while his lawyer entered not guilty pleas on his behalf. The accusations against him include one terrorism charge.About 80 members of Christchurch's Muslim community and dozens of media representatives attended the hearing in a packed court room, with many seated in another room watching by video.High Court Justice Cameron Mander said the trial would begin on May 4. The prosecution expected the trial would take around six weeks, although Mander said defence lawyers believed it could take considerably longer.Courts normally try to bring cases to trial within a year but Mander said "the scale and complexity of this case makes this challenging".Tarrant has been remanded in custody until Aug 15, when the next case review hearing is scheduled.Mander said Tarrant was fit to stand trial after the court ordered him to undergo a mental health assessment at a previous hearing on April 5."No issue arises regarding the defendant's fitness to plead, to instruct counsel, and to stand his trial. A fitness hearing is not required," Mander said in a minute released to the media after Friday's hearing.The court lifted an order last week suppressing the publication of pictures of Tarrant. An interim suppression order barring the publication of the identity of survivors also lapsed and will not be reinstated.Reuters

                WELLINGTON - Dressed in a traditional Chinese robe, Jimah Ruland-Umata, a 17-year-old New Zealand Maori boy, shared his experience of learning Chinese at the Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Islands Confucius Institute Conference recently.Speaking in fluent Chinese, Ruland-Umata says: "I was introduced to Chinese in my first year of intermediate school (Year 7). It was not easy at the beginning because my primary focus was on expanding my vocabulary, completely ignoring the biggest challenge we all face when it comes to learning Chinese tones."I had no idea that there were tones in Chinese and grasping the concept took quite a while."Ruland-Umata is from the Rotorua Boys High School, in the central region of New Zealand's North Island.He admits that speaking Chinese has opened up many opportunities both inside and outside of school. He currently works as a tour guide and translator at Tamaki Maori village."I made friends with countless Chinese people and those friendships have boosted my confidence to not only learn Mandarin but also the local Beijing and Sichuan dialects, and Cantonese," he says."I still have a long way to go in learning Chinese but I am grateful for every opportunity I receive."I speak Chinese every chance I get and it makes me feel happy that I can understand a completely different culture to that of my own," he adds.Tony Browne, chairman of the Confucius Institute at Victoria University of Wellington as well as a former diplomat in China, says: "Knowledge of China's history, its culture, its language and its people underpins the political and economic relationships that all the countries of our region have with China."The Confucius Institutes, individually and collectively, are becoming ever more important in building that knowledge and providing educational opportunities for our students."Blair McRae, deputy vice-chancellor of Victoria University of Wellington, says: "Hosting the Confucius Institute is an important part of our university's engagement with China. And beyond our university, our institute serves as an important vehicle for Chinese language learning and capacity-building through their management of the Mandarin Language Assistants' program, with over 50 MLAs placed across 140 schools in the lower half of the North Island."Experts from China, Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands Confucius Institutes participated in the annual meeting.Xinhua (China Daily 07/17/2019 page20)

                New Zealand is positioning itself to become a major, strategic link between China and South America under the Belt and Road Initiative.Although the idea has been around for some time, it has picked up new momentum as the BRI gains traction globally, said Stephen Jacobi, executive director of the New Zealand China Council and one of the key drivers behind the "Southern Link" concept.He said the BRI provides a framework for New Zealand to turn the concept into reality."We know that our Chinese friends want to expand out to South America across the southern part of the Pacific. We know that our friends in South America want to reconnect back with China in the same way. So, New Zealand is ideally positioned as a hub and a conduit," Jacobi said.He said the difference in travel times is significant. Exporting through New Zealand takes up to 36 hours compared to between four and seven days through Europe or the United States.The centrality of New Zealand was one of the themes discussed at the recent Building the Southern Link conference in Auckland. The conference on June 25 attracted more than 150 international experts, businesspeople and key stakeholders from New Zealand, China, Argentina and Chile.Still early daysA spokesperson for New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Wellington was "supportive of the New Zealand China Council's efforts to explore the development of a hub in New Zealand that could link Asia with South America"."It is still early days, but the idea has a lot of potential for New Zealand businesses in all relevant markets. New Zealand businesses, in particular, are expressing significant interest in the idea."According to Catherine Beard, executive director of ExportNZ and ManufacturingNZ, there seems to be political support both in New Zealand and China for New Zealand to serve as a connector between South America and China."This is probably feasible if there is investment from our airlines flying to more destinations in South America directly－as we now do to Buenos Aires," she said."We are already very well connected to China with regular direct flights to and from Auckland and Christchurch－and I expect we will be better connected to South America if New Zealand is able to sign up to the Pacific Alliance trade deal."The Pacific Alliance is a Latin American trade bloc, formed by Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru in 2011, which all border the Pacific Ocean.Air New Zealand flies daily to Buenos Aires, while LATAM Airlines operates a daily service to Santiago in Chile.China Airlines, China Southern, China Eastern and Sichuan Airlines operate services to and from China and New Zealand.China's ambassador to New Zealand, Wu Xi, in a keynote address to the conference, said the BRI had created new energy and momentum for global economic growth, and a framework for ideas such as the Southern Link to take shape.Wu said the idea of the council fits well with the key features of the Belt and Road, namely connectivity, openness and inclusiveness. "It also shows that all partner countries in the Belt and Road have unique ideas and unique value they can offer and contribute," she said.The Belt and Road needs the active participation of all partners and stakeholders. "We need to encourage the involvement of governments, international and regional organizations, the private sector, and people from all walks of life in fostering and promoting friendship, mutual understanding and trust," she said."To this end, it is heartening to see such a diverse audience today, all committed to a common goal."

                    Fonterra to cut stake in Beingmate
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Move part of NZ dairy giant's plan to turn around business in the Chinese market New Zealand-based global dairy giant Fonterra on Wednesday announced its intention to sell part of its stake in Beingmate Baby and Child Food Co Ltd, which market insiders believe may lead to the end of their four-year collaboration. Fonterra's Chief Executive Miles Hurrell said the decision is part of the company's plan to turn around its business. Fonterra currently has an 18.8 percent stake in Beingmate. "This started with a strategic review of our relationship with Beingmate, which has been disappointing. The first action in this review was bringing the distribution of Anmum in China back in-house under our management," the Fonterra CEO said.  Fonterra's Anchor milk products are displayed at a recent exhibition in Shanghai. Wang Zhuangfei / China DailyHurrell said they ended the Darnum joint venture with Beingmate, bought back Beingmate's share of the Darnum facility in Australia, and entered into a multi-year agreement for Beingmate to purchase ingredients from Fonterra. He said the company has talked to a number of parties regarding the potential sale of their entire stake in Beingmate, but has been unsuccessful in finding a buyer. Fonterra's global financial performance has been dragged down by its investment in Beingmate. In the 2017-18 year, Fonterra reported a net loss after tax of NZ$196 million ($125.5 million), with a NZ$439 million write-down on its investment in Beingmate. Beingmate reported a loss of 1.05 billion yuan ($148.9 million) in 2017 and has just recovered to post a profit of 41.1 million yuan in 2018. Song Liang, an independent analyst covering the dairy sector, said Fonterra's business in China has been thriving in recent years despite the decision at this time to end its investment in Beingmate. He said Fonterra should continue to localize its business in China to reduce market risks and consolidate its growth in the Chinese market. "For Beingmate, this would serve as an opportunity to secure new strategic partners and strengthen its financing channels to keep its independence in terms of operations," Song said. Another dairy analyst, Zhu Danpeng, said it is inevitable for the two parties to grow apart, especially when Fonterra has developed its own supply chain and marketing capacities so that it became less dependent on its domestic partner's distribution channels. Hurrell said China will always be one of their most important markets. "We have a strong business in China and are still very much focused on the market," he said. In the 2018 fiscal year, the Chinese market contributed 18 billion yuan of Fonterra's total revenue. Its Anchor UHT (ultra high temperature) milk, which has entered China for six years, ranked as No 1 among imported milk brands in terms of product sales volume last year. Its food business, which includes cheese and butter, has almost 50 percent of the market in the sector in China. In June, Fonterra started a strategic review of its two wholly owned farm hubs in China, which might lead to the sale of the two farms and possibly pose a threat to its growing fresh milk and food service businesses in the country. "Fonterra has contributed to China's dairy industry by developing high quality farms and showing there is a valuable opportunity for fresh milk in China's consumer market. However, we don't shy away from the fact that we've invested heavily in our China farms over the past 10 years. We will consider whether we still need to have large amounts of capital tied up in the farms," Hurrell said in replying to a question from China Daily. He said it is too soon to speculate on potential outcomes. Their fresh milk products will continue to be sold in retail stores such as supermarket chains Hema Fresh and Carrefour. "The farm-to-table concept remains viable and in the future our fresh milk could be sourced from our two joint venture farms in China that are not subject to the strategic review," he said. But lack of control of dairy sources such as self-operated farms could lead to risks in Fonterra's fresh milk and food service businesses, said market analyst Shen Meng. wangzhuoqiong@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 08/08/2019 page10)
