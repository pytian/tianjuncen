                Over 820 million people hungry in 2018: UN report
            </p>
            <p>
                UNITED NATIONS - World hunger is on the rise in absolute number and more than 820 million people were hungry in 2018, a UN report said Monday.After decades of steady decline, the trend in world hunger, as measured by the prevalence of undernourishment, reverted in 2015, said "The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2019" report launched at the UN headquarters in New York.While the ratio remained largely unchanged in the past three years at slightly below 11 percent, the absolute number of people who suffer from hunger slowly increased, reaching 821.6 million in 2018, it said.The 2018 figure compared with 811.7 million people in 2017, 796.5 million people in 2016 and 785.4 million people in 2015.The report was produced by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the UN Children's Fund, the World Health Organization, the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Food Programme.According to FAO Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva who spoke at the launch, this year, the report used a new indicator -- the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) -- to measure the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity.While severe food insecurity is associated with hunger, people experiencing moderate food insecurity face uncertainties about their ability to obtain food and have been forced to compromise on the quality or quantity of their food.FIES shows an estimated 2 billion people have experienced moderate or severe levels of food insecurity, amounting to 26.4 percent of the world population.

                It's vital to save our forests to save ourselves
            </a>
            <p>
                What if no forests are left by 2050?Most of us are familiar with the old saying that sometimes we "can't see the forest for the trees". But what if I told you that, at our present rate of exploitation of our forests and depletion of our natural resources in Asia and the Pacific, we run the risk of not seeing any forest or the trees by the middle of this century?As a region, Asia and the Pacific has more people than any other part of the world, and many areas within it have very high population densities. As a result, nearly two-thirds of the forests in this region have been degraded to various degrees. Only 19 percent of primary forests remain (where human intervention has been minimal), compared with the global average of 32 percent. So what will the future of our forests look like? Will we continue down this road or will we work together to improve things?To get a better understanding of the way forward, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has just published a wide-ranging and comprehensive review of the forest sector in the Asia-Pacific region. It examines trends from the last 25 years, the current state of forests and forestry, and provides an outlook for their future to 2030 and beyond up to 2050.The FAO report is unique because it looks well beyond the horizon to what our forests could look like by the middle of this century. I say "could look like" because the mid-century predictions depend largely on the path we take through our forests in the coming years and decades. The report, Asia-Pacific Forest Sector Outlook Study III, outlines some immense challenges ahead.First, the population of the Asia-Pacific region is expected to add another 500 million people by 2030, rising to 650 million more by 2050, when about two-thirds of the region's population are predicted to be living in urban areas.Second, the middle-income group is expanding in most countries. Which is increasing the demand for forest products and creating additional pressure to convert forests into agricultural land for a variety of uses such as meat and dairy production. And this increasing demand will add further pressure on natural resources such as soil and freshwater.The FAO review shows deforestation has, through the years, left the region with huge areas of secondary forests. While replanting is of course to be encouraged, the loss of biodiversity from disappearing primary forests is a major concern.The report warns that business as usual will lead us down a path that no one really wants to travel, a dead end future where natural resources have been squandered and exhausted. It suggests a more aggressive move toward an integrated landscape management plan that systematically deals with improvements in all natural resource areas－land, forests, soil and water－and benefits communities.Innovations－making use of powerful new technologies－are needed for improved governance and management to cope with future demands on forests and land, including those in urban and semi-urban areas.Clearly, there is a role for all of us to play. There is an urgent need for societies to reduce consumption, increasingly reuse instead of discarding forest products, and sustainably produce biomaterials from forests. In short, we need to find innovative ways to balance competing demands that will benefit us all.There are, however, reasons to be optimistic. The rate of deforestation has been slowing in recent years. And, overall, big shifts in the way we interact with forests and landscapes are happening due to demographic changes, economic progress, technological advances, environmental awareness and improvements in governance. The traditional use of wood as a source of domestic energy is declining rapidly, due largely to increasing incomes, urbanization and the substitution of wood with electricity and liquefied petroleum gas. The use of printing paper has declined as our society has shifted to online media and paperless workplaces.The Asia-Pacific needs political will and cross-country cooperation of all stakeholders to maintain some of these good traits and to deal with some of the above mentioned challenges.At the end of the day, if carefully managed, forests offer solutions to food insecurity, climate change, water scarcity and energy demands－but we can only take advantage of these if we take corrective action－and do so quickly. To ensure a positive and resilient future for everyone, we need to avoid going beyond the tree line.The author is assistant director-general and regional representative for Asia and the Pacific, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

                Guizhou Ancient Tea Trees System begins application for GIAHS
            </a>
            <p>
                Guizhou Ancient Tea Trees System's application to be included in the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System is announced to have officially started in Guiyang on June 27. [Photo by Lu Yong for chinadaily.com.cn]In order to protect precious biological resources, the Guizhou Ancient Tea Trees System began its application on June 27 to be included in the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS), an initiative launched by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United States (FAO).According to Mu Degui, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Guizhou Provincial Committee and head of the Publicity Department of Guizhou province, Guizhou has more than 1.2 million ancient tea trees, making it one of the provinces with the most diverse resources of tea trees in China. It is reported that the world's oldest tea seed fossil was discovered in Guizhou's Qinglong county in 1980, which pushed the history of tea in the area to more than one million years ago.Guizhou's ancient tea trees system has important scientific value and practical significance for the inheritance of agricultural culture, the expansion of agricultural functions, as well as the sustainable development of agriculture in China.In this context, the working group serving the application process has emerged. It is composed of the Guizhou Green Tea Brand Development and Promotion Association, the Guizhou Tea Culture Research Association, Guizhou Tea Science Institute, Tea College of Guizhou University, Guizhou Tea Culture Ecology Museum, and local government branches in ancient tea areas. It will invite relevant institutions at home and abroad to assist with the goal of achieving a successful application within three to five years.Zhao Yandi contributed to this story

                Tsinghua students help preserve terrace culture with designs
            </a>
            <p>
                A series of innovative solutions designed by Tsinghua University students, including products and service systems, will help empower the traditional agricultural sector and enhance rural livelihoods in Honghe county, Yunnan province, according to an innovation incubation project.The solutions were released by the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation on Friday at a promotional event for the Ag-LabCx Innovation Incubation Project, which was co-hosted by the representative office in China of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the School of Fine Arts of Tsinghua University. The event also saw the official launch of the Honghe Innovation Plan, which will turn the solutions into reality.The incubation project, conducted earlier this year, was an eight-week thematic course on service design, which focused on the Hani Rice Terraces in Honghe.The course required students to conduct field research in the Hani Rice Terraces, and design localized products and service systems with innovative ideas and methods.About 20 Tsinghua students proposed five innovative solutions based on local conditions: the Hani Rice Terraces Adoption Program, Cultural Ecology Museum, Cultural Eco-tourism, Red Rice Development, and Cultural Protection and Promotion.One of the groups designed a WeChat program to encourage users to donate and adopt a portion of a Hani rice field. The users will be able to check on the growth of the rice through the program in the following year. When harvest season arrives, the donors will receive a bag of rice from the land they adopted.In addition, users can also learn about the customs and culture of the local Hani people, one of the ethnic minorities.Luo Chongkai, deputy head of the Honghe county government, said the proposed solutions closely matched the local resources and the characteristics of the Hani Rice Terraces. "It is based on the functions of the internet, e-commerce and new media, setting a benchmark for connecting our local farmers with the market."The FAO designated the Hani Rice Terraces as Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems in 2010. Honghe county, where the terraces are located, is a national-level poverty-stricken county.Nicholas Rosellini, the UN resident coordinator, spoke highly of the necessity of the project and said in his opening remarks that innovation in the food and agriculture sectors is "critical for improving agricultural productivity and output, farmers' income, as well as food and nutrition security".Vincent Martin, the FAO representative in China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said agricultural innovation is the central driving force to realize a world free of hunger and malnutrition."Therefore, the FAO China Office has set up an Innovation Lab that currently focuses on two fields: connecting family farmers to the market with ICT (information and communication technology), and reducing food loss and waste," he said, adding that the Innovation Lab aims at building a platform for different parties to jointly promote agricultural innovation through service design courses, design thinking and activities.

                New project to help with rural development
            </a>
            <p>
                The model Internet + Agriculture + Finance will be launched in dozens of villages in China to help alleviate poverty, achieve rural revitalization and achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs).The project Development of SDG Villages was launched in Beijing on Friday by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the China Agriculture Science and Education Foundation (CASEF), and investment bank GF Securities Co, Ltd.The project will contribute to the SDGs on "No Poverty" and "Zero Hunger", two of the 17 goals under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by world leaders in 2015.It will for three years (2019-2021) promote agricultural technology in a more inclusive way and will train local agricultural experts and leaders in green value chain development.The project can also accelerate the transformation from traditional agriculture to ecological agriculture and ensure both economic development and environmental protection.The SDG Villages project will select four poverty-stricken villages in Longshan county of Hunan province, Laifeng county of Hubei province, Meigu county of Sichuan province, and Baisha county of Hainan province as pilot villages, with a total investment of $1 million.It is expected to benefit more than 1,000 farmers.Focusing on agricultural industry development and adopting the Internet + Agriculture + Finance model, the project will provide assistance to the 16 pilot villages, including training classes and e-commerce platforms for agricultural products.It will train farmers to observe, analyze and test different approaches during the entire growing season of crops and promote green agricultural development.The project will also help farmers connect with e-commerce platforms and provide training, such as package design for online product sales.Vincent Martin, FAO representative in China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said it is the first time that FAO China has implemented a project fully funded by the private sector and that the project is "a great example of a multi-stakeholder effort for fighting against poverty and promoting rural revitalization".Zhang Wanzhen, vice-chairman and secretary-general of CASEF, said that the foundation will follow up on project implementation and participate in reviews to promote its sustainability."We will also take this opportunity to further play the role of social charity platform to mobilize more social forces and resources, to fund and support agricultural science and education, and to help promote rural revitalization and modernization," he said.

                CHINA DEVELOPS ITS SWEET TOOTH
            </a>
            <p>
                Sugar consumption rises along with living standards Despite its unattractive name, zangzangbao (dirty dirty bread) is a popular snack in China. Food lovers line up at teahouses and bakeries eager to snap up the chocolate-and cream-filled croissants with a dusting of cocoa powder on top. The snack was introduced by a trendy Beijing bakery in 2017, and the name reflects the fact that it can be quite messy to eat. Customers usually end up with sticky fingers and lips after eating the sweet treats. Zangzangbao is just one of the trendy snacks that appeal to a growing number of consumers with a sweet tooth. The country's expanding middle class is demanding sweet and tasty food, drinks such as bubble milk tea, and luxury chocolate. The demand for sweet delights is rising in tandem with China's influence on the global sugar trade. It is the world's second-biggest sugar importer, and analysts expect this huge demand to continue dictating pricing trends in the next few years. Charles Clack, a commodity analyst with Rabobank, a banking and financial services company in the Netherlands, said: "Local production is expected to stay relatively stable in the coming years, but will not be enough to satisfy overall Chinese demand for sugar. Imports will be key to satisfying China's sweet tooth. A marginal improvement in Chinese demand in coming seasons may also see imports rise slightly." According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, China will be one of several Asian countries that will experience the largest increases in sugar consumption in coming years. From last year to 2027, it expects China's sugar consumption to rise by 1.9 percent on average annually. According to the OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2018-2027, rising demand for processed products, sugar-rich confectionery and soft drinks in Asia's urban centers will boost demand for sugar. The report is released by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Loris Li, director with market intelligence company Mintel Group in Shanghai, said, "Chinese consumers with higher incomes have also increased their sugar intake." Despite growing awareness that higher sugar consumption can be unhealthy, she said these consumers prefer food and drink products that are tasty. "They don't pay much attention to the nutritional information (on food labels), as they just want to enjoy and indulge," she said. For example, Li cited the bubble tea craze, which often sees consumers line up for hours for the drink. She said a Mintel survey last year found that only 5 percent of respondents ages 18 to 49 did not buy any bubble tea during the survey period from June to August. "The rise of tea shops in recent years has lured a large number of Chinese consumers to drink beverages such as milk tea, fruit tea and cheese tea. These drinks all have high quantities of sugar," she said. Featuring fresh-cut fruit, a sweet cheese topping and freshly brewed tea, HEYTEA has become a popular brand with young consumers. Many line up for at least half an hour just to buy a cup of the beverage. Since 2017, the 6-year-old brand has doubled the number of its shops, including tea vendors and teahouses, to 198. The best monthly sales for a single shop reached 4 million yuan ($578,000), according to Huo Wei, HEYTEA director of communications. "Sweetness can bring happiness and pleasure to people, and diversified products can meet different consumers' requirements. That is why the brand has become so popular," she said. Huo said HEYTEA keeps introducing new products to consumers, which can attract younger people who like to try new things. "We will develop new products in line with the characteristics of a particular city and based on different seasons," she said. For example, in Beijing, HEYTEA has produced a special product for the city, which mixes the liquor baijiu and osmanthus tea. Gan Lin, 29, who is a big fan of sweet foods, opened a bakery in Mianyang, Sichuan province, after graduating with a law degree. She sells cakes made to order and sweets that are intricately designed and follow the latest trends. Her main customers are young women and children. The women take cakes and candies with their afternoon tea, which has become a popular activity for them, and they are easily attracted by products that are attractive or feature unique designs, Gan said. She added that candies that make people feel happier are also proving popular. Children are usually interested in chocolate cakes and candies. Many now buy them for breakfast, as their busy parents don't have time to prepare this meal for them. Mauro De Felip, general manager of chocolate brand Ferrero China, said that compared with other developed markets in Asia, individual consumption of chocolate in China is much lower, at 200 grams per capita annually. In Japan and South Korea the figure is 2,000 grams. "The chocolate market in China is booming and there's plenty of potential for growth," he said. Ferrero's business in China has grown steadily in recent years, contributing a considerable proportion of the Ferrero Group's growth. Ferrero China's year-on-year offline sales revenue in the domestic market to March rose by 4.3 percent, compared with the confectionery industry's average growth rate of 1.8 percent, according to global market consultancy Nielsen. De Felip said increased sugar consumption indicates that people are enjoying a higher standard of living. "We believe the rising chocolate industry in China is driven by the huge consumption potential from a continually expanding middle class, as well as growing needs in lower-tier markets driven by urbanization. This creates potential for the mid-to premium-end market in particular," he said. Li, the Mintel director, said the rise in food delivery services has also led to increased sugar intake, judging by the popularity of dishes with a high sugar content such as sweet and sour pork ribs and soy-braised pork. Mintel estimates that the value of China's food delivery market reached 497 billion yuan last year, and Li said food delivery services have become an indispensable part of life for Chinese consumers with more money to spend but less time to cook. Another factor is the increased demand for processed food as people live faster-paced lives. According to the latest report from the US Department of Agriculture, China's food and beverage manufacturing industries grew by 6.7 percent in 2017, accounting for 70 percent of the nation's sugar consumption. "Contacts in the industry report that consumption growth is mainly driven by carbonated beverages, as well as dairy products, especially yogurt," the report said. "Yogurt producers reportedly prefer to use natural sugar in their products in order to improve the taste." According to the International Sugar Organization in London, China is among the world's 10 biggest sugar-producing countries, with annual output pegged at 10 million metric tons. But local production can barely cope with increasing demand. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs expects domestic sugar output to rise by 4.2 percent year-on-year to 10.68 million tons from October last year to September this year, according to a Xinhua News Agency report. Sugar imports during this period are expected to reach 3.2 million tons, the same as a year earlier, while exports are expected to rise by 30,000 tons to 150,000 tons. China's sugar imports, even though unchanged from the previous year, are still seen as a supportive factor in a market recovering from last year's historic lows. Last year, raw sugar futures traded on the Intercontinental Exchange fell to a 10-year low of 10 cents a pound (0.45 kilograms), pressured by bumper crops in key exporters Thailand and India. The health-and-wellness trend has also dampened sugar demand in Australia, the United States and Europe. Prices have recovered slightly this year, with raw sugar futures trading at 12 to 13 cents per pound on the exchange in the first week of last month. Asian sugar exporters are embracing the opportunities offered by the Chinese market. For example, Pakistan will export 300,000 tons of sugar to China this year, based on an arrangement reached by the two countries' governments, according to media reports. In India, the Ministry of Commerce said the Indian Sugar Mills Association has sealed a contract with China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corp to export 15,000 tons of raw sugar. The ministry also said in a statement that India plans to export 2 million tons of raw sugar to China this year. In late April, MSM Malaysia Holdings, one of the world's biggest sugar refineries, shipped 7,000 tons of sugar to China. In a statement issued on April 26, the Kuala Lumpur company said it was its first shipment to the country. Khairil Anuar Aziz, MSM Group CEO, said the company is also setting up partnerships in China's downstream sugar industry, according to a Bloomberg report. John Stansfield, senior analyst at Group Sopex, a sugar trading house in London, said, "China is a key factor for the sugar market in 2019." He said the country's crackdown on the smuggling of refined sugar will encourage raw imports of the commodity to be refined domestically. This, in turn, will support the global trade in raw sugar. But such support could be limited, at least in the near term. Analysts note that a huge sugar surplus remains in the global market, with China holding a big inventory. The US Department of Agriculture estimates that China has more than 5 million tons in its reserves. Stansfield said that overall Chinese sugar import demand is likely to remain restricted, as there are still very large reserves that can be released on to the domestic market.

                UN: Hunger on the rise worldwide as 821 million affected
            </a>
            <p>
                UNITED NATIONS - More than 821 million people suffered from hunger worldwide last year, the United Nations said in a report on Monday - the third year in a row that the number has risen. After decades of decline, malnutrition began to increase in 2015, mainly because of climate change and war. Reversing the trend is one of the 2030 targets of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals which aim to improve the planet and its people. But getting to a world where no one is suffering from hunger by then remains an "immense challenge", the report said, noting the number of people without enough to eat had risen from 811 million in 2017. "We will not achieve zero hunger by 2030," said David Beasley, head of the World Food Programme, one of the UN agencies contributing to the report. "That's a bad trend. Without food security we will never have peace and stability," said Beasley, deploring that the media carry more talk about Brexit and US President Donald Trump than children dying of hunger. He warned that extremist groups were using hunger and control over food supplies as a weapon to divide communities or recruit new members. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report was produced by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and other UN agencies including the World Health Organization. "To safeguard food security and nutrition, it is critical to already have in place economic and social policies to counteract the effects of adverse economic cycles when they arrive, while avoiding cuts in essential services, such as healthcare and education, at all costs," it said. A "structural transformation" was needed to include the poorest people in the world, the authors said. This would require "integrating food security and nutrition concerns into poverty reduction efforts" while tackling gender inequality and the exclusion of certain social groups, they said. Malnutrition remains widespread in Africa, where around 20 percent of the population is affected, and in Asia where more than 12 percent of people experience it. In Latin America and the Caribbean, fewer than seven percent of people are affected. Adding those hit by food insecurity gives a total of more than 2 billion people, eight percent of whom are in North America and Europe, who don't regularly have access to enough nutritious, safe food, the report said. The FAO said current efforts were insufficient to meet the 2030 goal of halving the number of children whose growth is stunted by malnutrition. Robin Willoughby, the head of food and climate policy at Oxfam GB, said women were hit hardest by the rise in hunger. "A toxic brew of climate shocks, inequality and conflict is unraveling years of progress," he said. "If we are to meet the target of ending hunger by 2030, governments must urgently cut greenhouse emissions, provide more support for small-scale agriculture and increase efforts to end violent conflicts."

                FAO, Tsinghua plan agricultural project to help impoverished county
            </a>
            <p>
                The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and Tsinghua University released designs of their products and service systems for a joint agricultural innovation project on July 5.The designs are for the Hani Rice Terraces in poverty-stricken county of Honghe in Southwest China's Yunnan province, as part of the project jointly launched by the FAO and Tsinghua's Academy of Arts &Design this spring.Their plans include an adoption program for the rice fields in the region, setting up a local cultural ecology museum and finding ways to cultivate rice, according to a statement released by the FAO.Named Ag-LabCx, the project combines the FAO's expertise in agriculture with Tsinghua's academy's design know-how to create a special service design course to explore agricultural innovation.The event also saw the launch of the Honghe Innovation Plan."To realize a world free of hunger and malnutrition is the goal of the FAO," said Vincent Martin, who's the FAO representative in China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, at the launch event."We believe that agricultural innovation is the central driving force for achieving this goal."Luo Chongkai, deputy head of the Honghe county government, said the project will help to solve the major problem of how to increase the land productivity and farmers' income in the county."Based on the functions of the internet, e-commerce and new media, the solutions proposed by the Ag-LabCx fit the local resources and the characteristics of the Hani Rice Terraces, and set a benchmark for connecting our local farmers with the market," Luo said.
