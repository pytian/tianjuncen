                Central bank takes no immediate step on monetary policy after Fed cuts rate
            </a>
            <p>
                China did not immediately use the latest United States interest rate cut as an opportunity to ease domestic monetary policy, since the current rate level is adequate and liquidity ample following a recent fund injection, analysts said. But they expect that the People's Bank of China, the central bank, will support the market in other ways by possibly lowering the base rate of banks' new loans soon to reduce costs for corporate clients. "For China, prudent monetary policy is basically appropriate at present as indicated by major financial data in August, such as improved aggregate social financing and the growth rate of the broad money supply," said Sheng Songcheng, former head of the PBOC statistics and analysis department. The latest cut of banks' reserve requirement ratio, which took effect earlier this week, freed up about 800 billion yuan ($112.75 billion) and is expected to ensure that liquidity remains at a reasonable level. The move can also effectively lower financing costs of financial institutions and reduce the lending rate to corporate borrowers, both of which help companies endure external and internal headwinds, Sheng said. A major monetary policy target this year is to guide a lower lending rate to corporate borrowers and grant more credit support for production and investment. The newly reformed loan prime rate, or LPR, mechanism will help achieve this goal, according to a CITIC Securities research note. "The money market interest rate is already at a relatively low level, which is one of the reasons for the PBOC not to follow the step of the US Fed to cut interest rates," said Ming Ming, an economist at the brokerage. Another mission for the PBOC, Ming said, is to drive the interest rate of corporate loans closer to the fund rate that banks borrow from each other, also known as the interbank lending rate. Similar views were made by PBOC Vice-Governor Liu Guoqiang last month. According to Liu, the money market interest rate has decreased to a reasonable level in line with global monetary policy trends. The PBOC refreshes the LPR, the new benchmark interest rate for bank lending, on the 20th of each month, based on the quotations of 18 banks. The one-year LPR in August was 4.25 percent, which was the first post after the country's market-oriented reform of its interest rate mechanism. The market was not surprised by the US Federal Reserve's quarterpoint interest rate cut on Wednesday, the second cut in two months, to ease the disruption of the continuing US-China trade dispute and offset the weight of a global economic slowdown. The Fed suggested that it is open to a third rate cut this year. Hours after the Fed cut, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development downgraded the economic forecasts for almost all of the countries it monitors and cut its global growth projection for 2019 to 2.9 percent from 3.2 percent, the weakest level since the financial crisis a decade ago. "The quarter-point cut won't be enough to derail a slowdown and more concerns about a US recession if trade relations between the US and China start to sour again," Kamal Khan, chief US editor at Investing.com in New York, told China Daily. "But it should help the economic data look even better in the near term." To maintain a strong economy, full employment and stable prices, the Fed pumped $75 billion into the financial system on Monday and Tuesday, the first such action in about 10 years, to alleviate a sudden shortage of cash. The Fed's interest rate cut will increase the attractiveness of Chinese assets in financial markets as the interest margin between the 10-year sovereign bond in China and the US was the largest since 2015, said Zhang Wenlang, an economist at Everbright Securities. Higher interest rates in China will encourage more capital inflows from overseas, Zhang said. Contact the writers at chenjia@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 09/20/2019 page1)

                Chinese company helps Cambodian children face life
            </a>
            <p>
                Prom Vichet is brimming with hope that he can continue to help Cambodian children improve their quality of life through art education, thanks largely to donations from a Chinese company since 2016. Vichet is the executive director of the Khmer Artist for Children Organization which he founded in 2013.The nonprofit organization provides free art education to local children with the aim of helping them support their livelihood and preserve Khmer traditional and contemporary art. On Tuesday, a team of volunteers from the sponsoring Chinese company, China Duty Free Group (Cambodia), visited the KAC, donating school supplies such as backpacks, books and pens to prepare the children for the new semester. Established in 1984, China Duty Free Group is a unit of China's largest tourism conglomerate China National Travel Service Group Corp. CDFG established its first overseas subsidiary in Cambodia. More than 90 percent of the volunteers who visited on Tuesday were local Cambodian staff of CDFG. During their visit, they shared with the children stories of Chinese virtues, cooked lunch and helped them clean up their premises. CDFG has organized a series of charitable activities to support the KAC since 2016, when it first opened in Phnom Penh, its third duty-free shop in Cambodia after Siem Reap and Sihanoukville. "I am very happy that CDFG Cambodia has been helping us because we used to have a very difficult time managing the organization," said Vichet, highlighting the hardware upgrade provided by CDFG. The company also helped the KAC build a kitchen, and a lavatory. It also involved other Chinese companies and organizations in Cambodia to provide help. For example, starting August, the supplier of Chinese watch brand Fiyta initiated a campaign to donate $1 to the KAC for each watch sold at CDFG Cambodia, according to the travel retailer. Vichet said the kindness from the CDFG helped bring hope to the children, which will encourage them to study harder and give back to society when they grow up. "There are about 70 children at the KAC, most of whom are aged between 5 and 12," said Vichet, adding that the children are either orphans, or left-behind kids whose parents are working away from home, or from divorced or poor families that cannot afford school. "Many kids at the KAC failed to receive proper education but here we teach them how to make a living through art. We teach them how to paint and make handicrafts, including wood carving and wax carving," said Vichet. According to Vichet, a wax carving can be sold for about $30, of which $5 will be given to the child "artist" and the rest for managing the organization. "It is important to care more about children because they are the hope and future of Cambodia," said Yin Yunxian, general manager at CDFG Cambodia's Phnom Penh Duty Free Store. After the company came to Cambodia in 2013, it carried out various social responsibility initiatives with a focus on children. These included donations to a high school in Sihanoukville and a children's hospital in Siem Reap, according to Yin. At the KAC, children not only learn artistic skills to make a living and show off the beauty of Cambodian art, but also learn how to face the vagaries of life with the right attitude, said Yin, whose office is adorned with a painting by the KAC children. One of the children at the KAC, 16-year-old Kang Theary, said she always enjoys her time with the volunteers from CDFG because she could feel their warmth and care. "My favorite part was when they taught us how to sing, how to wash our hands and how to speak some basic Chinese," said Kang, while confessing with a shy smile that she often forgets the vocabulary. Yin said the charitable activities involving employees from Cambodia and China can also help promote mutual understanding among staff of different background. As of end August, CDFG Cambodia had over 600 employees, of which 94 percent were recruited locally. Cheem SongDy, sales supervisor at CDFG's Phnom Penh Duty Free Shop, has visited the KAC with groups of CDFG volunteers several times. "I feel happy to be part of these social activities because I can share our values and experiences with the children," said Cheem. General Manager Yin said CDFG Cambodia has kept multiple "love boxes" at its cash counters to collect tips and donate them all to the KAC.Children's artworks are also displayed in their stores for sale. Yin hopes more companies and organizations in Cambodia can pay heed to the future of children in the country and help them fulfill their dreams. Meanwhile, seeing the children's interest in learning Chinese, Vichet of KAC said he hopes to have a Chinese teacher in the future. kelly@chinadailyapac.com (China Daily Global 09/20/2019 page3)

                Turmoil affects HK's insurance sector
            </a>
            <p>
                Business dips as mainland group tours fall, customers go slow in purchasing policiesAs political protests continue in Hong Kong, the local insurance sector has taken a hit.Juwena Lai, an insurance agent in Hong Kong at Canada-based Manulife Financial Corp, said some of the insurer's Chinese mainland business was affected by recent social unrest."To my knowledge, one of my colleagues, who has many mainland customers, has seen his new business value fall at least 50 percent in recent months compared with a year ago." Lai said."Some mainland customers do have hesitation in visiting Hong Kong to sign insurance policy contracts due to the unrest," she said.The industry rules stipulate that policyholders should be physically present to sign policies in Hong Kong before insurance contracts can be finalized.According to market sources, UK-based insurer Prudential Plc and pan-Asian insurer AIA Group have cultivated agents in Hong Kong that are targeting customers in the mainland. The unrest in the city is expected to exert more pressure on their business.Some insurers believe business from the mainland has dropped 20 percent year-on-year over the last two months, market sources said.Amid the prevailing market environment, Lai has developed a mix of Hong Kong corporate and individual customers as well as mainland customers.Lai said Hong Kong-based insurers will be more aggressive in acquiring a large customer base in group medical and critical illness business as well as give more incentives to customers and commission rebates to insurance agents.Insurers are also expected to ramp up their cross-selling channels through banks and hire more insurance agents to accelerate sales in these difficult times.The total number of individual insurance intermediaries reached 104,200 last year, representing a 34 percent increase compared with 2013.The number of individual agents grew 68 percent during the same period, according to Hong Kong insurance industry watchdog Insurance Authority.Insurance agents' contribution to new business through office premiums has grown from 25.2 percent in 2014 to 38.5 percent last year.Lai's experience reveals how the Hong Kong insurance industry has suffered recently because of social unrest, Sino-US trade frictions and slowing of the mainland economy.New premiums from policies sold to the mainland visitors increased 18 percent to HK$26.3 billion ($3.37 billion) in the first six months of this year, accounting for 26 percent of total new premiums from individuals, according to Insurance Authority.The number of mainland group tours to Hong Kong fell 90 percent in the first 10 days of September as against the same period last year, following a 63 percent drop in August, according to data compiled by the Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong.The mainland customers have long flocked to Hong Kong to buy insurance policies because the products offer an investment component and payouts in foreign currencies that are hard to come by on the mainland.Lai's mainland customers come from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and these customers are going slow in purchasing more policies."It is a challenging stage for the insurance industry. We expect it will take at least several months to restore confidence in mainland customers so they can come to the city and sign insurance contracts," said Chan Kin-po, the Hong Kong Legislative Council member representing the insurance industry.In 2018, the industry's total gross premium amounted to HK$531.5 billion, a 78 percent increase over 2013. This was mainly because of an 86 percent increase in the long-term business, according to a document released by the Legislative Council Secretariat Research Office in May.The share of office premium in respect of new long-term business with mainland visitors has grown from 16.1 percent in 2013 to 39.3 percent in 2016, the document said.However, there has been a visible decline since 2016 when the central government implemented measures to ban the mainland customers from buying any investment-related insurance policy to prevent capital outflows.The current business uncertainty has also delayed the proposed implementation of the Insurance Connect, a scheme that is expected to allow the mainland customers to buy policies from any Hong Kong-based insurers without having to leave the mainland while the Hong Kong people could buy products from the mainland companies."The first phase of Insurance connect, in which Hong Kong-based insurers will establish service centers in the Bay Area, remain on the agenda while a full-scale Insurance Connect would be delayed," Insurance Authority Chairman Moses Cheng Mo-chi said on September 9.

                MTR chairman urges public to treasure HK railway amid unrest
            </a>
            <p>
                MTR Corporation Chairman Rex Auyeung Pak-kuen appealed to the public of Hong Kong to cherish the homegrown rail brand, which has braced up to throw its support behind the police in fighting against violence and vandalism that have roiled the railway system and the city. Auyeung, 67, made the appeal in an interview with a local Chinese-language newspaper. He expressed hopes for the people of Hong Kong not to push the renowned local brand that was built up by the efforts of generations into the sea. The city’s rail network, which carries an average of 5 million daily passenger trips, has become a primary target of repeated vandalism by radicals in the ongoing civil unrest that has gripped the city for more than three months.Following several deliberate disruptions of the railway services that paralyzed the metro services and affected hundreds of thousands of travelers, radicals set fires and smashed facilities at the major metro stations along the Island Line over the past two weekends.In light of that, Auyeung said the company has recruited a large number of new security guards to shield the metro operations from vandals and ensure the safety of its front-line staff members.This year marks the 40th anniversary of the start of MTR services in the city. It, however, saw its most severe challenge in its history, with more than half of the about 150 subway and light rail stations being sabotaged at a repair cost of up to HK$10 million. Not to mention, hundreds of thousands of passengers were affected by the overt challenge to the rule of law, a value the city holds dear. Auyeung did not expect the radicals would defy a High Court’s injunction order that bans deliberately obstructing the proper use of the metro services. But he assured that the cost will not be transferred to passengers by a hike in ticket fares. Several standoffs at the MTR stations turned into scuffles with MTR front-line staff amid the incessant weekend mayhem. This has saddened Auyueng, who said the railway has become sandwiched and battered by the political turmoil. Auyeung said staff members for the MTR are not trained to deal with confrontations and the corporation is not experienced in dealing with massive public activities. For societal order, the police should step in, he said.That’s why the MTR will brace up and continue to support the police for strictly enforcing the law in the face of violence and vandalism, said the newly appointed chairman of the city’s sole rail operator. Auyeung assumed office in July 1, at a time when the city’s political turmoil rocked the city for about a month. He apologized for falling short of the public’s expectations in handling the political unrest when the company arranged a free train to help anti-government radicals retreat after they confronted the police in the Yuen Long MTR station on Aug 21.Auyeung said that the special train service arrangement was to evacuate the crowd as ground traffic was obstructed, adding that it was not out of political consideration.In hindsight, it did give a bad impression to the public as it was like giving a ride to someone who refused to foot a bill after the meal and vandalized the property at the restaurant, he said.

                Thousands of Australians protest against govt inaction on climate change
            </a>
            <p>
                CANBERRA - Thousands of Australian students abandoned classes to attend global climate strikes across the country on Friday.School and university students at more than 100 protests will be joined by trade unionists and employees from more than 2,000 companies and university academics.Protesters are calling on the federal government to commit to no new coal, gas or oil projects, 100-percent renewable energy generation and exports by 2030 and funding for a just transition and job creation for all fossil-fuel industry workers and communities.Australian Education Minister Dan Tehan has repeatedly declared that "politics should be kept out of the classroom.""Students should be active citizens but their education shouldn't suffer as a result ... The true test of the protesters' commitment would be how many turned up for a protest held on a Saturday afternoon," he said in a statement earlier in September.Despite similar government warnings, earlier protests in March attracted more than 150,000 people around the country.Siobhan, 15, from Western Australia (WA), chose to attend the protest despite being told that she would automatically fail a maths test worth 25 percent of her overall grade if she missed school."I have basically been told that because it is not a valid reason to be missing school, it is not a medical reason or anything, I am going to get a zero on the test if I don't actually sit it," she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)."Even though we ourselves aren't sick, the planet which we live on is, and we are protesting and fighting for it," Siobhan said."We are in the midst of a climate crisis, and Australia is in the thick of it," she said.Figures released in August showed Australia's carbon emissions were continuing to climb.Prior to the strikes more than 250 academics from Australian universities published an open letter saying that the government's inaction on climate change required civil disobedience."Australia's current climate policies and practices are dire," the letter said."When a government wilfully abrogates its responsibility to protect its citizens from harm and secure the future for generations to come, it has failed in its most essential duty of stewardship," the letter said.Thousands of companies have signed an online registry pledging to either close their doors, extend lunch hours or give employees the day off to attend the protests.The campaign was launched by superannuation fund Future Super with the aim of getting 50 employers to sign up but the number has soared past 2,200.The founder of Future Super Simon Sheikh said that most of the companies who have signed up have never previously taken a stand on climate change."These are mainstream businesses, they're tech businesses, design companies, start-ups, there's a furniture store involved, retailers are involved, a lot of tradespeople, there are a number of doctors surgeries who are closing for the day or having long lunch breaks," he told The Sydney Morning Herald."Usually it's employees mobilizing collectively against and lobbying an employer, but now it's all of us standing together," he said.

                Ministry: No tolerance for rigid approaches to local pollution
            </a>
            <p>
                China's top environmental watchdog reiterated its zero tolerance toward local governments' one-size-fits-all approaches to cope with environmental inspections and vowed to roll out effective measures to safeguard enterprises' legal rights and interests.Liu Youbin, spokesman of the Ministry of the Ecology and Environment, also said in a news conference on Friday that taking a one-size-fits-all approach to shut down companies ahead of inspections instead of fulfilling their duties in pollution control in daily work is "a typical act of formalism and bureaucracy".The act "not only tarnishes the image and credibility of the Party and the government, but also damages companies' legal rights and interests". It also goes against the original aspiration and mission of ecology and environmental protection work, he noted.Local authorities resort to one-size-fits-all approaches mainly because of their failure to fulfill their routine duties. The ministry had launched a three-month campaign to address the problem on Sept 1, he said.The Sept 4 notification issued by a district government in Linyi of Shandong province that shut down and suspended a large number of businesses to cope with an inspection on air pollution control is a typical example of one-size-fits-all conduct found in the campaign. The ministry has asked local authorities to carry out immediate rectification and hold accountable those officials who made the decision, he said.The ministry will watch closely regarding such approaches and investigate all such acts, he stressed.He also said the ministry will ramp up law enforcement to urge local authorities to strengthen their routine supervision to address the problem at its root.
