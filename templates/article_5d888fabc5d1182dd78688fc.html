                Deal for biggest naval ship inked with Thailand
            </p>
            <p>
                China to build Type 071E amphibious transport dock ship for foreign navyChina will build a Type 071E amphibious transport dock ship for export to Thailand, the largest naval ship the nation will have built for a foreign user.China State Shipbuilding Corp, a State-owned shipbuilding conglomerate and one of the major suppliers to the Chinese Navy, said last week it had inked an agreement with the Royal Thai Navy on the construction and sale of the Type 071E, adding it was the first time China had sold such a vessel to another country.Admiral Luechai Ruddit, commander-in-chief of the RTN, and officials from the Chinese government and military took part in a signing ceremony for the deal in Beijing on Sept 9, according to a statement issued by CSSC.The company said the deal was a major new accomplishment in the strategic cooperation between the two countries, adding it would substantially deepen collaboration in the arms trade and also help strengthen regional peace and stability.The shipbuilder did not provide details about the ship's specifications, or its construction and delivery schedule.The Type 071E is an export version of the Type 071 landing platform dock deployed by the People's Liberation Army Navy. There are six Type 071s in service with the PLA Navy, according to military observers following the Navy's weapons development.According to information from CSSC, the Type 071 is China's largest landing craft and boasts advanced weapons systems. It is 210 meters long and 28 meters wide, and has a full-load displacement of 25,000 metric tons. The vessel is capable of sailing more than 18,500 kilometers in a single operation, the company said.An insider in China's naval shipbuilding industry, who wished to be identified only as Che, said that compared with the existing Type 071 vessels in the PLA Navy, the export version features better weapons and can carry more helicopters.The Type 071E amphibious transport dock ship, also classified as a type of landing platform dock, will be the largest naval warship China has built for a foreign country.After the ship is delivered to the RTN, it will also become the biggest warship in the Southeast Asian nation's fleet, eclipsing HTMS Chakri Naruebet, the flagship of the RTN and its only aircraft carrier.The largest naval ship China has exported so far is HTMS Similan, a Type 908 replenishment ship built for the RTN in the 1990s that has a full-load displacement of 22,000 tons. That makes it bigger than HTMS Chakri Naruebet, but it is not classified as a warship.

                Shipbuilding giant to focus on high value-added vessels
            </a>
            <p>
                Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Co Ltd, a subsidiary of State-owned China Shipbuilding Industry Corp, the country's primary contractor for its naval force, will shift its focus from building conventional ships to high value-added vessels to cast off the negative influence caused by the ongoing Sino-US trade dispute, said a senior executive.Due to bilateral trade tensions, the world's goods and commodity trade activities have declined since March last year and this has severely affected shipowners' enthusiasm and banks' confidence in building new bulk vessels, chemical tankers and container ships, said Yang Zhizhong, president of DSIC.Eager to put its revenue growth on a firmer footing, the company will focus on building very large crude carriers, liquefied natural gas carriers, floating oil and gas production units, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels, as well as making innovation breakthroughs in heavy industry, new material and environmental protection products."About 85 percent of ship parts and equipment such as diesel engines and marine propellers today can be purchased from domestic manufacturers," said Yang, adding the company will gather more resources to compete with South Korea in the field of building LNG carriers, pushed by China's cross-border reform in the natural gas sector, including market-oriented reform, transparency and improved infrastructure.To ensure China's energy security, it is necessary for the nation to develop LNG carriers, because it will help the country import the increasingly widely used energy from other parts of the world such as Qatar, Malaysia and Russia, said Tan Naifen, deputy secretary-general of the Beijing-based China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry.According to global independent maritime research consultancy Drewry, China will import between 60 million metric tons and 100 million tons of LNG annually by 2022, which means that the market will need around 60 to 100 LNG carriers by that time.It is estimated that there will be about 500 LNG carriers worldwide by the end of this year and the number will jump to 600 by 2022.Building LNG carriers requires more advanced technology than building conventional storage tanks. They need to store LNG at a temperature of-163 C and are mostly powered by steam turbines. Each LNG carrier can be sold for $200 million to $250 million.Dong Liwan, a professor of shipbuilding at Shanghai Maritime University, said domestic players certainly see this area as a must-have and not a nice-to-have market. It is time for capable Chinese shipyards to make complex, high value-added vessels to reach buyers in new segments via international collaboration, research and development activities.DSIC is not alone, Shanghaibased Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding (Group) Co Ltd, a shipbuilding unit of China State Shipbuilding Corp, is building the world's largest liquefied natural gas carrier with a capacity of 270,000 cubic meters to cope with the rising demand for the clean fuel in the nation.The Shanghai-based company has joined hands with Norway-based internationally accredited registrar and classification society DNV-GL for construction of the carrier. Under the deal, research and development work on the new vessel is set to be completed by the end of 2020.In addition to building LNG carriers, DSIC delivered the world's first intelligent VLCC named New Journey to China Merchants Energy Shipping Co Ltd in late July to further diversify its production line in the field of high-end shipbuilding.Built over a period of three years, the VLCC is 333 meters long and 60 meters wide. Its dead weight is up to 308,000 tons.In the construction of New Journey, the shipbuilder received strong technical support from several research institutes, including the Shanghai Merchant Ship Design and Research Institute and the Shanghai Electrical Apparatus Research Institute.Yang from DSIC said the company will keep a close eye on market demand in Greece, Germany and member economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to stabilize its export channels and develop markets participating in the development of the Belt and Road Initiative.Supported by more than 1,100 researchers, the Dalian-based shipbuilder gained 20 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) of sales revenue in 2018, with 850 million yuan of profit. It is the only domestic equipment manufacturing enterprise group that runs business in five industrial sectors - military projects, shipbuilding, offshore equipment building, heavy industrial projects, ship maintenance and vessel scrapping.

                US desperate to boost presence in region
            </a>
            <p>
                The US-ASEAN maritime exercise that started on Monday is the first joint naval drill between the United States and the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. However, the multilateral drill has raised speculation over US involvement in Southeast Asia despite the negotiations between China and some ASEAN members such as Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam making good progress toward resolving their territorial disputes in the South China Sea.Since the White House seems determined to push ahead with its so-called Indo-Pacific strategy, the US administration has made desperate efforts to expand its influence and boost its military presence in the Asia-Pacific region by strengthening its ties with regional allies and promising to safeguard the security of other countries.The US-ASEAN naval drill, which the US claims is aimed at "maintaining maritime security and preempting wrongdoings in the sea", is part of Washington's policy to advance its Indo-Pacific strategy and strengthen its presence in Southeast Asia.
