                Motorcycle teams gear up for Yunnan race
            </a>
            <p>
                 Over 50 teams of leading drivers across the country have confirmed their participation in an annual motoring event at Yunnan's Anning from Oct 25-27, officials announced at a news conference Sunday in Beijing.2019 marks the seventh year for Anning to host the Greater Montenegro Cross Country Motorcycle Endurance Grand Prix, but this year the event witnessed its promotion rise to a national level, said Zhang Tao, deputy secretary-general of the Federation of Automobile and Motorcycle Sports of China.Contestants will compete on tracks that feature rock barriers and mining fields. Wang Min, vice-mayor of Anning, said they try hard to make the tracks as challenging as those of some international tournaments such as the world-renowned Austrian Mining Competition.This not only helps hone the skills of domestic drivers but also delivers a visual feast to audiences, continued Wang.In response to the call to promote sports from countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, the tournament will welcome more international drivers in the near future, according to the event organizers.

                10 films on real-life police stories planned
            </a>
            <p>
                A film franchise backed by Ministry of Public Security plans to make 10 films about nine police officers and a police detachment, a first- of-its-kind project for Chinese film industry.The project was announced at a recent Beijing event jointly held by the ministry, the China Film Association and the streaming giant iQiyi.Titled as Wo Shi Jing Cha (I'm a Police Officer), the franchise covers a wide range of different law enforcement units, including those responsible for counterterrorism, hunting criminals, and cracking down on drug rings as well as maintaining social order.Zhang Hong, the deputy chairman of the China Film Association, says that the stories of police officers are a treasure trove for filmmakers across the world, exemplified by gangster movies in the United States and cops & robbers films in Hong Kong.He says he hoped mainland filmmakers would produce movies about their own police heroes, highlighting their heroism to protect the country.Work on two movies, titled Operation Sword and Hunting Criminals Over 1,000 Miles, has recently started in Liaoyang, in Liaoning province, and Jixi, in Heilongjiang province.All the 10 movies will be produced by iQiyi and its production companies.

                Open classes on traditional Chinese culture reviewed in Beijing
            </a>
            <p>
                An assessment meeting on traditional Chinese culture open classes was held in the conference hall of the Ministry of Education on Wednesday. The activity, "Power of Inheritance" organized by China Youth Daily, and hosted by the Department of Physical Education, Sanitation and Art Education under the Ministry of Education, was aimed at promoting excellent traditional Chinese culture through physical and art education at school.The nation's education experts attended the meeting and reviewed some open classes.From April to June this year, the Ministry of Education collected excellent open classes on traditional Chinese culture from middle and primary schools, as well as colleges around the nation. There were 999 schools that handed in a total of 1,373 open class videos, covering music, fine art, traditional festivals, traditional sports items and intangible cultural heritage items. Some representative intangible cultural heritage inheritors walked onto the podiums, and the campus has become a major channel in passing on traditional Chinese culture.There were 32 works from 18 provinces or regions entering into the final which were presented on the assessment meeting. Experts shared their views on how to better promote Chinese culture through sports and arts courses on campus during the meeting.Yang Yu, one of the attendees from Sichuan Normal University, said that a teacher's passion for traditional culture determines the height and depth of his teaching design."I believe that, with such activity, and teachers devoted to Chinese culture, excellent traditional Chinese culture will surely be better inherited and innovated," Yang said.
