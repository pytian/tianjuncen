                IranZarif questions 'peace' coalitionIran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Friday questioned US plans for a coalition for a "peaceful resolution" in the Middle East while listing repeated Iranian diplomatic initiatives. "Coalition for Peaceful Resolution?" Zarif said in a statement on Twitter, and listed eight diplomatic initiatives by Iran since 1985, including a peace plan for Yemen in 2015, and a regional nonaggression pact for the Persian Gulf region proposed earlier this year. The United States said on Thursday it was building a coalition to deter Iranian threats following a weekend attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US was seeking to build a "coalition aimed at achieving peace and a peaceful resolution".

                Riyadh joins US-led coalition after attack
            </a>
            <p>
                Pompeo heads to Saudi Arabia amid fallout from strikes blamed on TeheranDUBAI, United Arab Emirates - Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday it joined a United States-led coalition to secure the Middle East's waterways after an attack targeting its crucial oil industry.Riyadh's decision to enter the International Maritime Security Construct came ahead of a planned visit by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo from Wednesday.Saudi officials separately planned to share information about the weapons used to attack a Saudi oil field and the world's largest crude oil processing plant on Saturday.Yemen's Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack, but the US and Saudi Arabia say they suspect Iran carried out the assault. Iran denies that, though it came amid a summer of heightened tensions between Teheran and Washington over its unraveling nuclear deal with world powers.The state-run Saudi Press Agency carried a statement on Wednesday quoting an unnamed official saying the kingdom had joined the International Maritime Security Construct.Australia, Bahrain and the United Kingdom already have joined the mission."The kingdom's accession to this international alliance comes in support of regional and international efforts to deter and counter threats to maritime navigation and global trade in order to ensure global energy security and the continued flow of energy supplies to the global economy and contribute to maintain the international peace and security," the statement read.US military officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.The coalition aims to secure the broader Persian Gulf region. It includes surveillance of the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of the world's oil travels, and the Bab el-Mandeb, another narrow strait that connects the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden off Yemen and East Africa. Smaller patrol boats and other craft will be available for rapid response. The plan also allows for nations to escort their own ships through the region.The US Navy already has sent Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers to chokepoint positions, like either end of the Strait of Hormuz. There, they observe ship traffic and monitor for anything unusual as drones and other aircraft fly surveillance routes overhead.The US blames Iran for the apparent limpet mine explosions on four vessels in May and a further two in June that were sailing in the Gulf of Oman near the Strait of Hormuz, something Iran denies being behind. Iran also seized a British-flagged oil tanker and another based in the United Arab Emirates.It's unclear what role Saudi Arabia will play in the coalition. Bahrain already serves at the headquarters of the US Navy's 5th Fleet.Wednesday's announcement also came after Saudi Arabia's energy minister said late on Tuesday that more than half of the country's daily crude oil production that was knocked out by the attack had been recovered and that production capacity at its targeted plants would be fully restored by the end of the month."Where would you find a company in this whole world that went through such a devastating attack and came out like a phoenix?" Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said about state-owned Saudi Aramco, which was the target of the attacks. His question to reporters, many of them Saudi, drew applause.Prince Abdulaziz said Aramco will honor its commitments to its customers this month by drawing from its reserves of crude oil and offering additional crude production from other oil fields. He said production capacity would reach up to 11 million barrels a day by the end of September and 12 million barrels in November.He said production at the Abqaiq processing facility is at 2 million barrels per day.Oil prices spiked on Monday, with benchmark Brent crude having the biggest percentage gain since the 1991 Gulf War. Prices dropped on Tuesday around the time of the Saudi announcement. Brent traded on Wednesday morning around the same prices as the day before, with a barrel costing over $64.Pompeo was due to land in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, where he was scheduled to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Pompeo later will travel to the United Arab Emirates on Thursday to meet with Abu Dhabi's crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Both nations are US allies and have been fighting against the Houthis in Yemen since March 2015.Agencies

                CNNC nuclear technology in spotlight at IAEA General Conference
            </a>
            <p>
                CNNC took the spotlight during the 63rd IAEA General Conference by demonstrating how it applies nuclear technology.The conference was held in Vienna on Sept 16 and will run until Sept 20.On Sept 17, a gathering of dignitaries visited the Chinese nuclear technology demonstration area to learn about nuclear technology recently being applied in industry, agriculture, medicine, and security in China.The delegation, accompanied by Yu Jianfeng, chairman of CNNC, included Cornel Feruta, acting director-general of IAEA, Zhang Jianhua, deputy director of the China Atomic Energy Authority, Liu Hua, deputy minister of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, and Wang Qun, China's ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary and permanent representative to the United Nations and other international organizations in Vienna.During the visit, Zhang and Yu gifted CNNC nuclear security equipment to IAEA, the second time China has offered gifts to IAEA.Feruta learned about CNNC's Nigerian Miniature Neutron Source Reactor (MNSR) conversion program, saying that China endeavors to deliver on its responsibility as a major power and plays an important role in helping prevent nuclear proliferation.He expressed hope that China would continue working with IAEA to explore more nuclear application possibilities.During the conference, Yu also met with a number of his counterparts from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Argentina, and Pakistan.In recent years, nuclear technology has begun being used on a large scale in irradiation processing, nuclear medicine, and public security in China.CNNC, with the approval of the China Atomic Energy Authority, demonstrated how nuclear technology has been applied in China over the past decade, with a special focus on how China uses nuclear technology to improve people's lives.

                US and Iran should be guided by reason: China Daily editorial
            </a>
            <p>
                Continuing to blame Iran for Saturday's attacks on two Saudi Arabian oil facilities, Washington is mulling imposing fresh sanctions on Teheran. But without foolproof evidence to support its action, the United States would put the cart before the horse if it announced new sanctions against Iran.That the news of the US considering such a move can increase the already high tensions in the Middle East is evident in Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif raising the specter of an "all-out war", and stressing that if the US or Saudi Arabia attacked Iran, it would have to fight to its last soldier.True, the attacks on the major Saudi facilities have shrunk the country's oil production almost by half and hiked global oil prices, sparking grave concerns over global oil supply. But the developments should prompt the US to more seriously consider the possible spillover effects of another punitive action against Iran on the regional situation and the world economy.Ignoring any such rational thinking, however, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the attacks an "act of war" against Saudi Arabia after Riyadh displayed missile and drone wreckage on Wednesday and other evidence claiming the raids were "unquestionably sponsored by Iran".Unfortunately, Pompeo's remark raises the fear of the US using military measures against Iran. Given Iran's pivotal location, that would affect global oil supply, not to mention there is no guarantee the US' move will not ignite, unwittingly or otherwise, the powder keg that the region has become.Judging by US President Donald Trump's remarks, it seems he understands the grave risk Washington would be taking by triggering another war in the Middle East.To be fair to Iran, it is not responsible for the current situation. The main cause of the tensions is the US' withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal despite the International Atomic Energy Agency saying Teheran had fully complied with the multilateral deal.Yet, amid rising tensions, both parties seem to have left some room for reconciliation. While the White House has not ruled out a meeting with Iran's top leader, Zarif said Iran hoped to avoid conflict, adding that Teheran was willing to hold talks with Riyadh, and the possibility of a return to negotiations with the US depends on whether Washington would provide full sanctions relief as promised under the 2015 nuclear deal.In the long run, therefore, keeping the Iranian nuclear deal alive, and ensuring it is implemented both in letter and spirit, is the only viable way of resolving the US-Iran conflict and defusing the tensions in the Middle East.

                Trump says US imposing sanctions on Iran's national bank

            <p>
                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump said on Friday that his country is imposing sanctions on Iran's national bank following attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities.Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House, claimed that the new sanctions on Tehran are the "highest sanctions ever imposed on a country."The latest punishment came two days after Trump revealed in a tweet that he had instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to "substantially increase Sanctions on the country of Iran."Washington has been indicating that Iran was behind Saturday's drone attacks on oil production facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia, a claim that has been strongly denied by Tehran.

                Iran displays downed US, British drones
            </a>
            <p>
                TEHRAN - Iran on Saturday displayed the debris of recently downed US and British drones by its air defense system.In the showcase, called Hunting Vultures, Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) displayed the remaining pieces of a US military drone downed by the country's air defense system in June in its southern waters.On June 21, Iran announced that it had downed a US RQ-4 Global Hawk "spy drone" which had violated Iranian airspace near the Strait of Hormuz.The IRGC also displayed the Aerosonde HQ vertical take-off and landing drone belonging to the US Army used for multi-intelligence payloads such as electronic warfare and communications relay in a single flight.Aerosonde has been designed for expeditionary land and sea-based operations and equipped for simultaneous day and night full-motion video.Desert Hawk was another captured American drone showcased in the exhibition. It has a length of 0.86 meters with a weight of 3.2 kg. It has an endurance of about an hour with an electric motor driving a quiet pusher propeller.Besides, a British unmanned aerial vehicle, named Phoenix, seized by the IRGC in the country's territorial region recently, was put on show. Phoenix is an all-weather, day or night, real-time combat surveillance drone.According to Press TV, Iran, in 2015, downed a US RQ-170 Sentinel stealth aircraft with minimal damage. The drone was flying over the Iranian city of Kashmar, near the Afghan border, when it was brought down.During the exhibition on Saturday, IRGC Commander Hossein Salami said Iran will never allow a war on its soil.Iran will follow and destroy any "aggressor" who stages even a limited attack on the country, said Salami."We will hit anyone who violates our borders," he said, adding Iran has so far demonstrated only part of its military capability.

                Iran releases seized British oil tanker
            </a>
            <p>
                TEHRAN - Iran released British oil tanker, the Stena Impero, detained in the Strait of Hormuz in July for "maritime violations," Tasnim news agency reported on Sunday.Allahmorad Afifipour, the general manager of Iran's Hormozgan Maritime and Ports, confirmed the release of British tanker, saying that the vessel will start its voyage from Iran's Bandar Abbas port to the international waters "soon."Although the tanker is allowed to leave Iran's waters, "the legal dossier for its violations is still open in Iran's judiciary," Afifipour was quoted as saying.Iran detained the Stena Impero on July 19, alleging that it had violated the maritime regulations while passing through the Strait of Hormuz two weeks after Britain seized an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar.Earlier, Iran released seven crew members of the oil tanker.The Iranian officials have ruled out any link between Stena Impero's case and British seizure of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 off the coast of Gibraltar.The Grace 1, renamed as Adrian Darya 1, was released by the Gibraltar authorities on Aug 16.
