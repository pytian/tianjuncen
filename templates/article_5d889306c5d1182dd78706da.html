                    Washington's smear campaign against Huawei doomed to fail
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                US President Donald Trump said last week that he wants the United States to become a technology leader through open and fair competition rather than by blocking others of their "currently more advanced technologies." The message came as a surprise because US officials have been busy waging an aggressive smear campaign against Huawei, Chinese telecommunications equipment maker and the world's leading 5G technology player.In the week leading to Trump's speech, US Vice-President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo went from Warsaw to Munich to Brussels to pressure Europeans to ban Huawei from their 5G networks or face US "punishment".Many expected Trump's words to put an end to the smear campaign, but they have proven ineffective. Major European countries have come out one after another, saying they will make their own decisions, and some have already refused to impose a total ban on Huawei as ordered by Washington.However, the US State Department has ignored Trump's remark that Washington does not seek to artificially block any companies in 5G. At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona which opened on Monday, US State Department ambassador for cyber and international communications Robert Strayer continued to portray Huawei as a national security threat, without providing any evidence.The logic for Strayer and other US officials seems to be that Huawei is guilty until proven innocent, a violation of the legal principle that has been held dear by the international community, including under the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That is why Vodafone CEO Nick Read, who operates the biggest mobile carrier in the Western world, questioned the unsubstantiated allegation by the US. Read not only warned that removing Huawei equipment would be "hugely disruptive" to 5G rollouts, but also said that he prefers to make sure "we have a fact-based conversation".Read was not alone. I sought the views on Tuesday of Clemens Fuest, a prominent German economist, who also challenged the logic of assuming that a company poses a security threat simply because it is based in China.While the US has been making all kinds of speculative allegations against Chinese telecom companies, Huawei's rotating chairman Guo Ping shed light on Wednesday by calling out the US as the true threat to cybersecurity.In an article in the Financial Times, Guo said that if the US National Security Agency wants to modify routers or switches in order to eavesdrop, a Chinese company will be unlikely to cooperate. He cited a leaked NSA document which said NSA wanted "to make sure that we know how to exploit these (Huawei) products". Guo argued that Huawei "hampers US efforts to spy on whomever it wants," emphasizing that "Huawei has not (planted) and will never plant backdoors".In a 2014 article, the German news magazine Spiegel, too, had revealed that the NSA made considerable efforts to spy on Chinese politicians and companies, with Huawei being a major target.The current episode reminds people of five years ago when the US, then led by president Barack Obama, lobbied its European allies to not join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, by questioning the AIIB's governance and environmental standards. However, major US allies from Europe to Asia, such as the United Kingdom, Australia and the Republic of Korea, all defied the US and became the founding members of the AIIB.That seems to be increasingly the case as more countries from Europe to Asia to Africa to Latin America defy the US and embrace Huawei's 5G technology, a technology that is a product of global cooperation.The author is chief of China Daily EU Bureau based in Brussels.

            <p class="style-content">
                Security software provider 360 Security Technology Inc has announced it will launch the "brain of home security", a comprehensive smart system deploying artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing and other technologies, to solve home security problems in the near future.Zhou Hongyi, CEO of 360 Security Technology Inc, believes that people are entering the age of big security. "After years of development, society and the internet have become extremely close. Today, the internet actually breaks the boundaries between the physical world and the virtual network," said Zhou, whose security company is known for its anti-virus software."Cybersecurity is not only related to the internet, but involves even personal security. That's why we will launch the brain of home security to target increasing threats to home safety," Zhou said.He fears that as the internet of things will foster tens of billions of connected devices, every single device may be attacked by hackers, which will pose threats to the safety of personal information and property.Zhou said the goal of the home security brain is to let people enjoy the future smart life with no worries.According to the company, the home security brain, a smart device connected to all the smart devices in the house, will serve as the data storage and processing center. And the smart brain will offer a safer option to store all the data encrypted locally instead of being uploaded to the cloud, the company said."Our internet of things strategy will not be working on appliances or building department stores. Instead, we aim to combine IoT products with cloud servers, solving real-life home safety problems," Zhou said.For instance, when the smart doorbell camera captures a courier, the home brain will analyze the recorded video, recognize the person's identity and then send the message to users' smartphones, Zhou explained.Statistics from 360 Security Technology show that the number of phishing and malicious websites have grown rapidly during the last five years, and per capita losses from online scams also increased year by year.According to the data, 33 percent of teenagers have been sent by pornographic information, and 36 percent of them have encountered online fraud. In addition, middle-aged and elderly people are also vulnerable to online fraud.To better serve working families and protect home safety, 360 Security Technology has introduced a wireless firewall router, which offers an anti-addiction system and payment notification, prevents harmful content, intercepts bilk websites and prevents smart devices being controlled by hackers.The company has also launched its first AI speaker, which offers two voices for children and elderly people. It has introduced voiceprint technology to allow child users to wake up the speaker, ensuring that the speaker will not offer harmful messages to children.Tencent Keen Security Lab noted in a recent report that with the blossoming IoT technologies, new security problems have popped up.According to the report, the number of devices connected via the IoT, excluding smartphones, tablets, laptops and landlines, has reached 7 billion, and is estimated to hit 22 billion by 2025.After the automated security monitoring of 486 latest IoT devices, a total number of 16,508 security risks were detected. Smart speakers topped all other IoT devices in terms of the highest number of security risks, followed by web cameras, routers, drones and smart door locks.Zhao Wu, chief executive officer at Beijing Huashunxinan Technology Co Ltd, noted botnets - vast networks of virus-infected computers that obey secret commands from a faraway controller - will attain stronger capabilities to attack internet-enabled devices in the future.

                They say language divides, but human emotions can breach barriers where language fails. We must also not forget, as George Bernard Shaw once said, that England and America are two countries divided by a common language.It actually takes a visit to a new country to see the emotions I mentioned earlier at play. Within an hour of arriving in Beijing, I was out on the street enquiring where to find a "market", a word I believed was international but turned out not to be.Residents extended their cellphones, gesturing to me to key in the word and on checking the Mandarin translation, pointed in the right direction.

                    WiFi-6 will change how we connect but many wonder what it is
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                5G is the big incoming tsunami of innovation that has captured the imagination of both consumers and startups that have gleefully anticipated the opportunities it promises.However, we still spend much of our internet surfing time attached to wireless internet networks, whether this be at home, in the office, or in coffee shops. The (usually) free and generous nature of Wi-Fi, which allows for connection to the internet in most public places, is attractive to people who may have fast data connections but limited data down to the exact megabyte. A recent study by Verizon found that, on average, smartphone users spend 139MB of cellular data per day, compared to 268MB over Wi-Fi networks.The incoming next generation of Wi-Fi networks, called WiFi-6, is causing great anticipation among the tech community. Due to be released later this year, promises have been made that WiFi-6 will increase the performance and reliability of wireless networks. Many manufacturers have been building Wifi-6 support into existing Wi-Fi routers, in the hope of future-proofing their products.The main advantages and changes that WiFi-6 offers comes not only in connection speed gains, but the increase in computational intelligence in managing various connections from different mobile devices. The capacity, therefore, on a WiFi-6-enabled router to stream multiple devices while maintaining connection quality will be something that home consumers and especially businesses will appreciate. In an increasingly crowded world of gadgets, organizations that can quickly bridge everyone together will be able to make quick decisions and collaboration efforts.The reach of WiFi-6 signals will also be superior to their predecessor networks.The current generation of networks relies, more or less, on technology from 2009. WiFi-6 will allow signals emitted from a single router to extend to around a football pitch away. This is not just down to signal strength, but the fact that networks will have the new ability to send stronger signals specifically to devices that they have identified as being near the edge of signal range. Whether devices connecting to WiFi-6 networks are enabled for the sixth generation or not, mobile device users will also find that WiFi-6 will let them save on battery life because the signals are more efficient and require less energy to receive and transmit.With any new technology, though, accessibility is crucial. Existing routers will be, to some degree, backwards compatible. Even if routers are not WiFi-6 certified, they will be able to pull signals. Possessing WiFI-6-compatible devices, however, will just mean that the experience will be optimized. The fact that so many people still use Wi-Fi services, whether on the train, in the mall, or in schools and offices, goes a long way to show that this technology is still an important part of our infrastructure. 5G may, in the future, reign supreme, but connecting to managed services such as Wi-Fi will still hold an appeal for many years to come.
