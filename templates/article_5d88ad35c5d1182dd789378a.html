            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Overtures advanced harmonious relations last year A nine-car train carrying 100 passengers departed from Seoul, capital of the Republic of Korea, on Dec 26 at 6:45 am for Panmun station in Kaesong, a border city in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It was the first time an ROK train had run on the Kumgang-Tumen line, which runs along the DPRK's east coast, since the Korean War (1950-53). The train arrived about 10 am on Dec 26 to cheers and music, and had a slogan on its side that read, "Let's open an era of peace and prosperity together." The 100 passengers included government officials, lawmakers and aging relatives separated by the war. They witnessed the unveiling of a project to reconnect the two countries by rail, heralded by ROK President Moon Jae-in as "the beginning of a wide range of exchanges and cooperation". Moon and top DPRK leader Kim Jong-un held a landmark summit in April, at which they agreed to modernize and eventually link the northern and southern parts of the Gyeongui Line, which runs along the west coast of the Korean Peninsula, and the Donghae Line on the east coast, as well as roads that span the border along the two coasts. The difference between the rail networks in the DPRK and ROK is striking. In his meeting with Moon in April, Kim conceded his country's trains were in an "embarrassing" state. Some commentators said modernizing the DPRK's rail lines to bring them up to international standards could take years or decades and would require billions of dollars in investment. Freight services began operating in 2007 between Munsan station in the ROK and Panmun station in the DPRK to support operations at a now-shuttered joint factory park in Kaesong. The ROK used the trains to move construction materials north, while clothing and shoes made at the factory park were sent south. The line stopped operating in 2008 due to nuclear tensions between the countries. Moon has said many times that better inter-Korean relations would reduce tensions, and that joint projects to improve the DPRK's infrastructure are an investment in the future of the Korean Peninsula, which could be of great benefit to both sides in the long term. Since taking office in late 2011, Kim has pushed for market-oriented economic development. At the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee in April, he said the WPK would "concentrate all efforts of the whole party and country on socialist economic construction". At his first meeting with Kim, Moon reportedly laid out his plans for the DPRK's development on a USB memory stick. Ultimately, the ROK wants to see a high-speed rail line linking Seoul and Pyongyang, the DPRK capital, and extending north to Sinuiju, an important trade hub on the Chinese border. At the Moon-Kim summit, both sides agreed that better roads and railways, and the ability to move goods and people quickly and reliably, would help boost economic activity. They also agreed to work together to improve roads and railways in the eastern transportation corridor from Pyongyang to Sinuiju. It remains to be seen whether connecting the two countries will pave the way to denuclearization. But this is possible after a year in which relations on the Korean Peninsula changed dramatically. Three inter-Korean summits, three China-DPRK ones and the first-ever DPRK-US summit took place last year, easing tensions caused by the prospect of a nuclear war. Overtures began on Jan 1 last year, when Kim said in his new year's speech he was willing to send a delegation to the Winter Olympics being staged by the ROK, and talk with Seoul to end military tensions. This soon translated into reality at the opening ceremony of the 23rd Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang on Feb 9 when ROK and DPRK athletes marched under one flag with a blue silhouette of the Korean Peninsula in the center - a symbol of peaceful unification to spark hope of inter-Korean rapprochement. This sporting diplomacy boded well. In late April, it was announced that the two countries would hold their first summit in 11 years. With a single step forward in the truce village of Panmunjom on April 27, Kim crossed a concrete block marking the border before shaking hands with Moon, a simple gesture that marked a significant first step toward peace on the peninsula. On May 24, the DPRK destroyed tunnels at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, where it had conducted all six of its nuclear tests, and announced that the complex would be dismantled, marking the start of denuclearization on the peninsula. During a second meeting with Moon on May 26, Kim said he was willing to hold a summit with United States President Donald Trump, and promised to further the denuclearization of the peninsula and improve inter-Korean ties. The peaceful momentum between the two neighbors led to the historic US-DPRK summit on June 12 in Singapore. A 13-second handshake, five hours of negotiations, and a four-point joint statement marked the meeting on the resort island of Sentosa. The courtesy and regard Kim and Trump extended to each other were poles apart from six months earlier when their bellicose insults embroiled the peninsula in a "doomsday scenario". According to a comprehensive joint statement signed at the summit, Washington would commit to providing security guarantees to the DPRK in exchange for Pyongyang promising complete denuclearization. Further negotiations and concrete actions by the two sides are expected. Fan Jishe, a senior fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said, "Both Washington and Pyongyang achieved some political victories and some strategic benefits in 2018." Kim and Trump set a path toward a new type of US-DPRK relations, offering flexibility for the two sides to engage in dialogue without compromising their positions. The agreement they reached, though short on detail, showed that the two leaders had not traveled to Singapore just for a photo op. The third Kim-Moon summit took place in Pyongyang on Sept 18, during which the two leaders decided to expand bilateral cooperation on economy, tourism, culture and sports. The ROK earmarked 1.1 trillion won ($970 million) for the cooperation fund with the DRPK for this year. Lee Jung-nam, professor at the Asiatic Research Institute of Korea University in Seoul, said, "A peaceful mood has come to the Korean Peninsula." While detente spread rapidly across the Demilitarized Zone and the Pacific Ocean, Kim's three visits to China last year were widely believed to have played an indispensable role in laying the groundwork for regional peace. Before his meetings with Trump and Moon, Kim visited China on March 25, his first foreign trip since assuming office. When meeting with President Xi Jinping, Kim said, "The issue of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula can be resolved if the ROK and the US respond to our efforts with goodwill and create an atmosphere of peace and stability while taking progressive and synchronous measures for the realization of peace". United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on March 29 he was extremely encouraged by Kim's visit to China and praised the country as "a very important contributor to a solution in this region". Two days after the Sentosa summit, during a meeting with Xi, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo conveyed Trump's appreciation of the Chinese president's important advice and help over the Korean Peninsula issue. Pompeo said the US was willing to work with China to promote the realization of denuclearization and lasting peace on the peninsula. When meeting with DPRK Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho in Beijing on Dec 7, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi called on Pyongyang and Washington to resume their dialogue and resolve each other's concerns "in a balanced way", adding that China supports both Koreas in advancing reconciliation and cooperation. Aiming to foster a peaceful environment on the peninsula, China put forward a series of solutions including a dual-track approach" and a "suspension-for-suspension" proposal. The dual-track approach aims to promote parallel progress in denuclearization of the peninsula and the establishment of a mechanism for peace in a synchronized and reciprocal manner, ultimately achieving both goals together. The latter proposal, which calls for the suspension of nuclear and missile activities by the DPRK and the suspension of large-scale military exercises by the US and ROK, seeks to bring the two Koreas back to the negotiating table. During a phone call with Moon on April 29, Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed that the importance of continuing the efforts of all parties involved toward a political and diplomatic settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue should follow a road map proposed by Russia and China. While Pyongyang and Seoul have been striving to form a closer relationship, DPRK-US relations have witnessed on-again, off-again twists since the Sentosa summit, casting a shadow on the prospects for peace on the peninsula this year. Lee, from the Asiatic Research Institute of Korea University, said, "Unless the DPRK and the United States normalize bilateral relations, inter-Korean relations cannot be developed over the long run." She indicated that distrust between Pyongyang and Washington is undermining the hard-won stability in the region and raising concerns that progress may be halted. On Dec 10, the US Department of the Treasury announced new sanctions against three senior DPRK officials for serious human rights abuses and censorship, incurring Pyongyang's wrath. The DPRK said Washington was "bent on returning DPRK-US relations to the state they were in last year (2017)". Negotiations after the Kim-Trump summit have also stalled due to differences on a series of key issues including the scale of denuclearization, US sanctions and whether to issue a declaration that war between the Koreas had ended. At a news conference on Dec 18, US State Department deputy spokesman Robert Palladino reiterated that Washington would maintain sanctions and pressure against the DPRK until the "final, fully verified denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" had been achieved. In response, the DPRK's Korean Central News Agency said Pyongyang would not give up its nuclear weapons until the US stopped making regional nuclear threats, citing the US troops stationed in the ROK, and the so-called nuclear umbrella that protects the ROK and Japan. Trump said a second meeting with Kim may take place this month or next, but there has been no confirmation of this from Pyongyang. Fan, from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said: "Both Trump and Kim want a second summit ... There is always a danger that either side may feel frustrated at the lack of progress and could try to create leverage by building up tension." Lee said, "In 2019, the key point will be a second DPRK-US summit. If Kim and Trump reach a visible agreement and Kim visits Seoul early in the year, it would become a game changer." panmengqi@chinadaily.com.cn  DPRK and ROK government officials take part in a groundbreaking ceremony at Panmun station in Kaesong on Dec 26 for a rail link between the two countries.Korea Pool / Newsis Via Ap(China Daily 01/08/2019 page1)

                China has always played an active role addressing the Korean Peninsula issue and makes consistent efforts to push for the denuclearization of the peninsula. China's role helps to propel positive trends in the region and facilitate better communication and coordination.During 1997 to 1999, the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the United States and China held conversations many times to discuss setting up a permanent mechanism to peacefully address the Korean peninsula issue.

                SEOUL - The Republic of Korea (ROK) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DRPK) shared understanding on the trial withdrawal of guard posts from areas near the inter-Korean border, according to the ROK joint media pool reports.The result came after military delegations from the two sides held general-grade talks on Tuesday at the Peace House, a ROK building in the border village of Panmunjom.The five-member delegations from the ROK and the DPRK shared views over the pullout of guard posts inside the demilitarized zone (DMZ), a buffer zone separating the two Koreas, on a trial basis.The two Koreas also understood the need to disarm the Joint Security Area (JSA), a jointly controlled area in Panmunjom, and to jointly excavate the remains inside the DMZ of soldiers killed during the 1950-53 Korean War.The military delegations, however, failed to reach any agreement on the issues and to announce any joint statement.Maj. Gen. Kim Do-gyun, a chief ROK delegate, told reporters after the talks that the two sides agreed to continue dialogue on how and when to implement the issues through exchange of letters and working-level contacts.The general-level military dialogue between the two Koreas came as the second of its kind after the April 27 summit between ROK President Moon Jae-in and top DPRK leader Kim Jong Un.During the summit, Moon and Kim agreed to reduce tensions near the border areas and stop all hostile acts.During the general-level military dialogue on June 14, the two Koreas agreed to completely restore military hotlines along the eastern and western corridors across the inter-Korean border. It was the first such dialogue in more than a decade.

                China and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea should keep up high-level exchanges and carry out events marking the 70th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries next year, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday.He made the remarks when meeting with DRPK Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho in Beijing. Ri is paying a three-day visit to China, which started Thursday.This is the fifth meeting between the two this year.Wang said 2018 has been an extraordinary year for the China-DPRK relationship.General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea, have held three meetings within this year.The important consensuses reached between Xi and Kim have pushed bilateral ties forward into a new historical period, Wang said.With the concerted efforts of China, the DPRK and other related parties, the situation on the Korean Peninsula has eased and the peninsula nuclear issue has been back on track for political resolution, an outcome in line with the common aspiration of many parties including the DPRK, he said.Wang said it is an unswerving policy of the CPC and the Chinese government to maintain, consolidate and develop good relations with the DPRK and China firmly supports the DPRK in taking a development path that meets its own conditions.China supports the DPRK's efforts to maintain stability, develop its economy and improve people's livelihoods, he said.According to Wang, China stands ready to work with the DPRK to promote greater development of bilateral relations according to the consensus of top leaders, as well as the common will of people in both countries.Both sides should keep high-level exchanges and enhance strategic guidance over bilateral ties, he said.He also called on both countries to carry out next year's events marking the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties, promote their traditional friendship and strengthen exchanges and cooperation in various fields.Wang said China hopes the DPRK and the United States can keep up dialogue and solve their own concerns in a balanced way in order to realize the goals set by their joint statement.China also supports strengthening communication and interaction between the DPRK and the Republic of Korea to promote reconciliation and cooperation, he added.Ri, for his part, said the DPRK-China relationship has achieved new development this year and the foreign ministries of both sides have made positive progress in implementing the important consensuses reached between top leaders.The DPRK spoke highly of China's active efforts in promoting the political resolution of the Peninsula nuclear issue in real time according to the situation, and is willing to keep up communication and coordination with China so as to jointly safeguard the stability and development of the peninsula and the whole region, he added.

                Front-line experience shows a different side of the DPRK Editor's note: As a new year gets underway, China Daily reporters look back at some of the people and events that impressed and motivated them in 2018. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea can seem a mysterious place for people who only get a glimpse of it from occasional news stories. I was among their number until I met a group of veteran businessmen who specialize in trade with the country, which borders China and imports all kinds of supplies from its larger neighbor. Now, the country is less abstract to me. I've interviewed scholars who can talk about the DPRK's relations with the rest of the world for hours (literally). However, I believe those businessmen, who make a living by constantly visiting the country and meeting its people, are the sort of experts we should listen to more. In June, I interviewed Zhou Linqing, a 54-year-old entrepreneur from Dandong, Liaoning province, which borders the DPRK. We sat in his office, which was playing host to boxes of DRPK-style cold noodles, as well as a polite and extremely friendly female trade representative from the country. "They (the people of the DPRK) are no different from us. They just do things differently," Zhou said, sensing the feeling of surprise I had been trying hard to conceal. No expert on DPRK issues has ever told me something so fundamental and important when trying to understand the country. In December, Zhou traveled to the DPRK and was taken to a new seafood restaurant in Pyongyang. "I was surprised to learn that the customers are prohibited from smoking in the restaurant. You see, the country is keeping up with the rest of the world," he said. Zhou was on a tour organized for a group of potential Chinese investors. He feels that the DPRK's economic development is still slow, and UN-imposed sanctions have exacerbated the situation. "It was worse than I had expected, but the locals are still very proud and confident," he said. During the trip, Zhou noticed many apartment buildings under construction in Pyongyang. DPRK officials told him that the apartments are part of a major housing project, which aims to improve people's lives. However, the UN's ban on steel imports has slowed construction, while sourcing materials has also become an issue. "Many people in the DPRK asked us when the sanctions will be lifted. That's my question, too," Zhou said. "Still, it's a country that is eager to develop its economy and is packed with potential - especially for Chinese entrepreneurs who are the real backbone of China-DPRK trade." In Dandong, Zhou's hometown, a new bridge crossing the Yalu River that separates China and the DPRK was completed several years ago, but it stands idle. He told me the locals regard the bridge as a symbol. "China-DPRK economic cooperation will get on the fast track when the bridge is finally opened to traffic," he said, adding that he has his eyes set on the golden opportunities that will flow when sanctions are finally lifted.

The peninsula remains in a technical state of war because of the armistice agreement.Kim called Trump's walk across the border a "courageous and determined act" to liquidate an unpleasant past and pioneer a good future.President Moon joined Kim and Trump later, talking with each other with beaming smiles. It marked the first time in history that the leaders of the two Koreas and the United States met in Panmunjom.Kim and Trump walked into the Freedom House, a ROK building in Panmunjom, for the 50-minute closed-door meeting.Before the one-on-one meeting, Trump sat with Kim in front of reporters, with US and DPRK national flags standing on the background, saying that it was a "great honor" to have become the first sitting US president to step into the DPRK.The DPRK leader said the handshake of peace with the US president represented a difference in relations between the two countries, which had long been hostile in the past. Trump thanked Kim for accepting his invitation.Trump invited Kim to meet through his Twitter message Saturday, saying at a press conference in Japan that he would feel comfortable stepping over into the DPRK if Kim showed up.After the face-to-face meeting between Trump and Kim, the three leaders walked out of the Freedom House together, then Trump and Moon bade farewell to Kim.Trump told reporters that the United States and the DPRK would set up teams, with the US team led by Stephen Biegun, special representative for the DPRK affairs, to resume the stalled denuclearization talks in two to three weeks.Trump said he hoped for a comprehensive deal between Pyongyang and Washington, but he noted that "speed is not the object" as both sides looked to "get it right".Regarding the sanctions against Pyongyang, Trump opened a possibility for the scaling back of the sanctions, saying it can happen "at some point during the negotiation".Trump also invited Kim to visit the United States, while the DPRK leader reciprocated by inviting Trump to visit Pyongyang "at the right time".Before the Panmunjom meeting, Trump and Kim first held their meeting in Singapore last June, with the two leaders agreeing to the complete denuclearization of and the permanent peace settlement on the Korean Peninsula.Kim and Trump then met for the second time in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi in February, but the summit ended with no agreement, and the denuclearization negotiation between Pyongyang and Washington had been stalled.Standing beside Trump, Moon praised the US leader for his "bold and creative" approach to the denuclearization talks, saying Trump's proposal realized the historic Panmunjom meeting.Before the Panmunjom meeting, Trump and Moon stood atop the Observation Post Ouellette in the ROK side of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to let the US president take a glimpse of the DPRK.It was the first time that the leaders of the ROK and the United States made a joint tour to the DMZ.Trump and Moon also met with both the service members of the United States and the ROK in Camp Bonifas, a UN Command military post located just about 400 meters south of the ROK boundary of the DMZ.After his Panmunjom talks with Kim, Trump headed to an American air base in Osan, just south of Seoul, and addressed members of the US military there. In his speech, he called his earlier talks with Kim as "a very productive meeting".Trump was scheduled to leave the ROK for his home country later in the day.
