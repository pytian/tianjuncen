                SAPPORO - China survived a five-set thriller against Brazil at the FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup here on Sunday to extend its unbeaten record to six matches after a two-day break.Zhu Ting and Yuan Xinyue tied for a game-high 26 points for China's 25-23, 23-25, 22-25, 25-19, 15-9 victory in two hours and five minutes. Gabriela Braga Guimaraes, with 20 points, was the top scorer for a Brazil side that rested captain Fabiana Claudino."I think unity and concentration are the reasons we were able to win," captain Zhu told Xinhua after the match.China kept a slight advantage over Brazil in the opening minutes with strong performance from Yuan and Yan Ni, and forced the two-time Olympic champion to a timeout after establishing a 13-8 lead. Drussyla Costa then spearheaded Brazil's attacks while China was troubled by consecutive errors as the South American side closed the gap 19-20. Coach Lang Ping called a timeout as Brazil saved two set points to trail by 24-23 and Yuan finally converted China's third chance to claim the set 25-23.The second set saw both sides showcase their attacking prowess with Rio 2016 champions Zhang Changning and Zhu launching spikes while Gabi and Lorenne Geraldo Texieira opening fire for Brazil. The game was tied multiple times before Sheilla Castro De Paula Blassioli registered one spike and one block to seize the set point 24-22. Brazil gave one chance away on error but Gabi's spike powered the two-time Olympic champion to level the game 1-1.China sent on young spiker Li Yingying and put Zhang as middle blocker in the third set in which the tenacious defense of the Nations League runners-up made it hard for the Chinese attackers, especially Zhu. Yuan carried the flag for China instead, but a more balanced Brazil initiated a 6-1 run after 14-19 down to recover from early disadvantage and tied the game 20-20. The two sides traded points before 23-year-old Lorenne wrapped up the set 25-22 for Brazil with two aces in a row."It's a good chance for Li Yingying to learn in such a tough match and as a young player, she did well in reception even though being targeted by the opponent," coach Lang commented on the 19-year-old.The defending champion regained form in the fourth set as Zhu and Yuan took turns to smash Brazil's defense and granted China a five-point lead into the second technical timeout 16-11. China pressed further ahead and grabbed the set point 24-18 after a service error by Lorenne and eventually tied the match 2-2 in the fourth attempt.The four-time World Cup winner carried on the momentum into the decider where Yuan and Gong Xiangyu combined for five points to put China 8-5 ahead. Mara Ferreira Leao had five points in vain to see China clinch the victory 15-9 after Ana Beatriz Correa's spike was called out.After losing its first two sets in the tournament, China will face Nations League champion United States on Monday while Brazil will play against Dominican Republic in an all-South American clash."Their head coach was with me a long long time ago, and he started to be a coach with my daughters in my house, so he knows everything about me," Brazil coach Hose Roberto Guimaraes said of his Dominica Republic counterpart Marcos Kwiek, adding that the match tomorrow will be difficult.

                    New TV documentary showcases 70 years of development

                A 24-episode documentary, titled On the Great Road, premiered on CCTV on Sept 16, to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China via a panoramic showcase of the country's progress and development since 1949.It has been aired daily on CCTV-1 and will run through Friday, with each episode lasting about 40 minutes.The series, which traces the country's achievements, takes its name from a popular Chinese song written by Li Jiefu in 1963.According to the director of the documentary, Yan Dong, over 450 people divided into eight teams drove over 37,000 kilometers and traveled to around 25 provinces and regions across the country to shoot the documentary.The series began with the birth of New China on Oct 1, 1949. The ceremony where Chairman Mao Zedong officially announced the founding of the People's Republic China to the world saw 200,000 people gather in Tian'anmen Square."It (that moment) marks the beginning of great social change in the country and it is the start point for all the stories we wanted to tell in the documentary," says Yan, who is known for directing the eight-episode documentary, The Long March, which marked the 80th anniversary of the end of the epic military expedition of the Red Army led by the Communist Party of China to combat the Kuomintang regime during the civil war.The first seven episodes of the new series focus on the years before 1978.Valuable historical footage show audiences a country going through historic change, such as how the government transformed the face of society by carrying out land reforms and ensuring women's rights were recognized and protected by law. It also tells the stories of the struggles and sacrifices people made for their country."The black-and-white pictures and footage, some of which had never been shown before, will remind the older generations of the hardships the country and its people had gone through. For the younger generations, they will learn about history, and especially about the people who made great contributions to the country," says Yan.

                    Murray's mission intensifies
                </p>

                Briton stepping up singles comeback against heavyweight field in ZhuhaiAndy Murray will be the center of attention at this week's Zhuhai Championships as the former world No 1 steps up his singles comeback against a heavyweight field in Guangdong province.The tournament, which has relocated from Shenzhen (the new venue for the WTA Finals next month), has attracted an impressive cast to battle for a share of a $1 million prize pool - the biggest of all ATP 250-level events - at the state-of-the-art Hengqin Tennis Center.Four top-20 players - world No 7 Stefanos Tsitsipas, Roberto Bautista Agut (10), Gael Monfils (12) and Borna Coric (15) - are kicking off their Asian swings of the tour in the coastal city, while the appearance of the mercurial Nick Kyrgios is another huge treat for fans.Perhaps the most intriguing addition, though, is Murray as the Scot continues his bid to climb back to the level that won him three Grand Slam titles (2012 US Open, 2013 and 2016 Wimbledon) and two Olympic gold medals (2012 and 2016).The 32-year-old, now ranked 413th in the world, has lost all two tour-level singles matches that he has played since recovering from a hip operation in January.With the top four seeds in Zhuhai receiving first-round byes, Murray will open his tournament against big-hitting American Tennys Sandgren, who last month defeated the Brit 7-6 (8), 7-5 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.In his last competitive outing late last month, Murray won two matches at an ATP Challenger event at Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca, but Zhuhai will be a considerable step up in class.Should he overcome Sandgren, seventh seed Alex de Minaur will await Murray, with Coric potentially up after that."Definitely, we would love to see Andy's long-anticipated first win happen here in Zhuhai," said Peter Lyu, a co-tournament director and executive director of Huafa Sports, which promotes and runs the championships."Each round he wins will be a huge reward for his Chinese supporters and the sponsors, and it will contribute greatly to the ticket sales and media exposure of this tournament."Wild cards Zhang Ze, Wu Di and Zhang Zhizhen will carry home hopes.Zhang Ze, the only Chinese man to ever break into the world's top 150(No 148 in May 2013), will face Frenchman Adrian Mannarino in his opener, with a potential second-round meeting with top seed Tsitsipas a major motivator for the 29-year-old Nanjing native.Third seed Monfils and his French compatriot Lucas Pouille, seeded fifth, are also in the 21-year-old Greek star's side of the draw.Both Wu and Zhang Zhizhen will play qualifiers in the first round. If Wu advances, Croatian fourth seed Coric will provide a stern test in round two. Should Zhang Zhizhen progress, a clash with Australian firebrand Kyrgios, who opens against Andreas Seppi, looms.Kyrgios, Tsitsipas, Bautista Agut and Coric all face tough turnarounds from the Laver Cup in Geneva, where they represented either Team World or Team Europe over the weekend.Spaniard Bautista Agut, who is pushing to book a spot at the Nitto ATP Finals in London, will open against American Steve Johnson or countryman Pablo Andujar.Another prospect to watch is Aussie youngster de Minaur, who carries plenty of momentum into Zhuhai. The 20-year-old won his second ATP title at the Atlanta Open in July before reaching the fourth round of the US Open. He will play friend and compatriot John Millman in his opener before potentially facing Murray, who is also set to play tournaments in Beijing and Shanghai."The strong field certainly makes this tournament look like a higher-level event," said Lyu. "Now it's up to us to impress the players with great organization and hospitality."
