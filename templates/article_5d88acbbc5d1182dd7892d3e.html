                Ford unveils three models in Shanghai, says more are coming
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Ford held one of its largest-ever branding events and launched three models in Shanghai on Friday as part of the US carmaker's plan to recuperate lost ground in the world's largest auto market.Called the Fun Day, the event allowed fans to experience Ford models from the Focus sedan to the F150 pickup. The event will also be organized in other cities, including Beijing and Chongqing.Jason Yang, president of Ford's national distribution services division in China, said he hoped the event and model launches would mark the D-Day of the carmaker in the country.Like the Allied forces before the Normandy landings, Ford went through years of lackluster performance, he said.Ford reached its zenith in 2016 when its annual sales passed 950,000. Sales have tumbled since then primarily because of slow product introductions.The company launched the new Focus Active SUV, the Edge ST/ST-Line SUV and the new Taurus sedan on Friday."You rarely see carmakers launch three models at a time," Yang said. "We do this because we have more new models to come."Ford unveiled a massive product plan in April, saying it will launch more than 30 new Ford and Lincoln vehicles in China over the next three years, including more than 10 electrified ones.The Edge ST, priced at 389,800 yuan ($55,369), is the first Ford SUV model to be tuned by the Ford Performance team.Created as a China-exclusive seven-seater, the vehicle features a specially tuned 2.7-liter twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6 engine, the most powerful engine in its class.It has a maximum output of 237 kW and a top torque of 500 Nm. It can sprint from zero to 100 km/hour in 7.2 seconds.Designed with a quick shifting 8-speed automatic transmission, the car delivers superior handling that highlights its power and sportiness. This design is echoed in the Edge ST-Line, which features the 2.0-liter EcoBoost turbocharged engine combined with the new 8-speed automatic transmission.The Edge ST-Line is available in five-seat and seven-seat variants, priced at 269,800 yuan and 299,800 yuan respectively.The Focus Active SUV sports the 1.5-liter EcoBoost turbocharged engine, which has a maximum output of 128 kW and a top torque of 243 Nm.It also features an 8-speed automatic transmission and has a comprehensive fuel consumption of 5.7 liters per 100 km.The model has a ground clearance of 150 mm and is the first to have driving modes in its segment. It has two variants, priced at 139,800 yuan and 153,800 yuan.Ford's flagship sedan, the new Taurus, sports the 2.0-liter Eco-Boost turbocharged engine, which generates a maximum output of 180 kW and a top torque of 390 Nm.It is available in three variants, priced between 228,900 yuan and 288,900 yuan.All of the three models feature SYNC+, Ford's new in-vehicle infotainment system powered by Baidu's artificial intelligence technology.Designed to meet the needs of Chinese consumers, the system offers advanced user functions like intelligent voice assist, Baidu cloud navigation as well as smart home connection.SYNC+ marks a significant milestone in Ford and Baidu's collaboration in the field of connectivity.In June 2018, Ford and Baidu signed a letter of intent to explore areas of cooperation in connectivity, artificial intelligence and digital marketing.From 2019, the majority of new models sold in China will also be equipped with Ford's Co-Pilot 360 advanced driver-assist technologies, including adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, traffic sign recognition and active park assist, to deliver a safer and less stressful driving experience.

                    US trying to trigger an arms race
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                THE UNITED STATES withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty on Friday, as scheduled. Beijing Youth Daily comments:Russia said it is not bound by the INF Treaty any more at the same time. It means that after being in place for 32 years, the treaty is now dead.The treaty limited both nations from fielding both "short range" and "intermediate range" land-based ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and missile launchers that could be used to house either nuclear or conventional payloads, in a bid to pull Europe from under the shadow of an arms race between the two giants.The world has lost a de facto brake that was designed to prevent it from sprinting to a nuclear war and an arms race. Nuclear proliferation will have a more solid foundation to rise again as a threat to global stability, world peace and security.In April, the US administration pulled the US out of the Arms Trade Treaty, saying that staying in it does not accord with the US' national interests. The treaty is an international treaty that regulates the international trade in conventional arms and seeks to prevent and eradicate illicit trade and the diversion of conventional arms by establishing international standards governing arms transfers.This marked Washington taking the first step toward dismantling the current arms control system, which was a foreshadowing of its withdrawal from the INF Treaty months later.The US' unilateral withdrawal from the two arms control treaties has wasted all previous efforts that the international community had made, including the US itself.It is foreseeable that the US will put in more money, technology and manufacturing capacity into expanding and upgrading its arsenal that will avail it better to exercise strategic deterrence against other countries.Which looks set to incur countermeasures from other big countries, such as Russia, and throw the world back into a new arms race and stalemate.While emphasizing its resolve and urgency to expand the US' military advantages, Washington has clearly distinguished Moscow and Beijing as its strategic rivals. That will also make relations among big countries more complicated and difficult to handle.

                    Shanxi celebrates in the spotlight

                Next wave of China's best young athletes competing in summer, winter and combined eventsIt might lack the nation's big-name athletes, but the Second Youth Games of the People's Republic of China is still a big draw, showcasing some of the country's most promising future stars.Thursday's opening ceremony at Shanxi Sports Center Stadium in Taiyuan, capital of Shanxi province, coincides with National Fitness Day and will see about 30,000 spectators sharing the excitement.China's largest youth sports competition includes 49 events:37 for summer athletes, five for winter athletes and seven combined.By the closing ceremony on Aug 18, 12,006 competitors from 34 delegations will have taken part, including 215 from Hong Kong and 53 from Macao. They're housed in an athletes village encompassing 15 buildings, 1,900 rooms, 9,500 beds and a three-floor canteen that seats 3,620.While Shanxi is embracing 34 summer events and two winter events at 58 venues spread across 11 cities, competitions that cannot be held in the province due to unique venue and/or weather requirements have been staged in 16 provinces and municipalities across China since January.Besides fostering friendship and harmony between young athletes from all backgrounds, the aim of the Games is to spotlight untapped athletic talent."We have added more events to the Second Youth Games and have divided each event into two groups－a sports school competition and a sports social club competition," said Zhao Xiaochun, director of Shanxi Sports Bureau."Athletes in the sports school groups are more professional, and most are training to be in the talent pool to represent China at future Olympics. However, there are many talented young athletes who join sports clubs, and they used to be out of our sight."We have also broken down many events into age groups. For example, in some we used to just have one competition for under-19.In theory, a 12-year-old could join an under-19 competition. Now we have age groups all the way from under-12 to under-19. In the first Youth Games, there were 305 gold medals. This time there are 1,868."In addition to showcasing superb competition, the games will provide a huge boost to Shanxi's local sports development."Organizing such a large event is a great boost of confidence for us, and the experience we gain in the process is very valuable," said Zhao."The Youth Games provide us a great opportunity to build and upgrade sports venues in the city－many of which will be used to host higher-level competitions in the future."We are also nurturing new talent because of the expanded number of events. It's not just about athletes; it's about coaches, referees and competition management. All of those things are crucial to Shanxi's future sports development."Volunteers are another vital ingredient. About 45,000 signed up in Shanxi, with around 2,300 taking part in the opening ceremony.Local college student Zhang Yating serves as a volunteer in the athletes village, helping competitors from all over China get settled while serving as an unofficial ambassador for her hometown."It's a tiring job, but it's also meaningful and I enjoy it," Zhang told Xinhua."We show them the way, help them to get phone chargers, help them to copy documents and access the lost and found."More importantly, we communicate with young people from all over the country and help them solve problems and make friends. It's such a warm experience."

                    Koepka leads sprint to PGA Tour's richest finish
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                It's billed as 'Ultimate August', with an eye-popping $15 million awaiting the new FedExCup champion. And for red-hot Brooks Koepka, it could mean collecting $18 million just in bonus money by the time the dust settles.Welcome to the conclusion of PGA Tour season, when every stroke matters and every missed shot can mean disaster.The stars know they have everything to fight for as one of the most prestigious accolades in sports await the FedExCup champion.Three tournaments remain out of the 46 that have seen the tour traverse the United States, Canada, Latin America and Asia over the past 11 months, cementing a legend's stature, establishing new superstars and heralding the arrival of a new generation of exciting young champions.The all-powerful Koepka is primed to be the season's biggest winner. Following his third victory of the season at the World Golf Championships-FedEx St Jude Invitational two weeks ago, he picked up a cool $2 million bonus for winning the Wyndham Rewards Top 10, which recognizes the high achievers in the regular season that concluded with last weekend's Wyndham Championship.The 29-year-old American then added another $1 million to his bank account for clinching the Aon Risk Reward Challenge, a new and innovative competition that highlights golf's best strategic decision-makers.This week, the top 125 golfers from the FedExCup points list are teeing up in the make-or-break Fed-ExCup playoffs, comprised of The Northern Trust, the BMW Championship and the Playoffs Finale, which will feature the top 30 and use a stroke-based system to determine the FedExCup champion.This season's $15 million payout to the FedExCup champion is $5 million more than what England's Justin Rose earned last year, thanks to a cash boost from FedEx, which topped up the overall bonus pool by $25 million to $60 million.Koepka, who also won this year's CJ Cup @Nine Bridges in South Korea and the PGA Championship, is geared up for a strong finish as he enters the playoffs at No 1 on the points list."It's incredible. To look at what I've done this year, the consistency, trying to take my game to a new level. I've done all that. To be up there in the FedExCup with a chance in Atlanta, that's incredible," Koepka said.Rory McIlroy, who is trying to join Tiger Woods as the only two-time FedExCup champion, is one of the contenders aiming to derail Koepka."You want to be as high up in the rankings as you possibly can. Obviously, there's a lot to play for. Every year, the FedExCup is getting bigger and bigger, and it's more of a target on all the guys' radar. There's a lot to play for in August," said McIlroy.Much of this month's excitement is due to the vision of PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan, who has advocated changes to the tour schedule and pushed for greater rewards to capture and expand the imagination of players, fans, sponsors, and TV and online viewers.As previous FedExCup champions include current greats such as Woods, McIlroy, Rose, Jordan Spieth, Henrik Stenson and Vijay Singh, winning the season-long competition has become a priority for the new generation.Reigning WGC-HSBC Champions and Sentry Tournament of Champions winner Xander Schauffele of the US, who enters the playoffs in third place, summed up the importance of the next three tournaments: "We have so much to play for. Everything's on the table. It's just as big as a major championship. I go to sleep thinking about those things."Rose, who became the first Englishman to taste FedExCup glory last year, added: "Obviously the playoffs are all about volatility and bringing your game when you really need it. We've all bought in and love that concept."Asia will have keen interest in the playoffs, with South Korean rookie Im Sung-jae currently ranked as the highest Asian on the points list in 23rd position, followed by compatriot Sung Kang in 29th and Japanese star Hideki Matsuyama in 30th.Chinese Taipei's CT Pan, who sits 35th, broke through for his first PGA Tour win in April and is determined to make it to the Championship for the first time."It's been my goal for the past three years. It's all I'm trying to do, get into the Tour Championship," said Pan.The writer is the PGA Tour's senior director of communications and is based in Kuala Lumpur.

                A growing number of fans are listening as audio plays and books give voice to our imagination, Wang Ru reports.Listening allows the imagination to run wild which is why audio books and shows have sprinted into popularity recently. The spoken word is both able to soothe and inspire.In another age, almost prehistoric in our days of smartphones and instant communication, people would say that you got a better picture on the radio than from the TV. As the old saying goes, what you see is what you get but what you hear is a never-ending feast.The Sound harks back to those days. The reality show, broadcast on Hunan Satellite TV since 2018, has brought voice actors to the spotlight, charming audiences with the sheer magic of the spoken word.Surprisingly, considering the appeal of electronic images for the younger generation, listening to audio dramas is a popular pastime for many college students. It could be that after long and arduous hours studying, they need to switch off their minds and relax.Li Jiani, 25, agrees as she recalls her limited leisure time on campus as an undergraduate student in Chongqing years ago."After studying long into the night, I would often lie on the bed, and open an app on the smartphone to savor an audio drama," she says."With my eyes shut, the sounds elicited vivid scenes in my brain. It was really relaxing and exciting!"For those who appreciate the art of sound, audio drama has a unique appeal. Performers use their voices to lead listeners on a journey of the imagination.The gadgets we use today to listen may have evolved from the clunky radios of yesteryear, when the first nationwide radio drama was broadcast in the 1950s, but the appeal remains. During its 1980s prime before the internet and other technologies took over, 500 new radio dramas were broadcast every year, created by voice actors on China National Radio and local radio stations.

                    Wulong's quest adds natural beauty to a physical challenge
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Those who relish a physical challenge and love nature are in for a treat as a mountain quest that brings together physical challenges and natural beauty will be held in Chongqing from Sunday to Aug 28. The China International Mountain Quest will be staged in the city's Wulong district. The quest has been held annually over the past 15 years, during which time about 400 professional sport teams from over 70 countries and regions have competed against one another. This year, the race covers 200 kilometers and will include a cross-country run, canoeing, rope-ladder climbing, swimming and cave exploration. All the racetracks involve distinctive landscape and run through local scenic spots, says Zhang Zhijian, deputy director of the hiking sport management center with the country's General Administration of Sport. More than 30 teams are expected to take part in the quest, including about 20 from abroad. The prize money totals $200,000. In addition to professional races, races for the general public will also be held to allow more people to savor the charm of Wulong. About 1,000 outdoor sport fans have been invited to hike and camp in the district's mountainous regions. "The race fully takes into account the integration of competition, the physical challenges and audience experience, as well as fashion and culture," Zhang says. As a result of the planning, participants will experience a rapid descent from an overpass to the Wujiang River and sliding across an overhead cable from the summit of Wulong's well-known Three Natural Bridges resort to a glass viewing platform, while cross-country runners will see beautiful countryside and such tourist attractions as the Xiannyu (Fairy) Mountain during their run. Contestants will also get a taste of boat-tracking at the Wujiang River, and better understand Wulong's boat-tracking history. Hazardous river conditions, such as the torrents, meant trackers earlier had to pull vessels along the waterway. The local government is also trying to use the mountain quest to transform Wulong into a top outdoor sport and tourism destination globally. Lu Hong, the district head, says: "We've developed and fine-tuned innovations (allowing participants to swim in the river, hike in the forest and valley, sprint on grasslands and explore karst caves) on the classic race routes over the years to get there." Wulong, about 130 kilometers from downtown Chongqing, was founded in AD 619. The 2,900-square-km district boasts karsts, caves, forests, springs and wilderness. UNESCO designated Wulong's karsts as a World Natural Heritage site in 2007, along with the Shilin karsts in Yunnan province and the Libo karsts in Guizhou province. The district received 32 million visits in 2018 and raked in 15 billion yuan ($2.19 billion) in tourism income. (China Daily Global 08/20/2019 page15)

                China's cycling queen Zhong Tianshi is anxious to inspire residents of the "kingdom of bicycles" to further embrace the sport through a successful defense of her gold medal at next year's Tokyo Olympics.With road races gaining more popularity in recent years, the public perception of biking has gone from being just a means of everyday transportation to a healthy lifestyle choice.As the face of cycling in China, Zhong hopes to accelerate that process."I think only by helping people realize that riding bikes is more than just a way of transportation, and getting more people to embrace it as a serious exercise, can we call ourselves a strong biking nation," Zhong told China Daily at the launch of the 10th Tour of China road race in Beijing earlier this week.As ambassador of the Sept 7-22 event, Zhong will show up at the final stop of the 11-stage race across five provinces."To try to defend my title at the Olympics and pedal for more golds is the best I can do to help bring more attention to the sport," said the 28-year-old Shanghai native.A sprinting specialist with exceptional late-race acceleration, Zhong partnered with now-retired Gong Jinjie to win the team sprint final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janerio, bringing home China's only Olympic gold in cycling.The tandem clocked 31.928 seconds in their first-round sprint in Rio, which still stands as the world record in the team discipline.Zhong and Gong had also set the fastest time at the world championships in London earlier this year but were relegated in the final against Russian pair Daria Shmeleva and Anastasia Voinova.Less than a year out from the Tokyo Games, Zhong is vowing to fill the vacancy in her trophy collection for a major international individual title."Leading up to Tokyo, I am focusing more on improving my strength and endurance, which will consequently enhance our team's competitiveness," she said."My goal for Tokyo is to go for gold in both disciplines as hard as I can."After being hampered by a nagging lower-back injury that forced her to settle for bronze at the 2017 National Games, Zhong missed this year's track cycling world championships in Poland due to a rib fracture.She said a return to top form could take longer than anticipated after she struggled to keep up with the grueling pace and heavy workload during a recent training camp in Spain that involved daily rides of up to 100 kilometers.With Zhong still recovering her full strength, Hong Kong rival Lee Wai Sze is consolidating her supremacy in the individual events after claiming the sprint title at the worlds.The 32-year-old Lee now tops the elite sprint ranking by the International Cycling Union, having won four of six UCI World Cup series events in the 2018-19 season.Zhong said she will embrace the challenge against Lee at the upcoming Asian Championships, the World Cup series and next year's worlds in Berlin as invaluable tuneups for Tokyo.In the team event, Zhong is confident her chemistry with new partner Lin Junhong, who joined the team following Gong's retirement in October 2017, will reap benefits in Tokyo."Lin is one of my best friends, we are close in life and of course it will boost our performance riding with each other on the track," Zhong said."She is a good partner. I trust her, we can win more golds in the future."In their first major international outing, Zhong and Lin clocked 33.118 seconds to win gold ahead of Hong Kong pair Lee and Ma Wing Yu at last year's Asian Games in Indonesia.

                    Captain Yi targets big rebound

                Team China leader has squad primed to end prolonged World Cup losing streak on SaturdayIt's crunch time for Team China.With the FIBA World Cup tipping off on Saturday in Beijing, can the much-hyped national squad prove its worth in front of tough home crowds?It's been nine years since Team China won a game at the World Cup: an 83-73 victory over Cote d'Ivoire at the 2010 edition in Turkey, when the tournament was known as the world championships.Newly appointed captain Yi Jianlian has vowed to end the long losing streak when the host squad opens its Group A campaign on Saturday at Wukesong Sport Arena - with Cote d'Ivoire again the opponent.The 31-year-old Yi became a household name in 2007 when he joined the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks. After 272 games over five seasons with the Bucks, New Jersey Nets, Washington Wizards and Dallas Mavericks, the Guangdong native finally returned to the Chinese Basketball Association with the Guangdong Southern Tigers in 2016.Yi, who suited up alongside eight-time NBA All-Star Yao Ming for Team China at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, has won five CBA championships and three CBA Finals MVP awards.He was named team captain on Wednesday, and the news instantly went viral on Chinese social media with related topics viewed over 27 million times by Thursday morning. While tens of millions of fans expressed their support online, Yi posted on Weibo: "Against the odds! You can't step back! Let's go China!"Eleven years ago we hosted the Beijing Olympics, and now we are hosting the FIBA World Cup. No one knows when we will have the opportunity to host such a high-level international basketball tournament."It's a rare opportunity for all of us. You can feel the special duty when you see the national flag on your chest. It's very meaningful for the national team and for me to play in the World Cup in front of the home crowd."Yi will have a strong supporting cast, led by rising stars Zhou Qi, Guo Ailun, Wang Zhelin and Abudushalamu.Zhou was the only Chinese player in the NBA last year when he saw spot duty with the Houston Rockets. The 23-year-old showed initial promise off the bench but was unable to become a more reliable player.A series of injuries, including a sprained knee and a twisted elbow, limited Zhou's playing time and the Rockets eventually released him to their G-League affiliate, the Rio Grande Valley Vipers. He returned to his former CBA club, the Xinjiang Flying Tigers, earlier this month.Zhou proved his worth for the national team by playing a key role in China's gold-medal triumph at the 2018 Asian Games in Indonesia."I'm in better condition now after a whole summer of training and competing," said Zhou. "Through the warm-up games ahead of the World Cup, the whole team has become closer and better. Each player has his own character, and we maximize our advantages when we play together."The World Cup will also be a major test for CBA chairman Yao Ming who has been pushing a series of reforms to level up the overall strength of Chinese basketball since being elected to the post in 2017."Winning matches is Team China's priority, but that's not the only goal for Chinese basketball," said Yao."The World Cup and all other top international tournaments are like sprint competitions. It's important we win these games, but we should focus more on the tenacity and endurance of our overall basketball development."The final 12-man roster: Head coach: Li Nan.Forwards: Ren Junfei, Zhai Xiaochuan, Abudushalamu, Kelanbaike.Centers: Yi Jianlian, Wang Zhelin, Zhou Qi.Guards: Guo Ailun, Zhao Jiwei, Zhao Rui, Sun Minghui, Fang Shuo.

                    Serena Williams reaches US Open final again
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                NEW YORK — With another US Open final in sight, and Grand Slam title No 24 within reach, Serena Williams got past a slightly shaky start and quickly took control.Williams turned in an increasingly impressive performance for a 6-3, 6-1 victory over No 5-seeded Elina Svitolina of Ukraine in their semifinal at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Thursday night.This will be Williams' fourth final in the past six major tournaments. She was the runner-up at Wimbledon each of the past two years, losing to Angelique Kerber in 2018 and to Simona Halep in July. And she was also the runner-up, of course, a year ago at Flushing Meadows, losing to Naomi Osaka.That final was, and forever will be, overshadowed by Williams' extended argument with chair umpire Carlos Ramos, who docked her a point, then a game — and was barred by the US Tennis Association from officiating any matches in this year's tournament involving her or her older sister, Venus.So much of what Williams does nowadays must be seen through the prism of tennis history, and that was certainly the case this time. Her 101st career match win at Flushing Meadows tied Chris Evert's tournament record."It's just impressive, I guess," Williams said. "I don't think about it. I just come out here and do what I can."By getting to the final, Williams set a record for longest gap between first career Grand Slam title match and most recent such appearance: It's almost exactly 20 full years since she won the 1999 US Open as a teenager.Most importantly, if she can beat No 13 Belinda Bencic or No 15 Bianca Andreescu in Saturday's final, Williams will equal Margaret Court with 24 Grand Slam singles titles, the most in tennis history. Court, though, won more than half of hers against amateur competition before professionals were allowed to play in majors starting in 1968.This was Williams' 38th Grand Slam semifinal; she made it that far for the 10th appearance in a row at Flushing Meadows. And it was only the second time to the final four at a major for the 24-year-old Svitolina, who also got there at Wimbledon in July.Right from the start, though, it was Svitolina who was steadier. She earned three break points in the opening game — but failed to convert one. In the second game, Svitolina went ahead 40-love — yet somehow got broken.In all, Svitolina held eight game points across that opening pair, and was left with nothing to show for it. Quickly, it was 3-0 for Williams.If it wasn't as lopsided a performance as she put forth in a 6-1, 6-1 victory over Maria Sharapova in the first round or a 6-1, 6-0 win over Wang Qiang in the quarterfinals, it was pretty dialed-in.She launched serves at up to 119 mph and saved all six break points she faced. She smacked three return winners in one game alone. She revved up some of the very best groundstrokes you'll see at angles a pool shark would appreciate, to the tune of a 34-11 edge in winners. She sprinted this way and that, showing no trace of any sort of lingering effect from a rolled ankle earlier in the tournament.As if for good measure, Williams even threw in a serve-and-volley approach while facing break point at 3-1 in the first set — and, naturally, it worked, thanks to a swinging putaway."Don't expect that again," Williams said, joking that this was going through her mind: "What am I doing at the net?! Let me get back to the baseline!' Maybe Svitolina, whose one upset of Williams in five previous matchups came at the 2016 Rio Olympics, was just a bit too passive, content to say way back and try to chase down everything sent her way.Not the right approach. At least not against this opponent, in this match, on this day.By no means was Williams perfect. She was awfully good, though, which was more than enough. It often is for her. Just hasn't been in the three most significant matches of her comeback so far.She'll get another shot at it Saturday.One more for 24.AP
