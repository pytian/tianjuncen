                    Guangxi a key cog in success of trade route

                Land-sea trade corridor greatly reduces travel time of seaward exports from western and central China, officials with the province say The Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region has developed into a crucial hub of the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor as a result of blossoming cooperation with China's inland regions and neighboring countries. The new land-sea corridor is an international trade and logistics passageway jointly built by western Chinese provinces and Southeast Asian countries under the framework of the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Demonstration Initiative on Strategic Connectivity, an agreement signed between the Chinese and Singaporean governments in November 2015. With Chongqing municipality serving as one of its transportation hubs, the corridor uses ports in Guangxi's Beibu Gulf coasts to provide access to Singapore and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations members by sea, and links with China-Europe freight trains coming from many western Chinese cities before heading to Central Asia, South Asia and Europe.  Clockwise from top: Fangchenggang has one of the busiest ports in the Beibu Gulf region. The Hengyang-Liuzhou High-Speed Railway has slashed the travel time between Guangxi and the central part of China. Nanning Comprehensive Bonded Area is an important part of the land-sea trade corridor. Photos Provided to China DailyIn August 2017, Guangxi, Chongqing, Guizhou province and Gansu province signed agreements to cooperate in developing the corridor. Qinghai province and the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region came on board in June and November 2018. Yunnan province and the Ningxia Hui autonomous region were the latest regions to join the program. The land-sea corridor can greatly shorten the travel distance of seaward exports from China's western and even central region, according to Guangxi's officials. They said exports from Chongqing, for instance, are traditionally shipped via the Yangtze to Shanghai and then transshipped to larger vessels. The trip on the 1,800-kilometer Yangtze waterway takes more than 10 days. In contrast, it takes only two days to transport Chongqing's cargoes to Beibu Gulf via railway. Guangxi also offers the shortest passageway for western China's freight to ASEAN, and other regions in the world through the Malacca shipping route. In the past two years, Guangxi has promoted cooperation with other Chinese regions and neighboring countries engaged in this initiative. These include agreements for implementation measures between Guangxi and other Chinese regions, as well as a memorandum between Guangxi regional government and the Ministry of Trade and Industry of Singapore. In addition, Guangxi also held promotional events in Singapore in May and in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in July. A number of key projects have been carried out in Guangxi to improve its land and sea transportation and information interconnectivity with its neighboring regions and countries. One of the landmark projects under the new land-sea corridor initiative is the Qinzhou Railway Container Central Station. Construction of its first phase, which covers an area of about 85 hectares, began in July 2017. According to Wei Ran, deputy chief of the Beibu Gulf affairs office at the regional government of Guangxi, the station has a designed annual handling capacity of 1.05 million containers, compared with the city's annual throughput of 150,000 railway containers before the operation of the new station. The central station was officially put into operation on June 30, as a China-Europe freight train loaded with 70 container cargoes departed from Qinzhou, to Duisburg, Germany. Construction of another key project for railway transportation, the first phase of Nanning International Railway Port, was completed at the end of last month. Construction of other transportation and logistics facilities, including a railway logistics center in the border city of Pingxiang and an expansion project of the Fangchenggang Port, has also been completed. Guangxi will accelerate construction on the Huangtong-Baise Railway, the Hunan-Guangxi Railway's Nanning-Pingxiang section and the Nanning-Kunming Railway's Weishe-Baise section. Qinzhou Port will add a 200,000-metric-ton container terminal and have its eastern shipping lane expanded. More direct freight trains will be launched to connect Chongqing with Beibu Gulf, and more shipping routes will connect Beibu Gulf with ASEAN countries. The China-ASEAN Information Port, which was proposed at the first China-ASEAN Cyberspace Forum in 2014, is a program for internet connectivity, information sharing and cultural exchanges between China and ASEAN members. It features five platforms for infrastructure construction, information sharing, technological cooperation, economic and trade services. According to executives of China-ASEAN Information Harbor Corp, the company that takes charge of the program's operation, the information harbor has made breakthroughs in infrastructure construction and promotion of IT-related businesses in regions involved in the program.

                March in France ends in violence after hijacking by outsidersA 91-year-old man was one of 10 people arrested when members of the Extinction Rebellion climate change action group took part in a blockade of the English port of Dover on Saturday.The man, along with an 83-year-old woman and three others, was part of a group that broke away from an official demonstration, and another five activists were detained for trying to glue themselves to one of the key roads into the town, in an effort to demonstrate the vulnerability of the United Kingdom's reliance on food imports."The government must tell the truth and act now," said Chris Atkins from Extinction Rebellion Dover."As climate change develops, millions of ordinary Britons will face the real and growing threat of food shortages, hunger and starvation. Extreme storms and floods are already causing major crop failures across the world, with high temperatures also hitting livestock and agriculture."This crisis may seem far away now but given the dependency of the UK on food imports we are extremely vulnerable."A Sky News reporter spoke to the 91-year-old man just before he was detained. He said he was taking part because his generation had done the damage that caused the current crisis.The UK's dependence on food imports, especially through Dover, has also been a major issue in the on-going Brexit crisis.The Institute for Government reports that 2.5 million heavy goods vehicles pass through Dover each year, carrying around 17 percent of the UK's entire value of trade goods. Last year, then-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was heavily criticized after saying in a speech that he had "not quite understood the full extent" of the country's reliance on Dover.The latest protests in the UK come at the end of a week where young people all around the world have taken part in climate change demonstrations, inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.On Saturday, what had been billed as a family-friendly peaceful climate change march in Paris was abandoned after infiltration by other protest groups led to violent clashes with riot police, vandalism and more than 100 arrests.The climate change protest and another over pension reform had both been permitted but other demonstrations, by groups including the yellow vest protesters, who have been involved in a series of previous anti-government confrontations dating back to last year, went ahead unauthorized, leading to more than 7,000 police officers being deployed.Tear gas was used to break up groups, thought to be made up of anarchists, who wore hoods, sunglasses and black scarves to hide their faces, with environmental group Greenpeace advising climate change protesters to leave the scene because of threatening circumstances."Brutalities (not by climate activists) occurred at the front of the procession. Following tear gas the march has halted," Greenpeace France tweeted, later adding: "Take no risk and leave the climate march."There have also been protests in Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government has made a breakthrough in its efforts to reduce greenhouse gasses by coming up with a new set of measures to combat carbon emissions.The deal is thought to cost around 48 billion pounds ($60 billion) by 2023, and includes a price on CO2 emissions from transport and buildings, and an increase in tax on air fares but a reduction on those for long-distance train tickets. "We are not living sustainably today", said Merkel.
