                Award-winning hit musical begins major national tourFor generations, the books of British author Roald Dahl have been a bedside fixture for millions of children around the world.His darkly comic stories, including James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and The Twits, view the tough adult world through the eyes of children, whose innocence, wisdom, and imagination guide them to victory in an often challenging environment. In recent years, a new champion has emerged to surpass the rest－Matilda.Although Dahl's original book was published in 1988, and a film version released in 1996, the thing that has taken Matilda to new heights is Matilda the Musical.The stage version of the tale of a super-intelligent child whose talents are ignored by her parents and who encounters the harshness of authority at school before a caring teacher inspires her to triumph, is written by Dennis Kelly, and its songs by Australian composer Tim Minchin.A multi award-winning success in London's West End and on Broadway, it is now touring around the world, and Matilda's next stop is China."It was just a matter of time before Matilda came to China- the whole tour has been built around our time there," producer Paul Warwick Griffin, of GWB Entertainment, the show's global stagers, told China Daily."Matilda's been a pillar of the global musical theater industry for the last eight years and is the UK's stand-out musical theater export of the last decade, so it's no surprise they wanted it, it was just a matter of finding a Chinese partner with the right long-term vision－and we're lucky to have found that in Seven Ages."Ivy Yang, the CEO of Chinese theatrical adaptation company Seven Ages, told China Daily that bringing Matilda to the stage was the culmination of a long journey."When I first saw the show in London seven years ago, it was love at first sight," she said. "I then spent five years traveling the world and talking to the rights holders, before finally, I got the chance to bring it to China."

            <p class="style-content">
                  Matilda the Musical, winner of seven Olivier Awards and five Tony Awards, will tour to 13 cities across China from June 2019 to January 2020.As one of the most acclaimed stage shows in the United Kingdom, the musical produced by Royal Shakespeare Company is adapted from British writer Roald Dahl's 1988 novel of the same name.The story centers on Matilda, a five-year-old girl of unusual precocity. Despite being badly treated by her silly parents and older brother Michael, she teaches herself to read and seeks to rewrite her own life.The musical has won 87 awards and 93 young girls have been cast as Matilda since it opened at London's Cambridge Theatre in 2011. The producer reveals that they usually cast girls aged from 9 to 12 to perform the five-year-old Matilda but, explaining that the high turnover of lead actresses is because of how quickly children that age grow.The musical is co-imported by Sevenages, a Beijing-based company specializing in musical copyrights, and Poly Theatre Management. The two also unveiled the rest of their 2019-2020 line up, including the Chinese version of The Sound of Music, Cinderella and Les Choristes (The Chorus).

                    China can be strong contender at FIFA Women's World Cup: Australian coach
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                GOLD COAST, Australia - The Chinese women's football team has improved technically and is more disciplined and organized, said the coach and skipper from W-League (Australian top-flight league) side Newcastle Jets on Sunday following a training match."They are much more improved from when they played in Melbourne last year," said Craig Deans, coach of Newcastle Jets Women.The Chinese women's football team battered Australian club Newcastle Jets Women in Gold Coast on Sunday, extending their victory streak to five during their one-month training in Australia for the upcoming 2019 World Cup in France.Deans said that he was quite impressed by No 10 and No 11, forwards Wang Shanshan and Li Ying, who scored a total of three goals at the match. He also talked about center backs No 5 and No 8, Wu Haiyan and Li Jiayue, saying that they "are very strong with good communication and organization"."China obviously is a very good team," said Emily van Egmond, captain of the Australian club and a core player of the Matildas (Australian women's national team)."China has improved technically and they are very disciplined. They go to World Cup with great ambition. They definitely look forward to making out of the group," she added.But the road for China's women football team is likely to be bumpy. It is placed in Group B, along with South Africa, two-time world champion Germany, and rising contender Spain."They have another six months to prepare," Deans said. "If they keep improving like they had in the last six months, I think they can make it difficult for all those teams in the World Cup.""With tactics and speed, they will make quite a lot of difference," he continued. "If they stick together and work hard like what they did, they can upset somebody like Germany and Spain for sure."

                    Five players to watch during the Women's World Cup

                Here are five players to watch during the Women's World Cup:ALEX MORGAN, United States: Morgan was named the US national team's Player of the Year after she closed out 2018 with 18 goals in 19 games. She had seven goals during the CONCACAF World Cup qualifying tournament alone.A proven scorer, Morgan also earned Player of the Year honors in 2012 when she had 28 goals and 21 assists, and helped the national team win an Olympic gold medal.The 29-year-old forward, who will have a birthday during the tournament in France, is playing in her third World Cup. She was the youngest player on the 2011 World Cup team, scoring a goal in the final against Japan, which ultimately won the match on penalties.She scored her 100th goal with the national team in April - not bad for a late bloomer who didn't start playing club soccer until age 14.Morgan, who plays with the National Women's Soccer League's Orlando Pride, was named this year to Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People list.CHRISTINE SINCLAIR, Canada: Sinclair is the most prolific scorer in Canadian soccer history, and with 181 career goals she's edging closer to former US star Abby Wambach, who holds the international record - among both men and women - with 184.Sinclair has been the face of Team Canada for 19 years. Now 35, this tournament will be the soft-spoken captain's fifth, and likely last, World Cup.Canada won bronze medals at the past two Olympics, but the closest the Canadians have come to a podium finish at the World Cup was in 2003, when they finished fourth.From Burnaby, British Columbia, Sinclair won two NCAA championships at the University of Portland. She's remained in the Pacific Northwest, and currently plays with the Portland Thorns of the NWSL.DZSENIFER MAROZSAN, Germany: Marozsan is the inspirational story of the World Cup, having returned to the game after a pulmonary embolism kept her sidelined for several months last year.The Hungary-born star grabbed international attention at the 2016 Olympics in Brazil when she scored the winning goal against Sweden. The 27-year-old has 32 goals in 89 appearances overall with Germany.At just under 15, she became the youngest player to debut in the Frauen Bundesliga.Now with Lyon, she has been the French player of the year for the past two seasons.Lyon has won the French league and the Champions League for the past three seasons. A World Cup championship is the only major title Marozsan is missing.MARTA, Brazil: Known by just her first name, Marta Vieira da Silva is a six-time FIFA World Player of the Year, playing in her fifth World Cup.She has also played in four Olympics for Brazil, but so far a championship has eluded her in both tournaments. The 33-year-old has the most World Cup goals with 15, one better than both Wambach and Germany's Birgit Prinz.Growing up in a small town in Brazil, Marta's talent was recognized quickly and she left home to play soccer when she was just 14.At the 2016 Olympics in her native country, she played with so much passion that fans crossed out Neymar's name on their No 10 jerseys and wrote in Marta's.She had a setback last week when she injured her left thigh in practice for the World Cup, but she vowed to be back "very soon".SAMANTHA KERR, Australia: There are few players, if any, that are as dynamic as Kerr on the ball. She's also known for her signature backflip following goals.This will be the 25-year-old's third World Cup, and the Australians hope to improve on their surprising run to the quarter-finals in the 2015 tournament. Since making her debut with the national team at 15, Kerr has collected 31 goals in 77 games. As captain of the Matildas, she has been called "fearless' by coach Ante Milicic.Kerr plays soccer year-round, dividing her time between the Chicago Red Stars of the NWSL and Perth Glory of Australia's W-League.Last season, she led the NWSL in goals for the second straight year with 16.

                Coach claims best yet to come from two-time champ after last-16 cruiseGRENOBLE, France - Germany coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg warned the best is yet to come from her team after it cruised into the quarterfinals of the World Cup with ominous ease on Saturday night.Goals from Alexandra Popp, Sara Daebritz (penalty) and Lea Schueller saw the second-ranked Germans brush aside Nigeria 3-0 in Saturday's opening last-16 clash, setting up a last-eight meeting with either Sweden or Canada next Saturday."Coaches are never 100 percent happy," said Voss-Tecklenburg. "We are very happy to be in the quarterfinals. We have had great performances in very different matches under difficult weather conditions."We have one week to relax. We will probably take one day completely off without football."Next Monday we have to focus on our performance in the quarterfinals, and make sure at certain phases of the match we can gain more ground and become more confident without getting frustrated by details," she added."Some of our best players are not able to play at the moment, but we've still performed in an excellent way, leaving all on the pitch and pushing to our limits. It's valuable. There is no reason that we don't feel happy even though we are quite exhausted."Two-time champion Germany expects to be able to call on star playmaker Dzsenifer Marozsan for the quarterfinal clash in Rennes. The Lyon ace sustained a foot injury in Germany's opening 1-0 victory over China but returned as an unused substitute against Nigeria."She's able to play the next match," Voss-Tecklenburg said of Marozsan.Whether it's fifth-ranked Canada or ninth-ranked Sweden as Germany's opponent, Voss-Tecklenburg expects a tough battle in the quarters."It will be a game on a high level-50-50 no matter which opponent it will be. We have to get prepared, go to next step, and focus on this single game," she said."If we manage to get to the final, we will do our best. But we just try to be in a very serious way preparing for our tasks, trying to relax the side and staying realistic. Everyone wants to stay as long as possible. We are ready to take the next challenge and hope to finish in a positive way."It is a knockout game. For many players, they feel pressure and we don't know how they are going to handle such situations. That's why I'm especially happy about the outcome. That's why I hope Marozsan will be back, as she's responsible and able to give confidence to other players," noted Voss-Tecklenburg.It was an extra special night for striker Popp, who broke the deadlock against Nigeria in her 100th international appearance and was voted player of the match."It's not that important if me or someone else scores. It's important to score early and get confidence throughout the game. We got more confidence, and it was an optimistic situation for us," she said."We are excited to see what will happen in Monday's match (between Canada and Sweden). Both teams are physically strong. Canada has plenty of pace and has very experienced players, so I'm excited to see how their opponent will cope. We already played against Sweden and performed quite well. But that was a friendly, and it's totally different situation in the quarterfinals.Norway ousts AussiesLater on Saturday evening, Norway joined Germany in the quarters by beating Australia in a penalty shootout.With seven minutes of normal time left, Elise Kellond-Knights equalized direct from a corner to cancel out Isabell Herlovsen's firsthalf opener and take the game to extra time, during which the Aussies had Alanna Kennedy sent off for a trip on Lisa-Marie Utland.The Matildas then withstood a late Norwegian siege but couldn't hold their nerve in the shootout as misses from Sam Kerr and Emily Gielnik sealed their fate.The 1995 champion, which is missing Ballon d'Or winner Ada Hegerberg because of her dispute with Norway's soccer authorities, will next face either England or Cameroon in Le Havre on Thursday.Xinhua

                    Matilda the Musical set to charm China
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                For generations, the books of British author Roald Dahl have been a bedside fixture for millions of children around the world. His darkly comic stories, including James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and The Twits, view the tough adult world through the eyes of children, whose innocence, wisdom, and imagination guide them to victory in an often challenging environment. In recent years, a new champion has emerged to surpass the rest: the stage show of Matilda. Although Dahl's original book was published in 1988, and a theatrical version released in 1996, Matilda the Musical has taken Matilda to new heights. The stage version of the tale of a super-intelligent child whose talents are ignored by her parents and who encounters the harshness of authority at school before a caring teacher inspires her to triumph, is written by Dennis Kelly with songs by Australian composer Tim Minchin. A multi award-winning success in London's West End and on New York's Broadway, it is now touring around the world, and Matilda's next stop is China. Ivy Yang, the CEO of Chinese theatrical adaptation company Seven Ages, told China Daily that bringing Matilda to the stage was the culmination of a long journey. Seven Seas was chosen to partner by GWB Entertainment, the show's global stagers. "When I first saw the show in London seven years ago, it was love at first sight," she said. "I then spent five years traveling the world and talking to the rights holders, before finally, I got the chance to bring it to China." The touring production of Matilda the Musical, which will be performed in English with translated subtitles, will open on July 2 in Dongguan and run in various cities until January. All told, there will be more than 130 performances in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Guangzhou, Changsha, Chongqing, Hefei, Wuhan, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an, and Nanjing. Producer Paul Warwick Griffin of GWB Entertainment told China Daily of his professional involvement with China, dating back. nearly 20 years, noting that the market had grown so much and so quickly. "In the last five years, there's been an explosion in terms of independent commercial presenters who have come out of the woodwork, pushing for market exposure," he said. "There's no shortage of venues, and, on paper, there's an enormous appetite for the live performing arts, but ... outside the big cities there's not the depth of experience in support structure." Dahl was born in Wales to Norwegian parents and died in 1990, aged 74. He was a prolific writer of all kinds of books, but his children's stories have proved the most popular. Yang said the universality of his themes, especially such a rebellious, authority-challenging character as Matilda, were perfect for the modern Chinese audience. julian@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily Global 06/25/2019 page6)

                    England looks to overcome 'ruthless' US in World Cup semis
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                LYON, France — England coach Phil Neville says the United States has a ruthless streak.It's one of the reasons the US has never missed the semifinals at the Women's World Cup, and why the team has three overall titles, more than any other nation."America has got that ruthless streak of wanting to win," Neville said. "You saw the last five minutes of the (quarterfinal) game against France. The game management was fantastic. They took the ball into the corner, they knew what it took to win, and they celebrated like winners. That's what I admire, and that's what my team has now. It's about winning."The third-ranked Lionesses play the defending champions Tuesday in Lyon. The winner will go on to the championship match, facing the winner of the other semifinal Wednesday between Sweden and the Netherlands.England has never broken through to the final at the World Cup. The Lionesses fell to Japan four years ago in the semis in Canada before going on to defeat Germany in the third-place match for the team's best tournament finish.Neville said that's not good enough."My players now want to win," he said. "If we don't get the right result, we'll feel the disappointment and we'll see that as a failure. That's not me being negative, that's just our expectations, and our belief and our confidence and our mindset."There were questions when Neville was appointed to lead the team early in 2018 because he'd never coached a women's team. But the former Manchester United and Everton star has answered all the critics by building a team that believes it can win."I think we've shown throughout this tournament that we can go toe-to-toe with anybody," captain Steph Houghton said.The Lionesses head into the U.S. game with four straight shutouts in France, including a 3-0 quarterfinal victory over Norway. Jill Scott, Ellen White and Lucy Bronze each scored, with Bronze's goal sealing it.White, as well as Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe, has five goals each in the tournament to lead the field for the Golden Boot. Australia's Sam Kerr also scored five, but the Matildas were eliminated in the round of 16.Rapinoe has been particularly dangerous in the past two games, scoring twice in a 2-1 victory over Spain in the round of 16 before another brace in the 2-1 quarterfinal victory over France. The performance in Paris on Friday night came as Rapinoe was embroiled in controversy over a video that surfaced of her saying she wouldn't visit the White House if the Americans win the World Cup. President Donald Trump subsequently called her out on Twitter.The French peppered goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher with shots and the United States settled into a five-man backfield, something French coach Corinne Diacre said she'd never seen the top-ranked Americans do before.The United States held firm.
