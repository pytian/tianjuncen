                Biden gets Harris punch in debate
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Former US vice-president Joe Biden entered the second debate of Democratic presidential candidates with a target on his back. California Senator Kamala Harris hit the bullseye.Harris attacked Biden for working with Southern segregationists, and in doing so, revived her flagging campaign by showing she's tough and can command the stage, two attributes a nominee will need to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020."I do not believe you are a racist," Harris said looking directly at Biden. "And I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground. But I also believe it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on segregation of race in this country. And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing."Busing is transporting a child of one race to a school where another race is predominant, in an attempt to promote racial integration.Biden's voting record - including his support for civil rights - is well-known, but Harris made the issue personal."There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day," Harris said. "That little girl was me."On the day after the debate, Biden gave a lengthy and vigorous defense of his civil rights record, saying that "30 seconds to 60 seconds on a campaign debate exchange can't do justice to a lifetime committed to civil rights"."I never, never, never ever opposed voluntary busing," he said at a luncheon in Chicago.Biden responded to Harris in the debate that he did not praise his fellow Democrats for their racial views, as Senator Corey Booker of New Jersey claimed, but worked with them as needed to get bills through the Senate."I felt Harris hit Biden with a punch he wasn't expecting," Jonathan Zogby, CEO of Zogby Analytics, which provides custom research and insight to leaders of businesses and communities, told China Daily. "Harris damaged Biden and helped herself. Harris was disingenuous, but she's trying to break away from the pack. When going up against Trump, the Democrats need someone who can get in the mud and sling it."Zogby said Biden can recover, but he must be better prepared for the next debate.Andrew Smith, a professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire and director of the school's survey center, said Harris's attack on Biden wasn't a surprise."That's politics," he said. "As Nixon said in 1960 when running as a Republican, you have to run to the right in the primaries and then to the center in the general election. That's a pivot all candidates have to make and positioning themselves is a test of their political skill."After four hours of debate last week involving 20 candidates for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, there are mixed reviews about how aspirants performed, but there is one clear winner: undocumented immigrants.If Democrats recapture the White House in 2020, the candidates promised to provide healthcare coverage for those who cross the southern US border illegally. Polls show the proposal is not supported by a majority of Americans.Savannah Gutherie, one of the moderators at both debates, said, "Raise your hand if your government (health) plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants." On the second debate on June 27, all candidates raised their hands.But then president Barack Obama's healthcare plan, signed into law in 2010, excluded illegal immigrants. "Why extend coverage to a group Democrats previously excluded?" Gutherie asked.Biden responded, "You cannot let people who are sick, no matter where there come from, no matter what their (immigration) status, go uncovered. You can't do that. It's just going to be taken care of, period. You have to. It's the humane thing to do."Critics say such a policy would provide further incentive to cross the southern US border illegally. President Donald Trump tweeted, "All Democrats raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare. How about taking care of American citizens first? That's the end of the race!"The exchange underscores that the Democratic Party has moved left since Biden's tenure as vice-president ended in 2017. The "progressive" tenor of the debates also calls into question Biden's appeal as a candidate, despite his large lead in early polls, and about the wisdom of the Democrats' tactics leading up to the 2020 campaign, analysts said."The Democrats' stance on immigration plays well among the coastal elites but won't play where it matters - the Midwest and battleground states," Zogby said. "Some voters will say, 'You've forgotten about us.' I think this issue plays to Trump's advantage."While the Democrats offer new programs and promise free goodies to illegal immigrants, Trump will tout the strong economy, rising income and record low unemployment among blacks and Hispanics, analysts said."The Democrats are talking tax and spend," Zogby said. "Trump can say he's put money in people's pockets in a strong economy."Biden leads the race for the Democratic Party's nomination. According to the Real Clear Politics, a Chicago-based political news and polling data aggregator, the average of major polls shows he is favored by 32 percent of primary voters, with Sanders second at 16.9 percent, Warren third at 12.1 percent and Harris fourth at 7 percent. Most of the other candidates poll at less than 1 percent.Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was understated during her appearance in the first debate, but made the points she wanted to make, and established herself as the alternative to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. He's still the only socialist curmudgeon, but this time Sanders appears crankier and less appealing than he did in 2016 when he was the alternative to the unpopular Hillary Clinton.

                    Biden announces 2020 White House bid

            <p class="style-content">
                Former US vice-president Joe Biden, vowing to fight for the "soul of this nation", announced on Thursday that he would seek the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, and then attended a private event in Philadelphia to raise money for the long campaign ahead.Biden, 76, made his announcement in a three-and-a-half minute video posted on Twitter."If we give (US President) Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation, who we are, and I cannot stand by and watch that happen," Biden said in the video."The core values of this nation, our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America America is at stake."In response, Trump tweeted: "Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe. I only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary campaign. It will be nasty-you will be dealing with people who truly have some very sick& demented ideas. But if you make it, I will see you at the Starting Gate!"Former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell organized the fundraiser in Philadelphia for Biden. Hillary Clinton lost Pennsylvania in 2016 and the state is considered a key to Democrats' efforts to win back the White House in 2020. Biden is scheduled to hold his first public campaign event on Monday in Pittsburgh.Biden becomes the 20th candidate seeking the Democratic Party's nomination. He leads among Democrats in early polls, but his standing may reflect little more than name recognition, analysts say."It seems to me that the Democratic view is built on the idea that there's a huge anti-Trump population out there," Jonathan Zogby, CEO of research company Zogby Analytics, told China Daily."The belief seems to be that most of the US can't stand Trump and voters will take anybody else. I don't think that's true. Biden will have to differentiate himself from Trump on policy. I don't know what Biden's candidacy represents, other than 'I'm not Trump,'" Zogby said.Factions of the Democratic Party have moved sharply to the left since Hillary Clinton's loss to Trump in 2016, as evidenced by the solid showing of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed socialist.Biden is betting that the party's left wing, while vocal, is not the majority and running as a centrist will give him a good shot at winning the nomination. He sought the Democratic nomination in 1988 and 2008 without winning a single delegate.

                    Early poll gives Biden 13-point lead on Trump
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The latest Quinnipiac University poll shows former vice-president Joe Biden leading President Donald Trump by 13 points nationally in a head-to-head matchup.But the poll of 1,214 registered voters showing Biden winning 53 percent of the vote against 40 percent for Trump, a landslide margin, should be read with caution for several reasons."Any poll is a snapshot of the moment," Jonathan Zogby, CEO of research company Zobgy Analytics, told China Daily. "It shows Biden is popular, and the poll will get him media coverage, and that will help build momentum. But we're not sure what voters will do. There are so many variables that could change the race right up to November 2020. This poll doesn't mean Biden will win."Early polls are often upended when the first ballots are cast in the primary elections. And polls can be – and have been – wrong in US presidential elections.In 2016, most polls showed former secretary of state Hillary Clinton easily defeating Trump. But Clinton ran a passive campaign and didn't campaign in Wisconsin or Michigan, states that had voted for Democrats in prior elections but switched to Trump, helping assure his victory.It's also early in the election cycle. The Iowa caucuses will be held Feb 3, 2020, and the New Hampshire primary, the first in the nation, will be the following week.The first Democratic Party debates will be on June 26 and June 27, with 10 candidates on each night. Early polls may reflect little more than name recognition and, as Zogby said, popularity.The Quinnipiac poll is a national poll and doesn't reflect sentiment in individual states, especially swing states that could support either a Democrat or a Republican and may determine the winner.The poll is of registered voters — not likely voters— and therefore may not reflect the sentiment of those who will cast ballots in November 2020."The poll is a barometer, and it shows Biden is popular and has a shot, and that will help him raise money for the campaign," Zogby said. "The poll has value, even if it's not perfect."Still, the poll can be seen as a warning for Trump because it also shows him trailing six other Democratic candidates by five to 13 points in potential head-to-head contests.It shows that Biden leads Trump 47 to 46 percent among men, but among women, Biden leads 60 to 34 percent, a 26-point lead. White voters favor Trump 47 to 46 percent. Among black voters, Biden leads 85 to 12 percent, and 58 to 33 percent among Hispanic voters.However, a Zogby poll published May 14 showed Trump's approval rating above 50 percent. Trump is winning back Hispanic, independent, college-educated and urban voters, according to that poll. Overall, 30 percent strongly approve and 21 percent somewhat approve of the president.On Wednesday, The New York Times reported that Trump asked aides to deny that internal polling showed he was trailing in key states. Trump denied the report.As for Biden, an Economist/YouGov national poll showed his lead over the rest of the Democratic field shrinking, and a poll of American millionaires showed they would elect Biden over Trump if he becomes the Democratic nominee.The Economist poll has Biden dropping from a 20-to-30-point lead after he announced his campaign in late April to 10 points. It also put Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren behind Biden, replacing Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in second place.It's the first time since she entered the race that Warren has led Sanders by more than the margin of error in a national poll.One group of Americans that isn't representative of voters as a whole also favors Biden over Trump — American millionaires.They would elect Biden if he becomes the Democratic nominee, according to the CNBC Millionaire survey released on Wednesday. Biden and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, are the only Democratic nominees who beat Trump among the top Democratic candidates in a head-to-head race, according to the poll.Fully 53 percent of millionaire respondents said they would vote for Biden, compared with 39 percent for Trump, while 9 percent would be undecided. In a race between Trump and Buttigieg, the mayor wins 43 percent to Trump's 42 percent.To be included in the poll, respondents had to have investable assets of $1 million or more. Of the 750 respondents, 261 were Republicans, 218 were Democrats and 261 identified as independent.George Walper, president of Spectrem Group, which conducts the survey, said that just as in 2016, wealthy voters may be underreporting their support for Trump.A CNBC Millionaire Survey got the 2016 election wrong. The wealthy backed Clinton over Trump, 44 percent to 31 percent."Trump is divisive," Zogby said. "There is no middle ground — voters like him or hate him. Trump has a strong economy, and he's the incumbent. But I think Trump will be in for a tough fight if he's up against Biden."

                    Biden 'target' No. 1 in first of Democrats' debates?
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Joe Biden won't be on the stage, but the former vice-president and front-runner for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination is likely to be the target when 10 rivals hold their first debate on Wednesday in Miami, Florida.The 76-year-old Biden, who has participated in at least 16 debates as a presidential or vice-presidential candidate, is expected to again be the target when he is on stage Thursday for the second debate with nine other candidates seeking the Democratic nomination to face President Donald Trump in 2020."Biden will have a target on his back, and he has the potential of having more damage done to his candidacy than any other candidate," Andrew Smith, a professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire and director of the school's survey center, told China Daily. "He'll have to show he can take the arrows, and anything damaging to him will become the story."Biden leads in recent polls of Democratic voters by seven to 27 percentage points. Trailing are Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Warren is in the Wednesday debate; Sanders will appear on Thursday.The nationally televised debates may provide an opportunity for a candidate to break out of the pack, but each must maintain at least the façade of party unity while stating positions on major issues, including the continuing trade dispute with China, the US economy, healthcare and illegal immigration.With so many candidates on stage, each will have at most 10 minutes to speak and are likely to try a clever quip to get noticed, analysts said."Most people won't pay close attention to this debate," Smith said. "No candidate can win the race in June 2019 — it will be won in April or May of next year. A good performance this early means a candidate will be able to raise money and participate in the next debate. This pattern will continue for another six months. At this stage, polls reflect little more than name recognition."Biden is likely to face questions in the debate for saying he had a cordial working relationship with two Democratic Southern segregationists in the Senate. He's also likely to be questioned about his strong opposition — before reversing his stance — to federal funding for abortion, analysts said.Jonathan Zogby, CEO of Zogby Analytics, said the crowded Democratic field almost certainly means a long, difficult fight to win the nomination."The Democrats are setting themselves up for a battle royal with a bloodied candidate emerging as the nominee," Zogby said. "Look how (Kamala) Harris, (Cory) Booker, Warren and others went after Biden last week for working with people who had awful views about race. Biden's point was that to get things done, we must find common ground with people we might not like. Democrats are on uncommon ground with each other right now."Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said Democrats can learn from the 2016 Republican debates."In 2016, Trump seemed to avoid being directly attacked because other Republicans assumed he would fall apart even when he led," Kondik said. "Democrats should not assume Biden will fall apart and should attack him if warranted. Whether or not they do so will be a major storyline of this and subsequent debates."Analysts agreed that Trump will probably be tuning in."I think Trump will watch the debates, make comments and enjoy himself," Neil Levesque, director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College, told China Daily. "If he can belittle the pack of 20 candidates, it will be to his advantage."There will be a total of 12 debates during the Democratic primary season. NBC randomly selected what day the candidates would be on the stage in Miami.

                    Zogby: 'Polls are best used as a snapshot'
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The 2020 race for the White House is well underway, and so are the polls.A number of recent polls have shown President Donald Trump trailing those leading the pack of Democrats seeking their party's nomination. But Trump has always dismissed those polls, or at least those he doesn't like, as more examples of "fake news".Is it possible to accurately handicap the current stampede of Democratic candidates and make a reasonable estimate about who might win, or at least who's ahead?"Polls are best used as a snapshot in time because there are so many variables involved: when and how the poll was taken, weighting the demographics and oversampling certain groups," Jonathan Zogby, CEO of Zogby Analytics, told China Daily. "Polls capture a moment in time, almost inside a bubble, and that bubble can burst."An accurate survey depends on the pollster's skill in selecting a random sample and finding the right mix of respondents to match turnout on Election Day. "Accuracy depends on sample size, demographics, the margin of error and correctly modeling voter turnout. What pollsters have done for the last 10 to 15 years isn't working because there's a growing disparity between the popular vote and the electoral map."Only about 50 percent of households still have a landline telephone, making it harder to get a meaningful sample. Older voters tend to have landlines, while younger people rely on smartphones.Who answers a pollster's call — and who doesn't — can skew results. To overcome such problems, many pollsters now include online responses as part of a survey, but a self-selected sample also can create bias, Zogby said. Early in its development, polling created major failures. In the 1936 presidential race, Literary Digest, which had accurately forecast winners since 1916, said Republican Alf Landon would receive 57 percent of the vote to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 43 percent based on 2.4 million responses from a sample size of 10 million. On Election Day, Roosevelt won 62 percent of the vote. The poll, relying on mail-in responses, drew its sample from middle- and upper-class magazine subscribers, club membership lists and telephone subscribers while largely ignoring workers and the 9 million unemployed.In short, the poll oversampled those who tended to be better educated and more conservative than the electorate as a whole. The lesson was that a bad sampling method can't be corrected by a large sample.The survey sample must be randomly selected to avoid repeating the Literary Digest debacle. It then must reflect voters' differences in age, sex, race, education and geography. Blacks, whites, Hispanics and Asians are likely to have different opinions based on their cultural backgrounds.In the 2016 presidential election between Democrat Hillary Clinton and the Republican Trump, the Real Clear Politics average of the final round of national polls before the election showed Clinton leading Trump by 2.1 percentage points, her margin in the final popular vote.The result was accurate but irrelevant because the United States votes as 50 states — not as a nation — when electing a president. The Electoral College, not the popular vote, determines the winner. Electoral College votes are determined by a state's number of representatives in the House plus its two senators.Polls of individual battleground states would have been more valuable in assessing the race because nationwide polls missed Trump's strength in Midwestern states that carried him to victory while overstating the importance of Clinton's strength in the Northeast and on the Pacific Coast."Some polls in 2016 oversampled Democrats," Zogby said. "That meant they missed the surge Trump created in the Republican base. In 2020, many voters may say they don't like Trump and plan to vote for the Democrat, but when they get in the voting booth, peace and prosperity might weigh more heavily on their decision."During presidential primary elections, many polls sample a state's registered voters. But what's more important is likely voters, those who turn out on Election Day. During the presidential race, most polls sample only likely voters after questioning respondents about their interest in the race and if they had voted in prior elections."Pollsters can get it wrong because it's difficult to get into voters' psyches," Zogby said. "No science is perfect, and polling is not a perfect science."

                The 2020 race for the White House is well underway, and so are the polls. Several recent polls have shown US President Donald Trump trailing those leading the pack of Democrats seeking their party's nomination. But Trump has always dismissed those polls, or at least those he doesn't like, as more examples of "fake news". Is it possible to accurately handicap the current stampede of Democratic candidates and make a reasonable estimate about who might win, or at least who's ahead?

                    Trump's 2020 bid facing economic turbulence

                US President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced that White House officials are exploring the possibility of a temporary payroll tax cut to put more money in the hands of consumers and boost the economy amid anxieties of a looming recession. "I've been thinking about payroll taxes for a long time," the president told reporters in the Oval Office during a photo-op with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis. "Whether or not we do it now, it's not being done because of recession."Trump's announcement contradicted his own aides on Monday who said that "cutting payroll taxes is not something under consideration at this time''.Any such tax cut would need congressional approval. President Barack Obama cut payroll taxes in 2011 and 2012. The taxes fund Social Security and Medicare.The announcement comes as the solid economy expected to carry him to a second term is now clouded by the ongoing US-China trade dispute, threat of a recession underscored by the inverted yield curve for bonds, wild stock swings, plus a looming global economic slowdown."Trump could win with a not-so-strong economy as Obama did in 2012," Jonathan Zogby, CEO of Zogby Analytics, told China Daily. "He could do this by painting his opponent as a socialist coming for voters' healthcare, Second Amendment (gun) rights, looking to raises taxes and open the borders."Unless there's a downturn between now and Election Day, he should have a good chance to win re-election. It's hard to beat an incumbent running on peace and prosperity," Zogby said.Recessions usually occur after an industry sector crashes, such as the dot-com bust of the early 2000s, or the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007-2008.This time may be different because the US economy continues to grow, but at a slower rate; employment is at record highs while consumer spending, accounting for about two-thirds of the nation's gross domestic product, remains strong.With no immediate hits to the economy likely, recession risk this year or next may stem from the trade dispute as companies become more cautious and invest less, damaging consumer confidence. If so, that could create negative feedback, causing consumers to spend less, leading to further corporate cutbacks and job losses."President Trump's China strategy is failing," Jason Furman, a professor at the Harvard's Kennedy School of Government who served as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers 2013-2017, wrote in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece. "His tougher approach yielded no meaningful Chinese concessions, but is increasingly damaging the US economy."In 1992, Bill Clinton's adviser, James Carville, reminded him, "It's the economy, stupid." By focusing on economic issues, Clinton defeated President George H.W. Bush.Trump appears concerned, tweeting on Monday: "Our economy is very strong despite the horrendous lack of vision by (Federal Reserve Chairman) Jay Powell. The fed (funds rate), over a fairly short period of time, should be reduced by at least (one percentage point). If that happened, our economy would be even better and the world economy would be greatly and quickly enhanced — good for everyone!"Trump's making the economy the centerpiece of his re-election campaign has hit turbulence. US farmers, a key voting bloc in Trump's 2016 victory, have been pounded by the trade dispute, and retailers say supply chains have been disrupted. Trump tacitly acknowledged this with a $16 billion aid package to farmers after pledging $12 billion last year, and his decision earlier this month to delay a planned 10 percent tariff on about half of the $300 billion in Chinese goods subject to the latest round of import duties.Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 800 points, or 3 percent, after the US Treasury yield curve inverted for the first time since 2007. Inversion of the yield curve — when short-term yields rise above long-term yields — shows that investors have little confidence in the near-term outlook and bid up long-term notes.In 2005, two-year and 10-year yields inverted ahead of a recession. In the past 50 years, a recession — two consecutive quarters of negative growth — has followed a yield-curve inversion within 18 to 24 months.However, former Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen said investors should give less weight to the inverted yield curve."I think the US economy has enough strength to avoid (a recession), but the odds have clearly risen, and they're higher than I'm frankly comfortable with," Yellen told the Fox Business Network. "There are a number of factors other than market expectations about the future path of interest rates that are pushing down long-term yields."The yield-curve inversion came after the Fed last month cut short-term interest rates a quarter-point. The cut was generally viewed as an effort to stimulate the economy by reducing the cost of borrowing. Most analysts expect the Fed to make further cuts.Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, said he believes there's a 40 percent chance of a recession prior to the 2020 election."Recessions are inevitable, the only question is when?" he told CNBC. "I think that in the next two years, let's say prior to the next election, there's probably a 40 percent chance of a recession."But not all forecasters are downbeat about the economy, now in its 121st consecutive month of growth — even as Home Depot lowered its sales outlook because of the trade dispute.The Conference Board, a non-profit research group, recognizes the risks to the economy, but forecasts GDP growth of 2.3 percent in 2019 and 2 percent in 2020.The Federal Reserve expects 2.1 percent growth this year and 2 percent in 2020. The International Monetary Fund forecasts global growth of 3.5 percent in 2020, with the American economy expanding 1.9 percent.
