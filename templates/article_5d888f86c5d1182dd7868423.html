                Healthcare cooperation with Arab countries to be expanded
            </p>
            <p>
                China will expand healthcare cooperation with the Arab world through more medical assistance, information sharing and joint research, the health minister said on Friday."We will continue to deliver medical aid teams to the Arab countries and provide technical training to improve local healthcare workers' capability," said Ma Xiaowei, minister of the National Health Commission in China. "The goal is to bring genuine benefits to people from both regions."To combat infectious diseases that constantly threaten global health, China and the Arab states will develop stronger partnerships in terms of disease monitoring and precaution, in order to facilitate the timely sharing of information during health emergencies, he added.Medical institutions and pharmaceutical companies from both regions are also encouraged to join hands to establish laboratories and evaluate innovative technologies, according to an initiative announced at the Second China-Arab States Health Cooperation Forum held in Beijing on Friday.The two sides are also mulling over a joint research institute dedicated to developing and manufacturing traditional medicines. Efforts will be made to streamline market approval procedures for such drugs in both regions, the initiative said.China has developed strong ties with the Arab countries in the healthcare sector in the past decades, yielding fruitful outcomes, according to health officials attending the forum.For instance, China launched a program in 2014 to provide free cataract surgeries for patients in some Arab countries, including Sudan, Morocco and Djibouti. More than 2,800 patients have received treatment and regained eyesight so far, Ma said.Fawziya Abikar Nur, minister of health and social services of Somalia, said the largest hospital in the country, which specializes in mother and child care, was built by China about 40 years ago and handed over to local authorities."The hospital was destroyed during the civil war and we are now working to restore the hospital to its previous standard," she said. "In the future, medical training from China will be an essential part of our rehabilitation work."Nasser Mohsen Baoom, minister of public health and population of Yemen, said the expertise of Chinese medical workers is trustworthy and of consistent high quality.In addition to conventional medical aid methods, such as sending medics and equipment, Baoom said he also sees great potential to tap into cooperation opportunities in the field of traditional Chinese medicine.

                AIIB expands membership to 100 in three years
            </a>
            <p>
                LUXEMBOURG - The three-year-old Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) on Saturday further expanded its membership to 100 with the approval of the African newcomers of Benin, Djibouti and Rwanda.The decision was made unanimously by AIIB's Board of Governors at its fourth annual meeting held in Luxembourg.The three prospective non-regional members will officially join the AIIB once they complete the required domestic processes and deposit the first capital installment with the bank.In the meantime, the bank's meeting elected Chinese Finance Minister Liu Kun as chairman of the board.With its approved membership increasing to 100, and the volume of approved financing expanding to $8.5 billion, the AIIB has become an important member of multilateral development system, said Liu at the bank's annual meeting.The China-initiated multilateral financial institution began operation in January 2016 with 57 founding members, with an agenda focused on supporting sustainable development through infrastructure and other productive sectors in Asia and beyond.Lauding the progress the AIIB has made over the last three years, Liu said that the AIIB has been granted permanent observer status by the United Nations General Assembly, issued its first U.S.-dollar-denominated global bond, as well as developed a series of important strategies and policies."AIIB members collectively account for 78 percent of the world's population and 63 percent of global GDP. With the backing of all of our members, we are building a lean, clean, and green institution that can help to support their sustainable development,"said AIIB President Jin Liqun.On the bank's continuous enlargement, AIIB Vice President and Corporate Secretary Sir Danny Alexander commented, "That another 43 members have joined in the last three years is recognition that AIIB has established itself as part of the rules-based international system, with strong governance and high international standards."According to him, the widely-represented bank takes interest in expanding its business in Africa."We now have members on every continent, and we welcome the growing interest of African countries in AIIB. We look forward to working with Benin, Djibouti and Rwanda to support their development in the years to come," he said.Under the theme "Cooperation and Connectivity," the two-day annual AIIB meeting kicked off in Luxembourg on Friday for the first time outside Asia. It drew over 1,000 AIIB officials, representatives from members and partner institutions, business leaders and experts.The meeting this year highlighted stronger Asia-Europe cooperation and connectivity, digital connectivity, climate change, sustainable infrastructure and mobilizing finance for circular economy transitions.The bank's board of governors decided to hold its fifth annual meeting in Beijing on July 2-3, 2020.The AIIB has approved 46 projects worth $8.5 billion in 18 members, such as building highways and power plants.The remarkable results have testified to the bank's operational efficiency, according to Luxembourg's Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna. "We are glad we contributed from the beginning to the setting-up of AIIB, because this bank is a real success story," he told Xinhua.In particular, he expressed his belief that multilateralism is the only way to solve the worldwide issues like poverty and climate change, and the AIIB is an important instrument."If we do not embark on sustainable development, if we do not try to save countries with a low standard of living through sustainable investment, if we don't do these things well, climate change will make sure that the temperature would rise above two degrees and that our planet may basically not survive," Gramegna noted.

                Newcomers take AIIB to milestone of 100 members
            </a>
            <p>
                3 African nations approved at annual meeting as bank chief aims for 'lean, clean and green'Jin Liqun, president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which reached 100 approved members over the weekend, wants the AIIB to become the bank that connects Asia to the world.The AIIB's Board of Governors approved the applications on Saturday of three African countries - Benin, Djibouti and Rwanda - at the bank's annual meeting in Luxembourg. This would bring the total number of AIIB members to 100, including 70 whose membership has already been ratified by their respective countries' parliaments."AIIB members collectively account for 78 percent of the world's population and 63 percent of global GDP. With the backing of all of our members, we are building a lean, clean and green institution that can help to support their sustainable development," Jin said.Chinese Finance Minister Liu Kun said at the meeting on Saturday that he hopes the AIIB will give play to its advantage as a multilateral development bank to link its strategy with the development blueprints of its members, the Belt and Road Initiative and the Connecting Europe and Asia Strategy of the European Union."China, an AIIB shareholder and the country that hosts the AIIB's head office, will continue to support the bank's development," Liu said.Liu suggested that the AIIB make an overall strategy to guide its further development, based on previous operation experiences, its own features, new trends of global growth and the diversified requirements of members.Uzziel Ndagijimana, Rwanda's minister of finance and economic planning, called the AIIB "a great bank"."We are happy to join as the 100th member. We are looking forward to not only having fruitful cooperation with the bank, but also with the member countries to promote infrastructure and promote trade and investment between Asia and Africa," he said on Saturday.The three new prospective nonregional members will officially join the AIIB once they complete the required domestic processes and deposit the first capital installment with the bank.At the annual meeting, the first held outside of Asia, Luxembourg Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna praised the AIIB as "arguably the most modern and international financial institution in the world"."The bank has emerged as the beacon of multilateralism while surpassing expectations of growth," he said. Luxembourg was the first European nation to join the AIIB.Gramegna said membership of European countries has been very beneficial for European and Asian countries alike. "Looking at the results of the past three and a half years, we can all be very pleased with what has been achieved, both in terms of financial operations and in terms of the quality of the work that has been done," he said.Since January 2016, the AIIB has provided $8.5 billion in loans to 45 projects in 18 member countries, many in renewable energy and green infrastructure. The AIIB has also received the highest credit ratings from the world's three biggest rating agencies - Standard &Poor's, Moody's and Fitch Group.Jin said the bank has a good working relationship with other multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. "We set the bar at the par with other multilateral development institutions and other institutions, so we can work together," he said, adding that "we are happy to see that we are recognized as such a bank".Jin said people should realize it takes time to help developing countries in their transition from high carbon to low carbon to zero carbon economies. "So it's really a very tough job. And we are doing our very best," he said in response to criticism that the AIIB was not doing enough.Next year's annual meeting will be held in Beijing, the AIIB's Board of Governors announced on Saturday. Finance Minister Liu was elected as chairman of the fifth Board of Governors.By the end of 2018, the AIIB's total investment had reached $7.5 billion, up from $4.196 billion a year earlier, according to the annual report released on the bank's website.Contact the writers at chenweihua@chinadaily.com.cn(China Daily Global 07/15/2019 page1)
