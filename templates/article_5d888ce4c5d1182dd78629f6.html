                China's Terracotta Warriors exhibition attracts over 1,000 visitors in 3 hrs in Thailand
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                BANGKOK -- More than 1,000 visitors flocked to see the exhibition of China's Terracotta Warriors at the national museum in Bangkok in only three hours after it was opened to the public in Thailand on Monday.Thai Cultural Minister Ittipol Khunpluem said that before the exhibition opened its door at 9:00 a.m. local time, visitors have already lined up at the ticket booth."It was the perfect decision to showcase the Chinese Terracotta Warriors, as they represent heroism and patriotism," said Ittipol, adding "this first exhibition of iconic ancient Terracotta Warriors also deepens cultural and economic cooperation between China and Thailand."The Terracotta Warriors on exhibition are part of the estimated 8,000 life-size sculptures of warriors, chariots, and horses, made in around 250 B.C. for the tomb of China's first emperor Qin Shihuang.Chinese farmers first stumbled upon the tomb in Xi'an in the northern Chinese province of Shaanxi. An archaeologist identified fragments of terracotta found by the local farmers digging a well in 1974.In 1987, the site was added to the list of World Heritage Sites by UNESCO.The Thai culture minister said it is expected that 200,000 people will visit the exhibition during the three-month period until Dec. 15 this year.

                    China history podcast draw wide audience
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                In 2010, Laszlo Montgomery came up with a short list of about 150 ideas for a new and ambitious project — a podcast focusing on curated topics from more than 5,000 years of Chinese history.Over time, what started out as a hobby evolved into a popular channel with 230 episodes and a fan base made up of listeners from around the world.Montgomery now receives topic suggestions from listeners every week. One week, for example, someone asked if he could do an episode covering the War of the Eight Princes in the Western Jin Dynasty (AD 265-316), he said. In another week, someone else asked him to cover the history of Macao."Five thousand years of history … it's doubtful I'm ever going to run out of potential topics," he mused.The China History Podcast (http://chinahistorypodcast.libsyn.com/) started out as his initiative for Americans to learn about Chinese history and gain a basic understanding and appreciation for the culture, Montgomery said.In a casual, storytelling style, Montgomery presents the various emperors, dynasties, heroes, revolutions and great leaders of China. The topics that he covers range from the history of Chinese philosophy to the history of Chinese Tang poetry, from the history of Jewish refugees in China to China's relations with Vietnam.An episode uploaded on July 14, 2019, is part one of a three-part series introducing audiences to "the seven great singing stars of old Shanghai" who dominated the Chinese popular music scene in the 1930s to 1940s, and whose music helped shape Chinese cinema.His Chinese Sayings Podcast offers the history and definition for individual Chinese sayings.In one episode, he explained the Chinese idiom, wan shi ju bei, zhi qian dong feng, translated to "all is ready except for the opportunity", by going into the story of Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang and their famous scheme to burn Cao Cao's fleets during the Three Kingdoms period (220-280 AD).Montgomery, who was born in 1959, in a tight-knit Jewish community in Illinois, traces his interest in China to 1979, when he was a student at the University of Illinois.That year, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping paid a historic visit to the United States, soon after the formalization of diplomatic relations between the two nations. The milestone event, which marked the opening of a new chapter in Sino-US relations, inspired the young Montgomery to study Mandarin at his university.He moved to Hong Kong in 1989, and lived there until 1998. Throughout his career, Montgomery has worked for three Hong Kong and Chinese mainland public companies in sales, marketing and new business development."I'm not a professor. I'm a salesman, so I use my sales technique to introduce Chinese history," he said.To him, understanding is the root of acceptance. Knowledge about a country's history, culture and society promotes dialogue and facilitates connections, especially during times of tension."The better people understand Chinese society, the better the chance is of finding common ground. For such a long history, rich culture and an epic list of achievements as a people and nation, this should be the easiest story in the world to tell. All that is supposedly bad about China, we Americans have become experts," he said.That is probably why Montgomery gave a speech at Harvard University last November titled "Don't Forget the Good Times", which was intended to remind people to keep a cool head and not to forget some of the important moments in history when the two countries got along better."The US and China have come together in positive ways many times in the past, and despite our differences in culture and how we view each other … both countries have gained so much from the relationship and have become better countries because of this interaction with each other. And look at how much America has benefited thanks to Chinese immigration," he said.For example, after the US became an independent country and was no longer bound by the East India Company monopoly of China trade, American traders made a beeline to China in 1783.The early commerce in tea, silk and porcelain boosted the US economy when it was desperately needed. A lot of American ginseng was exported to China, among other commodities, Montgomery said.In 1941, the American Volunteer Group, or "Flying Tigers", came to China's aid during Japan's invasion of China."All these great moments in diplomacy, in commerce, education and moments where we held hands together for a common cause … as much as we try to hide this or downplay its importance … let's not forget it in the face of the challenges and hard feelings both sides share today," he said.His fan base is a perfect example of a group of people drawn together through a shared interest and appreciation of Chinese culture.Montgomery said that only 50 percent of his listeners are in the US; the other 50 percent come from the rest of the world. Most of his fans are from English-speaking countries, such as Canada, Australia, the US and New Zealand. But traffic also comes from Germany, Sweden and Norway, as well as Southeast Asia and China."My greatest achievement has been the bandwidth of listeners I've managed to attract. From China experts and professors around the world to high schoolers, the show seems to offer sufficient-enough sophistication for the experts but still be accessible to students working on papers for their history class," he said.One of the most enthusiastic groups of listeners of the show are overseas Chinese who grew up outside China, Montgomery noted."My listeners for the most part aren't looking for a PhD in this subject. They have an interest or a curiosity in Chinese history that leads them to seek some understanding. My show offers listeners a convenient way to learn. And everything is free," he said."It's all about promoting understanding about China, with the hope that from understanding come friendship. So that's the easy introduction," Montgomery added.

                BEIJING - Chinese researchers are collecting DNA of ancient trees in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region to unveil their mysteries and facilitate protection, according to a recent Beijing Daily article. The research is being conducted by the Beijing Institute of Landscape Architecture and involves 25 ancient ginkgoes, including 18 ginkgoes located in Beijing, five in Tianjin and two in Hebei province. Some well-known ancient trees such as the "emperor tree" in Tanzhe Temple and "ginkgo king "in Dajue Temple are included. Trees have DNA just like humans and a molecular analysis will help reveal reasons for the longevity traits of the ancient trees, according to the report.

            <p class="style-content">
                In 1957, 20-year-old Li Boqian, a sophomore undergraduate at the school of history at Peking University, had to choose a specific direction for his studies. Hearing that archaeologists have the chance to travel a lot, Li thought it would be fun to pick that subject.Yet, he did not expect to be glued to it for a lifetime."It became my destiny," the 82-year-old tells China Daily. "Much emphasis was placed on archaeology even in those earliest years of New China when the country was still enduring tough times. Because of that, everyone (in archaeological circles) was eager to make a contribution using the knowledge they had gained at university."Halted by the civil war, Chinese archaeology resumed shortly after the founding of New China in 1949. The first archaeological research institution of New China was founded in Beijing in 1950. It also organized the young country's first archaeological dig, which was took place in Huixian county, Central China's Henan province."It just took around 10 people — that was how everything got started," Li recalls. "We were so lucky to become the first group of professionally-trained archaeologists in New China."In 1952, Peking University became the first Chinese educational institution to nurture archaeology majors.Born in Henan province, long considered the cradle of early Chinese civilization, Li seemed to develop a natural ability and a special emotional attachment toward research. Nevertheless, even as a veteran archaeology professor at Peking University who lead numerous key excavations around the country over the decades, Li knows that fieldwork cannot rely solely on enthusiasm."Archaeology needs lasting devotion and the patience to work in tough conditions," he smiles. "If someone wants to make a fortune, they would be wise to choose another career."Over the years, the team continued built up their experience — and muscles — as they tried to keep up pace with the country's rapid economic development.Chen Xingcan, head of Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, cites that majors in archaeology and cultural heritage conservation are now offered by over 100 Chinese universities. Currently, more than 60 institutions and 2,000 individuals in China hold licenses to lead up archaeological excavations."Large-scale urbanization and the construction of infrastructure from the 1990s presented new challenges in terms of the conservation of heritage sites," Chen says. "The need for archaeological research skyrocketed, and brought us many new opportunities."China's cultural relic protection laws demand that archaeological investigation must be undertaken before construction can begin on any major new infrastructure project.During the early 1980s, about 100 ongoing archaeological surveys were undertaken every year, and this number has risen to nearly 1,000 now, according to Wang Wei, director of the Society of Chinese Archaeology."In the past, archaeologists used to rely on luck to a certain extent," Li adds. "However, as a more comprehensive approach to archaeological research has developed in recent years, our aim now is to discover how China came into existence, and where the origins of our civilization lie."

                The Palace Museum and Tencent have agreed to team up for digitizing relics in the museum and carrying out cultural research through information technology, including cloud and artificial intelligence.Both sides have entered into an agreement that foresees their stepped-up strategic cooperation for building a "Digital Palace Museum" in the next three years, according to a statement by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.More funding and technology support will be delivered to the digitization of the Palace Museum collection under the deal, which will also see joint research on the capture, storage and demonstration of relic information in digital forms.It is estimated that high-definition images will be captured for around 100,000 relics as a result of the cooperation, facilitating the establishment of standards concerning the digitizing sectors, according to the statement.Having achieved initial results in digitizing its collection over the past 20 years, the Palace Museum, which was home to emperors in the Ming and Qing dynasties, needs to work with more partners for further promoting "Digital Palace Museum," the statement said.

                The giant stone statues in the imperial Xiaoling Mausoleum, the burial site of the Ming Dynasty's (1368-1644) founding emperor Zhu Yuanzhang, will receive its first large-scale "facelift", local authorities said Wednesday.The 34 stone sculptures along the Sacred Avenue of the mausoleum in Nanjing, capital of East China's Jiangsu province, have been damaged due to combined effects of pollution, bioerosion and weathering over the past 600 years, according to the mausoleum management bureau.Experts will conduct repair experiments on a pair of stone statues before Oct 1 to provide a reference for the whole restoration project.Solemn and extremely lifelike, the guardian stone statues of human figures and animals like elephants and camels represent the supreme artwork of stone-cutting in the early Ming Dynasty.The imperial Xiaoling Mausoleum buried emperor Zhu Yuanzhang and his empress. In 2003, it was included on the World Heritage List by UNESCO.

                    My China adventure
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Filled with excitement at winning a Chinese government scholarship, I did not anticipate that my stay in China would evolve to be an exhilarating adventure and eye-opener. My sojourn has not only given me an opportunity to be a first-hand eyewitness of China's miraculous economic transformation but also exposed me to the interesting ancient history and culture of the Chinese people.My first taste of life in China was learning the language. The Chinese language is seen as one of the hardest languages to learn. This preconceived notion scared me off at first. However, my passion to learn the language grew as time went on and it has become an adventurous journey. I am particularly fascinated because the language is written with characters. Each word seems to be a drawing, and this raised my curiosity to learn it. Sometimes I encounter words that are spelled the same way but have different tones and mean different things. For example, xīng with the first tone means a star while xíng with the second tone means row.Moving around the streets, one can easily notice that food reflects the diverse cultural heritage of the Chinese people. China is blessed with so many nourishing foods that it is possible to live without eating the same dish twice for the whole month. There are different cuisines, which have distinctive features that separate them from one another. The use of garlic, shallots, chili and spices cannot be missed in a routine Chinese meal. My best memories of Chinese food were when I first learned to use the chopstick. I recall how I could not hold the chopsticks properly. It was a struggle to hold the pair of sticks and eat food without dropping it several times back onto the plate. But the story has changed now. I have learned to balance large meatballs between two sticks without any difficulty.The use of technology is one inevitable aspect that you cannot escape while living in China. Technology is at the center of everyday life in China. Technology is everywhere, be it in schools, on the streets or homes. Apart from food and shelter, I dare say that everyday life in China largely depends on the phone. China is a cashless society. I recall my first visit to buy soap and I was asked by the shop attendant if I had Alipay or Wechat. I looked at her and had no idea what she meant. Now I look back and cannot imagine life without Alipay or Wechat. My phone with Alipay and WeChat Pay is sufficient for me to buy groceries, book a hotel, rent a bike, or manage my finances while enjoying a movie on my bed.There is an adage that says that you cannot understand China unless you explore. Fortunately, my quest to explore was actualized with trips funded by the China Scholarship Council (CSC). The trips were meticulously organized by the Overseas Education College (OEC) of my school, Jiangsu University. The trips took me to various places but the most outstanding one was the week-long trip to Liaoning and Jilin provinces in the Northeast of China. This trip started off with a bus ride from the university to Nanjing, where we embarked on a 14-hour long, exciting train ride. This was my longest-ever train ride. It showed me parts of China I probably would not have seen if we had used another mode of transportation. As the train passed through the countryside, I saw farmers working in rice farms, with the reflection of ancient houses along the way. The breathtaking views left me wondering at the landscape, size and magnitude of China.In Liaoning province, I visited Beiling Park, which is the largest park in Shenyang city. Perhaps the most noticeable feature of the park is the Zhaoling Tomb. This is the tomb of the second Qing emperor, Huang Taji, and is one of the most famous ancient relics because it depicts China’s ancient architecture. I also visited the Industrial Museum of China and the Liaoning Provincial Museums. The museums house various cultural relics dating back over 4,000 years and document the industrialization of China. It was interesting to have a glimpse of so many artifacts on display, including cultural objects in archaeology, painting and calligraphy, carving, ceramic, cloisonné enamel, silk embroidery, dress and adornment, copper ware, currency, lacquerware, furniture, oracle bones and stone tablets. The trips to the museums clearly showed that traditional aspects of Chinese culture remain very visible in everyday life, although the country has modernized.There is no better way to understand China's miraculous economic transformation than a visit to Shanghai. The city has three major areas of interest for any foreigner: Tourism, business and shopping. Shanghai is a portrait of a modern city. The skyscrapers and its modern appearance are signals of Chinas’ economic development. I had never seen tall buildings as those in Shanghai. The tallest skyscrapers loomed over me, and for a moment, I feared the buildings might collapse on me. What impressed my sight so much were the well-built apartments and how the city has balanced modernity and natural beauty. Shanghai is a metropolitan city with both modern and traditional Chinese features. Shanghai is probably the most evocative city for any foreigner in China.Studying in China has accorded me a life time opportunity to explore the world's most populous nation while experiencing its unique blend of ancient and modern civilization, as well as its scenic beauty and bustling life. China has made me realize the beauty of learning about other cultures, taught me not just the importance of learning in the classroom, but also of learning from every single person. These are memories that I will live to cherish. My story with China has been amazing.Glad Tako Ngwira, a Malawian by nationality, is studying for a master's degree in public administration and management at Jiangsu University in China.

                Throwing a "happy funeral" is a tradition in China to commemorate a person who has lived to a ripe old age and died peacefully from natural causes.It is a time to be joyful, a celebration of life and a blessing for the surviving family members.The case for holding such a funeral can be made for Beijing Nanyuan Airport, China's oldest, which will cease public operations before Sept 30 with the opening of Beijing Daxing International Airport.Nanyuan has been witness to rapid developments in the nation's aviation industry over the past century.Opened in 1910 during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), it has long served as both a military and commercial airport. In 1986, it became the main hub for China United Airlines after serving the military for decades. The airline was established under the administration of the People's Liberation Army Air Force, connecting revolutionary base areas and border cities.Located in Fengtai district, 13 kilometers south of Tian'anmen Square, Nanyuan is much closer to downtown than is Beijing Capital International Airport. However, its outdated and even shabby facilities have turned off many passengers.
