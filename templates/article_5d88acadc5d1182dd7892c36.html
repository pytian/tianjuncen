                DPRK confirms test of new rocket system
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                SEOUL－The Democratic People's Republic of Korea said on Saturday that it has tested its new rocket system again in launches conducted on Friday under leader Kim Jong-un's supervision.The firing of "newly-developed large-caliber multiple launch guided rocket system early in the Friday morning" was aimed to examine its capabilities, such as flight performance, track control ability and rate of hits, the state KCNA said.Kim "expressed great satisfaction over the result of the test-fire," the report said.The report came a day after Pyongyang fired two projectiles from Yonghung, South Hamgyong Province, into the East Sea, which Seoul said appeared to be short-range ballistic missiles. It was the third such launch in over a week.The series of launches came ahead of a possible resumption of the denuclearization talks between Washington and Pyongyang following US President Donald Trump and Kim's impromptu meeting at the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjom on June 30.Though the working-level talks, which had been expected to resume in mid-July, have not taken place, experts say Pyongyang is apparently trying to strengthen its negotiating leverage ahead of the talks' resumption, according to the ROK's Yonhap News Agency.The new launches also came as the United Kingdom, France and Germany, following a closed UN Security Council briefing, condemned Pyongyang's recent ballistic activity as violations of UN sanctions and urged Pyongyang to engage in "meaningful negotiations" with the US on eliminating its nukes. The three countries said international sanctions should remain in place until the DPRK's nuclear and ballistic missile programs are dismantled.In a separate report carried through KCNA on Saturday, a spokesperson for the DPRK's foreign ministry issued a statement slamming the UK, France and Germany for condemning its recent missile launches.Describing its latest launches as "conventional weaponry development," the spokesperson said the DPRK decision to suspend nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests is "goodwill and consideration for dialogue partner," not "part of acts to recognize" to UN resolutions.The United States, meanwhile, has remained upbeat about the prospects for talks with the DPRK, with Trump saying on Friday the firings did not violate his agreement with Kim."Kim Jong-un and North Korea (the DPRK) tested 3 short range missiles over the last number of days," the president wrote on Twitter. "These missiles tests are not a violation of our signed Singapore agreement, nor was there discussion of short range missiles when we shook hands."A senior US State Department official also said on Friday that the US and the DPRK are in regular contact for resumption of their talks, adding that both expect the negotiations to start again soon, according to the Reuters.

                PYONGYANG -- Kim Jong-un, top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), again guided the test-firing of "a newly-developed large-caliber multiple launch guided rocket system" on Friday, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported Saturday.The report said Kim guided the test-firing at the observation post "early in the Friday morning," without mentioning the site where the test-firing took place.The test-firing "satisfactorily confirmed the altitude control level flight performance, track changing capability, accuracy of hitting a target and warhead explosion power of the guided ordnance rocket," said KCNA.According to the report, Kim expressed "great satisfaction" with the result of the test-firing, saying that "another Juche-oriented weapon planned and so desired by the Party has been made."Kim also guided the test-firing of the weapon system on Wednesday, when he emphasized that the system has "a great strategic significance" for boosting the combat capability of the country's army.

                    DPRK fires two short-range projectiles into eastern waters: ROK

            <p class="style-content">
                SEOUL - The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) fired two short-range projectiles into its eastern waters early Tuesday, the fourth such launch in less than two weeks, the Republic of Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.The projectiles, presumed to have been short-range ballistic missiles, were launched at 5:24 am and 5:36 am local time each near the DPRK's southwestern county of Kwail in South Hwanghae province, the JCS said in a statement.Both traveled eastward about 450 km at an altitude of some 37 km. The projectiles flew across the Korean Peninsula, before splashing into the eastern waters. Their maximum speed was more than Mach 6.9.The intelligence authorities of the Republic of Korea and the United States saw the projectiles bear the similar flight features to the short-range ballistic missiles the DPRK fired off on July 25, according to the JCS.The exact type of the projectiles was under analysis, the JCS added.The JCS said the Republic of Korea military was maintaining defense posture and closely monitoring relevant situations in preparation for an additional launch.Chung Eui-yong, top national security adviser for ROK President Moon Jae-in, convened an emergency meeting with the intelligence agency chief and the defense minister, according to the presidential Blue House.The DPRK's projectile firings came a day after the Republic of Korea and the United States began their joint annual military drills despite Pyongyang's strong opposition to it.The ROK-US computer-simulated command post exercise (CPX) was forecast to last for about three weeks.Following the test-launch of short-range projectiles on July 25, the DPRK sent warnings against the planned ROK-US military exercises and Seoul's adoption of the US-made stealth fighter jets.Since then, Pyongyang fired off six more short-range projectiles, including the two launched earlier in the day.

                    US, ROK to hold drills despite Pyongyang ire
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Seoul and Washington kicked off their annual joint military exercises on Monday, despite warnings from Pyongyang that the drills could derail fragile nuclear diplomacy.Choi Hyun-soo, spokeswoman for Seoul's Defense Ministry, said the joint drills code-named "Dong Maeng" began on Monday with a computer-simulated command post exercise to "cope with any emergency on the Korean Peninsula" and will last for half a month.After the command post exercise, the two allies will spend the remaining 10 days intensively verifying Seoul's capabilities if it had to take wartime operational control of its troops from Washington, The Associated Press reported.The joint military drills will proceed despite the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's denunciation. Observers said the drills may prompt further provocation from Pyongyang.After test-firing two short-range projectiles on July 25, Pyongyang sent warnings against the planned ROK-US drills and Seoul's adoption of the US-made stealth fighter jets. Since then, the DPRK fired off four more short-range projectiles in just over a week.DPRK's state news agency KCNA said earlier that it will "wait and see if the exercises actually take place to decide on the fate of its diplomacy with the United States", and also whether to continue its suspension of nuclear and long-range missile tests.Liu Tiancong, a research associate at the Northeast Asian research institute of the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, said the missile tests are intended to counter the joint military drills between ROK and the US as Pyongyang has long been dissatisfied with the exercises."In its statement, Pyongyang believes that the ROK has done little to develop inter-Korean relations and continued to strengthen the military alliance between Seoul and Washington, touching a raw nerve of Pyongyang," Liu said.The ROK and the US have scrapped or scaled down three large-scale joint military drills following the inter-Korean summit at the border village of Panmunjom in April 2018 and the DPRK-US summit in Singapore in June that year, ROK's Yonhap News Agency reported. The allies launched the new Dong Maeng exercise in March as a replacement for their large-scale springtime Key Resolve and Foal Eagle exercises, the report added.But Pyongyang has denounced the new exercise as a violation of what was agreed on during the summits. On July 26, the DPRK said the two short-range ballistic missiles it fired the previous day were a "solemn warning" against the planned military exercises, KCNA said.

                    DPRK says Kim supervised weapons tests

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The Democratic People's Republic of Korea on Saturday extended a recent streak of protests at the ongoing US-ROK joint military exercises by firing two projectiles into the East Sea, the fifth such launch since July 25.According to the Republic of Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, Saturday's projectiles were short-range ballistic missiles, which flew around 400 kilometers at a maximum altitude of 48 kilometers.A Sunday report from DPRK's Korean Central News Agency, however, said the launch was a test of its "new weapon system", which its top leader Kim Jong-un supervised. It said he expressed "great satisfaction" over the launches.KCNA did not give further details on what type of weapon was launched, only to state that the analysis of the test result "proved that the new weapon system's advantageous and powerful demand of the design was perfectly met".Following the latest firings, US President Donald Trump tweeted that Kim told him in a new letter that he wants to resume the denuclearization talks once the joint exercise between the United States and the ROK is over, and that its short-range missiles "testing would stop when the exercises end".The allies began their joint military drill last week, which Pyongyang has long condemned as a rehearsal for invasion.Wang Junsheng, an associate researcher at the National Institute of International Strategy under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said Pyongyang's successive tests of weapons are a clear protest against the drills and a display of its discontent with Seoul.Kwon Jong-gun, DPRK's Foreign Ministry's director-general of the department of US affairs, said in a statement on Sunday that Pyongyang won't even have contact with Seoul, let alone hold a dialogue, unless Seoul gives a "plausible excuse" for its ongoing military exercise with the US, calling it an "aggressive war exercise against" the DPRK, Yonhap News Agency reported."Given that the military exercise clearly puts us as an enemy in its concept, they should think that an inter-Korean contact itself will be difficult unless they put an end to such a military exercise or before they make a plausible excuse or an explanation in a sincere manner for conducting the military exercise," Kwon said.Wang, the Chinese researcher, said Seoul has been advocating itself as a coordinator between Pyongyang and Washington. However, Pyongyang does not believe Seoul has made any substantial contribution to improving the denuclearization talks, as it continues to conduct military exercises with the US."The settlement of the peninsula issues requires favorable external conditions. Not only the DPRK and the US need to hold more dialogues in good faith, but relevant countries should also create peaceful conditions and environment for progress," Wang added.

                SEOUL - The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Friday fired two unidentified short-range projectiles off its east coast, according to the Republic of Korea (ROK)'s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).The projectiles were launched at 8:01 am and 8:16 am local time each from the DPRK's eastern coastal county of Tongchon into the East Sea.They flew about 230 km at an altitude of some 30 km and a maximum speed of Mach 6.1 or higher.The JCS said in a statement that the projectiles were under precision analysis by the intelligence authorities of the ROK and the United States.It noted that the ROK's military was closely monitoring relevant situations and maintaining a firm readiness posture.The Friday projectile launch was the first in six days and the sixth in three weeks. The DPRK fired off a total of eight projectiles this year.It came amid the ongoing ROK-US joint military exercises that kicked off on Aug 5. The DPRK denounced the joint military drills as a dress rehearsal for northward invasion.Right after the DPRK's test-firings, Chung Eui-yong, a top national security adviser for ROK President Moon Jae-in, held an emergency meeting of the National Security Office (NSO), according to the presidential Blue House.The NSO urged the DPRK to stop firing short-range projectiles in protest against the ROK-US joint military drills as the launches can escalate military tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

But it did not elaborate what kind of new weapon it was.Kim stressed the need to keep channeling all-state efforts and render unreserved support to the sacred national defence building "so as to reliably guarantee the sovereignty and security of the country and the happy future of the people," according to KCNA.He also said the core plan of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea for defense building is to "possess such a powerful force strong enough to discourage any forces from daring to provoke us."The DPRK on Friday fired two unidentified short-range projectiles off its east coast into the sea, according to South Korea's military.It was the sixth round of launches in recent weeks and happened after the joint military exercises by South Korea and the United States kicked off on Aug 5.The recent weapon tests came as plans to resume working-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington appear to have stalled.

                    US-ROK joint military drills would bring 'disastrous consequences': DPRK

                PYONGYANG - The US and ROK's authorities keep staging joint military drills despite warnings from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), which would bring disastrous consequences, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Saturday."This is an open denial and an outright challenge to the historic DPRK-US joint statement in which commitments were made to establish new DPRK-US relations and build lasting and durable peace-keeping mechanism on the Korean Peninsula," the KCNA said.The joint military exercises "are not favorable for building mutual trust and can entail countermeasures by the DPRK as they still take the DPRK for an imaginary enemy" and "may render tense the situation on the Korean Peninsula again," the KCNA quoted some local experts as saying.It also said that the US government committed to stop the joint military exercises at the Singapore DPRK-US summit, but the United States, together with ROK's authorities, is resorting to the military action to openly put pressure on the DPRK."The right answer for removing all the potential and direct threats posed to the security of our state is the constant development of powerful physical means and their deployment for an actual war," the KCNA said."The US should keep in mind that our repeated warnings are not hot air," it warned.The United States has over 28,000 soldiers stationed in ROK. The joint military exercises conducted by US and ROK's military forces this year kicked off on Aug 5 and are scheduled to end on Aug 20.In an earlier report, the KCNA said that the DPRK top leader Kim Jong-un supervised the "perfect" test-fire of new weapon on Friday morning. It was the sixth round of launches since July 25.The DPRK on Friday fired two unidentified short-range projectiles off its east coast into the sea, according to ROK's military.
