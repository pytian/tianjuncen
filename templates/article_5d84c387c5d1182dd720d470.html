                Hangzhou reflects millennia of China history, change
            </p>
            <p>
                China is a country with at least 5,000 years of history. China has seen many changes in its long history from ancient kingdoms to dynasties to the founding of the People’s Republic of China. Perhaps the most rapid and dramatic changes have taken place more recently. Today, the once faraway and cloistered land has become a hotspot for foreign investors, businesses, and visitors from all around the world. The easiest and best way to see these rapid changes is to visit a Chinese city, like Hangzhou.Hangzhou was once the capital of the Song Dynasty (1127-1279). Today it is the capital of East China’s Zhejiang province, just south of Shanghai. Much has changed in Hangzhou since the Song Dynasty. In more recent years, Hangzhou has grown into a world-class city. Foreign trade and investment, as well as business sectors, have seen robust expansion. Hangzhou is home to international trade expos, international investment centers, and the Zhejiang World Trade Center. It is also home to numerous tech start-ups, retail companies, internet developers, and the global e-commerce giant Alibaba. All of this growth and change has greatly improved the local economy and China’s overall GDP.The physical shape of Hangzhou, like most of China, is also changing. Like every major city in China, construction is a constant 24/7 occurrence. The physical alteration of the land has been extraordinary. I currently work in an office in Binjiang district, which five years ago was a rice paddy. Now it is filled with bars, restaurants, cafes, Japanese sushi joints, foreign language schools, water parks, and even a park with a replica of Venice. Also, when I first lived here in 2016, there were only metro Lines 1 and 4. Now there is Line 2, part of Line 5 is open, and 6 additional lines are either planned or under construction. The city and the country show no signs of slowing down the current lightning pace of progress.But perhaps the most striking and visible change China is undergoing can be seen in the faces of its people. Long ago, Chinese cities were top destinations for travelers and traders. Hangzhou was even visited by Marco Polo. Today, China and Hangzhou are enjoying a bit of a golden age when it comes to welcoming foreign visitors and workers. Hangzhou has become a melting pot over the past few years and has high hopes of becoming an international city like its neighbor, Shanghai. I personally have met people from such diverse places as Russia, Yemen, the UK, USA, Ukraine, Madagascar, Zambia, South Africa, Canada, Iceland, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, among countless others. Many come to Hangzhou to either attend university or contribute actively to the work force. When they are not hard at work or studying, many expats are playing a role in Hangzhou’s up and coming arts scene. Expats have been getting together to express themselves at local open mics and art events, adding their flavor to Hangzhou’s creative scene. Groups such as the Hangzhou Writer’s Association or Screaming Lemur Theatre offer a place for writers and performers at all levels and abilities to express themselves. Hangzhou also enjoys local arts festivals, such as Tribe Fest, which is organized almost entirely by expats. It also sponsors the Hangzhou International Theatre Festival, which includes performances from all over the world. In time, Hangzhou’s arts scene might even rival that of Shanghai.In conclusion, China has been undergoing a staggering amount of change and development over the past few years. Hangzhou with its rapid construction, economic development, increasing diversity, and rising and vibrant arts scene, provides an excellent microcosm for the rest of the country. Today’s China is a whole new world compared to its ancient past. Everyday China is evolving and expanding. What China will look like in five years, or even one year is impossible to tell. However, whatever the result, it certainly will be an interesting place to visit and a key player on the world stage.The author is the current administrator and editor for the Hangzhou Writers’ Association International.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                Trump authorizes release of oil from strategic petroleum reserve after attacks on Saudi oil facilities
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he has authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve after attacks on Saudi Arabian oil production facilities."Based on the attack on Saudi Arabia, which may have an impact on oil prices, I have authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed, in a to-be-determined amount sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied," Trump tweeted."I have also informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in Texas and various other States," the president added.The move came after drone attacks on Saudi Arabian oil production facilities on Saturday have raised global concerns over oil supplies.The drone attacks were reported at dawn of Saturday with several explosions on Saudi Aramco plants in Khurais and Abqaiq in the east of the country, resulting in fires that were later controlled.Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud announced on Sunday that the drone attacks caused temporary suspension of production at targeted oil plants.According to Aramco, after Saturday's attacks, Saudi Arabia saw production cut by 5.7 million barrels, or about 50 percent of the company's daily production.The country's total production hovers around 10 million barrels per day, with an average of 9.85 million barrels per day in August, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show.

                US 'locked and loaded' after oil attack
            </a>
            <p>
                Iran rejects 'baseless' claims following Trump warning; Crude prices jump 19%WASHINGTON - Tensions are flaring in the Persian Gulf after US President Donald Trump said the United States is "locked and loaded" in response to a weekend drone assault on Saudi Arabia's energy infrastructure that his secretary of state blamed on Iran. Teheran on Monday called the accusation "unacceptable" and "baseless".The attack, which cut Saudi Arabia's oil production in half and sent crude prices spiking, led Trump to authorize the release of US strategic oil reserves should they be necessary to stabilize markets."There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!" Trump said on Twitter.Earlier in the day, a senior US official told reporters that evidence from the attack, which hit the world's biggest oil-processing facility, indicated Iran was behind it, instead of the Yemeni Houthi rebel group that had claimed responsibility.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also said there was no evidence the attack came from Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Houthis for four years in a war widely seen as a conflict between Saudi Arabia and Shiite Muslim rival Iran."Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply," Pompeo said.Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi dismissed the US allegations that it was responsible as pointless."These allegations are condemned as unacceptable and entirely baseless," Mousavi said in remarks carried by state TV.A senior Revolutionary Guard commander warned the Islamic Republic was ready for "full-fledged" war."All American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000 kilometers around Iran are within the range of our missiles," the semiofficial Tasnim News Agency quoted Commander Amirali Hajizadeh as saying.China urges restraint Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday that it was irresponsible to blame others for the oil attack without a conclusive investigation."The Chinese side's position is that we oppose all actions that enlarge or intensify the conflict," Hua told a news conference in Beijing."We call on relevant parties to avoid taking actions that will escalate the current tensions. We hope all sides can exercise restraint and jointly maintain the peace and stability of the Middle East," she said.Tensions between Washington and Teheran were already running high because of a long-running dispute between the two nations over Iran's nuclear program that led the US to impose sweeping sanctions more than one year ago.Oil prices surged as much as 19 percent in early Asian trade on Monday on worries over global supply and soaring tensions in the Middle East.Brent crude posted its biggest intraday percentage gain since the start of the Gulf War in 1991.The US government produced satellite photos showing what officials said were at least 19 points of impact at two Saudi energy facilities, including damage at the heart of the kingdom's crucial oil processing plant at Abqaiq.Officials said the photos show impacts consistent with the attack coming from the direction of Iran or Iraq, rather than from Yemen to the south.Iraq denied that its territory was used for an attack on Saudi Arabia.The US officials said additional devices, which apparently didn't reach their targets, were recovered northwest of the facilities and are being jointly analyzed by Saudi and US intelligence. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, did not address whether the drone could have been fired from Yemen, then taken a roundabout path, but did not explicitly rule it out."There's no doubt that Iran is responsible for this. No matter how you slice it, there's no escaping it. There's no other candidate," a US official told reporters.The attacks and recriminations are increasing heightened fears of an escalation in the region, after US Senator Lindsey Graham suggested striking Iranian oil refineries in response to the assault, and Iran warned of the potential of more violence.Actions on any side could break into the open a twilight war that's been raging just below the surface of the wider Persian Gulf in recent months. Already, there have been mysterious attacks on oil tankers that Washington blames on Teheran, at least one suspected Israeli strike on Shiite forces in Iraq, and Iran's shooting down a US military surveillance drone.Agencies - Xinhua - China Daily
