                Europe may face economic setbacks

                Germany, Italy and Britain are either on verge of recession or amid political crisisEurope is edging toward a crisis, as several of its largest economies face recession or a political crisis, analysts have said.Germany, the largest economy in Europe, is losing momentum. Italy's debt crisis is being made worse by political uncertainty, and the United Kingdom is likely to leave the European Union without a deal."These major economies in Europe are all distracted by their own problems, which is likely to lead Europe's economy to go through another round of recession, as there are not yet effective policies in these countries to stimulate growth," said Qu Qiang, assistant director of the International Monetary Institute of Renmin University of China.With various kinds of fiscal and currency instruments that could be used to stimulate the economy, European's recession will not erupt dramatically, but it is still likely to happen bit by bit, based on the current data, he said.Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, warned on Aug 19 that county could enter a recession in the third quarter, due to the falling industrial production and orders affected by the international trade tensions."The German economy is likely to remain weak in the summer of 2019," the Bundesbank said in a gloomy economic report, adding that the "overall economic output could decline slightly again".Chen Fengying, a senior researcher in the world economy at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that Germany's manufacturing sector had helped neighboring countries get out of trouble when a debt crisis hit the eurozone nearly a decade ago.But after more than a decade's growth, Germany's manufacturing sector is challenged by the sluggish international economic environment and the trade tensions initiated by the United States, she said."Germany's economy is on the verge of recession, which means that Europe is losing its engine for growth," she said. "So there is a reason to believe that Europe will experience a hard time."Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte resigned on Aug 20 after lashing out at his Interior Minister Matteo Salvini for pursuing his own interests and thus damaging the coalition government. Salvini, leader of the far-right League party, pulling the plug on a coalition with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement earlier this month and called for elections."The uncertainty about who will become the new leader of Italy will alarm international investors and is worsening its economy," Chen said.In the United Kingdom, its economy contracted for the first time since 2012, due to the Brexit chaos. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Aug 22 that the UK "must leave the EU on October 31, deal or no deal".British GDP contracted by 0.2 percent in the second quarter of 2019 compared with the first quarter, according to figures released by the Office for National Statistics of UK.Chen said that currently, the whole world's economy is undergoing transformation. Major economies are slowing down and the US and Europe "will be no exception", Chen said.However, political groups supportive of European integration prevailed in recent European Parliament elections. That means European countries will seek cooperation, rather than making more divisions, to solve their problems, she said."The incoming head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, who gained rich experience as managing director of the International Monetary Fund, will also be efficient in helping European countries reach consensus over key issues," she said.She added that some European countries, for example, Spain and Portugal, are experiencing brisk growth, driven by tourism and other factors, which might help offset the weak performance of some major economies.Qu said that a common problem that the major European economies face are aging populations and generous welfare system. An aging population means that there will be fewer workers to make innovations and to create wealth, as well as lower consumption. The result could be a stagnant economy. Welfare states require high public expenditure."When an economy slows down and the public expenditure still increases, the economic situation will not be sustainable," he said. "European countries will have to make changes."

                Tough road lies ahead for EU
            </a>
            <p>
                With the European Parliament election in May producing unexpected results, choosing new leaders for European Union institutions became a tough exercise for EU officials.On July 2, Ursula von der Leyen, German defense minister, was nominated as the new president of the European Commission, and Christine Lagarde, International Monetary Fund managing director, was nominated to head the European Central Bank. While outgoing Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel was nominated to lead the European Council, former EP president Josep Borrell's name was proposed as the new EU foreign policy chief.That all four have been elected to head their respective institutions suggests the EU leaders have agreed to a compromise. This became apparent when the candidatures of Manfred Weber of the European People's Party (a group of Christian democratic and liberal-conservative parties), and Frans Timmermans of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats were both rejected by some EU member states.The European Council nominates the new European Commission president, who then has to win an absolute majority of votes in the European Parliament to be elected to the post. In order to strengthen democracy and transparency, the EU adopted a lead-candidate-or Spitzenkandidaten-system in 2014, according to which the European Council has to nominate a candidate from the largest group in the new EP to head the commission. Which means the system is designed to ensure a candidate from the largest group in the EP would lead the commission.The fact that von der Leyen's candidacy was proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron reflects the strong bond between France and Germany. While German Chancellor Angela Merkel abstained from the vote on the commission president to avoid any conflict of interest, countries such as Hungary and Poland supported von der Leyen because Weber and Timmermans have made things difficult for the countries by giving negative assessments about them.Still, the Spitzenkandidaten system is rather weak, because member states are still reluctant to transfer much power to the EU institutions. In particular, the nomination of von der Leyen has broken the institutional balance between the European Parliament and European Council, with the member states continuing to accumulate more power.Von der Leyen's nomination steered clear of the Spitzenkandidaten process, and she needed the support of different groups to be elected. Notably, outgoing European Council President Donald Tusk called on the Group of Greens and the European Free Alliance to support von der Leyen, as it has won 74 seats and become the fourth-largest group in the EP.As for von der Leyen's policy focus, it is apparent she would intensify European security cooperation and military construction, as well as try to consolidate the union in order to increase the EU's influence in the international arena.Germany and France were expected to win, and actually won, the two most important posts-presidents of the European Commission and European Central Bank-because when European integration encounters difficulties, the two countries join forces to overcome them and deepen the integration process, which was evident during the eurozone reform and military construction processes. But since the heads of the main EU institutions are from Western Europe, the appeals of Eastern Europe are likely to be neglected, which could become a hurdle for European integration.When it comes to EU governance, the participating institutions have different rights and responsibilities. The European Commission plays the role of legislation initiator and provisional supervisor, yet it lacks flexibility and is restricted by the council and parliament. The EP may be able to better supervise member states and help rectify their faults-but, to deal with other agencies, it needs more institutional power and legal authority.It is thus obvious that the European Council will become the political center of European economic and social governance, as well as the main platform for member states to hold negotiations. And since the governments of EU states are reluctant to devolve more power to EU institutions and, instead, aim to strengthen governmental coordination to achieve policy consistency, making policy decisions will become more difficult for the EU while the negotiation process will become more complicated.The author is assistant professor of the Institute of European Studies, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

                Striking the right balance
            </a>

                EU's new leaders need confidence, vision and determination to tackle global challengesOh, the excitement and the suspense, the breathless reporting and the angry tweets. Osaka, Brussels, dinner, breakfast. Jet lag. Is anyone really surprised that - despite hours of back-biting, horse-trading and secret deals - exhausted leaders needed several meetings before agreeing on an allocation of the European Union's top jobs?Of course not. It's the way Europe chooses its political leaders. Has always done and will continue to do so until we say: Stop, enough is enough. Europe can't aim to connect with citizens and be a more forceful global actor until it puts its house in order. Yes, it's difficult to get the political balance right. There's geography and gender to consider. Egos to manage. Alliances to respect. And lost in the arcane process is quality and qualifications, merit and substance.Still, the women and men selected at the European Union summit which finally ended on July 2 appear to have the leadership skills needed to steer Europe in the challenging years ahead.Christine Lagarde will be the new head of the European Central Bank. Charles Michel, the outgoing Belgian prime minister, takes over the reins at the EU Council. And Ursula von der Leyen, former German defence minister, is the European Commission president, while Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell Fontelles has been appointed as the EU high representative for foreign and security policy.The EU's new team faces a difficult balancing act as it tries to get its internal dynamics right while also seeking to command attention and respect on a very crowded global stage.The women and men taking charge of the different EU institutions must set their global sights high. They must be ready to talk and walk very quickly on tackling major global challenges. And they should do so with confidence, vision and determination.It won't be easy. The world today is not just more complex, contested and competitive than ever before, it is going through a period of massive change and upheaval. A new era is unfolding in myriad messy ways.The dominance of the United States and Europe is well and truly over. And the global center of gravity is shifting away from the West.Just outside Europe's borders, there are countries still entangled in futile but endless wars, while others face grinding poverty, and hunger. Migration and climate change confront all nations.Liberalism is under threat. Racism is being mainstreamed, technological change and innovation challenge both the rich and the poor - albeit in different ways - and there's a push back against gender equality. Add to this the ongoing discrimination faced by minorities and the threat posed to the press and civil society. Zero-sum games prevail. And in a world dominated by "strong men" it's always "us versus them".The list is long and painful to read. With the US no longer the shining city on the hill, Europeans cannot look away and seek isolation. They must engage, connect and persist. Turning inward is not an option.Europe's voice still counts. So, here are some suggestions on how to make Europe matter even more in the months ahead:First, don't give up on Iran or the Middle East. Yes, this does mean more areas of discord with the United States administration. But so be it. Europe must salvage the nuclear deal with Iran while broadening the conversation to include regional issues. And Jared Kushner's so-called "deal of the century" Middle East Development Project? Forget it. The EU was right not to attend the Bahrain workshop and to stick to its long-standing commitment to a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.Second, build on the impressive recent EU trade deal with the South American Mercosur bloc and with Vietnam by embarking on a similar process of serious consultation and exploration of a trade pact with the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations while also seeking synergies with the African Union's even more visionary Continental Free Trade Agreement. Why not consider joining the revamped Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership that brings together 11 major economies?Third, open discussions with all interested economies on negotiating a multilateral agreement which covers internationally-agreed standards and norms on transparency, sustainability and fiscal elements of connectivity projects. The world needs more infrastructure connectivity - not just China's Belt and Road Initiative. The EU should take seriously Chinese President Xi Jinping's commitment to "multilateralizing" the Belt and Road Initiative and work with all countries with similar projects - Japan, ASEAN, India - to draw up binding quality and procurement standards for infrastructure connectivity.Fourth, replace slapdash and ad hoc internet and digital governance initiatives with a coherent international effort to set global standards. The Osaka Track to formulate rules on digital governance adopted by 24 signatories, including China, at the G20 Leaders' Summit is one way forward. As a first step, it commits countries to international rule-making on trade-related aspects of e-commerce at the World Trade Organization. India and some others are not participating - but should be persuaded to do so. Other issues to address concern privacy and data security.Fifth, make Agenda 2030 the driving force for EU ambitions and policies both at home and abroad. Adopted by the United Nations in 2015, the 17 sustainable development goals are often shrugged off as little more than a sideshow to the real task of tackling climate change, women's empowerment and combating poverty. In fact, it's quite the opposite. If implemented and enforced, the goals will go a long way to reversing environmental degradation, ensuring fair taxation and tackling ocean pollution.And last, but not least, ignore the far right naysayers and adopt a humane and respectful policy for managing migration which meets Europe's need for skills, labor and talent. Italy's action against Carola Rackete, the captain of the Sea-Watch 3 rescue ship, who sailed into the port of Lampedusa with 42 asylum seekers on board despite a ban from Rome, is just one example of an EU policy gone terribly wrong. It clearly erodes the EU's moral credibility.There is more of course. Europe alone can't ensure peace in our world. But new EU leaders can play their part in trying to make a start.The author is the director for Europe& Geopolitics at Friends of Europe, based in Brussels.

                EU pushes Bulgarian for top job at IMF
            </a>
            <p>
                But move has raised doubts about European domination of governanceThe European Union has decided to put forward World Bank official Kristalina Georgieva as their candidate to replace Christine Lagarde as head of the Washington-based International Monetary Fund. But the move has raised doubts about the European domination of the organization that fosters global financial stability.The EU's nomination of Georgieva, a Bulgarian economist, came after two days of negotiations and two rounds of contested votes in a selection process led by French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. Other candidates include former Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, Portuguese Finance Minister Mario Centeno, Bank of Finland Governor Olli Rehn and Spanish economy minister Nadia Calvino.If approved by IMF's board in October, Georgieva would be the first East European to head the organization. All 11 IMF chiefs since 1946 have been West Europeans. Under an informal agreement between Europe and the United States, the World Bank is headed by a US citizen and the IMF by a European. Together, they control 46 percent of the IMF vote."Ms Georgieva certainly has strong credentials in the world of international finance and is likely to do a competent job managing the economic and political challenges the IMF faces," Eswar Prasad, a professor at Cornell University and a former chief of IMF's China Division, told China Daily on Monday."However, the process of her nomination, which was orchestrated by a set of advanced European countries, still reeks of a global governance system that is dominated by advanced economies who put their interests first."Prasad said the outcome points to the lack of unity among emerging market economies, whose competing interests and lack of cooperation have yet again prevented them from mounting a cohesive challenge to the existing international order.The IMF board of directors would need to change its rules to let Georgieva succeed Lagarde, who resigned last month to take the job as president of the European Central Bank. Managing directors are now required to take office before turning 65; Georgieva will turn 66 on Aug 13.Ferdinando Giugliano, an editorial board member of Financial Times, wrote on Monday on his Twitter that Georgieva "is a strong contender to head the IMF, but Europe has no divine right to this post"."There should be other candidates - from Mark Carney to Tharman Shanmugaratnam - and the IMF board should simply pick the best." Carney is the governor of Bank of England and holds Canadian, British and Irish citizenships while Shanmugaratnam is chairman of Monetary Authority of Singapore.In a Bloomberg column on Monday, Giugliano argued that the world economy is changing as Europe's share of global income continues to fall. "At a fraught moment for international politics and economics, the IMF needs the best possible head regardless of where she or he comes from. A selection based truly on merit is far better than an anachronistic America-European stitch-up," he wrote.Writing in The Guardian newspaper on Monday, Amanda Khozi Mukwashi, chief executive of Christian Aid, a relief and development agency in UK and Ireland, said that the new IMF chief should not be chosen by Europe alone."As the world becomes ever more politically polarized and vulnerable to populist leadership, and as the US turns away from multilateralism and takes a skeptical approach on the climate crisis, there is all the more reason for these major institutions - which are so keen to boast of their globalist credentials - to take an inclusive, merit-based approach to what ought to be a diversified recruitment process," she wrote."The coming window for new leadership is an opportunity for the IMF to demonstrate a different model that is democratic and -crucially - inclusive of candidates from the global south. IMF, like the World Bank, needs to modernize, or it is in danger of outliving its usefulness to the world," she said.The European Commission does not have a formal role in the selection of an IMF chief, but spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said at a news conference in Brussels on Friday: "We do support the nomination of a European candidate, who can make an effective contribution to the IMF's global mission of maintaining the stability of international economy."

                IMF nominee a sign of W. Europe losing hold
            </a>
            <p>
                If choice approved, first East European will be taking the helm of institution The European Union's nomination of World Bank Chief Executive Officer Kristalina Georgieva as head of the International Monetary Fund has raised doubts about Western European domination of the institution. The EU's nomination of Georgieva, a Bulgarian economist, came after two days of negotiations and two rounds of contested votes in a selection process led by French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.

"Ms Georgieva certainly has strong credentials in the world of international finance and is likely to do a competent job managing the economic and political challenges the IMF faces," Eswar Prasad, a professor at Cornell University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told China Daily on Monday. "However, the process of her nomination, which was orchestrated by a set of advanced European countries, still reeks of a global governance system that is dominated by advanced economies who put their interests first," Prasad, a former chief of IMF China division, said. "Yet again, the leadership of the major international financial institutions is being determined not based on technical competence but by a small group of advanced economies, with even major emerging market economies having little say in the process." He said the outcome also points to the lack of unity among emerging market economies, whose competing interests and lack of cooperation have yet again prevented them from mounting a cohesive and credible challenge to the existing international order. Mina Andreeva, the European Commission spokeswoman, did not say whether the EU would support a non-European candidate for the IMF top job. "We do support the nomination of a European candidate who can make an effective contribution to the IMF's global mission of maintaining the stability of international economy," she told a regular news briefing in Brussels on Friday. While saying that the European Commission does not have a formal role in the selection process, she said: "We believe there are a number of well-qualified European candidates." Georgieva's nomination has created a conflict with the current IMF age limit that managing directors take office before turning 65. She will turn 66 on Aug 13. The IMF board would need to change its law to let her succeed Christine Lagarde, who resigned last month to take the job as president of the European Central Bank. Echoing Prasad's view, Ferdinando Giugliano, an editorial board member of Financial Times, tweeted on Monday that Georgieva "is a strong contender to head the IMF, but Europe has no divine right to this post. "There should be other candidates - from Mark Carney to Tharman Shanmugaratnam - and the IMF board should simply pick the best," Giugliano said. Carney is the governor of the Bank of England and holds Canadian, British and Irish citizenship, while Shanmugaratnam is the chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. In a Bloomberg column on Monday, Giugliano argued that "the choice should be open. Other people, especially from emerging markets, should be encouraged to apply too." He said the world economy is changing as Europe's share of global income continues to fall. "At a fraught moment for international politics and economics, the IMF needs the best possible head regardless of where she or he comes from.

                US administration gets egg on its face with fallacious currency claim
            </a>
            <p>
                The labeling of China as a currency manipulator on Monday by US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is another sign of the impulsive nature of the US administration's decision-making that is often based on its twisting of facts. In May, the Treasury's semi-annual report to the US Congress determined that China is not a currency manipulator. The International Monetary Fund said at the time that China's handling of its currency was "broadly in line" with the state of its economy. A few months ago outgoing IMF managing director Christine Lagarde had dismissed the idea that China is manipulating its currency to gain a competitive advantage. China's central bank has been letting market forces play a larger role in determining the yuan's exchange rate, and on Monday, when the yuan faced growing devaluation pressure under the latest US threat to impose 10 percent punitive tariff on $300 billion Chinese goods starting Sept 1, it went beyond 7 to the US dollar. The People's Bank of China said it was the "arbitrary unilateral and protectionist practice" of the US that had caused the Chinese currency to weaken. The US claim that China is a currency manipulator has been criticized and questioned by many in the US including former US treasury secretary Larry Summers and Fred Bergsten, a leading currency expert. The title of Summers' Washington Post column on Tuesday tells it all: "By naming China a currency manipulator, Mnuchin has damaged his credibility". Summers argued that China does not come close to fitting the template as a currency manipulator. China has reduced its trade surplus from more than 8 percent of GDP to almost zero in the past eight years. And the yuan's weakening on Monday was not artificial - it was an entirely natural market response to the US' new threat to impose more tariffs. On Tuesday, Bergsten, a former US assistant secretary of treasury, listed three fundamental reasons for the yuan's fall. First, US tariffs and rising global uncertainty have pushed the dollar up against most currencies, including the yuan. Second, US tariffs are hurting the Chinese economy, thereby reducing the demand for the yuan by overseas investors. Third, investors think China's central bank will continue pumping money into the economy. That also puts downward pressure on the currency. He called the US designation "toothless" and "fallacious" and said it won't get support from the IMF. I have talked with Bergsten and Summers in Washington in the past few years and their views have been consistent. So far, no US economist has come out in support of the US Treasury designation. People from economics Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman to Derek Scissors, an economist and usually a critic of Chinese economic policy at the American Enterprise Institute, have all rejected the listing. A story on Markets Insider on Tuesday quoted experts as saying that based on the US administration's definition, the US has a long history of "currency manipulation", or letting the US dollar slide. There is no doubt that the US Treasury's designation, under the auspices of the US administration, is aimed at justifying protectionist tariffs on Chinese goods in the escalating trade war. But the trade war the US administration initiated with China has already proved to be a failure as it could not bully China into conceding one-sided concessions. The economists from top think tanks in Washington I interviewed early last year had already predicted that it would not be easy to win a trade war as the US administration claimed, and that has proved to be the case. The US administration continues to claim that the tariffs are being paid by the Chinese. But a Goldman Sachs study belies that, showing the tariff costs fall entirely on US businesses and households.

                IMF reiterates China's exchange rate broadly in line with fundamentals
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - China's real effective exchange rate (REER) in 2018 is estimated to be at the same level as warranted by fundamentals and desirable policies, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reiterated on Friday in a newly released report.The average REER in 2018 appreciated by about 1.4 percent relative to 2017, driven by the appreciation in the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) (1.5 percent), the IMF said in a staff report after concluding the annual Article IV consultation to review the Chinese economy.China's current account surplus fell by around 1 percentage point to 0.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018 and it is projected to remain contained at 0.5 percent of GDP in 2019, the report noted."The external position in 2018 was assessed to be broadly in line with the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies," the IMF said, consistent with its earlier conclusion in its annual External Sector Report released in July."The IMF report makes clear that there has been absolutely no currency manipulation and that China's external balance has been appropriate," Jeffrey Sachs, a senior United Nations advisor and renowned economics professor at Columbia University, told Xinhua via email.In response to the IMF estimates through May 2019 which show the REER has depreciated by about 0.2 percent relative to the 2018 average, Sachs said the unilateral tariff action by the United States "surely has caused some depreciation" of the equilibrium REER."The US Treasury action declaring China a currency manipulator was blatantly arbitrary, capricious and political, based on Trump's tweets rather than on objective analysis," Sachs said.Mark Sobel, non-resident senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and US chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, told Xinhua that the Article IV report also notes that China's current account surplus is "small," around half of a percent of GDP, and "that estimates suggest China has not been intervening in the foreign exchange market.""As such, the Article IV clearly rebuffs the recent US assertion that China is 'manipulating' its currency to gain unfair competitive trade advantage or prevent effective balance of payments adjustment," said Sobel, who was the U.S. representative at the IMF, and once served as deputy assistant secretary for international monetary and financial policy at the US Department of the Treasury.Gary Hufbauer, non-resident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Xinhua that "there's no chance" that the IMF will change its assessment (on currency manipulation) unless the United States threatens to withhold support from the European Union's nominee for the managing director, conditioned on a "fresh evaluation" of the IMF's criteria for assessing exchange rates.The IMF executive board has initiated the selection process for the next managing director, aiming to reach a decision in early October, after Christine Lagarde formally submitted her resignation in July. The position of IMF chief has always been held by Europeans while the head of the World Bank has traditionally been American, an informal arrangement that has stayed in place for over seven decades.In the newly released IMF report, the IMF executive directors also commended the Chinese authorities' recent reform progress, in particular, in reducing financial sector fragilities and continuing opening-up of the economy, while underscoring the importance of structural fiscal reforms that can enhance medium-term growth.Welcoming the country's commitment to multilateralism and a rules-based trading system, the executive directors agreed that trade tensions between China and the United States should be quickly resolved through a comprehensive agreement that avoids undermining the international system.The directors also concurred that greater exchange rate flexibility and deeper and better functioning foreign exchange markets would help the financial system prepare for greater capital flow volatility.

                IMF needs reforms to meet new challenges
            </a>
            <p>
                As a significant multilateral organization, the International Monetary Fund has played an effective role in promoting economic globalization. To begin with, the IMF has helped advance globalization and international trade. It is committed to boosting and better balancing global trade, while helping IMF member states establish a multilateral payment system with the aim of removing the foreign exchange limits that impede the development of global trade. In particular, the IMF has opposed trade protectionism since the China-US trade conflict intensified, and warned that the rise of protectionism is harmful to global economic growth. In fact, Christine Lagarde, the outgoing managing director of the IMF, called on countries to make efforts to build an open and rule-based multilateral trading system. The IMF has facilitated the orderly flow of state-owned capital, while encouraging member states, especially developing countries, to promote capital account openness. But after the 2008 global financial crisis, the IMF's attitude toward capital flow has changed; it has begun focusing more on management of capital flow. On the whole, the IMF still emphasizes the free flow of capital as long as the extent of the flow does not exceed the financial capacity of a country, saying that once a country's capital flow exceeds its capacity, the IMF would be forced to regulate the capital flow, even impose capital control. Which means countries can enjoy the benefits of the globalization of capital, but have to take measures to reduce its negative effects. The IMF has also helped stabilize globalization. For example, to minimize risks at the international and national levels, the IMF put forward policies and suggestions aimed at guaranteeing global financial and economic stability, so as to boost the movement of goods, services and capital among different countries. It has also issued reports to assess and analyze the potential financial risks and vulnerability of major economies. Moreover, the IMF helps crisis-stricken countries recover and return to the growth track. For instance, it offers credit instruments which can provide financial support for member states, including standby credit facility, to balance their international payments in the short term, extended financing facility in the long run, and rapid financing instruments to meet the international payment demand. It also offers precautionary financing to prevent and deal with economic crises. But the IMF faces challenges, too, because of the decline of multilateralism. As the largest shareholder of the IMF, the United States is critical to its funding. But that the US has taken advantage of the bilateral currency swap agreement to maintain its financial stability suggests the US is now less interested in multilateralism in international financing. With the US administration turning its back on multilateral mechanisms, the IMF's problems are likely to increase. To some extent, the IMF has encountered difficulties due to a lack of financial resources. For example, its lending capacity has lowered, and as the new borrowing arrangement will expire by the end of 2022, its financial resources could shrink to half their present size if a new arrangement is not put in place. Plus, the lack of financial resources will undermine the IMF's capacity to defend globalization. The delay in reform has weakened the IMF's governance structure. Emerging economies have become more important for global economic development. Yet the IMF's governance structure is not fully adaptive to the new changes to promote global economic development, especially because there is a huge gap between the share of emerging markets in the world economy and their voting rights in global financial institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. With Lagarde scheduled to leave office on Sept 12, the new IMF chief needs to be aware of the potential challenges, and make strenuous efforts to maintain the IMF's position at the core of the global financial system, by enhancing the solidarity of member states and strengthening the IMF's financial resources, in order to prevent the global financial security system from weakening. The new chief also has to continue promoting structural reforms in the IMF in accordance with the current global economic trend, and optimize the organization's functions in order to better promote global economic development.

                IMF to consider sole candidate Kristalina Georgieva for managing director
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - The executive board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced on Monday that it will consider the nomination of Bulgaria's Kristalina Georgieva, currently chief executive officer of the World Bank, for the position of IMF managing director.Georgieva, selected by the European Union to lead the IMF, has become the only nominee for the position, as the period for submitting nominations closed on Friday. She served on the European Commission and has been chief executive officer of the World Bank since January 2017.The IMF approved the removal of the age limit for the position of managing director last week, paving the way for 66-year-old Georgieva to head the multilateral lender.Previously, the IMF's bylaws had prohibited the appointment of a candidate aged 65 or over as managing director and had also prohibited the managing director from serving past his/her 70th birthday.In July, Christine Lagarde announced her resignation as IMF chief from Sept. 12 shortly after she was nominated for the presidency of the European Central Bank (ECB), triggering a selection process for the global lender's next managing director.In early August, Georgieva narrowly defeated former Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem and emerged as EU's choice to lead the IMF, after EU countries failed to reach a consensus on a single candidate.Britain had actively promoted its former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne for the post, but later decided to support Georgieva as it didn't manage to garner enough support for Osborne, according to media reports.Georgieva, who would become the first eastern European national to head the IMF, "has confirmed willingness to be considered as a candidate," the executive board said in the statement. The board's goal is to complete the selection process "as soon as possible," at the latest by Oct 4.The position of IMF chief has always been held by Europeans while the top job at the World Bank has traditionally been American, an informal arrangement that has stayed in place for over seven decades.Earlier this year, David Malpass, former undersecretary for international affairs at the US Treasury Department, was chosen by US President Donald Trump as a candidate to lead the World Bank, and he took office in April after a campaign without competition.
