                Trump seeks Pakistan's help to end long war
            </p>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump claimed on Monday that he could end the nearly two-decade old war in Afghanistan in a matter of days, but it would kill millions of people and wipe the country "off the face of the earth".The president made the statement at the White House as he praised Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and sought his help in negotiating a peace deal in neighboring Afghanistan."I could win that war in a week. I just don't want to kill 10 million people," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. "If I wanted to win that war, Afghanistan would be wiped off the face of the earth. It would be gone. It would be over, literally, in 10 days."Warming up to Khan marked a turnaround for Trump, who has been sharply critical of Pakistan and now hopes Khan's government will use its influence with the Taliban to advance a peace deal and help the United States withdraw from the nearly two-decade old war.The war began when the US hunted al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden and his Taliban supporters in Afghanistan following the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist plane attacks in the US. Sitting alongside Khan, Trump said he wanted a peaceful resolution. "So we're working with Pakistan and others to extricate ourselves."The pleasantries in the Oval Office were an abrupt change from when Trump cut millions of dollars in aid to Pakistan, saying the only thing it offered the US was "lies" and "deceit".Khan has bashed Trump too, but now says Pakistan is also eager to work to end the war. The US wants Pakistan to use its leverage to get the Taliban to agree to a cease-fire, negotiate with the Afghan government and stop harboring militant groups.US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has been holding talks with the Taliban for months, but so far the militant group has refused to talk directly to the Afghan government. There has been no letup in terrorist attacks during the US-Taliban talks."It's the closest we've been to a peace deal," Khan told Trump. "And I hope in the coming days we will be able to urge the Taliban to speak to the Afghan government and come to a political solution."As the war has dragged on, relations between the US and Pakistan have gone up and down. They reached rock bottom under former president Barack Obama when the US carried out the raid on bin Laden's compound in Pakistan without giving Islamabad a heads-up. The relationship didn't improve when Trump took office.In January 2018, Trump tweeted: "The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help."Khan, who assumed office last fall, has fired back.He tweeted that Pakistan has suffered 75,000 casualties and lost $123 billion in the "US War on Terror", although no Pakistanis were involved in the Sept 11 attacks. He said the US has only provided a "minuscule" $20 billion in aid.Agencies(China Daily Global 07/24/2019 page7)

                Real spies take center stage at museum
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - James Bond's shiny silver sports car - with its JB007 rotating license plate - is the first thing visitors see when they step into the new and improved International Spy Museum that opens on Sunday in Washington. After that, it's as if the history of Hollywood's famous private eye vanishes in invisible ink, while the stories of real-life spies and modern-day espionage take center stage. The old, cramped museum focused on human collection of intelligence. The new one also offers a window into covert operations, counterterrorism, intelligence analysis, cyber espionage, intelligence failures and even highly debated legal and ethical issues, such as waterboarding. "We're not playing it safe as a museum," Vince Houghton, the museum's curator and historian, said during a sneak-peak tour of the $162 million, nonprofit museum. "We don't get money from the government. We need to maintain our independence because there are a lot of stories we need to tell." Real intelligence officers tend to be tight-lipped, but at the museum, visitors can watch videos starring current or former intelligence officers talking about their jobs. The top psychologist at the CIA talks about how trust and fear affect relationships between intelligence assets and their handlers. A former deputy CIA director discusses how spooks assessed the intelligence that led to the raid of a compound where al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden was killed in 2011 in Pakistan. Real female spies dispel the myth that women rely on sex appeal to gather intelligence. "It's the Magna Carta for American intelligence," Houghton said of his favorite artifact. "It's the founding document and we have it. It's as cool as it gets." The new spy museum has 10,000 artifacts, including more than 5,000 items donated by H. Keith Melton, a Florida businessman who spent years crisscrossing the globe to find and buy them. Not everything is real. Upon entry, visitors can opt to get a cover identity and mission along with a badge with radio-frequency technology that will recognize them as they walk up to interactive exhibits throughout the museum. Their spy skills are tested throughout the tour and they can find out if they're suited to be an intelligence officer. Associated Press (China Daily Global 05/09/2019 page6)

                Man sought guns, grenades for Times Square attack, feds say
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW YORK — A New York City man accused of plotting a terrorist attack on Times Square spent months trying to stockpile guns and grenades, heaped praise on the Islamic State group and Osama bin Laden, and feared being known as the "Looney Tunes Terrorist" if his glasses fell off and he couldn't shoot straight, federal prosecutors said Friday.Ashiqul Alam was arrested Thursday after arranging through an undercover agent to buy a pair of semiautomatic pistols with obliterated serial numbers, prosecutors said. Police Commissioner James O'Neill said that development was "a clear indicator of (Alam's) intent to move his plot forward."Despite the grave allegations, the 22-year-old Alam is charged only with offenses related to the gun transaction. He did not enter a plea at an arraignment Friday and was ordered jailed without bail. Prosecutors argued he was a flight risk and a danger to the community.Alam's lawyer, James Darrow, declined to comment.Court documents describe months of plotting for an attack Alam told an undercover agent would make them "legends."Alam spoke of plotting to kill civilians and law enforcement officers in Times Square and targeting a senior government official in Washington, according to the documents.He talked about wanting to "shoot down" gays, referring to them with a slur; using a "rocket launcher, like a huge one," to cause havoc at the World Trade Center; and obtaining an enhanced driver's license so he could walk onto a military base and "blow it up," the documents said.Alam, born in Bangladesh, moved to the US as a child about 12 years ago and has been living in Queens as a legal permanent resident, prosecutors said.Alam started speaking with the undercover agent about his plans in August and went with him on reconnaissance trips to Times Square and to a shooting range in Pennsylvania, the documents said.Alam "repeatedly expressed interest in purchasing firearms and explosives for a terrorist attack in the New York City area" during conversations with the agent and spoke glowingly about past attacks on the city, the court documents said.Alam used his cellphone to take video of Times Square and "explained to the undercover that he was looking for potential targets," according to the documents.Alam also allegedly discussed buying a silencer, ammunition and hand grenades, which he said could each "take out at least eight people."In April, Alam told the undercover agent he was planning to get laser eye surgery so he wouldn't have to wear glasses during the planned attack, the documents said."Let's say we are in an attack, right, say that my glasses fall off. What if I accidentally shoot you? You know what I mean?" Alam said, according to the documents. "Imagine what the news channel would call me, the Looney Tunes Terrorist or the Blind Terrorist."Times Square, the heart of the Broadway theater district and packed with tourists day and night, has been a target of attacks before.In 2010, Faisal Shahzad, a US citizen who had gotten explosives training in Pakistan, tried but failed to detonate a car bomb there. He was sentenced to life in prison.In 2017, a Bangladeshi immigrant, Akayed Ullah, detonated a bomb in an underground pedestrian concourse linking the Times Square subway station to the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Only Ullah was seriously hurt, though bystanders were injured by shrapnel.That same year, a man who told police he was high on drugs and hearing voices drove his car into the square's crowds, killing a teenager and injuring around 20 people.Police always have a heavy presence in Times Square, and its sidewalks and plazas are partially protected with steel posts intended to stop vehicles.AP

                US believes Osama bin Laden's son Hamza is dead - official
            </a>
            <p>
                The United States believes that Hamza bin Laden, a son of slain al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden and himself a notable figure in the militant group, is dead, a US official said on Wednesday.The US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, provided no further details, including when Hamza died or where.President Donald Trump earlier on Wednesday declined to comment after NBC News first reported the US assessment. Asked if he had intelligence that bin Laden's son had been killed, Trump told reporters: "I don't want to comment on it."Separately, the White House declined comment on whether any announcement was imminent.Hamza, believed to be about 30 years old, was at his father's side in Afghanistan before the Sept 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and spent time with him in Pakistan after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan pushed much of al Qaida's senior leadership there, according to the Brookings Institution.Osama bin Laden was killed by US special forces who raided his compound in Pakistan in 2011. Hamza was thought to be under house arrest in Iran at the time, and documents recovered from the compound indicated that aides had been trying to reunite him with his father.The New York Times reported that the United States had a role in the operation that led to Hamza's death, which it said took place in the past two years. Reuters could not immediately verify those details.Still, the US government's conclusion appears to be a recent one. In February, the State Department said it was offering a reward of up to $1 million for information leading "to the identification or location in any country" of Hamza, calling him a key al Qaida leader.Introduced by al Qaida's chief Ayman al-Zawahiri in an audio message in 2015, Hamza provided a younger voice for the group whose aging leaders have struggled to inspire militants around the world galvanized by Islamic State, according to analysts.Hamza has called for acts of terrorism in Western capitals and threatened to take revenge against the United States for his father's killing, the US State Department said in 2017 when it designated him as a global terrorist.He also threatened to target Americans abroad and urged tribal groups in Saudi Arabia to unite with Yemen's al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula to fight against Saudi Arabia, it said.In March, Saudi Arabia announced it had stripped Hamza bin Laden of his citizenship, saying the decision was made by a royal order in November 2018.Reuters

                Latest Taliban talks end without agreement
            </a>
            <p>
                KABUL - Taliban and US negotiators have wrapped up their latest round of talks seeking a deal that would see the United States shrink its troop presence in Afghanistan, a Taliban spokesman said on Monday.The eighth round of talks in the Gulf Arab nation of Qatar concluded after midnight and was "long and useful", Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement.He made no statements on the outcome of the talks.Last week, another Taliban spokesman had said a deal was expected to follow this round as both sides seek an end to the nearly 18-year war.An agreement - if reached - is expected to include Taliban guarantees that Afghanistan would not be a base for other extremist groups in the future. However, both the Islamic State group's affiliate and al-Qaida remain active in the country. The Taliban stage near-daily attacks across Afghanistan, mainly targeting Afghan forces and government officials but also killing many civilians.The deal also could include a cease-fire and stipulate that the Taliban would negotiate with Afghan representatives, though the insurgent group has so far refused to negotiate with Kabul representatives.There was no immediate comment on Monday from US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who on Sunday tweeted that "I hope this is the last Eid where#Afghanistan is at war".Sunday was the first day of the Muslim holiday of Eid-al-Adha, which unfolded without any major violence reported in Afghanistan.Khalilzad later added that "Many scholars believe that the deeper meaning of Eid al-Hadha is to sacrifice one's ego. Leaders on all sides of the war in Afghanistan must take this to heart as we strive for peace".Some in Afghanistan saw it as a response to President Ashraf Ghani, who on Sunday declared that "Our future cannot be decided outside, whether in the capital cities of our friends, nemeses or neighbors. The fate of Afghanistan will be decided here in this homeland. ... We don't want anyone to intervene in our affairs."While Ghani insists that the upcoming Sept 28 presidential election is crucial for giving Afghanistan's leader a powerful mandate to decide the country's future after years of war, Khalilzad is seeking a peace deal by Sept 1, weeks before the vote.The Taliban control roughly half of Afghanistan and are at their strongest since the US-led NATO invasion toppled their five-year government in 2001 after the group had harbored al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. More than 2,400 US service members have died in Afghanistan since then.The United States and NATO formally concluded their combat mission in Afghanistan in 2014. Around 20,000 US and allied troops that remain are carrying out airstrikes on the Taliban and IS militants, and are working to train and build the Afghan military.Agencies

                US, Taliban resume talks to end war
            </a>
            <p>
                KABUL, Afghanistan - A United States envoy and the Taliban resumed negotiations on Thursday on ending Washington's longest war after earlier signaling they were close to a deal.A Taliban member familiar with, but not part of, the talks that resumed in Qatar said US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad also met one-on-one on Wednesday with the Taliban's lead negotiator, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. The Taliban member spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with reporters.Baradar is one of the Taliban's founders and has perhaps the strongest influence on the insurgent group's rank-and-file members. Some in Afghanistan fear that Taliban fighters who reject a deal with the US could migrate to other militant groups such as the brutal local affiliate of the Islamic State group, which claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at a Kabul wedding over the weekend that killed at least 80 people.That attack again raised fears among Afghans that a US-Taliban deal will bring little peace for long-suffering civilians in the past decade alone.The US and the Taliban have held eight previous rounds of negotiations in the past year on issues including a US troop withdrawal, a cease-fire, intra-Afghan negotiations to follow and Taliban guarantees that Afghanistan will not be a launchpad for global terror attacks.Previously, Khalilzad has said the intra-Afghan negotiations will be the occasion to work out thorny issues such as constitutional reforms, the fate of the country's many militias and even the name for Afghanistan, as the Taliban still refers to it as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.It was not immediately clear when a deal might be reached. US President Donald Trump, who wants to bring home at least some of the 13,000 troops he says remain in Afghanistan before next year's election, was briefed on the negotiations on Friday.This week, Trump said it was "ridiculous" that US troops have been in the country for almost 18 years. Two US service members were killed on Wednesday, joining more than 2,400 US service personnel who have died since the US-led invasion in 2001 to topple the Taliban, whose government had harbored al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.Trump this week also said Afghanistan remains dangerous and "we have to have a presence" - a stance that could complicate talks with the Taliban, whose top demand has been the departure of all US and allied troops, which number close to 20,000.Associated Press

                Afghan peace talks dead; US to keep up pressure
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON — Talks on bringing peace to Afghanistan are on hold, and the United States will keep pressuring Taliban militants for significant commitments while providing military support to Afghan troops, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday.US President Donald Trump unexpectedly announced Saturday that he had canceled peace talks with the Taliban's "major leaders" at Camp David, Maryland after the group claimed responsibility for a Kabul attack last week that killed a US soldier and 11 other people.The US has recalled US special envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad to Washington to chart the path forward, Pompeo said in appearances on Sunday news shows. Asked on "Fox News Sunday" whether Afghan talks were dead, Pompeo said, "For the time being they are."US diplomats have been talking with Taliban representatives for months about a plan to withdraw thousands of American troops in exchange for security guarantees by the Taliban.US and Taliban negotiators struck a draft peace deal last week that could have led to a drawdown in US troops from America's longest war, one of Trump's foreign policy objectives.Asked about the Camp David meeting scheduled for Sunday, Pompeo said Trump decided to get personally involved to advance the agreement."President Trump ultimately made the decision," Pompeo told Fox. "He said, 'I want to talk to (President) Ashraf Ghani. I want to talk to these Taliban negotiators. I want to look them in the eye. I want to see if we can get to the final outcome we needed.'"After news emerged of the Camp David scenario, Trump was criticized for having planned to host on US soil a militant group that has killed U.S. troops and sheltered al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden after the Sept 11, 2001, attacks on the United States."Never should leaders of a terrorist organization that hasn't renounced 9/11 and continues in evil be allowed in our great country. NEVER. Full stop," US Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois tweeted on Saturday.REUTERS

                Rocket blast at US Embassy in Kabul on 9/11 anniversary
            </a>
            <p>
                KABUL, Afghanistan — A rocket exploded at the US Embassy in Afghanistan just minutes into Wednesday, the anniversary of the 9/11 attack on the United States.A plume of smoke rose over central Kabul shortly after midnight and sirens could be heard. Inside the embassy, employees heard this message over the loudspeaker: "An explosion caused by a rocket has occurred on compound."About an hour later the all-clear was given, with no injuries reported.There was no immediate comment from Afghan officials or those with the NATO mission, which is also nearby.It was the first major attack in the Afghan capital since President Donald Trump abruptly called off US-Taliban talks over the weekend, on the brink of an apparent deal to end America's longest war.Two Taliban car bombs shook Kabul last week, killing several civilians and two members of the NATO mission. Trump has cited the death of a US service member in one of those blasts as the reason why he now calls the US-Taliban talks "dead."The 9/11 anniversary is a sensitive day in Afghanistan's capital and one on which attacks have occurred. A US-led invasion of Afghanistan shortly after the 2001 attack toppled the Taliban, who had harbored Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaida leader and attacks mastermind.In the nearly 18 years of fighting since then, the number of US troops in Afghanistan soared to 100,000 and dropped dramatically after bin Laden was killed in neighboring Pakistan in 2011.Now about 14,000 US troops remain and Trump has called it "ridiculous" that they are still in Afghanistan after so long and so many billions of dollars spent.It is not clear whether the US-Taliban talks will resume.AP

                WASHINGTON - The White House says Hamza bin Laden, the son of the late al-Qaida leader who had become an increasingly prominent figure in the terrorist organization, has been killed in a US counterterrorism operation in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.A White House statement gives no further details, such as when Hamza bin Laden was killed or how the United States confirmed his death.The statement says Hamza bin Laden's death "not only deprives al-Qaida of important leadership skills and the symbolic connection to his father, but undermines important operational activities of the group."As leader of al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden and others plotted the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. US Navy SEALs killed him in a raid on a house in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in 2011.

                Donald Trump confirms death of al-Qaida heir Hamza bin Laden
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump on Saturday confirmed that Hamza bin Laden, the son and designated heir of al-Qaida founder Osama bin Laden, was killed in a counterterrorism operation in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. Citing intelligence officials, US media reported more than a month ago that the younger bin Laden had been killed sometime in the past two years in an operation that involved the United States. US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said last month that it was "his understanding" that Hamza bin Laden, who was thought to be about 30, was dead. But Trump had not publicly confirmed the news until Saturday - three days after the 18th anniversary of al-Qaida's 9/11 terror attacks in the US and a week after Trump's surprise announcement that a planned secret meeting with Taliban leaders at the Camp David presidential retreat had fallen through. "Hamza bin Laden, the high-ranking al-Qaida member and son of Osama bin Laden, was killed in a US counterterrorism operation in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region," Trump said in a brief statement issued by the White House. "The loss of Hamza bin Laden not only deprives al-Qaida of important leadership skills and the symbolic connection to his father, but undermines important operational activities of the group." The statement did not specify the timing of the operation, how the long-rumored death had been confirmed, or even specifically in which country it occurred. Hamza, the 15th of Osama bin Laden's 20 children and a son of his third wife, was "emerging as a leader in the al-Qaida franchise", the US State Department said in announcing a $1 million bounty on his head in February 2019. It said Hamza was married to a daughter of Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, a senior al-Qaida leader indicted by a US federal grand jury in 1998 for his role in the bombings that year of US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. Hamza had issued calls for attacks on the US and other countries, especially to avenge his father's killing by US forces in Pakistan in May 2011, the department said. That work helped him attract a new generation of followers to the extremist group that carried out the 9/11 attacks. Colin Clarke, an analyst with the Rand Corporation and the Soufan Center think tanks, said he was still skeptical the younger bin Laden had a major role "operationally". "But obviously he's got the DNA - the bin Laden name," he said. The al-Qaida organization has yet to confirm the US announcement. Agence France - presse (China Daily Global 09/16/2019 page6)
