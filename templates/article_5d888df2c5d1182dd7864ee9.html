                Municipal officials from China and US look to connect grassroots at summitCitizen diplomacy is ever more important during the current trade war between China and the US, said the leadership at Sister City International (SCI) ahead of the upcoming US-China Mayors Summit to be held in mid-July in Houston.The summit will be part of the 2019 SCI annual conference where municipal representatives from around the world will gather to foster understanding and connection at the grassroots level.As China and the US established diplomatic relations 40 years ago, St. Louis and Nanjing became the first pair of sister cities for the two countries. That number has grown.Today "we currently have over 200 city partnerships and more than 40 state partnerships with China", said Roger-Mark De Souza, president and CEO of SCI. "The relationship with China has become one of our strongest partnerships. In building those relationships we have seen many concrete examples of cooperation."De Souza noted that the sister-city relationship between Columbus, Ohio, and Hefei resulted in more than $1 million in exchange programs in one year.The relationship has become so involved that a biennial US-China Mayors Summit was set up in 2013."This is our fourth US-China Sister City Mayors Summit," said Carol Lopez, chair of the summit and vice-chair of the SCI board. "This year has special meaning because we are celebrating 40 years of diplomatic relations. What an amazing 40 years it has been in terms of what has happened in China and what has happened with our economies working together."Tim Quigley, chair emeritus and president of the SCI Foundation, said that the summit mechanism shows that "both countries put great emphasis on subnational connections and in municipal and community connections."According to Quigley, over 200 Chinese delegations representing more than 20 Chinese cities have already registered for the summit; another nine cities are considering sending delegations. On the US side, 21 cities have confirmed they will participate. "That's a notable increase over the past conferences," he said.De Souza said that the primary goal of the summit is to not only celebrate the relationship, but also to point to the direction."We bring some of the questions to the summit: The Maritime Silk Road and what it means for us? How do we continue to energize and build the sister-city relationships between the US and China? What have we learned from the relationships? How do we leverage citizen diplomacy to really make a difference? We need to think how to strategically engage each other and move forward," De Souza said.Lopez said efforts have been made to commemorate 40 years of the relationship. Working with Quigley and the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC), they "came up with the idea of establishing a US-China endowment that could ensure in perpetuity we will continue to have these exchanges."The US-China Endowment for Citizen Exchanges is the brainchild of Quigley and one of the principal features of the upcoming summit."The purpose of this endowment is to enable us to have the resources to provide to local US-China sister-city relationships in order to promote more exchanges in youth, sports, academia or municipalities," said Quigley.Quigley stressed the importance of citizen diplomacy during the current climate."One of the most critical roles the citizen diplomacy has played for millenniums throughout the history of the world has been providing those connections between people, in particular when national governments are hitting some bumps in the road," he said.Fan Bo, a representative for China at the SCI Foundation, said the fact that the more active participation of Chinese cities in the summit indicates that Chinese people understand the importance of staying engaged with the US."People have expressed interest in exchanges in more than 20 fields, and we are working hard to meet that demand," Fan said.For De Souza, citizen diplomacy has a personal connection. His great-great-grandfather came from Guangdong. He grew up with a strong presence of Chinese traditional culture.

                    Koepka wins PGA Championship at Bethpage Black
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                FARMINGDALE, NY — Brooks Koepka took his place in PGA Championship history with a wire-to-wire victory, minus the style points.In a raging wind that turned Bethpage Black into a beast, Koepka lost all but one shot of his record seven-shot lead Sunday. He lost the brutal Long Island crowd, which began chanting "DJ!" for Dustin Johnson as Koepka was on his way to a fourth straight bogey.But he delivered the key shots over the closing stretch as Johnson faded with two straight bogeys, and Koepka closed with a 4-over 74 for a two-shot victory and joined Tiger Woods as the only back-to-back winners of the PGA Championship since it went to stroke play in 1958.Koepka said at the start of the week that majors are sometimes the easiest to win.This one should have been. It wasn't.His 74 was the highest final round by a PGA champion since Vijay Singh won in a playoff in 2004 at Whistling Straits."I'm just glad I don't have to play any more holes," Koepka said. "That was a stressful round of golf. I'm glad to have this thing back in my hands."Johnson now has runner-up finishes in all four of the majors, the wrong kind of career Grand Slam."I gave it a run," he said. "That's all you can ask for."Koepka returned to No. 1 in the world with a performance that defines his dominance in golf's biggest events.He becomes the first player to hold back-to-back titles in two majors at the same time, having won a second straight U.S. Open last summer 60 miles down the road at Shinnecock Hills. He was the first wire-to-wire winner in the PGA Championship since Hal Sutton at Riviera in 1983.WEB.COM TOUR Robby Shelton got up-and-down from a bunker to save par on the 18th hole Sunday for an even-par 71, giving him a one-shot victory in the Knoxville Open and his second Web.com Tour victory of the year.Shelton started the final round at Fox Den Country Club with a two-shot lead and fell behind early with consecutive bogeys as Zhang Xinjun made two early birdies. Shelton started the back nine with back-to-back birdies to regain control.Mark Anderson began the back nine with an eagle and finished with a birdie and a 68, making Shelton finish with par for the wind.Shelton finished at 15-under 269.He won two weeks ago in the Nashville Golf Open, and this victory enabled him to take over the lead from Zhang on the Web.com Tour points list. The top 25 earn PGA Tour cards at the end of the regular season.Zhang (70), Tim Wilkinson (70) and Mark Hubbard (71) tied for third.AP

                    Devils introduce Jack Hughes to New Jersey after big week
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                NEWARK, N.J.  — The Devils introduced No. 1 overall pick Jack Hughes to New Jersey on Tuesday — even though he is already sharing the spotlight.The Devils have given notice they might be re-emerging as a contender with an encouraging draft and the stunning acquisition of six-time All-Star defenseman P.K. Subban. It has all gone a long way in turning pessimism into optimism for a team that finished with the league's third-worst record and out of the playoffs for the sixth time in seven years."Adding a talent like Jack Hughes on Friday night and Saturday, P.K. Subban, obviously I think the Devils are back in business," general manager Ray Shero said.It started with winning the draft lottery in early April to the selection of Hughes, a center, with the top pick Friday to the trade for Subban, who immediately steps into the role as New Jersey's top defenseman.With 2017-18 MVP Taylor Hall expected to return to form after an injury-marred campaign, 2017 No. 1 pick Nico Hischier continuing his development and leading scorer Kyle Palmieri playing his best hockey, the Devils have a shot to do something in a league where the St. Louis Blues come out of nowhere to win the Stanley Cup.Devils majority owner Josh Harris can't wait to the season to start, adding Devils' fans are used to winning Stanley Cups — the last was in 2003 — and now is the time to start doing it again."Jack joining the franchise represents another turn in our goal to be elite," Harris said at a news conference for Hughes at the Prudential Center. "We said that we're here not to do anything other than consistently compete and ultimately win the Stanley Cup."With parents Jim and Ellen sitting in the front row, the 18-year-old Hughes was soft spoken, confident and composed speaking on a stage that included Harris and Shero.The Florida-born Hughes said he had no doubt he would be playing next season in the NHL for the Devils and he hopes to play a creative game.It is just what the talent-starved Devils need. The past week was a major step in Shero's rebuilding plan over the past four years. It started soon after he was hired with the trades for Hall and Palmieri, the draft of Hischier, another center, and now the selection of Hughes and the trade with Nashville for Subban and his $9 million cap hit for each of the next three seasons.Hughes hasn't stopped going since the draft. He returned to New Jersey with Shero, Harris and his parents on a private jet and spent the next few days making media appearances. He attended the New York Yankees game against Toronto on Monday night, sitting for 30 minutes with Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson and actor Adam Sandler.He is eager now to return to suburban Toronto, where he grew up, and begin preparations for an 82-game season against men, and being a part of a team."I want to be Jack Hughes, not Patrick Kane or Matt Barzal," Hughes said. "I want to have my own flavor, my own excitement to my game."The 170-pound playmaking center mixed poise, drive, and sheer skating ability to score 74 goals and 154 assists in 110 games with the USA Hockey National Team Development Program.It will be interesting to see what he does with the Devils. Hischier had 20 goals and 32 assists as a rookie.Hughes doesn't see himself as competing with Hischier for the job as the top-line center."I think to win you have to have 1A and 1B," said Hughes, who will wear No. 86 with the Devils. "No team wins with just one really good center. Travis Zajac has been a really good center for a long time and I think the Devils are in a really good spot. In the NHL, I feel whoever I play with will be a really good player."Coach John Hynes is looking forward to using all his new talent."It's exciting," Hynes said. "It's what you want. You want guys to come in and give you a chance to win and coach some excellent players."And who is to say the Devils are done? They still have $25 million available in cap space."I feel with the pieces we have at this moment, we are a much better team than we were on Thursday," goaltender Cory Schneider said. "That's encouraging."Agencies

                    Nashville-Taiyuan: driven by economics
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                After more than a decade since it became an official sister city with Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi province in northern China, Nashville, Tennessee, has developed deep cooperation and friendship with its Sino-sibling through a variety of cultural and economic exchanges."Our partnership started in 2007, and really began because there was an economic partnership between the state of Tennessee and Shanxi province in the 1980s," said Heather Cochran Cunningham, executive director of Sister Cities of Nashville, a volunteer organization that promotes exchanges between Nashville and all of its eight sister cities.Cunningham said the relationship of the two cities so far has developed from the initial iron and steel industry in the '80s to broader cultural and economic exchanges.She said that China is the fourth-largest trading partner of the Nashville metropolitan area, at $539 million, and the third-largest trading partner of the entire state of Tennessee."A number of large Nashville-based companies have long-standing business relationships in China, including Jack Daniels, Gibson, Tractor Supply and CAT Financial," Cunningham said.There are also many industry exchanges and delegation visits between the two cities, Cunningham said.A delegation from Nashville attended the 2018 Taiyuan Energy Low Carbon Development Forum last year. The forum was an important opportunity for the program as the Nashville mayor's office has been working towards transferring more of Nashville's energy consumption to renewable solutions."In January, the vice-mayor from Taiyuan led a delegation to Nashville, where they met with our vice-mayor," Cunningham said, adding that other organizations have also come from China to learn about Nashville.In terms of educational exchange, an email pen-pal program was established between 33 students at Martin Luther King High School and 36 students at Taiyuan Affiliated High School in 2010.In 2013, a reciprocal high school exchange was launched between Nashville students and students at Yuying High School in Taiyuan that continues today."We have been working with Yuying High School for about the last nine years," Cunningham said, "and through our student ambassador program in Nashville, we have students from a variety of public and private high schools applying to go on our exchanges."She said eight students from different schools in Nashville went to Taiyuan last summer."We always receive students from Yuying High School too," Cunningham said, adding that 10 students and two teachers from Taiyuan visited Nashville for a week during the winter holiday."They're home hosted, they learned about the Nashville government, culture and history," she said. "We took them to see the key sites and they lived with the family here, they went to school for a day and we just tried to immerse them in the culture of Nashville.""And conversely, they do the same thing," Cunningham said of American students going to China.She said students from Nashville were able to learn about kung fu, dragon festivals and other special holiday activities in China."They did paper-cutting and calligraphy, they made special foods to eat, and they went to Jinci Temple," she said. "So, they're doing the same thing — just learning all about Taiyuan."

                    In Tennessee, a call for more trade with China
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                History has proven that both China and the United States benefit from cooperation and lose in confrontation, Minister Xu Xueyuan from the Chinese embassy in Washington told elected officials and business leaders during a three-day visit to Nashville.Minister Xu, along with Zhao Zhenge, general representative of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) in the United States, led a small delegation to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), where hundreds of state legislators gathered to discuss policymaking.Many state legislators expressed their desire to see US and China overcome their differences and build a closer trade relationship.They briefed local business leaders at a luncheon hosted by the International Business Council, Nashville law firm Baker Donelson, the Tennessee-China Network and the Tennessee World Affair Council. The delegation presented China's perspective on the current trade issues."It is important for us to always remember that this relationship is mutually beneficial. China and the US have been each other's most important trading partners, and the two countries also act as an important source of investment to each other," Xu said.Xu said that China is Tennessee's third-largest goods and services export market. In 2016, exports from Tennessee to China supported more than 20,000 jobs in the state. Also, nearly 70 Chinese companies have established operations in Tennessee, providing nearly 4,000 jobs.According to US statistics, American exports to China supported more than 1 million jobs in the US, and trade with China helped every American household save hundreds of dollars."These figures could have been much bigger if it were not for the trade war," Xu said. "Increasing tariffs or decoupling our economies will not resolve our differences in trade policy. It will only hurt both sides."Phillips Richard, COO and senior vice-president of Global Food Exchange Corporation, a Chinese company based in Glendale, California, said the tariff prevented his company from exporting US agricultural products to China."Each month we ship about a thousand containers of food to China from all over the world," he said. "We would love to buy from the US. Unfortunately, the tariff made it unprofitable. We have to get our supply from countries like Brazil, Chile, Russia, Spain, Australia and others. I have talked to many US farmers who desire to see China and the US reach an agreement so they could enter the China market."The prolonged dispute has hurt businesses on both sides, said John Scannapieco, partner and chair of the global business team at Baker Donelson, which represents a large number of Chinese companies doing business in the US, and American companies doing business in China."I have seen companies having real financial problems because they can't pass on all the tariff costs to customers," Scannpieco said. "It put them in the red. We have seen increasing farm bankruptcies, some companies going out of business, and jobs being lost. I know some factories in China are also closed. Both countries are losing, to what end?"Trade is not about I win you lose; it has to be both win," he said.Through his exchanges with the American business community Zhao Zhenge of CCPIT has noticed a strong desire to forge close trade and economic relations with China. However, the trade issues have brought a lot of predicaments to the American businesspeople:"The tariff has created uncertainty, and people don't know what step to take next," Zhao said.In expressing a desire to continue to gain access to the Chinese market, Tennessee state Representative John Deberry said that the small-businesspersons often get lost in the big talks. For that reason, he'd love to pay a visit to China.Tennessee state Representative Mike Sparks said that the state cherishes the relationship with China.He expressed a wish that China could help solve the problem of overpopulation of Asian carp in his state."You will be our savior if you could help with that problem," he said.Minister Xu assured political and business leaders that China is sincere about its talks with the US. However, "they must be based on equality and mutual respect, and they must address reasonable concerns raised by the two sides", she said. "We hope the US will meet China halfway and work towards a final solution that is acceptable to both sides."

                    Nashville native looks to make Chinese pop a hit

                Stokes Neilson has a dream: make Chinese pop singers big in the United States.He wants to find that Chinese talent who one day becomes as popular as the K-pop band BTS from Seoul.Neilson was born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee, known as the "Home of Country Music" and "Music City", where the music industry has an economic impact of about $10 billion a year.A 2000 graduate of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Nielson dived into the music industry as a singer, producer, recording artist and song writer. He is a BMI-award winning songwriter and three-time Academy of Country Music Award nominee. He has produced original content for many of the leading artists in the entertainment industry, including Tim McGraw, Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez and more.As the founder of Channel Greatness, a media content provider and online video channel-building company, Nielson also consults for major brands and broadcast media companies.Five years ago, at the Grammy Awards ceremony, Nielson befriended a music group from Shanghai."They asked me if I would be willing to help them exposing Chinese artists in the US. They also suggested that I start to think about making songs available to the Chinese audience as well when I write a song. That started my real collaboration in China," said Nielson.In the past few years, Nielson has promoted Chinese pop singer Jane Zhang and Jackson Yee of TFBoys in the US through radio stations.He brought Zhang to the Grammys and set up interviews for her with top 40 US pop stations. "They talked about her music and played her songs," Nielsen said.Nielson did an interview with Jackson Yee in China, brought it back to the US and had it aired in major pop stations. He also became friends with actor and singer Kris Wu."What the Chinese artists really need in the US is being exposed to the US audience. In the US, the audience generally discovers singers through radio. We started introducing these Chinese artists to Americans," he said.He considers Zhang, Yee and Wu "fantastic" artists."Jane Zhang is one of the best pure singers on the planet. Her vocal range is amazing. Kris Wu is very creative. His new song Freedom proves that he is a wonderful lyricist. Jackson Yee is an amazing dancer. Each of them can compete with any on the planet," he said.However, Chinese artists still need marketing, promotion and exposure to make it in the US. "You have to learn the American market, it's different from China," Nielson said.After getting himself familiar with Chinese pop music, Nielson believes that he's in an exciting and once in a life time period of growth in China's music industry."China's film industry is very mature, the music industry is an emerging economy, and there are a lot of opportunities. A lot of music artists can benefit by having a collaborator in the US where the music industry is very mature," he said.He believes that in the next four or five years, a Chinese pop singer will connect with American audiences in a major way."I want to be part of that story when it happens. I want to find, discover and promote that artist here. When I go back to China in September, one of my purposes is to become more aware of the new artists," said Nielson, who on average travels to China four times a year.Nielson also wants to make American artists treat China as an equal market. He finds such opportunities abundant in China, particularly in Chengdu and Chongqing."We have been hearing news about the tariff issues between China and the US. We need to look at the broader story – these are two great nations that are trying to find out equitable way to work together," Nielson said."I want to do as much as possible with my counterparts in China to build a true bridge good for creativity and money. I believe music can build a bridge of understanding for the two cultures," Nielson said.Recently, Nielson took a group of Chinese listeners of a Shanghai radio station to a Nashville studio, where one of his client artists was recording."They learned the lyrics in the studio. We had them sing, and they are recorded in the production. They are part of the song, which is coming out this fall. That's the kind of cultural bridge I am talking about," Nielson said.
