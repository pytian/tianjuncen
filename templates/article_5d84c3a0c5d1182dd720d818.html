                1970s ping-pong did produce a diplomat

                The curtain went down. The spotlight was on. Jan Berris, whose hair was in two braids to match her Chinese counterpart, walked briskly onto the stage of the auditorium to announce the next program. The audience waited with bated breath, having just been delighted by a riotous lion's dance.It was December 1972 in Chicago. The Shenyang Acrobatic Troupe from northeastern China was touring the US. And the braids, most popular among Chinese young women at the time, were meant to be a nod to the guests.Barely eight months before, the Chinese Table Tennis Team had come to the states, touring and playing friendly matches with their US counterparts. The visit itself was reciprocal because in April the previous year, the US Table Tennis Team had been invited to visit China, the first American delegation since 1949.Dubbed "ping-pong diplomacy", these mutual gestures symbolized a thaw in what was once seen as a perennially frozen bilateral relationship.In a fateful twist of events, the games also set Berris, a promising young diplomat stationed in the US consulate in Hong Kong, on a different career path. Berris is today the vice-president of the New York-based National Committee on US-China Relations, a nonprofit organization founded by those who saw "the potentials not the limitations" in the two countries' futures."In June 1971, I was invited by a former professor of mine who was the chairman of the National Committee to join the organization and help prepare for the coming visit of the Chinese ping-pong team," said Berris, who was with the Chinese players during their entire stay in the US."That trip was so successful that the Chinese decided to send the acrobatics. Chicago was their first stop," said Berris, the project's coordinator, who also found time to be part of the troupe's performance as the stage announcer. "There I was, announcing the second act when all of a sudden I saw, out of the corner of my eye, that one of our security officers was running to the back of the auditorium. The bright stage lights were on so I couldn't see clearly, but I could tell that there was some sort of commotion. The minute I walked off stage, I said to our stage director: 'Don't pull up the curtain.'"It turned out that someone in the audience had thrown tear gas toward the stage ¡ª the auditorium, filled with the burning, acrid smell, had to be cleared and everyone had to get out."My National Committee colleagues and I went backstage to talk to the head of the Chinese delegation. We basically explained the situation and said: 'It's up to you as to whether you want to continue the show or not. If the answer is yes, we'll wait for an hour before bringing back the audience; if it's no, we'll just miss this one performance and will begin again tomorrow,'" recalled Berris. "After conferring briefly, they said: 'Yes, we want to do it.'""It was a freezing-cold night in Chicago, yet the majority of the audience chose to stay instead of going home and having their ticket money refunded," she continued. "When they were finally allowed back into the theater, there was only a faint whiff of the tear gas there. But it was a lot stronger up on the stage, where the acrobats were doing some very difficult tasks that required plenty of energy and therefore air into one's body. They got a lot of credit from the audience and the media which reported on it afterwards."The incident, not entirely unexpected given all the "misperceptions the two people had harbored towards each other", nonetheless allowed Berris to see the commonalities."There's a phrase in the American theater: 'The show must go on.' The Chinese decision was very much in that flavor," said Berris, who has a BA in Chinese studies from the University of Michigan and whose Chinese name, Bai Lijuan, translates into "white jasmine".However, this "jasmine" was no fragile flower, but a workaholic and multitasker who over the past half century has brought hundreds of Chinese delegations to the US, in addition to traveling to China more than 160 times, taking with her various groups from governors, mayors and a Supreme Court justice, to business leaders, scholars and tennis players."I was driven by a strong desire to bring people together," said Berris, who reputedly drove her staff crazy in those early days by insisting that they carry electric tea kettles so that the Chinese delegation members would always be able to have hot water in their rooms. She also went to great lengths to make sure that the hotel chef knew how to make xifan, or Chinese rice soup, the way the Chinese would like to have it, with no butter or salt.In February, 1979, one month after China and the US normalized their relationship, Deng Xiaoping, the then vice-premier, visited a number of US cities. Berris was tasked by the State Department to coordinate Chinese press activities throughout the trip.In Simonton, Texas, while watching a rodeo show, the Chinese leader symbolically donned a cowboy hat, wowing the world press that was present, including more than 30 journalists from China."It was a real surprise. … Deng had the intuition to sense what would play well for the American public, and had the confidence to do it, " said Berris, who was also responsible for organizing and running the 1980 delegation of provincial leaders to the United States, headed by Xi Zhongxun, the late father of Chinese President Xi Jinping, and then governor of Guangdong province."He was a very thoughtful man," said Berris, who calls herself "a stronger believer in engagement and exchanges", and who, at a farewell party at the end of Deng's visit, arranged for a Chinese journalist to sing the song Getting to Know You from the 1950s American musical film The King and I, joined on stage by the American security personnel involved in the landmark visit."Up till recently, there have always been people on both sides who felt that a strong, stable relationship between the two countries was paramount," she said. "Unfortunately, that coalition is fraying, and the relationship, at least on the governmental level, is spiraling downward at a dizzying rate. But I still believe in the importance of the relationship and that there are things that both sides could and should do."What we are trying to do here at the National Committee is to work against this narrative that has somehow grown up, that engagement has been counterproductive and has not been positive for the United States," she said. "Engagement is essential for all of us. It must be done in a reciprocal, mutually beneficial and constructive way. But this idea of decoupling, of minimizing the amount of contact between the two peoples, is a path toward disaster."Talking about the Chinese ping-pong players of the 1972 visit, Berris said: "They didn't conform to Americans' image of Communists, they didn't act like that. They were fun, playful, just as enthusiastic as any group of young people might be."When it was time to say goodbye, Berris found herself futilely fighting back tears, despite the presence of a big swarm of reporters."The next year, when I visited China, people would come up to me and say: 'Are you that crying girl?'"

                Don't underestimate far right's surge, analysts say
            </a>
            <p>
                The surge of Germany's far-right party Alternative for Germany, or AfD, in recent state elections signals that it will pose challenges for the mainstream political groups or even for the stability of the German coalition government, analysts said.The AfD achieved a stunning second place earlier this month in two eastern state elections, taking 23.5 percent of the votes in Brandenburg and 27.5 percent in Saxony. That was an increase from 12.2 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively, five years ago.Meanwhile, both German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, or CDU, and the Social Democratic Party, or SPD, lost ground in the elections, compared with the 2014 results. However, the SPD maintained its first place in Brandenburg with 27.5 percent of the votes while the CDU still led in Saxony with 32 percent.Cui Hongjian, director of the department for European studies at the China Institute of International Studies, said Germany's mainstream political groups have made a mistake underestimating the strength of the AfD since it was founded in 2013.The party was first formed by a small group of euroskeptics who were critical of Germany's bailout of Greece after the global financial crisis. In the beginning, they just raised questions about the government but didn't have a clear political agenda."Chancellor Merkel carefully found a way of supporting the eurozone while convincing German people to accept that, so the AfD almost fizzled out as the crisis was successfully defused," Cui said. "The main political groups didn't expect it to develop into a strong force."However, in 2015, the arrival of nearly a million asylum-seekers provided a great opportunity for the AfD. Anti-immigration then became its key policy and helped it grow rapidly.In the last federal elections in October 2017, the AfD gained seats in every state parliament and became the third-largest party as well as the main opposition party facing Merkel's grand coalition.He Yun, assistant professor at Hunan University's School of Public Management, said the AfD is part of the anti-establishment and anti-globalization movement that is sweeping many parts of the West right now."It took advantage of the refugee crisis and rose to power by stoking people's fear toward immigrants," she said. "Before the German federal government starting to allow refugees into Germany in 2015, all the far-right parties combined claimed less than 6 percent of voters in Germany, but after that their votes skyrocketed."She said the AfD is good at using social media to spread its message directly to the public, which has proved to be "a very effective strategy in a digital age".Cui said that even when the AfD entered the German parliament, however, many still believe its strength to be limited, as the mainstream parties have pledged not to collaborate with it."However, the election results in the eastern region remind people that the AfD has stable support in certain regions and from certain groups of people," he said.Moreover, as Germany's economy is losing momentum, the AfD will have more chances to challenge the mainstream political groups and even the coalition government over various issues in the future, he added.Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, warned on Aug 19 that the country could enter a recession in the third quarter of this year, due to the falling industrial production and orders affected by the international trade tensions.Though Germany has achieved great economic development in the past decade, there is still uneven development between the western and eastern parts of Germany. This is despite many measures the government has taken to stimulate the economic development in the eastern region, such as preferential policies and incentives for companies to invest there, Cui said."It is way too optimistic for the main political groups to think that the AfD will rest on the current achievements," he said.Cui said if the CDU and the SPD cannot find solutions to their problems, then the political fragmentation in Germany might increase."There will even be a situation in which there are various political parties that are unable to reach a mainstream consensus, like the situation in some other European countries. That will have a great impact on the traditional stable political system of the country," he said.He Yun of Hunan University expects that in the next federal election, both the AfD and the environmentalist Greens will take big chunks of votes away from the ruling CDU and SPD parties."It will be much harder for them to form a stable coalition afterward," she said, adding that drawn-out coalition talks and internal government rows will, in turn, be used by the AfD to show that the current system is not working and to further strengthen its position facing traditional parties.
