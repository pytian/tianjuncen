                Afghan war takes toll on schools and kids
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Increasing attacks underscore how children remain vulnerableKABUL, Afghanistan - Sixteen - year-old Madina still has nightmares about the day that two huge blasts tore through her school in Kabul, showering shards of broken window glass on her and other students.She survived, with lacerations to her arms and legs. The physical wounds are slowly healing, but she remains haunted by the stress of the attack.Madina, like many of her generation in Afghanistan, has never known peace and experts warn the psychological impact of living in a country where schools are often on the front line and counseling is in short supply, can be overwhelming."It was a scary day. I still have nightmares, I cannot focus. It was very hard to prepare for exams," Madina recalled.She had to take her math exam in the corridor at her shattered school as many classrooms have been left unusable.The United States and Taliban claim progress in ongoing peace talks, but little has changed for Afghans, and recent attacks underscore how children remain as vulnerable as ever in the grinding conflict.A United Nations tally found last year was the deadliest on record, with at least 3,804 civilian deaths caused by the war - including 927 children. And in the first six months of 2019, children accounted for nearly one-third of civilian casualties."In the first few days after the attack, you could see the trauma on students' faces. They would cry every minute," Madina's school director Niamatullah Hamdard said.According to UNICEF, the number of attacks against Afghan schools tripled last year compared to 2017. By the end of 2018, more than 1,000 Afghan schools had been shut due to conflict, denying about 500,000 Afghan kids access to education.In the arid Deh Bala district of Nangarhar Province in eastern Afghanistan, the Papen High School has been reduced to rubble amid fighting between government forces and the Islamic State group.Schoolchildren sit on a rug outside for a class, frowning as a reporter approaches. Some of them have witnessed Islamic State fighters beheading locals."When the students go to sleep at night, they dream about Daesh and they are haunted by these atrocities," school director Muhamad Wali said, using the local name for the IS. "They scream in their sleep, and when they come here, they are so stressed out."Stress takes a huge toll Omar Ghorzang, a school district official, said the stress takes a huge toll. "When the teachers are talking to them, the kids talk among themselves and do bizarre things. They cannot pay attention", Ghorzang said.Amir Gul, aged about 15, said he and his Papen classmates are constantly anxious."We are always afraid a bomb might go off. Everyone is scared and no one can study," he said.Psychotherapist Bethan McEvoy, who works as an education adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council in Kabul, said it can be tough to assess the prevalence of mental illness and emotional trauma resulting from school attacks.That's because symptoms of psychological trauma often manifest only after the shock has subsided - and in Afghanistan, people can spend years living through one stressful event after another."When we experience a high-stress event, there's a natural response in our body that turns into a survival response," she said. "When people are in a state of constant fear... then it's very difficult to turn that response off."How people are impacted in the long term depends on many factors including their background, family relations and support networks."If a school has something in place to provide that kind of support to the child then it can actually be very helpful," McEvoy said, noting that more can be done to provide services in Afghanistan.At the Kabul school, much of the debris had been cleared, but twisted metal poked through a collapsed roof and the crunch of broken glass could still be felt underfoot in areas away from where the children play.Days after the Kabul attack, a Taliban car bomb targeted a government intelligence center in the eastern city of Ghazni. The blast also hit a nearby school, wounding dozens of children.Barely a day goes by without reports of children or families being killed or wounded.It is not just insurgent groups responsible for the killing.A recent Pentagon report found US forces in Afghanistan caused 134 civilian casualties in 2018. Of the 76 among them who died, 31 were children.The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said war explosives account for 84 percent of all child casualties in Afghanistan.Agence France-Presse

                    US exit from INF a 'great blow' to global security
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Experts warn it would further dampen Washington-Moscow relationshipThe Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty, signed between Washington and Moscow in 1987, ended when the United States formally withdrew from the treaty on Friday. Experts warned the move is bound to weaken mutual trust between the major powers, encourage nuclear arms race, and raise the level of risk in the world's security landscape.Washington unilaterally started the withdrawal process in early February, citing Russia's violation of the deal. Moscow, which has repeatedly denied Washington's accusation, also suspended its participation in the INF Treaty, the first-ever pact reached by the two sides on nuclear disarmament and a major step forward in restricting arms race.The INF was negotiated by then-US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev. It banned land-based missiles with a range between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, reducing the ability of both countries to launch a nuclear strike on short notice. It played a major role in maintaining the strategic balance in Europe and keeping the peace between the NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries.Experts worry that the annulment of the nuclear control pacts will eventually lead to a more complex and dangerous relationship between Washington and Moscow in the future.William Perry, former US defense secretary, tweeted that "the US withdrawal from the INF Treaty today deals a great blow to nuclear arms control and global security, we are sleepwalking into a new arms race".Zhang Yifei, a researcher of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the withdrawal of the US from the treaty is expected to damage global security. It will further dampen US-Russian relations and could open the door to a dangerous new era of unconstrained military competition between the US and Russia, Zhang said."The current course will lead to a less stable and secure world. The United States and Russia will be less able to predict future developments on the other side and thus will have to make expensive worst-case assumptions," Steven Pifer, a nonresident scholar with the Brookings Institution think tank told Xinhua News Agency.Viktor Murakhovsky, a Russian defense analyst, said it makes no military sense for both US and Russia to start a new arms race by increasing their launchers and nuclear warheads, but the competition in the realm of military technology will continue between the two countries after the death of the treaty."The situation in this area is already very difficult and it will only get worse, something catastrophic will happen to the military-political trust between the US and Russia." Murakhovsky said.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also lamented that with the demise of the INF Treaty, the world lost an invaluable brake on nuclear war.In fact, the worries are not overreacting. Hours after the collapse of the historic arms control pact, the Pentagon announced that the US will fully develop ground-launched conventional missiles. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has warned that if Washington deploys missiles prohibited by the treaty near Russia's border, his country reserves the right to respond in kind."It is a pity that rather than renegotiate the treaty to suit the times, both sides chose, for their own purposes, to mutually abandon the treaty and its structure," said Larry Cata Backer, a professor of law and international affairs at Pennsylvania State University.Backer said the death of the treaty is a reminder for the European Union that the old assurances of the detente between the US and the Soviet Union have at last been swept away and, as a result, the EU might face higher security risks.In a recent report, Russian newspaper Izvestia said that collapse of INF Treaty hurts everyone, notably Europe.Izvestia said it is necessary to begin working on a new arms agreement and the EU should support any initiative that would lead to the signing of such a document. Despite the termination of the treaty, Russia said it is ready to return to the implementation of that key arms control accord, according to Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Russian Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian Federation parliament.Kosachev said Russia is not burying the INF Treaty, and it is ready to get back to it at any time, "if the US also does so".Zhang Jing in Washington contributed to this story.

                    Esper in first visit to Asia as Pentagon chief
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                Intermediate-range missile deployment, Indo-Pacific Strategy are his key agendaAlthough the Pentagon has highlighted intermediate-range missile deployment in Asia and the United States-led Indo-Pacific Strategy as key agenda items of its new chief's first Asia trip, media reports show that some die-hard military allies of the US responded to the proposals with a cold shoulder.Analysts said Washington is unlikely to score a major victory during the tour when shifting blame to China, as its Asia-Pacific allies and partners are showing prudence and avoiding taking sides between the two top economies in the world.US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper arrived in South Korea on Thursday as the last leg of his five-stop trip, according to Seoul-based Yonhap news agency.He has finished visiting Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Mongolia.Speaking to reporters in Sydney on Saturday, Esper said he "would prefer months" for placing ground-launched, intermediate-range missiles in Asia, one day after the US withdrew from the landmark Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, Reuters reported.He also lashed out on China's role in the Indo-Pacific region on Sunday, saying the US "also stands firmly against a disturbing pattern of aggressive behavior, destabilizing behavior from China".However, South Korean Defense Ministry spokeswoman Choi Hyunsoo said in a news conference on Monday in Seoul that the US and South Korea have never officially discussed on deploying such missiles in Asia, and South Korean military has neither considered this regard, Yonhap news agency reported.Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya said that Esper told him that the US has yet to enter the stage of discussing where to deploy the missiles, Japan's Kyodo News Agency reported.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday that Washington "has tried to drive a wedge" among Asia-Pacific countries by promoting the Indo-Pacific Strategy.The US has been using China as an excuse on the INF Treaty and other issues, and it is "hastily seeking to deploy intermediate-range missiles in Asia" after its withdrawal from the INF Treaty, Hua said.Fan Jishe, director for Strategic Studies of the Institute of American Studies of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said it is unlikely to see Esper help US make major difference in the region through this trip, and Esper is more expert in fulfilling President Donald Trump's ideas in boosting competition among major countries.It is unlikely to see US allies in this region - including Australia - to accept US plans for ground-launched missile in the near future, which China firmly opposes. The situation in the region is tense enough for such deployment, Fan said.Liang Fang, a professor of naval studies at the PLA National Defense University, warns that the majority of potential sites for US missile deployment may fall in China's neighborhood, and China will be a major victim of US withdrawal from the treaty.The US is sabotaging strategic stability in Asia and in the greater world, Liang said.

                WASHINGTON - The United States tested a new ground-based cruise missile which can hit a target after more than 500 kilometers of flight, weeks after withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty banning such systems, the Pentagon said Monday in a statement.The test took place at 2:30 pm Pacific Time on Sunday at San Nicolas Island, California, said the statement.The missile "exited its ground mobile launcher and accurately impacted its target after more than 500 kilometers of flight," the statement said."Data collected and lessons learned from this test will inform the Department of Defense's development of future intermediate-range capabilities," it said.The United States will fully develop ground-launched conventional missiles after withdrawing from the INF Treaty earlier this month, US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has said.The collapse of the INF Treaty, which was signed by the Soviet Union and the United States in 1987, has triggered the fear that a new round of arms race is looming, many analysts say.

                    US missile deployment plan a dangerous miscalculation: China Daily editorial
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The Pentagon announced on Monday it had successfully tested an intermediate-range missile, the first such test since the United States formally withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed with the Cold War-era Soviet Union.In a Fox News Channel interview on Wednesday, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said it was intended "to deter Chinese bad behavior".This, along with his earlier revelation of the US intention to deploy ground-launched, intermediate-range missiles in Asia and State Department Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security Affairs Andrea Thompson's disclosure of consultations with allies and partners regarding such deployment, cannot but raise serious security concerns on the part of Beijing.China's and Russia's request for the United Nations Security Council to meet over the proposed US missile deployment under the agenda item "threats to international peace and security" is legitimate and justified.However, the present UN architecture is simply not designed for a dispute of such proportions. Yet if Moscow and Washington were able to sit down and come up with the INF Treaty at the peak of Cold War confrontation, there is no reason they cannot do it today. They are a much lesser threat to each other nowadays.China, an outsider to the INF regime, has refused to be dragged in and become a third party in Russia-US intermediate-range missile negotiations, as the premise and basis for trilateral arms control negotiations do not exist.Trilateral talks would be to no purpose since not only has the current US administration shown it is willing to tear up any agreement whenever it feels like it, but even if it did take part in them, it would be doing so in bad faith, since its true intention in withdrawing from the INF Treaty is to make the treaty no longer binding on itself.It wants to go all out developing cutting-edge intermediate range missiles so it can apply pressure on what it views as the unholy trinity of China, Russia, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and trigger a new arms race.State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday reiterated Beijing's resolute opposition to Washington's plans to deploy such missiles in Asia during his meeting with his counterparts from the Republic of Korea and Japan.Since Japan and the ROK, as the two major US allies in Asia, will be expected by Washington to play host to new US intermediate-range ballistic missiles, they should give careful consideration to the increasingly obvious fact that it is the outdated Cold-War and zero-sum mindset of the US that is the biggest threat to regional peace and stability.

                    New Pentagon command launched for space warfare
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - The US government announced on Thursday the establishment of the US Space Command to defend its interests in space. "This is a landmark day, one that recognizes the centrality of space to America's security and defense," US President Donald Trump said in a White House ceremony joined by John Raymond, the first commander of US Space Command. "We are at a strategic inflection point where there is nothing that we do as a joint coalition force that isn't enabled by space," Raymond told reporters at the Pentagon. "I'm convinced that space is a war-fighting domain. I'm convinced that our way of life and our way of war depend on space capabilities," he said. Trump ordered the establishment of the Space Command late last year, making it the 11th unified combatant command of the US Department of Defense. The newly established Space Command is built to "protect America's dominance in space" by "employing assigned forces from every branch of the military" and "delivering combat power by operating superior space capabilities such as communications, intelligence, navigation, and early missile detection and warning", according to a White House statement released on Thursday. A US Space Command existed from 1985 to 2002, but was disbanded in the aftermath of the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks as the country focused on domestic defense. The new command is believed to be a step toward building an independent Space Force, a plan that still requires Congress approval. The US Space Command will soon be followed by the establishment of the United States Space Force as the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, according to Trump. "As a unified combatant command, the United States Space Command is the next crucial step toward the creation of an independent Space Force as an additional armed service," US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said on Wednesday at a news conference. One-year transition The US Defense Department officials had discussed Space Force legislation with Congress, sources told SpaceNews. The Senate proposed a one-year transition before standing up a new military service but the House required no such transition, according to the sources. The phased-in approach proposed by the Senate came amid concerns over excessive costs and the growth of the military bureaucracy. "There is no reason to believe that adding an entirely new Space Force bureaucracy and pouring buckets more money into it is going to reduce our overall vulnerability in space," said Senator Elizabeth Warren at a Senate hearing in April. "In order to achieve the intent of standing up the new force and executing the bill, additional technical and conforming amendments are necessary," said a US Defense Department memo. Last year the Pentagon elevated its cyber warfare operations to Cyber-Com, recognizing that online attacks and defense constituted a unique theater of combat. But Trump has a much more ambitious vision for space warfare. In June 2018, he ordered the US Department of Defense to create a much larger Space Force, a dedicated branch of the military equal to the existing forces, the US Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines and Coast Guard.

                    Trump administration prepares to divert $3.6b from Pentagon projects for border wall
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - The Trump administration will divert $3.6 billion from the Pentagon for the construction of the US-Mexico border wall, according to local media reports quoting House aides and Democrats on Tuesday.Defense Secretary Mark Esper called congressional leaders including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer on Tuesday to inform them of the decision to reprogram the money away from military construction projects and to the border, said a report by TheHill news daily.About half of the funding will come from military construction projects outside the United States and half will come from Pentagon projects within the country, according to a report from the Politico website.In response, Schumer said: "The president is trying to usurp Congress's exclusive power of the purse and loot vital funds from our military. Robbing the Defense Department of much-needed funds is an affront to our service members and Congress will strongly oppose any funds for new wall construction."President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in February, ordering funding from other federal accounts to build a wall along the US-Mexico border. Besides military construction projects, a Treasury Department account and Defense Department efforts to interdict drugs were affected by the presidential order, said local media reports.
