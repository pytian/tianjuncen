                China's private sector vital cog in African country's economic diversificationAngola will present its first international public tender in Beijing on Sept 16 to grant diamond, iron and phosphate mining rights to Chinese investors for the country located in the western part of southern Africa.The Angolan embassy in Beijing said on Tuesday the process aims to bring mining concessions for diamonds in the Angolan provinces of Lunda-Norte and Lunda-Sul, iron mining in the province of Kwanza-Norte, and phosphates in the provinces of Cabinda and Zaire.The mining rights roadshow began on Tuesday in the Angolan capital of Luanda, with Dubai hosting the second presentation. They will be followed by Beijing and London later on.Angolan Minister of Mineral Resources and Petroleum, Diamantino de Azevedo, said in a statement that national and foreign companies, embassies, banks, chambers of commerce and industry, professional associations and other entities interested in the mining concessions are invited to attend the presentations."China has been an important strategic partner for Angola and we believe that the Chinese private sector can play a crucial role in Angola's economic diversification by seizing the business opportunities listed in the privatization program," said Domingos Orlando Jacinto, press counselor at the Angolan embassy in Beijing.The minister said the Angolan government has released a list of 195 public companies to be privatized and 32 of them are major national companies. The sale can be executed through public tender, an initial public offer (IPO) or an auction at the stock exchange.Of the total, 175 of the target companies will go private by public tender, 11 by stock exchange auction and nine by IPOs.The privatization program will foster economic diversification and the creation of jobs in Angola as the government intends to increase competition, efficiency of the firms and boost the country's economy. The privatization program will be executed over four years, the minister said.The Angolan embassy official said the most well-known companies involved in this process are state oil company Sonangol, diamond company Endiama and airline TAAG, commercial banks BCI, BAI and Banco Economico, and financial companies ENSA Seguros and Bodiva-Angola Debt and Securities Exchange.The telecommunication companies included in the program are Unitel, MS Telecom, Net One, Multitel, Angola Telecom, TV Cabo Angola, Angola Cables, Angolan postal company ENCTA and telephone directory company ELTA, he said.The program also includes agroindustrial farms Aldeia Nova and Biocom, textile companies Textang II, Satec and Africa Textil, cement plants Nova Cimangola and Secil do Lobito, breweries such as Cuca, Eka and Ngola, and the engineering and construction company Mota-Engil Angola, he added.

                After eight months of not knowing where or when he would next suit up, former NBA player Zhou Qi has opted to rejuvenate his pro career by returning to his former CBA club, the Xinjiang Flying Tigers.On Tuesday, a day after helping Team China win three straight FIBA World Cup tune-up games in Kunshan, Jiangsu province, Zhou agreed to a reported two-year contract with Xinjiang, starting this season.His decision to rejoin the Flying Tigers ended speculation about Zhou's future that began after he was waived by the Houston Rockets in December."We hope Zhou returning to the CBA and playing for a strong franchise like Xinjiang will help him continue honing his game and leadership," said a statement released by Zhou's agency, New Level Sports Group, on Tuesday."Zhou will give all he has to help Xinjiang fight for another CBA championship and he will keep improving his game for future opportunities to compete at a higher level."Xinjiang will pay Zhou a reported annual salary of 20 million yuan ($2.8 million), with full support of his pursuit of another crack at sticking in the NBA.The 2017-18 CBA champion Liaoning Flying Leopards and three-time league winner Beijing Ducks also showed interest in landing his services.Flying Tigers president Hou Wei said in an earlier interview that a player of Zhou's caliber deserved an offer worthy of his value on the court."The club appreciates Zhou's high standards in terms of his own career development and acknowledges the progress he made during his stay in the NBA," the team said in a statement.As an effective rim protector and rebounder on Team China's World Cup roster, Zhou averaged 13.3 points and 10 rebounds in wins over Angola, Croatia and Puerto Rico in Kunshan.A product of Xinjiang's youth program and the 43rd overall pick by Houston in the 2016 NBA Draft, Zhou helped the Flying Tigers to their first league title in 2017 before joining the Rockets ahead of the 2017-18 NBA season.The 7-foot-1 center showed initial promise off the bench in his rookie season in Houston but was unable to become a reliable mid-range shooter or rim-runner in the Rockets' fast-paced offense.A series of injuries, including a sprained knee and twisted elbow, limited his playing time and the Rockets eventually released him to their G-League affiliate, the Rio Grande Valley Vipers.In 19 games over two seasons with the Rockets, Zhou averaged 1.3 points, 1.2 rebounds and 0.7 blocks-far below his production in the CBA and international competitions.Still, Rockets' All-Star guard James Harden is optimistic Zhou will be back in the NBA."He's always been a rebounder and a shot blocker, and he's getting stronger and shooting the three ball well," Harden said in a CCTV interview during his visit to China in June."I'm proud of him. He listens to people's suggestions. When you get a young guy who listens and wants to get better, it makes you want to help him more. I won't be surprised to see him return the NBA."Zhou made his international debut by helping China win the 2015 Asian Championships to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympics.After representing China in Rio, he helped the national team win gold at the 2018 Asian Games.

                    Legal centers help overseas business operations

                Jiangsu province has established seven legal service centers in other countries to meet the rising demand from its overseas enterprises and to offer platforms for enterprises to participate in international economic cooperation.The seven centers are in Cambodia, United Arab Emirates, Russia, Brazil, Angola, Ethiopia and Indonesia, Wang Xiaoqing, vice-president of Jiangsu Lawyers Association, said at a news conference on Tuesday in Beijing."The layout of overseas legal service centers covering the main areas involved in the Belt and Road Initiative has been preliminarily formed," he said."Jiangsu is one of the major provinces with an open economy in China and is also an important juncture of the Belt and Road. More than 600 Jiangsu enterprises have, in recent years, gone overseas and invested in more than 7,000 overseas projects, so the demand for foreign legal services is quite strong."As of the end of June, Jiangsu had 27,459 licensed lawyers, and 635 of them could provide legal services for international legal affairs.Wang said the centers can provide legal support for Chinese enterprises and citizens overseas involved in major legal disputes. They also alert Chinese enterprises to possible religious conflicts as well as legal, policy and labor risks due to different legal systems.To further increase the reserve of talent familiar with international laws, the centers have also undertaken the function of organizing training for domestic lawyers and offering them the platform to participate in practicing abroad.Additionally, the centers promote cultural exchanges and strengthen communication with local governments, business associations, bar associations and law firms to establish good cooperative relationships.Since 2017, the All China Lawyers Association has trained a group of high-quality lawyers with global vision who are also familiar with international rules.They would mainly engage in international investment, acquisitions, anti-dumping, antitrust, intellectual property protection, environmental protection and international commercial arbitration.Training will continue until 2022.The Ministry of Justice decided in March to establish a national talent bank for foreign legal expertise and released a list of 1,000 lawyers dedicated to international legal services for the reference of overseas companies and institutions.
