                US looks set to remain China's main soybean supplier in short term
            </p>
            <p>
                Russia is unlikely to replace the United States as China's main soybean supplier in the immediate future, according to industry insiders.Their prediction comes despite the fact that China and Russia have made great progress on cooperating in the soybean sector.Chinese imports of Russian soybeans have risen amid the trade dispute with the US, while Beijing and Moscow have pledged to increase their cooperation in the sector.The South China Morning Post reported recently that Russia would make 1 million hectares of arable land available to foreign investors. Most of the money is expected to come from China.Chen Yangfen, a researcher with the Institute of Agricultural Economics and Development at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said that to ensure grain security, China must diversify its soybean import channels. Cooperation between China and Russia in the sector offers great potential, he added."But we can see that Russia will not be able to replace the market share held by the US for a considerable period of time or fully meet Chinese demand for soybeans," Chen said.China needs to import 80 million to 90 million metric tons of soybeans a year, but Russia cannot meet this demand, he said."Last year, China's soybean imports from the US fell by 49.4 percent year-on-year, to 16.64 million tons," he said. "But Russia's total soybean output last year was only 4.02 million tons. There is still a huge gap between demand in the Chinese market and Russian soybean supplies."Moreover, Russia mainly grows non-genetically modified soybeans, while the demand in China is mainly for soybean meal and soybean soil. As a result, there is an imbalance between supply and demand.Yue Hongwen is deputy general manager of Suifenhe Liangyun Agricultural Products Development Co in Heilongjiang province, which in recent years has grown soybeans in the Russian Far East. He said that although Moscow encourages agriculture sector development in this region and welcomes farmers from overseas to grow produce there, it will take a long time for the scale of such business to increase.He Zhenwei, secretary-general of the China Overseas Development Association, said the trade tensions between China and the US have resulted in a "soybean gap" of millions of tons. Russia could be a good choice to fill the gap, due to its geographical proximity to China and because it produces high-quality, non-GMO soybeans.But as Russian soybean output is still far from sufficient to meet Chinese demand, He suggested that to increase output, Moscow should improve agricultural and port infrastructure in the Russian Far East, where most of the country's soybeans are grown.

                Rising patent filings show a sign of faith
            </a>
            <p>
                Stronger legislation combined with tough response to breaches offers assurance to overseas businesses BEIJING - China has been fostering strict protection of intellectual property by law, leading to a growing number of foreign patent applications, said an official from the National Intellectual Property Administration. From January to July, foreign applicants filed 92,000 invention patent applications in China, a year-on-year growth of 8.3 percent. Also, 149,000 trademark registration applications were filed, up 13.1 percent compared with the same period last year, said Gan Shaoning, deputy head of NIPA. In conversing with a group of foreign journalists, Gan attributed the rises to the application of measures designed to strengthen IP protection in the country. These measures included amending laws and regulations, accelerating the construction of a national IP credit system and carrying out joint punishment on dishonest behaviors. Last week, the foreign journalists visited NIPA's Patent Examination Cooperation (Beijing)Center. After a tour of exhibitions, they learned about the history and development of China's modern patent system. They also watched a demo on the process of a patent application of a robotic arm for surgery. The event was organized by the Information Office of the State Council to show the country's business-and innovation-friendly climate to foreign journalists. "China attaches great importance to IP protection, not only for creating a friendly environment for opening-up, but more importantly, for its own development," said Gan in response to a question by a Russian journalist. "The Chinese government has put forward the idea of innovation-driven development," he said."Without strict IP protection, there will be no innovation and no economic and social development." China's advances in IP protection have been widely recognized. The country's global ranking of the business environment rose to 46th place in 2018 from 78th in 2017, according to the Doing Business 2019 report released by the World Bank. The 2019 Member Survey by the US-China Business Council shows that 58 percent of US enterprises share the view that China has enhanced its IP protection in 2018. This marks a record high since the survey started in 2011. Data from the Ministry of Commerce show that more than 20,130 new foreign-funded companies were registered in China in the first half of this year. They collectively involved 478.33 billion yuan ($67.49 billion) in combined paidin foreign capital. Of the amount, which increased by 7.2 percent year-on-year, 28.8 percent went to the high-tech industry. Pilot free trade zones and regions in western China have become popular investment destinations. Foreign capital flowing into the zones and western regions jumped 20.1 and 21.2 percent year-on-year during the six-month period, respectively.

                Sino-Russian partnership gets verve to improve world order
            </a>
            <p>
                To the China-Russia partnership, the 24th regular meeting between their heads of government, which concluded in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Wednesday, gave a shot in the arm. There is no better way for the two sides to secure international support as both have come under increasing external pressure to change their diplomatic maneuvering on the global stage. The joint communique Beijing and Moscow issued proves the claim that the Sino-Russian partnership, now officially described as comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era, has reached a historical high. Not least because the document literally instills the idea of comprehensive strategic partnership into all aspects of bilateral relations, showcasing the two sides' shared commitment to formulating a new kind of Sino-Russian partnership in global governance. Emphatically, it reiterates the importance of securing mutual support. With both under pressure of externally imposed economic hardships, Beijing and Moscow are laying unprecedented emphasis on tapping the full potential of bilateral collaboration. And given their highly complementary economic structures as well as economic conditions, they do have room for such endeavors. The document they issued on Wednesday vows to raise bilateral trade, which surpassed $100 billion in 2018, to $200 billion by 2024 through trade facilitation. Besides promises of dovetailing their respective key development strategies, the Beijing-proposed Belt and Road Initiative and Moscow's Eurasian Economic Union, they have pledged to make joint efforts to address current issues, from collaboration on soy production to avoiding risks of sanctions from the West. While making their partnership true to its comprehensive nature, China and Russia have made it clear in the joint communique that their cooperation is not limited to bilateral affairs. Despite being a little less specific when it comes to such issues, the document does indicate the clear orientation of the two countries to work more closely together in the international arena. As responsible major countries, it says, China and Russia share the obligation for improving global governance and safeguarding international justice. That Beijing and Moscow have vowed to deepen cooperation on such multilateral international platforms as the United Nations, World Trade Organization, Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS reflects the seriousness with which they intend to work to build a world order that is fairer and more representative of nations. Since the current pattern of Sino-Russian interaction is the outcome of de facto Western isolation, it should come as no surprise if the two are found acting more in unison against rising protectionism and unilateralism that have cast a shadow over the world.

                SINO-RUSSIAN AGRICULTURAL LINKS TAKE ROOT
            </a>
            <p>
                Chinese soybean farmers flourish in new pastures Alexander Mikhailovich Somov is head of a small village called Dmitlovo in the Russian Far East. The 75-year-old recalled that in 1992, when he moved to the village, there were only about 100 residents and 300 buildings, including a school, several small shops, a pig farm and some abandoned properties. Due to poor transportation links and a lack of job opportunities, young people kept moving away from Dmitlovo, which is 70 kilometers south of Birobidzhan, the capital of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast. "At one time, there were fewer than 10 families in the village," Somov said. The village's future appeared bleak until 2014, when two Chinese farm owners, Ying Junfeng and Ying Xiufeng, from Suifenhe, Heilongjiang province, arrived. The brothers rented 3,000 hectares of wasteland - most of it marshland - and began to grow soybeans. Ying Junfeng said that when they first arrived, the locals did not believe they would stay for long. It was only after the new arrivals spent four years constructing a 6-kilometer road with farm excavators and bulldozers to connect the village with other districts that they finally gained the locals' trust and appreciation. Now, at least one member of almost every family in the village works on the soybean farm. The average wage is 1,000 roubles ($15.50) per day - higher than that in Birobidzhan, according to Somov. "We greatly appreciate our Chinese friends coming here, because if they had not, the village would have disappeared," he said. China and Russia have strengthened agricultural cooperation in recent years, particularly in the soybean industry, amid trade tensions between Beijing and Washington. Last year, China imported 817,000 metric tons of soybeans from Russia, up by nearly 65 percent on 2017. Most of the imports came from the Russian Far East, according to the Ministry of Commerce. In June, the two countries signed a development plan to deepen soybean cooperation, and in late July, China approved imports of the crop from across Russia. Exports to rise Valery Dubrovskiy, director of investment for the Far East Investment and Export Agency, a nonprofit organization, said Russia will open 1 million hectares of arable land to foreign investors, and it expects most of the funds to come from China. The South China Morning Post reported last month that the land is suitable for dairy farming or for cultivating crops, including soybeans. Maxim Oreshkin, Russia's Minister of Economic Development, said his country and China have listed several key sectors that need to be developed and improved. "The two countries should not only implement large projects, but also provide diversified end-use goods and investment, whose volumes will grow very quickly," he said. In particular, he said that Russia plans to increase soybean exports to China, the world's largest importer of the crop. There is high demand in China for soybeans, as they are the source of tofu, soy milk, soybean oil and even animal feed, but 90 percent of the country's requirements are met through imports, mainly from countries such as the United States, Brazil and Argentina. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, soybean demand in China is about 110 million tons per year, while the nation's output is about 16 million tons. However, since last year, the US has imposed several rounds of additional tariffs on Chinese imports. In retaliation, China has levied tariffs on a range of US imports, including soybeans. Before the trade dispute erupted, the Chinese market accounted for about 60 percent of US soybean exports, but last year the proportion fell to 17.9 percent due to US trade protectionist policies. Sergey Lukanin, researcher at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations at the Russian Academy of Sciences, said that when trade tensions between China and the US began, he thought that Russia could theoretically fill the gap in soybean supplies resulting from the dispute, and as a result, agricultural cooperation between Russia and China could flourish. Chen Yangfen, a researcher with the Institute of Agricultural Economics and Development at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said China needs to diversify its soybean import sources to ensure a stable supply of agricultural produce amid the trade tensions with the US. At the same time, Russia also needs to seek new growth drivers while facing economic sanctions from the West. "China and Russia have strong complementarities in agricultural markets, capital, land and technology resources," he said. "Both countries have good relations, so deepening agricultural cooperation, especially in the soybean industry, is a natural move." Some Chinese companies have already started to grow agricultural produce, including soybeans, in Russia to sell to the Chinese market. Chen said the Russian Far East, which has a large area of reclaimable land that can be cultivated and is ready to attract investment, has been the main target for Chinese companies. An estimated 95 percent of the soybeans in the Russian Far East border region with Heilongjiang province are grown by Chinese, he added. "In Russia, about 250 million hectares of land are suitable for growing soybeans, but to date, only about 3 percent has been used," Chen said. The good relations between China and Russia, which mean low political risks, are an advantage in growing soybeans in Russia, he said. Moreover, the nations' geographical proximity means that the cost of sending the produce to China is much lower than that for shipping it from the US or Brazil. Strict regulations Ying Junfeng, the soybean grower in Dmitlovo, said the soil in the area is fertile and suitable for cultivation and growth. In addition, Russia has strict regulations on food processing safety, environmental protection and the use of pesticides and fertilizers. "Russia prohibits the cultivation of genetically modified crops," he said. "Therefore, non-GMO Russian soybeans could be a selling point in the Chinese market." Wang Shilin, manager of Suifenhe Baoguo Economic and Trade Co in Suifenhe city, Heilongjiang, said the company has invested 160 million yuan ($22.6 million) in its two farms in Primorsky Krai in Russia's Far East that cover a total of 16,000 hectares of arable land, along with a 0.7-hectare pig farm with 6,000 animals. This year, its farms are expected to produce 15,000 tons of soybeans and 50,000 tons of corn. Shilin said that under Russian law, grain cultivation must follow European Union standards and strict restrictions should be imposed on pesticides, fertilizers and seeds. "Moreover, Russia has encouraged grain exports with zero tax," he said. Yue Hongwen, deputy general manager of Suifenhe Liangyun Agricultural Products Development Co, which was established in 2014, said it has a mature agricultural production chain in Russia, including planting, breeding, processing and logistics. The company decided to invest in the Russian agricultural sector in view of the increasing demand for soybeans in China. In Russia, land rentals are lower, the soil is fertile and planting costs are relatively affordable, he said. By the end of last year, the company had a 30-hectare farm in Russia with more than 100 sets of large agricultural machinery, and was planting on 10,000 hectares of arable land, mainly in Primorsky Krai. It has an annual output of about 20,000 tons of maize, 12,500 tons of soybeans and more than 8,000 tons of oat grass. "In the next five years, we intend to cultivate an additional 50,000 to 60,000 hectares of high-quality organic land in Russia," Yue said."We will focus on growing organic and non-GMO agricultural produce for the Chinese market." He said the investment return from growing soybeans in Russia initially ranged from 30 percent to 40 percent. However, as costs have increased, the return has fallen as more companies from South Korea, Japan and China have arrived in Russia in the past two to three years to grow soybeans. "Taking tax and logistics costs into account, Russian soybeans, although they are non-GMO, are not competitively priced in China, as those grown domestically receive government subsidies," Yue said. Chen said China and Russia have great potential for agricultural cooperation. But in the Russian Far East, infrastructure is backward, including soybean processing. Compared with other main soybean producers such as the US and Brazil, temperatures in the Russian Far East are much lower, and as the crop is non-GMO, this restricts the yield. In 2017, the soybean yield per hectare in the US was 3.29 metric tons. In Russia, it was 1.40 tons and in Brazil it was 3.38 tons, he said.

                China serves as development model, says Russian youth leader
            </a>
            <p>
                China's achievements in economic development logged over the past decades are impressive and can serve as a model for other nations, a Russian official said."It's a miracle that hundreds of millions of Chinese people have been delivered from poverty and have been able to advance toward a prosperous way of living in such a short period of time," said Vladimir Isakov, the first secretary of the Central Committee of Lenin's Communist Youth League of the Russian Federation.On a recent visit to Beijing, Isakov said the Chinese authorities and the people had been wise to approach such a large development task with the mindset of achieving smaller, incremental goals. In this way, they had a clear vision to work toward and other countries could tap China's experience in pursuing their own economic development."This is the third time that I have visited country since 2016. In just a few years, China has achieved significant progress, let alone over the past several decades," he said.He highlighted the role played by the Communist Party of China in the country's rapid and high-quality development, which underscores the importance of strong leadership in guiding the people.The CPC has always made the interests of the people and the development of the country its priorities, and this commitment has also been the source of its strength, Isakov said.The young leader further praised China's development philosophies, saying that the Belt and Road Initiative and efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind offer the world a platform for equal development."China's philosophies in terms of development are quite impressive and have relevance not only for the Chinese people, but for the welfare of the global community," Isakov said."The Belt and Road Initiative provides opportunities for all participating countries to engage in dialogue, irrespective of their size. Under the framework, countries can communicate and cooperate with each other in any number of fields and ultimately achieve mutual benefits."He said China's achievements had shown that a country can rely on its own strengths, rather than resort to plunder or even the invasion of other states.Isakov also singled out China's sustained efforts to maintain world peace as the country has long called for the resolution of disputes and conflicts through negotiations."The extent of the conflicts in the world would be much greater were it not for China's hard work," he said.This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the establishment of diplomatic ties between Beijing and Moscow.Isakov said the Soviet Union was the first country to recognize the People's Republic of China, and that Russia had continued to maintain good relations with China after the collapse of the Soviet Union."Reflecting this, learning Chinese has become a hot trend among young Russians. And more and more tourists are visiting China as well," he said. "I'm really happy to see the increasing exchanges and communications between the two countries, and hope they will grow even stronger in the future."
