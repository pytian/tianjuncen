                A general view of the mudslide at the mountain town of Regent, Sierra Leone, Aug 16, 2017. [Photo/Agencies]FREETOWN - Chinese companies and medical team members operating in Sierra Leone on Wednesday donated $200,000 in cash as well as other materials towards the efforts of the government in trying to support people affected by the flood and mudslide disaster.The disaster, which struck the outskirts of the West African nation's capital city Freetown on Monday buried hundreds of Sierra Leoneans in various communities, including Regent, Mount Sugar-Loaf, Kamayama, Kaningo and Dworzark, among others.The incident, apparently the worst of its kind in the country's history, also left thousands of people homeless across the city of Freetown.Speaking during the donation ceremony, charge d'affaires at the Chinese Embassy Wang Xinmin said the people of China are with Sierra Leone during this moment of grief because the two countries are like brothers and sisters."Our hearts and minds are with the government and people of Sierra Leone in this time of difficulty. We are always with you. This donation is a token of our friendship and we will continue to do more," he said.He disclosed that the Chinese government is currently putting modalities in place to send in their own support to help the Sierra Leonean government care for the victims of the disaster.Vice-President Victor Bockarie Foh welcomed the support from Chinese companies in the country and assured that the items and cash donated would be used for the intended purpose."I am glad that you care for us. The money and materials donated will be handed over to the Office of National Security. Over 400 dead bodies have been discovered and we are starting to bury them," he said."We will take measures that will address this calamity...We cannot stop natural disasters but we must be prepared to care for our people. So many areas are affected. We are in a state of shock and mourning," he said.He disclosed plans by the government to evacuate those in disaster-prone areas to safer areas and also build affordable homes for the people.

                    China vows to boost ties in infrastructure, production capacity in Sierra Leone

                Premier Li Keqiang meets with the visiting Sierra Leonean President Ernest Bai Koroma on Friday in Beijing. [Photo/Xinhua]Premier Li Keqiang pledged on Friday to promote cooperation in infrastructure and production capacity with Sierra Leone while meeting with the West African country's President Ernest Bai Koroma. Premier Li also said China is willing to boost cooperation in minerals, agriculture, fishery and product processing under market-oriented principles with the strategic partner. Li added that China is willing to deepen political trust and strengthen pragmatic cooperation with the African partner to bring more welfare to both peoples. When the Ebola epidemic began to hit West Africa, including Sierra Leone, in 2014, China immediately dispatched more than 1,200 medical staff and public health experts to help the region fight the disease, contributing to the efforts that helped overcome the epidemic, Li said at the 9th Global Conference on Health Promotion in Shanghai last month. In March, the World Health Organization announced the end of Ebola flare-ups in Sierra Leone. Li said China will continue to cooperate with Sierra Leone in public health by dispatching medical professionals and helping train Sierra Leonean doctors and nurses. Koroma, who was reelected the West African country's president in 2012, is now on his fourth official visit to China from Wednesday to next Tuesday since taking the first presidency nine years ago. He expressed his gratitude on Friday to China for the help in overcoming the epidemic and boosting its capacity of disease prevention and control. Koroma also said his country will learn from China and strengthen cooperation in traditional fields such as infrastructure and explore new fields such as telecommunication, public health and tourism.

                Huge shipment from China expected to help Sierra Leone boost food supplies and prosperity China is to donate 6,300 metric tons of rice seed to Sierra Leone. The move follows President Xi Jinping's promise to the people of Sierra Leone, made when he met the country's President Ernest Bai Koroma in December. The donation was announced by Ambassador Wu Peng on March 21 to the country's Minister of Agriculture, Monty Jones.  Wu Peng, China's ambassador to Sierra Leone, shakes hands with Sierra Leone's Minister of Agriculture Monty Jones during the handing-over of seeds and chemicals. Provided to China DailyThe amount is equivalent to 126,000 50-kilogram bags. The ambassador made this announcement during the official handing over of seeds and chemicals by the Chinese embassy to the Ministry of Agriculture, for the use of farmers within the Western Area. Wu said: "I am very glad to hand over materials from the China-aid Agricultural Technical Cooperation Project. China has been carrying on agricultural and technical cooperation with Sierra Leone for more than 40 years. Since the 1970s, China has sent agricultural experts and set up cooperation sites in districts including Kambia, Bo and Makali." He said Chinese experts are working together with local farmers, teaching them how to grow rice and vegetables. The farmers are receiving fertilizer and seeds, and the people of the communities are benefiting. Wu said he was also glad to announce that China is working actively on training programs in the agricultural sector for Sierra Leone in which 60 participants will be sent to China on courses, including agricultural administration, rice planting and road beautification. "Agriculture is fundamental to the economic development of a nation, and rice is a key focus of agriculture in China," he said. "We put a lot of importance on rice. I know for most Sierra Leoneans, not eating rice every day is like not eating." He thanked the Chinese Agricultural Cooperation Team for its work, saying its members have boosted self-sufficiency in growing rice in the country. Receiving the seeds and chemicals from Ambassador Wu on behalf of the farmers, Jones said he was very happy that China had responded to his country's call and sent nine experts to help in the agricultural sector. He said they would test hybrid rice, corn and other crops with a view to achieving maximum yields in the future. "Agriculture is No 1 in any country, and it has been responsible for the development of all the developed countries," Jones said. "We are pushing toward feeding ourselves and we hope we will achieve it soon as we intend to go into large-scale farming, with Chinese investors, of rice, onions, cassava and sweet potatoes." Rice, corn seed, fertilizers and agricultural chemicals were handed over. Farmers present at the ceremony thanked the Chinese government and people for their support. They said that with the training received from Chinese experts, they are seeing a great difference in farming output, through which they can raise funds to look after their families and pay school fees.
