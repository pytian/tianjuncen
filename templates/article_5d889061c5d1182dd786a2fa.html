                Harry Stine: sows trade with China
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Iowa billionaire Harry Stine has been compared to Gregor Mendel, an 1800s Austrian monk and the father of cross-bred pea plants. Growingup poor as a farm boy, Stine became a successful inventor and businessman by creating high-yield corn and soybean seeds through genetic modification and cross-breeding and by licensing them to multinational companies. While Mendel had only about 50 acres to work with to find out the basic rules of heredity, Stine has 28,000 acres to cross-breed corn and soybean plants based on the same principle, creating Stine Seed, the world's largest privately owned seed company.  Harry Stine, founder and owner of the world's largest private seed company, Stine Seed in Adel, Iowa, speaks about his business and history with China from his modest office. May Zhou / China DailyOn a windy, sunny summer morning, Stine showed his demonstration corn and soybean plants at the company's modest headquarters in Adel, Iowa. "This year, we have 35,000 different seeds. There are 400,000 corn plants in the nursery. Every one of them will be pollinated by hand," Stine said. Pointing to the corn plants, Stine said: "We put two inbreeds together to make a hybrid. Then we plant the genetics in the US and other places around the world, including China,"he said. For him, there are plenty of reasons he has many connections with China. "My first main business was in soybean plant breeding, and all of our soybeans originally came from Asia, primarily China in the early 1900s. We would not have the success we had today if we didn't have the opportunity to use Chinese soybeans to start with," said Stine, while pointing to the soybean nursery on the farm. Stine was also one of the first people invited by the Chinese government to visit China in early 1976. He ran into Zhou Enlai's funeral procession in the streets of Beijing. "Zhou did a good job in a complicated situation," Stine said. Since his first visit to China in 1976, Stine had taken his family to tour China a couple of times. He also spoke at the 2015 China Development Forum in Beijing. "Anyone who had been in China then and now has to have great admiration for the progress and change (that has) occurred in China. Combined with China's long history, I only have great respect and appreciation for both China and its people," Stine said. Stine's father moved to the current farm in 1934, when it was relatively small. "We worked long hours and had a small income. I kind of identify with that kind of small farmer in China and want to help them wherever I can," Stine said. Beginning in 2012, with the help of Zhao Li at the Iowa China Group, Stine began making connections with Chinese seed companies and now provides high-yield corn and soybean seeds to farms around China. Since then, "we have established a business relationship with a few Chinese companies", Stine said. Stine said his products can help Chinese farmers to increase their corn yield by one third and soybean yield by 10 to 20 percent. He wants to help Chinese farmers reach the same level of production in the US. So far, Stine has sent hundreds of products to China to test which best fit China's environment. "Some not doing well here can do well in China," he said. Although a relative newcomer to China's seed business, Stine Seed is moving fast. Already, China has become its largest market outside of the US. The company has registered three hybrid corns with the Chinese government, and more are coming. Stine seeds are being planted in half of China's provinces. Now, Stine's connection with China is getting much stronger: In June, ChinaChem acquired Syngenta, one of the largest global agricultural chemical and seed companies. "The largest company we deal with here in the US is Syngenta. We have a lot of contractual agreements with Syngenta. So you might say that today most of our business is done with the Chinese," Stine said. Stine is confident that his seed business will grow rapidly in China. "We are more cooperative with local companies and government than some other American seed companies," he said. Many US companies don't want to put soybeans in China because they think they will lose control. "It's true, but I don't care," Stine said. "I want to help Chinese soybean farmers. It was Chinese soybean that made me successful in the first place, so I am happy to give some new varieties back to China. "Some (genetic seeds) will be used in China in ways not permitted here," he said. "We constantly have newer and better genetics, so it's a minor problem, not a major one. Yes, China should and will change, but let it happen; it will be OK." Stine has razor-sharp focus and loves working in the field. To him, the farm is his playhouse. "I hire people to play golf, to go fishing, to go to ballgames. I come here to play every day," he joked. Stine's love of ping-pong is legendary, and he has beaten many Chinese seed executives. A big ping-pong table sits in one of the company's offices. He recalled that he beat someone from Japan in the hotel when he first visited China in 1976, but lost to the delegation's Chinese bus driver. "They were looking at a picture of me playing ping-pong when I visited the Department of Agriculture in China," chuckled Stine. When it comes to China-US relations, Stine said it does the world a lot of good for the two to work together. "We should forget about the differences and focus on working together on issues, like, there are terrorists running around, and China is a good partner to work with on that," Stine said. With the two visits to Iowa made by President Xi Jinping and the new appointment of former Iowa governor Terry Branstad as the new US ambassador to China, Iowa is forging an ever-growing tie with China. "Branstad is a longtime friend, and his ambassadorship will benefit Iowa, the agricultural business and the US as a whole," Stine said. mayzhou@chiandailyusa.com (China Daily USA 07/07/2017 page11)

                For Harry Stine, a farm boy who became an inventor, businessman and the richest billionaire in Iowa by licensing his genetically engineered corn and soybean seeds to multinational companies, there are a lot of reasons he has many connections with China. "My first main business was in soybean plant breeding, and all of our soybeans originally came from Asia, primarily China. We would not have the success we had today if we didn't have the opportunity to use Chinese soybeans to start with," said Stine, while pointing to the soybean nursery on the farm where Stine Seed sits in Adel, Iowa. Stine Seed is the world's largest privately owned seed company. Stine was also one of the first people invited by the Chinese government to visit China in early 1976. He ran into the funeral procession of former premier Zhou Enlai in the streets of Beijing. "Zhou did a good job in a complicated situation," Stine said. Since his first visit to China in 1976, Stine had taken his family to tour China a couple of times. He also spoke at the 2015 China Development Forum in Beijing. "Anyone who has been in China then and now has to have great admiration for the progress and change that occurred in China. Combined with China's long history, I only have great respect and appreciation for both China and its people," Stine said. Stine's father moved to the current farm in 1934 when it was relatively small. Today it has morphed into a giant farm of 11,331 hectares primarily used for seed breeding. "We worked long hours and had a small income. I kind of identify with that kind of small farmers in China and want to help them wherever I can," said Stine. Beginning in 2012, with the help of Zhao Li at Iowa China Group, Stine began making connections with Chinese seed companies and now provides high-yield corn and soybean seeds to farms around China. Stine said his genetics can help Chinese farmers to increase their corn yield by one-third and soybean yield by 10 to 20 percent. He wants to help Chinese farmers to reach the same level of production as in the US. So far Stine has sent hundreds of genetics to China to test what best fit China's environment. Although a relatively newcomer to China's seed business, Stine Seed is moving fast. Already, China has become its largest market outside of US. Stine Seed has registered three hybrid corns with the Chinese government and more are coming. Stine seeds are being planted in half of China's provinces. Stine is confident that his seed business will grow rapidly in China. "We are more cooperative with local companies and government than some other American seed companies," he said.

                    Harry Stine: Sows trade with China
                </p>
            </a>

                Harry Stine, founder and owner of the world's largest private seed company Stine Seed in Adel, Iowa, speaks about his China connection from his modest office. MAY ZHOU / CHINA DAILY Iowa billionaire Harry Stine has been compared to Gregor Mendel, an 1800s Austrian monk and the father of cross-bred pea plants.Growing up poor as a farm boy, Stine became a successful inventor and businessman by creating high-yield corn and soybean seeds through genetic modification and cross-breeding and by licensing them to multinational companies. While Mendel had only about 50 acres to work with to find out the basic rules of heredity, Stine has 28,000 acres to cross-breed corn and soybean plants based on the same principle, creating Stine Seed, the world's largest privately owned seed company.On a windy, sunny summer morning, Stine showed his demonstration corn and soybean plants at the company's modest headquarters in Adel, Iowa."This year, we have 35,000 different seeds. There are 400,000 corn plants in the nursery. Every one of them will be pollinated by hand," Stine said.Pointing to the corn plants, Stine said: "We put two inbreeds together to make a hybrid. Then we plant the genetics in the US and other places around the world, including China," he said. For him, there are plenty of reasons he has many connections with China."My first main business was in soybean plant breeding, and all of our soybeans originally came from Asia, primarily China in the early 1900s. We would not have the success we had today if we didn't have the opportunity to use Chinese soybeans to start with," said Stine, while pointing to the soybean nursery on the farm. Stine was also one of the first people invited by the Chinese government to visit China in early 1976. He ran into Zhou Enlai's funeral procession in the streets of Beijing. "Zhou did a good job in a complicated situation," Stine said.Since his first visit to China in 1976, Stine had taken his family to tour China a couple of times. He also spoke at the 2015 China Development Forum in Beijing. "Anyone who had been in China then and now has to have great admiration for the progress and change (that has) occurred in China. Combined with China's long history, I only have great respect and appreciation for both China and its people," Stine said.Stine's father moved to the current farm in 1934, when it was relatively small."We worked long hours and had a small income. I kind of identify with that kind of small farmer in China and want to help them wherever I can," Stine said.Beginning in 2012, with the help of Zhao Li at the Iowa China Group, Stine began making connections with Chinese seed companies and now provides high-yield corn and soybean seeds to farms around China.Since then, "we have established a business relationship with a few Chinese companies", Stine said.Stine said his products can help Chinese farmers to increase their corn yield by one third and soybean yield by 10 to 20 percent. He wants to help Chinese farmers reach the same level of production in the US. So far, Stine has sent hundreds of products to China to test which best fit China's environment. "Some not doing well here can do well in China," he said.Although a relative newcomer to China's seed business, Stine Seed is moving fast. Already, China has become its largest market outside of the US. The company has registered three hybrid corns with the Chinese government, and more are coming. Stine seeds are being planted in half of China's provinces. Now, Stine's connection with China is getting much stronger: In June, ChinaChem acquired Syngenta, one of the largest global agricultural chemical and seed companies. "The largest company we deal with here in the US is Syngenta. We have a lot of contractual agreements with Syngenta. So you might say that today most of our business is done with the Chinese," Stine said.Stine is confident that his seed business will grow rapidly in China. "We are more cooperative with local companies and government than some other American seed companies," he said.Many US companies don't want to put soybeans in China because they think they will lose control. "It's true, but I don't care," Stine said. "I want to help Chinese soybean farmers. It was Chinese soybean that made me successful in the first place, so I am happy to give some new varieties back to China. "Some (genetic seeds) will be used in China in ways not permitted here," he said. "We constantly have newer and better genetics, so it's a minor problem, not a major one. Yes, China should and will change, but let it happen; it will be OK." Stine has razor-sharp focus and loves working in the field. To him, the farm is his playhouse. "I hire people to play golf, to go fishing, to go to ballgames. I come here to play every day," he joked.Stine's love of ping-pong is legendary, and he has beaten many Chinese seed executives. A big ping-pong table sits in one of the company's offices. He recalled that he beat someone from Japan in the hotel when he first visited China in 1976, but lost to the delegation's Chinese bus driver."They were looking at a picture of me playing ping-pong when I visited the Department of Agriculture in China," chuckled Stine.When it comes to China-US relations, Stine said it does the world a lot of good for the two to work together."We should forget about the differences and focus on working together on issues, like, there are terrorists running around, and China is a good partner to work with on that," Stine said. With the two visits to Iowa made by President Xi Jinping and the new appointment of former Iowa governor Terry Branstad as the new US ambassador to China, Iowa is forging an ever-growing tie with China. "Branstad is a longtime friend, and his ambassadorship will benefit Iowa, the agricultural business and the US as a whole," Stine said.

                CHICAGO — "I'm a farmer so I want to do things that benefit farmers worldwide," Harry Stine, founder and CEO of the world's largest private seed company Stine Seed, said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.75-year-old Stine grew up on a farm in US midwest state of Iowa. He went to a small liberal arts college taking a general course in agriculture, then went on to Iowa State University and took some graduate work in agricultural economics for one year."On the farm I grew up on, we would raise a small quantity of seed, sell it to the neighbors and the margins were very small. We would just make a few cents," Stine said. "But on a new variety, we would get a little larger margin for one year. So I thought if I developed new varieties, I could have more control over them."He started plant breeding in mid 1960s, first in soybeans and later in corn. Without attracting any notice, Stine has developed some of the most valuable agricultural products in the world, and applied more than 900 patents.Today about two-thirds of the soybeans planted in the US every year use genetics developed by Stine's company. Its soybean and corn seed genetics also have a strong presence in South America and other international markets. Forbes estimated in 2014 that Stine's company was worth nearly $3 billion."I didn't envision that it would do quite as well as it has, we've been very lucky," Stine said.Stine Seed joined US President Donald Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in their visit to China last month, and signed an important collaborative agreement with one of its local partners in China. With this new platform, Stine Seed hoped to further strengthen its young but rapidly increasing presence in China, and to expand more efficiently and effectively.Stine Seed entered China about seven years ago. "We did it at first in a smaller way. We've been gradually expanding on that. China is one of the largest countries in the world with a large population, so we think we want to be there partially because of that and partially because we just have an attraction to China. We like China, we like its people, we like its government," Stine said.The seed company is now cooperating in both corn and soybean research with several Chinese companies."We take our genetics out of our system and we put them either directly into the Chinese companies or we cooperate and do research combining their genetics with our genetics to make superior material for the Chinese farmers," he added.Stine made his first trip to China in 1976, and has been there three times afterwards. China "has changed over the last 40 years. China has made more rapid progress than any place in the world," he noted."I've always felt close to China, partially because all of our soybeans originally came from Asia, and China in particular," Stine said. "I'm grateful of the fact that we've been able to be successful based on the origin of material that came from China."Never leaving his homeland in Iowa, Stine is a good friend of former Iowa governor and now US ambassador to China Terry Branstad. "We have a lot of connections to China and have reason to think we'll do things very favorably." "I can't help but think our two countries together can do good things for the world," he stressed.Stine also reiterated since there are many farmers in China, that's "one of the primary areas that we want to work in."He said he does not care much about revenue as long as his company helps the Chinese farmers. Even if the company gets some revenue, "we would leave that revenue in China and do research."Stine Seed's exports to China are minimal at present. "We never planned to have large exports to China. We'll export small quantities of seed that haven't reproduced in China and distribute it there. We want to get our genetics there, we don't need to be exporting large quantities of material," he explained.In face of widespread concern that farmers may become dependent on his seeds, Stine said it is okay for the farmers to keep some seed of their own. "Over time as they become more affluent and intellectual property becomes better protected, it will change," Stine said.Responding to frequent criticism that all Stine Seed has is yield, Stine said frankly: "That's true, we admit that. But we think that's by far the most important thing."

                Harry Stine, a self-made billionaire in Iowa and owner of the world's largest privately owned seed company Stine Seed, fondly remembers his first visit to China in January 1976."We landed at Beijing, made a semicircle in China and came back to Shanghai. There were very few Americans who had visited China at that date. It was interesting for us to learn," Stine recalled. "We were there as guests of the Chinese government, (which) wanted to show to a segment of Americans exactly who China was and what they were doing."They visited industrial locations, schools, hospitals and farms. "It was a wide-ranging experience which I greatly appreciated," he said.When the group stopped by at a road construction site, Stine was fascinated by how locals were building the road and has photos of him picking up a shovel and mallet."The mallet was being used to crack stones for the road construction. I was just doing it for fun. Some Americans thought that Chinese were doing things inefficiently. I recognized that the Chinese were using the resources they had at that time to the best of advantage. So I always had appreciation for their common sense and logic and how they were doing things," Stine said.Another photo showed a classroom of an elementary school in China at that time."Most of the schools were not heated, it would be nice if they were, but economically at that time that's the thing to do — not to waste money on energy. Some people would view it as negative, but I view it as positive," Stine said.Stine's parents were married in 1929, immediately before the Great Depression worldwide."I grew up poor, and we were very careful with resources. Today, Americans aren't as careful with resources. In China, particularly in that time, they were very careful with resources. I had great appreciation of that, which maybe other people didn't have."They also visited some historical sites such as the Great Wall."We didn't understand exactly how it [the Great Wall] worked. So visiting it and being told about it, and the fact it was built in sections, it's very interesting. It's nice to visit something known worldwide and historical," Stine said.Stine said he was actually impressed because people sometimes try to show things better than they are, and show things that are not realistic, but he was shown the real China."When I was there, everyone was riding bicycles and wearing blue uniforms. I thought we had an excellent understanding of where China was and where they were going," he said."Today in China there are eight-lane roads and new cars. If you told me that China would make as much progress between then and today as they have, I would say that's impossible."Henry Kissinger was there just a year ahead of me in 1975; he and I were at the 2015 China Development Forum in Beijing, and he said exactly the same thing with the same observation. The economic transformation was almost unreal," Stine said of China's development in the last 40 years.Since 2012, Stine began working with Chinese seed companies and providing high-yield corn and soybean seeds to farms around China."We are very active there in agriculture. Our original businesses are in soybeans – originally the soybeans were from Asia and primarily China – that's another reason I have great appreciation for China," Stine said.For years, Stine had a working relationship with Syngenta – a global giant in agrochemicals and seeds. A couple of years ago, Syngenta was acquired by ChinaChem and became China-owned."Our Syngenta program has expanded significantly since then. Many of the programs we are doing with Syngenta are intended for China," Stine said.
