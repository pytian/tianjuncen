                Zimbabwe mourns former president
            </p>
            <p>
                 Thousands of Zimbabweans paid their last respects to the late Robert Mugabe, whose body was brought to the Rufaro Stadium on Thursday.The queues were long, belying the mixed feelings that have characterized the public debate over the last days since the former liberation hero died in a Singaporean hospital aged 95.He leaves a complex legacy. Pundits have said while his last years at the helm ended in a military coup that forced him to resign, he is also accredited with policies such as education reforms, which lifted the southern African country literacy rates to be among the highest on the continent.The "education for all" principle pushed up demand for schools, especially in marginalized areas and disadvantaged urban centers and accelerated the training of teachers.The United Nations estimates that 83.6 percent of Zimbabweans aged 15 and older were literate in 2011. This estimation was based on Zimbabwe's 2011 Demographic and Health Survey results."Many people benefited from the education reforms implemented immediately after independence. Mugabe later launched the presidential scholarships, which targeted children from underprivileged backgrounds and sponsored them to top universities in South Africa," said Tanaka Chitsa, a researcher based in Harare.While crediting the former president as a firebrand for pan-Africanism, Tanaka said his legacy has to acknowledge the economic and social decline that later followed. Zimbabwe's annual inflation rate hit 175 percent in June, according to official data.The country is still under sanctions imposed in 2002 by the European Union following an escalation of violence and intimidation of political opponents and the press."There is a lot to learn from his leadership," concludes Chitsa.His body is expected to be at the 35,000-seater stadium for two days. The venue happens to be where Mugabe took his oath of office in 1980.His official funeral is expected to take place on Saturday at the giant 60,000-seater National Sports Stadium in Harare, where foreign leaders will attend, according to the government.The body of the former president arrived home for burial on Wednesday afternoon with around 2,000 supporters, family members and government officials waiting on the tarmac at Harare International Airport to receive his remains.His body was later taken to his private residence in the city, known as the Blue Roof. His coffin was draped with the country's national flag.Mugabe's final resting remains unclear however, as his family and government are at odds over whether is to be buried at his homestead northwest of Harare or a shrine for liberation heroes in the capital.President of Zimbabwe, Emmerson Mnangagwa has already declared Mugabe a "national hero", with flags flown at half mast across the country.

                Zimbabwe cabinet ministers sworn in
            </a>
            <p>
                 HARARE - Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Monday swore into office his new 20-member cabinet that will drive Zimbabwe's economic revival in the next five years.This comes after Mnangagwa named the leaner cabinet last Friday that is composed of new, old, experienced and youthful faces.A cross section of the Zimbabwean society has welcomed the cabinet as a breath of fresh air, taking into account that it excludes most of Mugabe-era ministers.The new finance minister Mthuli Ncube was the first to take the oath of office and he said his priorities are to stabilize the economy, clearing the country's huge external debt, restoration of public confidence in the financial sector as well as addressing the current cash crisis.He said addressing these issues would put Zimbabwe on a strong footing to eventually re-introduce its own currency dumped in 2009 in favor of multiple currencies after being rendered worthless by a decade of hyperinflation."The issue of currency reform will be underway. It is important that we do that but currency reform alone is not adequate. It needs a second leg which is fiscal policy to create stability, so that is what I will be focusing on," he said.He said his ministry will look at other options beyond the surrogate bond notes introduced in 2016 to stem the cash crisis but have slowly lost their value to the green back on the black market."Ultimately I would want the Zimbabwe dollar to come back as a sovereign currency, legal tender and store of value," he said.The former banker and financial expert said the country's cash crisis was a reflection of the country's "poor macro-economic" environment.Foreign Affairs minister Sibusiso Moyo who retained his position said Zimbabwe will continue with its engagement and re-engagement policy."All what we want is to ensure that we are friendly to all countries and above all our policy is Zimbabwe first in everything we do. But of course there are compromises because every nation has its own firsts," he said.Zimbabwe's most successful Olympian and surprise cabinet inclusion Kirsty Coventry said she would engage stakeholders to find ways of resolving challenges facing the sports sector.Coventry is one of the five ministers picked by Mnangagwa from outside parliament for their professional skills and competence.Mnangagwa also swore into office 13 deputy ministers and nine provincial ministers.

                Rwanda eyes China's support to boost sports profile
            </a>
            <p>
                African nation hopes to draw on expertise so it can improve its performance in global competititionsRwanda is looking to China in a bid to boost the Central African nation's sports profile.Olivier Oleg Karambizi, adviser to Rwanda's minister of sports and culture, says China is already a global sports giant, excelling in the Olympics as well as other international sport tournaments."We hope to improve our performance in the future, including in the Olympic Games, as a result our of strong ties with China," Karambizi says.Sino-Rwandan cooperation in the area of sports dates back to the 1980s, when China financed the construction of Amaharo National Stadium, which, with a capacity of 30,000, is the country's main sports arena.Karambizi says the Rwandan and Chinese governments are discussing the development of new training facilities, as well as the refurbishment of existing ones."The objective is to ensure that Rwandan sportsmen and women have the necessary infrastructure to be competitive in the regional and global sports arena," he adds.Today, bilateral cooperation in sports between Rwanda and China can be seen in two disciplines, kung fu and table tennis, where China is a global powerhouse.Rwanda hosts the Ambassador's Kung Fu Cup, sponsored by the Chinese envoy to Rwanda.China is also a big supporter of the Rwanda National Kung Fu Championship.Karambizi says that because China is the home of kung fu, his country hopes to receive expertise from the Asian nation.In the field of table tennis, Rwanda is also gaining expertise from China.Karambizi says Rwanda has been a beneficiary of Chinese technical support in the sport."We remain optimistic that Rwanda will qualify to play table tennis in the 2020 Olympics as a result of capacity building from China," he says.Currently, Rwandan coaches and athletes are undergoing six months of training in China to help improve their table tennis skills.At present, China is the dominant nation in table tennis, having won the vast majority of medals since the sport was introduced in the Olympics in 1988.Bonnie Mugabe, spokesman for the Rwandese Association Football Federation, says his organization is seeking closer ties with the Chinese soccer sector in order to improve the quality of Rwandan soccer.Mugabe says Rwanda could learn from China's youth development strategy for soccer, which focuses on nurturing talent at an early age.He says a number of Rwandan soccer players have expressed interest in playing in the lucrative Chinese Super League, which has attracted some of the best players from around the world.For China Daily

                Zimbabwe's founding father Robert Mugabe dies at 95
            </a>
            <p>
                 Zimbabwe's former president and founding father has passed away as of early Friday morning. Robert Mugabe, who ruled the southern African country for more than three decades before he was disposed in a military coup, has been pronounced dead.President Emmerson Mnangagwa confirmed the news on his Twitter account and said, "It is with the utmost sadness that I announce the passing on of Zimbabwe's founding father and former President, comrade Robert Mugabe.""Comrade Mugabe was an icon of liberation, a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to the emancipation and empowerment of his people. His contribution to the history of our nation and continent will never be forgotten. May his soul rest in eternal peace."His death elicited mixed reactions on the platform, with some calling him a hero due to his victory in the liberation struggle while others vilified his rule, blaming him for Zimbabwe's economic decline.Media reports quote the opposition's secretary for education MDC Zimbabwe Fadzayi Mahere as having tweeted: "Rest in Peace, Robert Mugabe. My response to your passing is complicated. I'm going to write a long piece. However, for now, deepest condolences to his family."Mugabe first served as prime minister of the newly renamed Zimbabwe for seven years after elections in February 1980. He then became president in 1981, and ruled until 2017. The army then forced him to resign in what was deemed as a coup and installed Mnangangwa, his successor.

                Former Zimbabwe President Mugabe to be buried at national shrine in Harare
            </a>
            <p>
                HARARE - Former Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe will be buried at the National Heroes Acre at a date to be announced, family spokesperson and Mugabe's nephew Leo Mugabe said Friday.Mugabe told journalists that his uncle's body would be taken to the National Heroes Acre on Sunday when all the necessary procedures to honor a national hero, such as the military 21-gun salute and conferment of national hero status by the government, will be done."The body will then be taken away for burial later while the works that are supposed to be done at Heroes Acre are done and finalized," he said.He said the works would take long to be completed, "perhaps as much as a week"."Thereafter, he will then be buried at a private ceremony by the family in a private burial service," he said.There had been issues between the Mugabe family and the government over the burial arrangements, with some family members saying that he should be buried at his rural home as per his wishes, while the government was pushing for him to be interred at the national shrine as a sign of honor.He was speaking during the second public funeral ceremony for Mugabe at Rufaro Stadium.Mourners from five provinces from the southern parts of the country bid the former president farewell, after those from the country's five other provinces did the same on Thursday.According to the program, the international dignitaries will bid farewell to Mugabe at the National Sports Stadium in Harare on Saturday.At least 11 African heads of state and government have confirmed attendance and are expected to start arriving in the country Friday.
