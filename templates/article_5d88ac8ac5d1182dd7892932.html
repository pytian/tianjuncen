                One of last generals from war with Japan dies at 100
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Zhang Zhongru, the first president of People's Liberation Army University of International Relations and a veteran of the fighting that preceded the birth of the People's Republic of China, died in Beijing on Thursday at the age of 100.Born into a poor farmer's family in Yuanping, Shanxi province, Zhang joined the PLA and the Communist Party of China in 1937 and participated in more than 100 battles during the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression (1931-1945).Zhang was the fourth major general who experienced that war to die this year.There are now 11 major generals left who fought in the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, with an average age of over 100.From 1955 to 1965, China conferred the rank of general on more than 1,600 distinguished military personnel, including 10 senior generals, 57 generals, 177 lieutenant generals and 1,360 major generals.All the generals ranked higher than major general have died.Known for his indomitable spirit and brushes with death, Zhang told Xinhua News Agency in 2015 that China's victory against Japanese aggressors was earned through unity, blood and sacrifice, and scenes of fierce battles lived on in his mind.In January 1938, at a battle near Taiyuan, Shanxi province, Zhang's squad was encircled by Japanese troops. The fight to break out was brutal and his team leader, Liu Sentang, was killed in action."I can never forget Liu's face and his dying pose," Zhang said."The Japanese soldiers can defeat one of us, but they can never defeat the united spirit of the Chinese people."In 1943, Zhang was ambushing a group of Japanese troops when a bullet penetrated the left side of his chest. Blood gushed uncontrollably from the wound, and Zhang was rushed to a makeshift hospital tent where a doctor removed his shattered ribs and flesh without any anesthetic.Zhang then returned to the battle while exhaling pus and blood from his mouth.He survived the ordeal after seven more surgeries.In 1951, Zhang was tasked with creating a school to train young volunteer soldiers for scouting missions during the Korean War (1950-1953).The school became the predecessor of the PLA University of International Relations in Nanjing, Jiangsu province.Zhang emphasized loyalty, sacrifice, rigorousness and practicality in his curriculum, which later became the teaching philosophy at the university.The university was founded in June, 1951.

                    HK rioters no longer act over extradition bill
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The criminal actions by a few rioters in Hong Kong show that their purpose is no longer related to the extradition bill but to paralyze the Hong Kong government and make Hong Kong an independent political entity, said a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council on Tuesday.Yang Guang, spokesman of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said at a news conference on Tuesday in Beijing that "we have reached a crucial moment to safeguard the bottom line of the 'one country, two systems' principle and maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability."Yang said the Hong Kong situation triggered by the revision of the extradition bill has deteriorated and the purpose of the rioters no longer has anything to do with the bill amendments.He said the rioters did not hesitate to violate the law and commit violence to willingly serve external forces and anti-China forces.Their purpose is to "disrupt Hong Kong order, paralyze the SAR government, then seize the jurisdiction of the region and turn Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity," he said, adding that they aim to undermine the "one country, two systems" ultimately.According to Yang, three rioters ambushed a police officer on Aug 30 and attacked the officer with a knife, causing him serious injury in many parts of his body. "The cruelty has reached the level of madness," he added.On Aug 31, rioters held illegal gatherings in crowded areas, tossed petrol bombs at police officers and government buildings, and threw tear gas into the military camp of the PLA Hong Kong Garrison.On Sunday, a small number of radicals rushed into the Tung Chung metro station and damaged the metro control room, seriously threatening the safe operations of the subway. They also blocked traffic to the airport, causing multiple lines to stop service for more than six hours.Additionally, they incited students to go on strike from classes and used students as tools to achieve their political goals, Yang said, adding that these acts have far exceeded the scope of normal assemblies and are "violent crimes in any country, any region and any legal system.""There is no middle ground and no room to hesitate or sway on the issue of stopping riots and unrest, which concern Hong Kong's future and destiny," he added.

                Criminal acts committed by a few rioters in Hong Kong show that their purpose is no longer related to the extradition bill but instead is intended to paralyze the Hong Kong government and make the city an independent political entity, a spokesman for the Hong Kong affairs authority said on Tuesday."They are in fact confronting the central government and imperiling the principle of 'one country, two systems'," using the high degree of autonomy as a pretext, said Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council.Yang said the rioters have not hesitated to violate the law and engage in violence to willingly serve external forces and anti-China forces.Hong Kong's situation is still grim and complex, he said, adding that the violence and illegal activities have not been totally kept at bay, with a small number of rioters doubling down on their violent and criminal activities.Yang said three rioters ambushed a police officer on Friday and attacked him with knives, causing serious injury. "The cruelty has reached the level of madness," he said.On Friday, rioters tossed gasoline bombs at police and government buildings and picked up police tear gas grenades before tossing them into a military camp of the PLA Hong Kong Garrison.They incited students to boycott classes and used students as tools to achieve their political goals, Yang said, adding that the rioters even threatened to die together and tried to bend the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government under their pressure by resorting to such extreme behavior."We have reached a crucial moment to protect the 'one country, two systems' principle and maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability," Yang said. "We should not hesitate or compromise on issues concerning Hong Kong's future and destiny."Yang called on the SAR government and people from all sectors of society to further build consensus on containing turmoil and bringing order back to Hong Kong.As for the demonstrators' "five demands", including universal suffrage for the election of chief executive, Yang said they are not expressing demands but are threatening and coercing the central government."The universal suffrage they want is to elect a chief executive who is not accountable to the central government," Yang said, indicating that the purpose is to make the principle of "one country, two systems" exist in name only.Under the Basic Law, candidates for Hong Kong's chief executive must be endorsed by a majority of a nominating committee, and the chief executive must be accountable to the central government.Xu Luying, a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said the central government will not allow the chaos in Hong Kong to continue indefinitely and will not stand idly by if it worsens and turns into unrest that threatens national sovereignty."It's totally wrong that the deployment of the People's Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong would overturn the principle of 'one country, two systems'," Xu said.The Garrison Law states that the SAR government can request that the central government let the PLA garrison in Hong Kong help maintain local public order.The Constitution and the Basic Law also grant the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress-the top legislature-the power to judge and directly announce an emergency status for Hong Kong, under which the PLA Hong Kong Garrison can perform its duties accordingly."The two conditions are both under the framework of the 'one country, two systems' principle," she said.On Tuesday morning, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor firmly denied media reports hinting at her broaching the subject of possible resignation in a private conversation.Speaking to reporters ahead of the weekly meeting of her Executive Council, Lam said, "From the beginning until now, I have never tendered my resignation to the Central People's Government."Lam reaffirmed that she had never contemplated resigning as she took questions from reporters. "Let me say it in a clear-cut manner: No," Lam said.In an unambiguous message, Lam said: "In a private session, I just attempted to explain, as an individual, given the very difficult circumstances, it (resignation) might be an easy choice to make. But I told myself repeatedly in the last few months that my team and I should stay on to help Hong Kong in a very difficult situation and serve the people of Hong Kong. That remains my position."

                    Insights on HK from Deng Xiaoping's speeches
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Protests in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) have not stopped, although Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has repeatedly said the extradition amendment bill, which sparked the protests, is "dead" on different occasions. The continuing protests on Hong Kong's streets are part of a conspiracy between opposition figures, some radicals and external forces.During the past months, these people have been inciting confrontation between the Hong Kong government and citizens, turning initially peaceful protests into illegal violence and even challenging the bottom line of "one country, two systems". Their violent acts exhibit earmarks of a "color revolution". And as the violence is getting more and more intense, "signs of terrorism" are emerging.In such a context, it is of special significance that we review speeches by former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, made on Oct 3, 1984, when he met with a delegation of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots attending the National Day celebrations, and on April 16, 1987, at a meeting with the members of the drafting committee of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR (Basic Law).Hong Kong's achievements today are attributed to "one country, two systems""One country, two systems" is a preferential State policy adopted by the central government toward Hong Kong and Macao. The original purpose of "one country, two systems" is to make Hong Kong and Macao return to China's sovereignty and achieve cross-Straits reunification by allowing a socialist system and capitalist system to coexist in a socialist country. This is a great pioneering initiative, an unprecedented innovation without a doubt. It is just as Deng Xiaoping said when he met with members of the drafting committee of the Basic Law: "This is something new. It was created not by the United States, Japan, the Soviet Union or any European country, but by China; that is why we call it a Chinese characteristic." He added, "We are building socialism suited to Chinese conditions, which is why we were able to formulate the policy of 'one country, two systems' and why we can allow the two different systems to coexist. We would not be able to do this if we lacked courage, the courage that comes from the support of the people. Our people support the socialist system and leadership by the Party."Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy, which even exceeds that of states under some federal governments, if we consider it comparatively. The SAR enjoys an extremely wide range of administrative powers, covering economics, education, science, culture, sports, religion, social services, social security, and exit and entry management. In addition, Hong Kong also enjoys some rights on foreign affairs under central government authorization. But its most important right of autonomy, above all, is in finance and economics. For example, the HKSAR has its own independent tariff system and it does not need to turn over its tax revenue to the central government. Apart from that, Hong Kong also has its own independent monetary system and the Hong Kong dollar can be exchanged to other currencies freely. Although the land of Hong Kong is State-owned, it is managed by the SAR government and the revenues derived from it are exclusively at the disposal of the SAR government.Besides, Hong Kong also enjoys an extremely broad range of legislative powers and can enact laws applicable in the SAR in civil, criminal, commercial and legal proceedings and other aspects in accordance with the Basic Law. The laws previously in force in Hong Kong (that is, the common law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation and customary law) have been maintained, save for any that contravene the Basic Law, and are subject to subsequent amendment by the HKSAR legislature. After the establishment of the HKSAR, the Court of Final Appeal has also been set up to exercise the power of final adjudication in the region. The judicial system previously practiced in Hong Kong has been maintained except for those changes consequent upon the establishment of the Court of Final Appeal. The common law and relevant judicial principles and systems previously practiced in Hong Kong, including the principle of independent adjudication, the principle of stare decisis and the jury system, have continued to apply. When adjudicating cases, the courts of the HKSAR may refer to precedents of other common law jurisdictions, and the Court of Final Appeal may as required invite judges from other common law jurisdictions to sit in the Court of Final Appeal.The wide-ranging and high degree of autonomy has created favorable conditions for Hong Kong's economic development and has promoted and consolidated its status as an international hub of financing, trade and shipping. All these are dividends brought about by "one country, two systems". In addition, the Chinese mainland has been giving priority to meeting the needs of Hong Kong residents in supplies of food, tap water and all kinds of daily necessities. Infrastructure, such as high-speed railway and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, is constructed to help integrate Hong Kong into the national transportation network and make it more convenient for Hong Kong people to travel to the mainland. Apart from that, Hong Kong residents can travel to and from the mainland simply with a Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents, and can stay in the mainland with no time limit. China is also constantly introducing new policies and measures to facilitate Hong Kong people's work, studies and lives on the Chinese mainland. Without the strong support from the motherland, Hong Kong would not be self-sufficient in food, clothing, housing and transportation, let alone become an international financial, trade and shipping center or an international metropolis full of vitality and freedom.After Hong Kong's return to China in 1997, many people in Hong Kong hadn't realized the change of their identity and Hong Kong's constitutional order. Hong Kong people have values and lifestyles similar to the West, so some of them don't have enough understanding of or affective commitment to China. Foreign forces have taken the opportunity to infiltrate. For example, the US has been trying to turn Hong Kong into a pawn to hinder China's development, while the UK, an ally of the US and the former ruler of Hong Kong, often pokes its nose into the administration of the SAR government. In addition, the deep-seated contradictions in Hong Kong society have not been resolved after its return, which leads to mounting public grievances. It was under such conditions that the opposition groups took use of the controversies sparked by the extradition amendment bill to make waves and throw Hong Kong society into turbulence.

                China to build Type 071E amphibious transport dock ship for foreign navyChina will build a Type 071E amphibious transport dock ship for export to Thailand, the largest naval ship the nation will have built for a foreign user.China State Shipbuilding Corp, a State-owned shipbuilding conglomerate and one of the major suppliers to the Chinese Navy, said last week it had inked an agreement with the Royal Thai Navy on the construction and sale of the Type 071E, adding it was the first time China had sold such a vessel to another country.Admiral Luechai Ruddit, commander-in-chief of the RTN, and officials from the Chinese government and military took part in a signing ceremony for the deal in Beijing on Sept 9, according to a statement issued by CSSC.The company said the deal was a major new accomplishment in the strategic cooperation between the two countries, adding it would substantially deepen collaboration in the arms trade and also help strengthen regional peace and stability.The shipbuilder did not provide details about the ship's specifications, or its construction and delivery schedule.The Type 071E is an export version of the Type 071 landing platform dock deployed by the People's Liberation Army Navy. There are six Type 071s in service with the PLA Navy, according to military observers following the Navy's weapons development.According to information from CSSC, the Type 071 is China's largest landing craft and boasts advanced weapons systems. It is 210 meters long and 28 meters wide, and has a full-load displacement of 25,000 metric tons. The vessel is capable of sailing more than 18,500 kilometers in a single operation, the company said.An insider in China's naval shipbuilding industry, who wished to be identified only as Che, said that compared with the existing Type 071 vessels in the PLA Navy, the export version features better weapons and can carry more helicopters.The Type 071E amphibious transport dock ship, also classified as a type of landing platform dock, will be the largest naval warship China has built for a foreign country.After the ship is delivered to the RTN, it will also become the biggest warship in the Southeast Asian nation's fleet, eclipsing HTMS Chakri Naruebet, the flagship of the RTN and its only aircraft carrier.The largest naval ship China has exported so far is HTMS Similan, a Type 908 replenishment ship built for the RTN in the 1990s that has a full-load displacement of 22,000 tons. That makes it bigger than HTMS Chakri Naruebet, but it is not classified as a warship.
