                Brazil military begins operations to fight Amazon fires
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                RIO DE JANEIRO  — Backed by military aircraft, Brazilian troops on Saturday prepared to deploy in the Amazon to fight fires that have swept the region and prompted anti-government protests as well as an international outcry.Some 44,000 troops will be available for "unprecedented" operations to put out the fires, and forces are heading to four Brazilian states that asked for federal help to contain the blazes, Defense Minister Fernando Azevedo said. The states are Roraima, Rondonia, Tocantins and Para.The military's first mission will be the deployment of 700 troops to the area around Porto Velho, capital of Rondonia, Azevedo said. He added that the military will use two C-130 Hercules aircraft capable of dumping up to 12,000 liters of water on fires.An Associated Press journalist flying over the Porto Velho region Saturday morning reported hazy conditions and low visibility. On Friday, the reporter saw many already deforested areas that were burned, apparently by people clearing farmland, as well as a large column of smoke billowing from one fire.The Brazilian military operations came after widespread criticism of President Jair Bolsonaro's handling of the crisis. On Friday, the president authorized the armed forces to get involved in putting out the fires, saying he is committed to protecting the Amazon region."It shows the concern of Bolsonaro's government about this issue," Azevedo said. "It was a very fast response."The defense minister noted US President Donald Trump's offer in a tweet to help Brazil fight the fires, and said there had been no further contact on the matter.Bolsonaro has previously described rainforest protections as an obstacle to Brazil's economic development, sparring with critics who say the Amazon absorbs vast amounts of greenhouse gasses and is crucial for efforts to contain climate change.The Amazon fires have become a global issue, escalating tensions between Brazil and European countries who believe Bolsonaro has neglected commitments to protect biodiversity. Protesters gathered outside Brazilian diplomatic missions in European and Latin American cities Friday, and demonstrators also marched in Brazil.The dispute spilled into the economic arena when French leader Emmanuel Macron threatened to block a European Union trade deal with Brazil and several other South American countries. He wants Group of Seven leaders meeting at a summit in France this weekend to discuss the Amazon crisis."First we need to help Brazil and other countries put out these fires," Macron said Saturday.The goal is to "preserve this forest that we all need because it is a treasure of our biodiversity and our climate thanks to the oxygen that it emits and thanks to the carbon it absorbs," he said.Bolivia and Paraguay have also struggled to contain fires that swept through woods and fields, in many cases set to clear land for farming. A US-based aircraft, the B747-400 SuperTanker, is flying over devastated areas in Bolivia to help put out the fires and protect forests.Fires are common in Brazil in the annual dry season, but they are much more widespread this year. Brazilian state experts reported nearly 77,000 wildfires across the country so far this year, up 85 percent over the same period in 2018.AP

                Burning forests ignite global debates on climate change and deforestationThis year's fire season in the Amazon is igniting a global debate on climate change and deforestation while thousands of Brazilian troops battle the spreading fires.The number of fires between January and August 21 is up 85 percent from the same period in 2018, according to Brazil's National Institute for Space Research, which tracks satellite data. The cases also increased in neighboring Bolivia and Paraguay.Under increasing international pressure to contain the fires, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has ordered 44,000 troops to be ready to combat the fires. He also spoke with the presidents of Ecuador, Chile, Argentina and Spain.Bolivia and Paraguay have also struggled to contain fires that swept through woods and fields and, in many cases, got out of control in high winds. About 7,500 square kilometers of land has been affected in Bolivia. A Boeing 747-400 Super-Tanker has been despatched to dump retardant on the blazes there.Forest fires are common across the Amazon rainforest between May and October but the big jump this year has ignited a global debate that threatens to hurt Brazil's trade and diplomatic relationships."The number of fire outbreaks recorded in the Amazon in 2019 is one of the largest in recent years. And it is getting worse," Romulo Batista, an Amazon campaigner from Greenpeace Brazil, said.The concern is that the increase in the number of fires is directly related to rapid deforestation.Thomas Lovejoy, a senior fellow at the United Nations Foundation and a professor at the Environmental Science and Policy department at George Mason University in the United States, said deforestation of the Amazon rainforest could soon reach a tipping point. Working with a Brazilian scientist, Lovejoy concluded about 18 months ago that "the tipping point probably is around 20 percent deforestation. And we're very close to that. Probably at 18 percent or 19 percent"."There are three things affecting (the Amazon) today. One is deforestation. One is extensive use of fire as you can see right now. And the third is climate change. And the three of them are working together on that hydrological cycle pushing toward a tipping point," Lovejoy added.

                LA PAZ - Just as the Amazon fires in Brazil have aroused international concerns, wildfires in Bolivia are also triggering alarm worldwide. Bolivian President Evo Morales on Sunday said he welcomes international aid to fight the wildfires that have been blazing in the country since last week.On Sunday during a re-election campaign, Morales focused on the wildfires in the country. "There have been offers of aid," he said. "They are welcome, no matter whether they come from international groups, people or presidents."He said Paraguay, Chile, Spain and some other countries have all offered aid. "I've instructed the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Relations to see how they can be of help to put out these fires," Morales said.The wildfires are blazing across the Chiquitano forests on Bolivia's border with Brazil, which is a dry tropical broadleaf forest covering an area of 230,600 square km.The Amazon fire in Brazil has now transcended its borders, reaching Peruvian, Paraguayan and Bolivian regions. Brazil owns about 60 percent of the Amazon rainforest, which covers an area of some 5,500,000 square km in South America.

                LA PAZ, Bolivia — While global attention has been focused on fires burning across the Brazilian Amazon, neighboring Bolivia is battling its own vast blazes, which have charred an area nearly as extensive as the nation of Lebanon.The head of the national forests and lands authority says at least 38,793 fires were burning across the country as of the weekend, and a total of 3,700 square miles (950,000 hectares) had been burned so far this year — most of that in weeks.While some of the fires are burning in Bolivia's share of the Amazon, the largest blazes were in the Chiquitanía region of southeastern Bolivia. It's zone of dry forest, farmland and open prairies that has seen an expansion of farming and ranching in recent years.AP

                    South America to hold Amazon summit, says Brazil's president

                BRASILIA - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Wednesday said South America's Amazonian countries will hold a summit to discuss ways to sustainably exploit the rainforest.The Sept 6 gathering in the Colombian city of Leticia comes in the wake of devastating forest fires.Bolsonaro made the announcement at a breakfast meeting in Brasilia with his Chilean counterpart Sebastian Pinera.Global concern over the destruction of the Amazon sparked a spat between Bolsonaro and French President Emmanuel Macron, who called on the international community to take steps to protect the world's largest tropical rainforest. Bolsonaro accused him of impinging on national sovereignty."By minimizing our sovereignty, he has awakened the patriotism of the Brazilian people and other countries here in South America that are part of the Amazonian region," said Bolsonaro."So much so that on Sept 6 we will get together with these presidents, except Venezuela, to discuss a single policy on environmental preservation and sustainable exploitation in our region," said Bolsonaro.Brazil, Peru and Colombia are home to most of the Amazon rainforest, though parts of it lie in Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana and Suriname.Macron also spearheaded a financial offer of $20 million from G7 countries to help battle the blaze in the Amazon, an offer Bolsonaro has so far rejected, and Pinera encouraged Brazil to accept.Regarding the aid offer, Pinera said "the Brazilian Amazon is Brazilian, but it's true that many countries want to cooperate" to put out the fires.Bolsonaro has said he will consider accepting the aid if Macron apologizes for calling him a "liar" and retracts remarks about the internationalization of the Amazon jungle.

                    Amazon fires raise alarm on ecological impact
                </p>
            </a>

                Nations along the Amazon River are not only battling huge blazes in the forests, but also fighting the perception that pro-development policies are responsible for the fires that environmentalists fear may affect the rainforest and South America's ecology.The relatively young government of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is coping with the situation by using troops and firefighting assistance from some nations, though initially balking at a G7 offer of financial aid."More than 43,000 members of the armed forces (Navy, Army and Air Force) are located in the region. They are available to act on demand, coordinate with environmental control and public safety agencies," said the Brazilian Ministry of Defense.Bolsonaro has questioned whether any other country can tell Brazil how to use its natural resources.The Amazon rainforest spans more than 5.5 million square kilometers in nine countries, though two-thirds of the area is in Brazil. More than 160,000 forest fires have been recorded throughout the region so far this year, with about half of them in Brazil. Of the rest, 26,000 have been in Venezuela, 19,000 in Bolivia and around 14,000 each in Colombia and Argentina.The United States and Israel have sent firefighting planes to help tackle the blazes. Other countries are leasing planes to spray water and fire retardants.For the rest of the continent, the concern is that burning a particular section of the Amazon rainforest could have implications on weather patterns as well as regional access to water. A single large tree in the Amazon can release about 1,000 liters of water into the atmosphere every day through a process called evapotranspiration. That water turns into rain that falls throughout the region."Calculating that, the Amazon would reach the extraordinary number of 20 billion tons of water in a single day. We call this rios voadores, or 'flying rivers'," said Ana Luiza Tunes, an environmental engineer and water management specialist who founded the Brazilian environmental portal Tunes Ambiental."It is the 'flying rivers' formed in the Amazon that bring water back to the continent. This leads us to conclude that the Amazon rainforest is not only the main lungs of the world, but the heart of planet Earth," Tunes said.During the dry season, which typically runs from May until October, fires in the Amazon are sparked by natural sources such as lightning strikes. Some argue that this year's fire season is not particularly different from others.According to NASA, total fire activity across the Amazon basin as of Aug 16 was close to average compared with the past 15 years. Global Forest Watch, an online platform that provides data and tools to monitor forests, agreed, though data from other agencies point to an increase in fires.Brazilian President Bolsonaro has argued that the global alarms are politically motivated.Renan Buchelt de Oliveira, an environmental consultant, said, "The problem is the media war against the current government, not a fire increase."He said it is mostly opposition parties that have harshly criticized Bolsonaro's government and management of the fires. "In eight months of government, these groups have been trying to destabilize the new government," he said.Critics say the president's pro-development policies are responsible for many of the fires, due to the expansion of slash-and-burn tactics. They argue that this year's fires are the beginning of a trend caused by runaway deforestation sparked by pro-agriculture policies.Around 2,500 fires are currently burning in Brazil. The Brazilian state of Amazonas has managed to control some areas after it declared a state of emergency on Aug 11.Fires have spread across the tropical forests and savannahs near Bolivia's borders with Paraguay and Brazil. At least 1 million hectares have been affected by the blazes, Bolivian officials said."More than 800,000 hectares of the Chiquitano forest (inside the Amazon rainforest) were burned in Bolivia during August. This region is the largest dry rainforest in the world and at risk of losing this title," said Tunes, the environmental engineer.The author is a freelance journalist.

                 LETICIA -- Leaders and representatives of Amazon countries signed a pact on Friday to protect the the world's largest tropical rainforest.The "Leticia Amazon Pact" came as raging fires have burned thousands of hectares of the forest.The presidents of Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru, as well as Suriname's vice president and Guyana's natural resource minister attended the summit during which the pact was signed.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro participated by video link, while his foreign minister attended in person.The signatory countries announced that they will look for strategies and act to battle logging and forest fires, which are contaminating the "lungs of the world."The Amazon has more than 50 percent of the tropical forests in the world.During the opening of the summit, Colombian President Ivan Duque made an appeal to protect the rainforest.Duque said that it was necessary to establish an "immediate coordination among all the natural disasters' management and care units to face forest fires."
