                The mask of King Tutankhamun, which was found to have been damaged and glued back together, is seen at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo January 24, 2015. [Photo/Agencies]The golden mask's beard was detached in August, something the museum had not made public until photographs surfaced on the Internet showing a line of glue around its chin, prompting speculation about the damage and questions over whether Egypt was able to care for its priceless artefacts.The beard broke off when museum workers were changing the lights in its display case and accidentally touched the mask, the antiquities ministry said.Christian Eckmann, a German conservator brought in to evaluate the damage, told reporters on Saturday that the seriousness of the damage had been exaggerated."The use of epoxy is not the best, but it is a solution," he said at a news conference alongside the minister of antiquities."However this measure was unfortunately done not really properly, so you can see now some remains of glue at the beard."However, gluing the boy king's beard on is not unprecedented.The beard was not fixed to the mask when it was excavated, Eckmann said, and the artefact was brought to the Egyptian Museum with its beard unattached in 1924.It was not until 1941 that the beard piece was reattached to the mask with glue that has deteriorated over the past 70 years, making the accident in August more likely, Eckmann said.

                An archaeologist said on Sunday that Maia, Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamen's wet nurse, may have actually been his sister Meritaten, reviving speculation about the identity of the mother of the boy king.DNA tests have proved that the pharaoh Akhenaten was the father of Tutankhamen, but the identity of his mother has long been a mystery.On Sunday, Egyptian officials and French archaeologist Alain Zivie unveiled Maia's tomb to journalists ahead of its opening to the public next month.

"However, business improved after Chinese tourists started visiting Luxor."An increasing number of Chinese tourists are visiting Egypt following President Xi Jinping's recent visit, reviving Egypt's tourism industry.

                US archaeologist's newly translated book explores the next phase of human societal development and how the lessons of the past can help predict the future. Wang Kaihao reports."I have seen yesterday. I know tomorrow." The words taken from an inscription on the tomb of the ancient Egyptian Pharaoh, Tutankhamen, provide the opening line to the original English version of the most recent book by American archaeologist Robert L. Kelly.The somewhat prophetic, yet at the same time reflective, proclamation sets the tone for The Fifth Beginning, in which Kelly attempts to show what six million years of human history can tell us about our future.Now, Chinese readers can also enjoy Kelly's insightful tome, as it has been translated into Chinese and published through China CITIC Press this month.In the book, Kelly identifies four pivotal points in human history: the beginning of technology, culture, agriculture, and the concept of the nation-state, as he puts it."Archaeology relies on 'things' to tell story, (like) broken pieces of pottery, stones or collapsed walls," he explains in a video clip introducing the book for Chinese readers. "Changes in these things over time tell us about changes to the organization of human societies."I think the future archaeologists will see another beginning, the fifth beginning, which began about 500 years ago," he says.In his point of view, the fifth beginning is that of global migration and the global movement of goods, which have been brought about by new transportation and computing technologies－so-called "globalization", which is thus framed in a larger historical context.Kelly is a professor of anthropology at the University of Wyoming, and was the president of the Society for American Archaeology. He has conducted archaeological research throughout the western United States for 45 years.Returning from another field excavation, he quickly responded to an interview from China Daily via email."Looking at all of world prehistory, I could see that technology, culture, agriculture and the state each marked major transitions in how humans organized themselves and related to each other," he says. "Of course, (they) are still important today."We could not survive without technology," Kelly explains. "Culture is a crucial element of human adaptation, while agriculture is equally important, because a world of almost eight billion people could not live as hunter-gatherers. The state was a way to organize large numbers of people ... in a world of increasing competition for resources."

                LUXOR, Egypt－Authorities on Saturday unveiled a well-preserved mummy of a woman inside a previously unopened coffin in Luxor in southern Egypt dating back more than 3,000 years.The sarcophagus, an ancient coffin, was one of two found earlier this month by a French-led mission in the northern area of El-Asasef, a necropolis on the western bank of the Nile. The first one had been opened earlier and examined by Egyptian antiquities officials.In a ceremony in front of the temple of Queen Hatshepsut, Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani announced that French and Egyptian archaeologists had discovered "a new tomb... with very nice paintings".Located between the royal tombs at the Valley of the Queens and the Valley of the Kings, the El-Asasef necropolis is the burial site of nobles and senior officials.Among the finds in the tomb are sarcophagi, statues and about 1,000 funerary figurines called "Ushabtis" made of wood, faience and clay."One sarcophagus was rishi-style, which dates back to the 17th dynasty, while the other sarcophagus was from the 18th dynasty," Anani said. "The two tombs were present with their mummies inside."The 18th Dynasty dates back to the 13th century BC, a period noted for some of the most well known Pharaohs, including Tutankhamen and Ramses II.It was the first known time that authorities had opened a previously unopened sarcophagus before international media.Ongoing workIn a statement, the ministry said the remains are of a woman named Thuya.But spokeswoman Nevine Aref said later that work was still ongoing to definitively identify the name of the mummy.Earlier in the day, authorities also revealed in the same area the tomb of the overseer of the mummification shrine identified as Thaw-Irkhet-if.Three hundred meters of rubble were removed over five months to uncover the tomb, which contained colored ceiling paintings depicting the owner and his family.The tomb, which also contains mummies, skeletons and skulls, dates back to the middle-kingdom almost 4,000 years ago, but was reused during the late period.Ancient Egyptians mummified humans to preserve their bodies for the afterlife, while animal mummies were used as religious offerings.Egypt has revealed over a dozen ancient discoveries since the beginning of this year and archaeological sites, particularly in Luxor, make the country a major draw for foreign tourists.REUTERS - AFP

                28.5-cm brown quartzite relic might fetch $5 million despite Egyptian outcryChristie's auction house has said it will go ahead with the sale of a Tutankhamen statue in London on Thursday despite an outcry from the Egyptian authorities, who claim the bust may have been stolen.Christie's expects the 28.5-centimeter brown quartzite relic from the Valley of the Kings to fetch more than 4 million ($5.1 million). The statue of Pharaoh Tutankhamen, portrayed as god Amun, is said to be more than 3,000 years old.In a statement posted on its social media page, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities said it has contacted the auction house and UNESCO to try to halt the sale and to request to see the documents of ownership related to the artifact.Egypt's embassy in London has reached out to the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a bid to have the bust returned to Egypt and has asked Christie's to stop the sale and return other Egyptian artifacts. It said Egypt will continue attempting to retrieve and restore Egyptian artifacts that have been smuggled abroad and added that it has had success in doing so.Christie's said in a statement that it has established legal rights and ownership of the statue."Ancient objects by their nature cannot be traced, over millennia. It is hugely important to establish recent ownership and legal right to sell which we have clearly done. We would not offer for sale any object where there was concern over ownership or export," the auctioneer said.The auction house said the lot was acquired from Heinz Herzer, a Munich-based dealer, in 1985.Before this, Joseph Messina, an Austrian dealer, acquired the statue in 1973 or 1974 from Prinz Wilhelm von Thurn und Taxis, who reputedly had it in his collection."The work has been widely exhibited and published (about) and we have alerted the Egyptian embassy so they are aware of the sale," Christie's said. "There is a long-standing and legitimate market for works of art of the ancient world, in which Christie's has participated for generations."The London auction house stressed that it "strictly adheres to bilateral treaties and international laws with respect to cultural property and patrimony".Ian Fox-Williams, deputy head of law at Birmingham City University, said it is no surprise that Egypt is seeking to block the sale given the "revered place Pharaoh Tutankhamen has in the rich cultural history of Egypt". Tutankhamen reigned as king from 1332-1323 BC."It should be noted that before putting the piece up for sale, Christie's publicized documentation that shows provenance of the statue that will go to auction on July 4, and, as the legal owner, they are entitled to sell the piece to the highest bidder," Fox-Williams said."However, it should be noted that the way ancient artifacts often come onto the international market is through looting. However, things can become more complex with regards to showing provenance, if the item instead of looting was 'picked up' during the aftermath of conflict."But Christie's comments have not eased doubts from the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities.Mustafa Waziri, secretary-general of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, told Saudi Arabia's Arab News that more proof was needed to show that the bust was taken out of the country legally. The bust is suspected to have been stolen from the Karnak temple in Luxor, according to Egyptian officials. He vowed to stop the auction and called on the piece to be returned immediately.Earlier this year, the authorities recovered a cartouche of King Amenhotep I, which they said had been stolen and illegally smuggled out of Egypt. The item was recovered following searches of international auction websites. Officials said steps were then taken to stop the sale and withdraw the item at an unnamed London auction hall. It is unclear how the tablet fragment had been smuggled out of Egypt and into the United Kingdom."In recent years, Egypt, like China, is trying to strongly enforce patrimony laws to repatriate ancient treasures it sees as having been taken from it," Fox-Williams said. "If it comes to pass that the statue was smuggled out of the country more than a century ago, then this will provide a strong moral argument for its return."But he argued that law and morality "are not always the same thing and the moral case for repatriating an item back to the country where it originated is not the same as having a legal argument as to authentic ownership".

                LONDON - A brown quartzite head of young king Tutankhamen sold at auction in London for more than 4.7 million pounds on Thursday, in the face of Egyptian demands for its return.The more than 3,000-year-old sculpture, displayed at Christie's London auction house, shows the boy king taking the form of the ancient Egyptian god Amen.An unnamed buyer bought the head for 4,746,250 pounds ($5.97 million), including commission and in line with the estimated price before the sale, Christie's said.Outside, around 20 protesters stood silently and held placards that said "Egyptian history is not for sale".Egypt has long demanded the return of artefacts taken by archaeologists and imperial adventurers, including the Rosetta Stone kept in the British Museum - campaigns paralleled by Greece's demands for the Parthenon sculptures, Nigeria's for the Benin Bronzes and Ethiopia's for the Magdala treasures."We are against our heritage and valuable items (being) sold like vegetables and fruit," said Ibrahim Radi, a 69-year-old Egyptian graphic designer protesting outside Christie's.The 28.5 centimetres (11.22 inches) high piece, with damage only to the ears and nose, was sold from the private Resandro collection of Egyptian art.Christie's said it was acquired from Munich dealer Heinz Herzer in 1985. Before that, Austrian dealer Joseph Messina bought it in 1973-1974, and Germany's Prinz Wilhelm Von Thurn und Taxis "reputedly" had it in his collection by the 1960s.Hailing the piece as a "rare" and "beautiful" work, a Christie's statement acknowledged controversy over its home."We recognize that historic objects can raise complex discussions about the past, yet our role today is to work to continue to provide a transparent, legitimate marketplace upholding the highest standards for the transfer of objects."Before the auction, Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said he was disappointed the sale was going ahead, despite requests for information and protests from government officials and Egypt's embassy."I believe that it was taken out of Egypt illegally ... They have not presented any documents to prove otherwise," he told Reuters, saying that Egypt would continue to press the buyer and others for the work to be returned.Staff at Christie's said they had taken the necessary steps to prove its provenance and the sale was legitimate. "It's a very well known piece ... and it has never been the subject of a claim," antiquities department head Laetitia Delaloye told Reuters.Christie's had been in touch with Egyptian authorities in Cairo and the London embassy, she added.Reuters
