                Scientists want parents to teach their children about the importance of plants and to ensure they can recognize and name some, as part of a drive to raise awareness and better protect the world's flora, which is disappearing at an alarming rate.Researchers from the Royal Botanic Gardens in London and from Stockholm University issued the advice after releasing a report that says at least 571 plant species have disappeared in the last 250 years."Most people can name a mammal or bird that has become extinct in recent centuries, but few can name an extinct plant," said Aleys Humphreys, of Stockholm University, a co-author of the report published in the scientific journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.Humphreys said the rate of extinction among plants has been more than twice the rate among birds, mammals, and amphibians, which have lost a combined 217 species since 1750.The researchers said plants are going extinct at 500 times the speed they would have if humans did not exist.Co-author Eimear Nic Lughadha said: "Plants underpin all life on earth, they provide the oxygen we breathe and the food we eat, as well as making up the backbone of the world's ecosystems, so plant extinction is bad news for all species."Lughadha said millions of other species depend on plants, including humans, "so knowing which plants we are losing and from where will feed back into conservation programs".The Chile sandalwood, which was exploited for its aromatic qualities, the banded trinity plant, and the Saint Helena olive were among species lost.CNN said the report is the first to provide a comprehensive global overview of lost species of plant.Researchers found plants on islands, those in the tropics, and around the Mediterranean Sea were the most likely to succumb because those habitats tend to be home to rare species and are vulnerable to human activity.Maria Vorontsova, from the Royal Botanic Gardens, told the Guardian newspaper the 571 plants recorded as extinct only include discovered plants known to have been lost and not an estimate of plants that were made extinct before mankind noticed they existed, so the actual total would be higher."It is way more than we knew and way more than should have gone extinct," she said. "It is frightening, not just because of the 571 number but because I think that is a gross underestimate."But the report did have some good news: 430 species of plant that had historically been thought extinct were found to still exist, although 90 percent were at a "high extinction risk".The new study follows a United Nations report released in May that found 1 million of the planet's eight million species are threatened with extinction, mainly because of human activity.That report, by the UN's Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, said the rate of extinction worldwide "is already tens to hundreds of times higher than it has been, on average, over the past 10 million years".

                    East Lake greenway now a tourist hub
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Donghu Lake, or East Lake, in the east of Wuhan, Hubei province, has become popular among tourists and locals alike since the completion of greenway along the lake in February this year. The 102-kilometer greenway, with trees planted on the lakeside, connects islands, lakeside parks and nearby small ponds. The green stretch has been attracting families, marathon runners as well as elders, who would like to soak in the beauty of the place, go for walks or just limber up. The greenway project began in 2015. "Before, the road was used mainly by cars and big trucks that made the road bumpy and dusty. Now it has entirely changed," Zhang Lan, who lived by the lake, told Xinhua News Agency. The transformation was quick. Paved walkways, new benches and trees provided a "welcoming space" to people from all ages. The United Nations Human Settlements Programme, or UN-Habitat, and the Wuhan Land Use and Urban Spatial Planning Research Center started the greenway project to promote urban public spaces in China. It was focused on turning the largest urban lake in China into an integrated and people-friendly green space in the center of metropolitan Wuhan. The UN-Habitat is the UN program for human settlements and sustainable urban development. Since then, the greenway, with a 1.5-meter-wide walking lane and 6-meter-wide cycling lane, has hosted several marathons and cycling competitions, besides drawing nearly 40 million visitors since 2016, according to the administrative committee of the Wuhan East Lake Scenic Area. Greenways have been transforming cities across the country. The figures from the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development show that a total of 56,000 kilometers of greenway had been developed in China by the end of 2018. Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, is one of the first cities in the country to build a greenway, with an 80-km road specially designed for cycling in its Zengcheng district in 2008. Now, Guangzhou has a 3,500-km greenway network connecting 500 scenic spots in and around the city, Guangzhou's Forestry and Landscaping Bureau has said. It said Guangdong province took the lead in building the first greenway network in China in 2010, connecting parks and nature reserves in different cities, such as Zhuhai, Zhongshan and Dongguan, in the Pearl River Delta. Ma Xiangming, an urban planning engineer at Guangdong Urban and Rural Planning and Design Institute, said the greenways have given a big push for tourism in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, according to a report in the Southern Metropolis Daily. "Developing greenways along the river or lake banks helps protect environment as well as serve as leisure destinations," said Ma, who participated in the planning of the greenway network in the Pearl River Delta. In Shanghai, along the city's mother river, the Huangpu, a 45-km greenway was completed in 2018, turning the banks of the river into a long, green park. "We wanted people to get closer to the mother river," said Zhu Xiaojun, director of the Huangpu District Greenery Management Station's planning and construction department. Shanghai is currently working on connecting the separate stretches of greenway along the Suzhou Creek, another river that flows through the city. A part of it - in the Changning district - is expected to be completed by end of this year. Fang Yan, director of Shanghai's Landscaping and City Appearance Bureau, said, "Greenways have enabled citizens in big metropolitan cities to enjoy nature by connecting the once isolated green spaces." Zhao Jianrong, deputy supervisor at the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development's urban construction department, lauded the local governments in a news conference in March, saying they have played an active role in developing greenways, which helps to protect environment by changing people's lifestyles. "Greenways provide the right environment for cycling and walking. Once people experience healthy ways of getting around, it will be easier for them to maintain a greener lifestyle," Zhao said. xingyi@chinadaily.com.cn  People cycle on the greenway along Donghu Lake in Wuhan, Hubei province, in April.Zhou Guoqiang / For China Daily(China Daily Global 06/19/2019 page3)

                    Endangered Species Act plan stirs controversy
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The Trump administration on Monday unveiled plans to change the implementation of the Endangered Species Act, a move lauded by industry but strenuously opposed by environmental groups.Changes proposed by the US Interior Department are a rollback to the act credited with rescuing multiple endangered species in the US, notably the grey wolf and the bald eagle."These changes crash a bulldozer through the Endangered Species Act's lifesaving protections for America's most vulnerable wildlife," said Noah Greenwald, the Center for Biological Diversity's endangered species director.The new rules will change how the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration determine the status of animal species and for the first time allow economics to be considered.The revision also will change how the agencies designate critical habitats for an endangered species, changes that the department argued are "designed to increase transparency and effectiveness and bring the administration of the act into the 21st century"."An effectively administered act ensures more resources can go where they will do the most good: on-the-ground conservation," said Interior Secretary David Bernhardt.Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said the revision fits "squarely within the president's mandate of easing the regulatory burden on the American public, without sacrificing our species' protection and recovery goals".The new rules, which are expected to be published in the Federal Register this week and take effect 30 days after that, were the results of the Interior Department's July 2018 proposal aimed at "improving" the 1973 act, which protects more than 1,600 species in the US and its territories.Last September, a coalition of 10 state attorneys general submitted objections to the proposed rule changes, saying they were"in clear violation of the ESA's statutory language"."This effort to gut protections for endangered and threatened species has the same two features of most Trump administration actions: it's a gift to industry, and it's illegal," said Drew Caputo, vice-president of litigation for lands, wildlife and oceans at Earthjustice, an environmental law organization.Critics of the new rule focused on its introducing economic conditions into the listing decisions for species.The new rule removes the phrase "without reference to possible economic or other impacts" of determining endangered species and threatened species from the act, which requires such determinations to be made based on science.It brings "more transparency and certainty to the public about the way we'll carry out our job", said Gary Frazer, an assistant director at the US Fish and Wildlife Service, according to The Associated Press.The new rules also are accused of weakening protection for endangered animals threatened by climate change by redefining the concept of "foreseeable future" as "extends only so far into the future as the Services can reasonably determine that the conditions potentially posing a danger of extinction in the foreseeable future are probable".The Center for Biological Diversity said that the changes would prohibit the designation of critical habitats for species threatened by climate change.According to a UN report in May, climate change is one of the biggest drivers of change in nature. It is negatively impacting the distribution of almost half of land-based flightless mammals and nearly a quarter of threatened birds, the report said.Overall, critics argue that revisions announced on Monday would limit agencies' abilities to designate critical habitats for endangered or threatened animals, including those in need of moving to a new habitat as the previous one was under threat, and those needing a habitat for recovery.While critics have vowed to take the issue to court, multiple industries applauded the changes.The American Petroleum Institute said in a statement that the rules "clarify and improve the implementation of the Endangered Species Act through the reduction of duplicative and unnecessary regulations that ultimately bog down conservation efforts.""This is the most significant gain for property rights under the Endangered Species Act in decades," said Jonathan Wood, a senior attorney at Pacific Legal Foundation, a group representing landowners that challenged the agencies' designation of critical habitat."Because an endangered species' recovery meant no change in regulation, the rule undermined property rights and denied property owners any reward for helping that recovery," he said, adding that the new rule "aligns the incentives of landowners with the interests of species".Some called out Bernhardt, a former fossil fuel-industry lobbyist, for leading the development of such rules that fit with the overall "anti-wildlife rule-making pattern by the Trump administration", according to David J. Hayes, executive director of the State Energy & Environmental Impact Center at New York University and former Interior deputy secretary.
