                Xi, Conte hold talks on elevating China-Italy ties into new era
            </p>
            <p>
                ROME -- President Xi Jinping and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte held talks here Saturday on jointly elevating the China-Italy relations into a new era and witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to advance the construction of the Belt and Road.During their talks, Xi noted that the China-Italy relations are rooted in the history of the two countries' thousand-year-old exchanges, with strong public support.In recent years, the two countries have continuously deepened their communication and cooperation in various fields, which helped each other's social and economic development, Xi said.Calling China and Italy important strategic partners to each other, Xi urged both sides to view and handle the bilateral ties from a strategic height with long-term perspective.The two countries should take the opportunities of the 15th anniversary of the China-Italy comprehensive strategic partnership this year and the 50th anniversary of China-Italy diplomatic relations next year to jointly elevate bilateral relations into a new era, and allow their practical cooperation fruits in various fields better serve the two peoples, Xi said.With similar development goals, China and Italy have strong complementarity in economy and bright prospect of cooperation, the Chinese president said.China is willing to work with the Italian side to comprehensively expand and deepen bilateral ties, he said.Xi encouraged China and Italy to enhance top-level design, consolidate political basis, promote high-level exchanges, increase dialogue between various departments and on all levels, and continue to render mutual understanding and support on issues of each other's core interests and major concern.China and Italy were at the two ends of the ancient Silk Road, thus they have every reason to carry out cooperation on the Belt and Road, Xi said. "We adhere to the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, follow the principle of transparency and openness, and aim for cooperation of win-win results."He urged the two countries to take the opportunity of the inking of the intergovernmental MoU on jointly building the Belt and Road to strengthen the alignment of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with Italy's plan to develop its northern ports and the InvestItalia program, and promote mutually beneficial cooperation in all fields.The two countries should increase convergence of interests, optimize and upgrade their cooperation, and achieve more early results in priority areas such as space technology, infrastructure construction, transport, environment and energy, Xi said.China and Italy should also strengthen communication and coordination on macroeconomic policy and jointly push forward third-market cooperation in such fields as energy, finance and infrastructure construction, he said.Xi urged the two countries to take the opportunity of the culture and tourism year, to be held in each other's country in 2020, to forge friendly bonds of their world heritage sites and increase exchanges and cooperation between their museums, at local levels, and in sports and other sectors.China and Italy should also join hands in advocating trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, continue to strengthen communication on major issues such as the United Nations affairs, WTO reform, climate change and global governance, and safeguard multilateralism together, he said.The Chinese president noted that China sticks to further opening up and welcomes Italian and other countries' enterprises to invest and start business in China."We also encourage Chinese enterprises, especially high-tech companies, to invest and develop in Italy, and regard Italy as an important partner in cooperation on science and technology innovation," Xi told Conte.The Chinese government has always encouraged Chinese enterprises to conduct overseas cooperation according to business principles and international rules, and on the basis of abiding by local laws, Xi said, urging the Italian government to continue to provide good business environment for Chinese investors.Calling China and the European Union (EU) constructors of world peace, contributors to global development and protectors of international order, Xi said the two sides should follow the trend of the times featuring a world of multi-polarization and economic globalization, and push for the construction of an open world economy.He urged the two sides to accelerate the negotiations on a China-EU investment agreement, enhance the synergy of the BRI and the EU's development strategies, and boost communication and coordination on major international and regional issues.Xi said he hopes that the Italian side would continue to play an active role in deepening China-EU dialogue and cooperation in all fields and promote independent and stable development of China-EU ties.For his part, Conte said Xi's visit to Italy bears historic significance and will lead the Italy-China relations to a higher level.Noting that the two countries have a thousand-year-old history of exchanges, the Italian prime minister said the two ancient civilizations have interwoven with each other, with long-standing exchanges in economy, trade and culture, which served as an important foundation for the long-term development of their friendly cooperation.Italy attaches great importance to its relations with China, and is willing to deepen the Italy-China comprehensive strategic partnership and expand cooperation in such fields as economy, trade, energy, agriculture, culture, tourism and aviation, on the occasion of the upcoming 50th anniversary of their diplomatic ties, Conte said.With a special geographical advantage in building connectivity, Italy is glad to seize the historic opportunity in joining the Belt and Road construction, Conte said, adding that he strongly believes that it will help fully explore the potential of Italy-China cooperation.The prime minister said he is looking forward to attending the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, adding that Italy welcomes Chinese enterprises to invest in Italy and realize mutual benefit and win-win outcomes.Italy stands firm in supporting multilateralism and free trade, and ready to closely communicate and coordinate with China so as to promote healthy and stable development of EU-China ties, he said.After their talks, the two leaders witnessed the signing of multiple bilateral cooperation documents, including the MoU on jointly advancing the construction of the Belt and Road, and the document on the return of Chinese relics confiscated by Italy. They also paid a visit together to see the Chinese relics.Xi arrived in Rome Thursday for a state visit to Italy, the first stop of his three-nation Europe tour, which will also take him to Monaco and France.

                Full text of Xi's signed article in French newspaper
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING -- A signed article by Chinese President Xi Jinping titled "Move Together Toward Common Development" was published Saturday in leading French newspaper Le Figaro ahead of his state visit to the European country.An English version of the full text of the article is as follows:Move Together Toward Common DevelopmentXi JinpingPresident of the People's Republic of ChinaInvited by President Emmanuel Macron, I will soon pay my second state visit to France.Five years ago, in a balmy spring, I paid my first state visit to France as the two countries celebrated the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations. It gave us an opportunity to review the past, plan for the future and open up a new era of close and enduring comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries. Five years later, again in a blossoming spring season, I am to make another visit to France. I take great delight to see that the China-France relationship is beaming with vigor and spring.On this visit, I will bring with me goodwill toward France. Such goodwill is based on the admiration both from the Chinese people and from myself for the splendid history and culture and the unique charm that France has to offer. It is also inspired by how our two great cultures have engaged and illuminated each other. I will bring with me special friendship toward the French people. Such friendship is rooted in the long-standing friendly ties between our two countries, and reinforced by the closeness between our peoples with mutual respect and mutual trust. I will bring with me great expectations for further growth of our bilateral relationship. I find reasons for such expectations from our past 55 years of mutual support and win-win cooperation, and more so from the great potential and future prospects that our bilateral relations hold.-- We are making steadier progress in pushing our relations forward. I have built a good working relationship with President Macron through the exchange of meetings, phone calls and correspondence. The two sides have deepened political mutual trust, intensified high-level exchanges and maintained high-quality communication and coordination through the 30-plus dialogue and consultation mechanisms in the strategic, economic, financial, cultural and other fields. We have developed more common views on major international issues, carried out sound cooperation under the United Nations, the G20 and other frameworks, and jointly worked for peaceful settlement of regional hotspots, playing our important roles in upholding global peace, stability and development. By working together for the conclusion and implementation of the historic Paris Agreement, our two countries have led the way in the global response to climate change.-- We are making the pie of our converging interests bigger. In a short span of five years, our bilateral trade has expanded by more than 13 billion U.S. dollars, and mutual investment increased by over 20 billion dollars. French beef and other quality agricultural produce are becoming increasingly popular among Chinese consumers. The Taishan 1 nuclear reactor built under China-France collaboration has become the world's first EPR (European Pressurized Reactor) unit connected to grid. The Hinkley Point nuclear power plant, an iconic trilateral project between China, France and Britain, has got off to a good start. The China-France Oceanography Satellite (CFOSat) has entered into orbit. We are tapping our cooperation potential in sustainable development, finance, medicine and health, and other fields. As our cooperation in third markets grows, we are making good progress in jointly undertaking the Belt and Road Initiative.-- We are cementing the foundation of our friendship. With 102 pairs of sister provinces and cities, the two countries have developed a thick network of subnational exchanges and cooperation. In 2018, nearly 40,000 Chinese students were studying in France, more than 100,000 French students were studying Chinese, and a record number of Chinese tourists visited France. Paris has more direct flights to China than most other European cities. Like a myriad of small streams converging into a mighty river, the various close personnel and cultural exchanges have enriched our friendship.Spring is the sowing season. During my visit, in addition to reaping the fruits of our growing relationship over the past five years, I also look forward to the two sides working together to sow the seed of hope for future cooperation.As I said, China and France are special friends and win-win partners. The world is undergoing major changes rarely seen in a century and humanity stands at a critical stage of development. The challenges and risks we confront are ever more complex, and the opportunities we could grasp are just as unprecedented. As France's comprehensive strategic partner, China will continue to forge ahead with France shoulder to shoulder. I hope the two sides will seize the historic opportunity, meet challenges with joint efforts, and deepen strategic mutual trust in order to broaden the horizon for our common development and shared prosperity.To succeed in this endeavor, it is most important that we act out four key principles:Independence. Guided by a spirit of independence 55 years ago, China and France took the lead in breaking Cold War barriers and reached out to each other. We must stay true to this spirit as we face a fluid international situation and rising protectionism and unilateralism. We must stay the course instead of drifting with the tide. We must uphold our independence and show mutual respect, and continue to lead as an example for countries with different social systems, cultural backgrounds and stages of development to live side by side in friendship and cooperation. This way, we will contribute our share to multi-polarity and greater democracy in international relations.Openness and win-win. Both China and France are great nations that cherish the tradition of openness and the spirit of cooperation. China has carried out reform and opening-up for 40 years, and will only open wider in the future. I hope our two countries will continue to stand together to unequivocally reject protectionism, uphold an open world economy and make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all. China hopes to work with France to deepen all-round cooperation in the traditional areas of nuclear energy, aviation and aerospace, develop new areas of cooperation such as agriculture and technological innovation, and make greater headway in our cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative and in third markets. We welcome France to the China International Import Expo, and want to import more high-quality French products and services to meet the Chinese people's growing needs for a better life. We hope more French companies will choose to invest and do business in China to share in the country's development opportunities. We also hope to see Chinese businesses do better in France and contribute more to France's economic and social development.Inclusiveness and mutual learning. The progress of human history shows that exchanges and mutual learning between civilizations have made our world a more colorful place and provided a powerful underpinning for cooperation among countries and nations. As representatives of Eastern and Western cultures, China and France both celebrate the fine tradition of being open and inclusive. I hope our two countries will take bigger strides in our cooperation in culture, tourism, education, sports and youth affairs, and at the subnational level, and hope to see our cooperation play an exemplary role in driving the cultural and people-to-people exchanges between China and the West.A strong sense of responsibility. What has happened in the past 55 years shows that China and France, working together, could make a difference. At a time when humanity stands at a critical juncture of development, major countries must rise to the challenge. China and France are both permanent members of the UN Security Council. China hopes to strengthen coordination with France to safeguard multilateralism and uphold the basic norms governing international relations as underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. We need to join hands to tackle challenges, promote global prosperity and stability and build a community with a shared future for mankind.The Chinese believe that "a one-thousand-mile journey starts with the very first step," while Victor Hugo said "that little time is enough to change all things." We now stand at a new starting point. Let China and France join hands and set off in solid steps on a common journey toward new and greater achievements in China-France cooperation.

                The sisterhood of the rings
            </a>
            <p>
                Milanese jewelry brand Pomellato invited inspiring guests of various ages and backgrounds to convey a message of inclusiveness and sisterhood as part of the new "Pomellato Sisterhood Initiative" video and digital campaign.For the second year in a row, influencers including American actress Jane Fonda, Italian fashion blogger Chiara Ferragni, Chinese actress Ning Chang and the brand's CEO, Sabina Belli, participated in this program."To us, today is no different to 50 years ago. Women are always at the center of the Pomellato universe, and our original theme of female empowerment remains intact," Belli says.Founded in Milan in 1967, Pomellato puts empowering women at the heart of its manifesto."In the late 60s, women were carving their space in society and in the workplace. They needed clothes and jewelry to fit their new lives," Belli explains. "Pomellato listened to their needs and shook the conservative world of jewelry."Pomellato has since been known as a brand for women: 75 percent of the Milanese jeweler's work force is female, and the vast majority of its clientele are women buying jewelry for themselves.The brand first launched the #PomellatoForWomen campaign in 2017, on the occasion of Pomellato's 50th anniversary. The community, a communication platform of likeminded women, was designed to inspire others, highlight the importance of female leadership and promote a more authentic idea of natural beauty."We are crafting a sisterhood of women who think, feel and act differently," said Belli in the video.

                Wartime museum serves as grim reminder of atrocities

            <p>
                A facility in the suburbs of Beijing provides a bridge to the past and holds evidence of crimes committed by invading troops. Zhao Lei reports.Ouyang Min, a senior member of staff with the international cooperation team at the Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression in Beijing, said she is proud of her job because it gives her an opportunity to tell people outside China about what happened to her country just a few generations ago during World War II."During an exhibition we held at the Belarusian State Museum of the History of the Great Patriotic War in Minsk, a family from Russia told me that the only reason they had travelled to Minsk was to see our exhibition," Ouyang said. "They said they were very interested in the history of the war, but couldn't find sufficient materials in Russia."

                On the road from past to future
            </a>
            <p>
                Two decades ago I first came to China, just at the right time to experience the 50th anniversary of People’s Republic of China in Guangzhou. Out of the past 20 years I’ve spent seven living and working in China, first for an international German sports company for two years, later after a long break in Europe I joined a Chinese supplier company for the international sports industry. Twenty years ago it was unimaginable for a Westerner to work in a local Chinese company. Today, it is a common sight. I am welcome to contribute to the growth of China, and Chinese companies are becoming global companies and brands. Our HAPTIC 3D textile coating company is a great example how Chinese companies are setting up globally leading B2B brands. What a rapid change and great development! Business environment and Chinese people are opening up to international experience and global exposure.However, you can still find the traditional old Chinese culture and lifestyle, especially in the rural country side. Recently I managed to get the driving license for motorbikes, a difficult challenge for a foreigner as the test is conducted in Chinese language. I love motorbikes because they allow so much more contact with nature. You feel the wind, the rain, the sunshine, the temperature and the smell of the air every kilometer you drive. You are connected with your environment and still have a tool to explore the country and discover areas not everybody can easily go. Immediately after I got the license I bought a nice Chinese Zhongshen 450 cc adventure motorbike. I wanted to get a Chinese brand, something that really connects me to the Chinese development, not an established Western or Japanese motorbike brand where the quality is good but but price is high.After buying the bike my life has changed. Suddenly I feel much more integrated into Chinese life. And much more independent. I can take it and go wherever I like, whenever I like. My bike is a kind of adventure bike, in our city of Putian it appears to be a very big bike. Most of the people drive small 125 cc “working horses” but not fun bikes. My bike is made not only for transportation but also for enjoying life and exploring the country. And I feel this is an enormous trend in China. Chinese people are getting to a point where they want more than only working hard, making money and enjoying family life. Many Chinese now start looking for new experience, not only work experience but also new life experience. Outdoor sports for example are growing fast. Sport overall is growing fast. People realize that beside work you need some activity to keep your body and mind healthy.Something you really enjoy and something which teaches you a new experience and connects you better to your environment and the world you are living in. For me, driving my motorbike is one part of it – and I can meet more and more Chinese adventure motorbike drivers feeling the same. When I take my motorbike and ride out of the city into the mountain regions of Fujian province there is not only great nature to experience. Sometimes I stop in small villages, buy water in a local shop or some food in a small restaurant. And every time I do so I experience so much friendship, lovely people who are interested to connect although language is still a big barrier.Anyway, all of us can feel that we all are nice people from different parts of the world and happy to meet. And happy to exchange a few minutes of our life. People in the countryside are often not familiar with such type of adventure motorbikes and may not fully understand the purpose but they can feel it is something special and great. They can feel that I am bringing a message from future to them. We all live together here on this planet, we all enjoy meeting each other in peace and friendship, and we are hoping the future will bring us communication tools making it easy for us to connect and exchange our experience and thinking. Friendly people on the way invite me for a cup of tea and often we spend an hour enjoying the tea and trying to exchange some information. Not always you need to talk a lot.Sometimes you can just feel that all the talking about cultural differences is pretty much exaggerated. On the ground level of living together we are 90 percent the same, we all have the same dreams, happy family, good food, peaceful and exciting life. Why most of the time we talk about the small differences and why these small differences sometimes make daily life so complicated? International exchange and friendship helps to see the real importance of focusing on people. Connecting by opening up, by trusting you can find friends in every corner of the world. Exploring, understanding and respecting the little differences is the best way forward to future. My motorbike is a tiny small step enabling international experience on a very personal level. Arriving back at home in Putian I always feel to this day that I have connected a little bit with the world. I have planted a seed to grow friendship between our different cultures. And I am looking forward to the next weekend for the next adventure.Thomas Schmidt is the director of innovation and RSL at Huafeng company in Putian, Fujian province.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                Chery Jaguar Land Rover makes plans to shake up luxury car market
            </a>
            <p>
                British premium carmaker Jaguar Land Rover and its Chinese joint venture with Chery Automobile plan to launch many high-quality products, in efforts to lead the upgrade of China's luxury car market.A joint brand day of Jaguar Land Rover China and Chery Jaguar Land Rover was launched in Chengdu, Sichuan province, early this month where some updated models were unveiled.The new Jaguar XEL made its debut in Chengdu with a new interior, upgraded materials and technologies. The Jaguar F-Pace Checkered Flag and F-Pace 300 Sport, Range Rover 50th Anniversary edition and Range Rover Sport SVR of the British premium carmaker's luxury sub-brand Special Vehicle Operations were also showcased.Murray Dietsch, president of Chery Jaguar Land Rover, and Chris Chen, vice-president of Chery Jaguar Land Rover, introduce the new XEL in Chengdu.In August, Jaguar Land Rover exceeded the monthly sales target with an increase of 17 percent year-on-year. The figure was 40 percent in July.Pan Qing, a board member of Jaguar Land Rover and executive director of Jaguar Land Rover China said: "By the end of 2021, Jaguar Land Rover will launch 30 new and updated models in China to provide more exciting experiences and services for customers in the world's largest auto market."In an interview at the auto show, Murray Dietsch, president of Chery Jaguar Land Rover, said that the joint venture is always listening to voices in the Chinese market and customers. It is also doing lots of research to learn about policies and market trends, which helps to integrate localized voices with global system strength.An example is that WeChat, a part of Chinese customers' daily lives but little-known in other countries, must be integrated with vehicle information systems, Dietsch added.Chery Jaguar Land Rover has operated its world-leading intelligent manufacturing system and produced localized products in its Changshu plant, Jiangsu province.The plant is a model of Jaguar Land Rover operations worldwide. It ranks top in terms of interaction technology, efficiency, quality and operation management, according to Chris Chen, vice-president of Chery Jaguar Land Rover.The plant has two phases in operation, which can produce 200,000 vehicles annually. It can also handle more than 300,000 individual options to meet customers' requirements.One of the highlights is that the Changshu plant has introduced Jaguar Land Rover's world-leading aluminum technology. It is China's first purpose-built aluminum body shop.An aluminum body can provide a lighter and stronger solution with the advantages of fuel saving and flexible control performance, said Chen."To bring the all-aluminum body to China, we brought the requirements of the aluminum supply chain to the country and drove a large number of suppliers, which also contributes a lot to China's auto industry," he added.The aluminum body workshop has 344 robots, 232 among which are self-piercing, riveting robots.The welding workshop can finish one car body in two minutes and has introduced laser as well as radar-based tools to ensure precision in production.The assembly workshop has adopted an advanced pick-to-voice system, which guides workers to sort materials via voice control.The system has helped improve material sorting efficiency by 20 percent.To deliver a solution that is flexible, more efficient and electric-ready, the plant uses Premium Transverse Architecture, or PTA, which is the latest manufacturing platform independently developed by Jaguar Land Rover.The internet of things has been widely applied in the plant. The advanced radio frequency identification system, or RFID, is used in welding, painting, assembly and logistics processes, to ensure traceability of production and quality control."We also have built a quality management system that covers procedures from planning to the process of supervision and post-sale feedback to solve and prevent potential quality problems," Chen said.The Changshu plant is also home to Jaguar Land Rover's only engine plant outside the United Kingdom. The plant produces the family of its Ingenium engines, including the Ingenium 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines for localized models, which boast outstanding performance and good fuel economy.The facility set a record when its engine plant started production within 32 months of vehicle production on the same site.The company said that the third phase of the plant is on schedule, which will improve the production and R&D capacity.Last December, Chery Jaguar Land Rover unveiled its Design Studio in Shanghai to better learn about and reflect the voice of China in its product design.In the future, the studio will design models especially for China auto market, which is an important part of the company's strategy plan.caoyingying@chinadaily.com.cn(China Daily 09/16/2019 page19)
