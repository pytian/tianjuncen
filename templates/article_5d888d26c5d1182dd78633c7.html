                Convenience stores team up with Chinese brands for PRC's 70th anniversary
            </a>
            <p>
                Jianlibao drinks packaged in panda paintings and White Rabbit milk on convenience store shelves are part of a new campaign involving more than 40,000 convenience stores to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.Stores such as Good Neighbors CVS have updated their shelves with banners featuring Chinese elements and characteristics to create a celebratory atmosphere with shoppers.The move is considered a joint effort between local brands and the retail sector to bring local brands closer to young consumers in China.Pei Liang, head of the China Chain-Store and Franchised Association, said in the past three years, the number and revenue of convenience stores have seen double-digit growth, ahead of general growth in the retail industry."In less than ten years, the market scale of the convenience store sector will exceed 2 trillion yuan, a significant channel for the Chinese retail industry," said Pei."The move to align with Chinese local brands with a massive network of convenience stores is to boost the development of local brands and reach more young consumers in the country," said Pesi.Jianlibao Group Co, which has embraced traditional Chinese packaging, has enjoyed major sales success, said Wang Yi, general manager of Jianlibao's marketing department, a brand that has grown into a leading domestic beverage giant thanks to the reform and opening-up policy."It is a new way to work with a convenience store network – how to revitalize our brand is our priority," Wang said.
