                Beijing's global influence grows amid its world-class aspirations
            </p>
            <p>
                Capital has drawn international events, high passenger traffic, Fortune 500 firms Beijing is experiencing growing international influence as the city accelerates efforts to become a world-class metropolis that is harmonious and livable, senior officials said on Thursday. Chen Jining, mayor of Beijing, said at a news conference held by the State Council Information Office that the city has witnessed tremendous historical changes over the past 70 years. "With the improved functions of the 'four centers', the city has taken on a brand-new look," he said. In 2014, President Xi Jinping gave clear guidance on "what kind of capital we are building and how to build it" by propping up the "four centers" as Beijing's major functions - namely the national political, cultural, international communication and scientific innovation centers. In past years, Beijing has significantly improved its capability in delivering quality service for major national affairs and events. The city has also raised its cultural service level by increasing the number of libraries, museums, shows and exhibitions. Based on its rich technological resources and huge talent pool, Beijing has boosted innovation capabilities by putting 6.17 percent of its GDP into scientific research. The city has contributed to more than half of all China's major world-leading technological breakthroughs, Chen said. More importantly, Beijing has gained more international influence through its efforts. "The city is now more comprehensively open to the world," Chen said. In the past few years, Beijing has successfully held many international events such as the 22nd APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation and the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, which have exhibited China's confidence to the world. The Beijing Daxing International Airport, which will begin service by the end of this month, will help Beijing enter the "dual-pivot" air transport era. The Beijing Capital International Airport has ranked second in the world for years in terms of passenger traffic, with annual visits exceeding 100 million. In the business sector, 56 Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in Beijing, according to the municipal authority. Beijing is also home to 30,000 foreign institutions and the headquarters of major international organizations such as the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank. The capital has been working on improving its business climate for both foreign and domestic companies. According to the World Bank, Beijing has made a significant contribution to China's advancement in the global ranking for the ease of doing business in its Doing Business Report in 2018. "At present, we humans are facing some crucial challenges that require the world's scientists to work in cooperation," Chen said. "Beijing welcomes scientists from all over the world to settle down in the city to do their research." Lin Keqing, executive deputy mayor of the capital, said Beijing is about to become the first city to have hosted both the summer and winter Olympic Games as of 2022, and the city will strengthen communication and cooperation with other international cities in many sectors through the opportunities brought by the Games. "The Games will be green and open," he said. dujuan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 09/20/2019 page4)

                COMAC says production of C919 to start later this year
            </a>
            <p>
                Move will help aviation industry get involved in global supply chain systemCommercial Aircraft Corp of China, the manufacturer of China's first home-built narrow-body passenger jet C919, said it will start manufacturing the first aircraft later this year and it aims to get airworthiness certification and deliver to China Eastern Airlines in two to three years.Now, four C919 test jets－the 101,102, 103 and 104 prototypes－are in intense flying tests, static tests and other ground tests at test bases including Yanliang district in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, Dongying in Shandong province, and Nanchang in Jiangxi province. Another two new test jets, the 105 and 106, will be put into tests within this year. So far, 815 orders have been placed for the C919 from home and abroad."The manufacturing of the C919 will help the Chinese aviation industry to be involved in the world's supply chain system of large aircraft, and China will be able to acquire valuable experience," said Wang Yanan, editor-in-chief of Aerospace Knowledge magazine."The C919 still needs to undergo several tests to showcase that it is a safe, fuel-efficient, and convenient aircraft. The Chinese aviation industry could transform from a manufacturing giant to an innovation power," he said.Meanwhile, the CR929 long-range wide-body aircraft, which is co-developed by China and Russia, has finished conceptual designs, and now it is in the stage of selecting suppliers."Aero engine makers General Electric Aviation of the United States and Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc of the United Kingdom, among others, are in the bidding process, and we will announce the result at a later stage," Yang Yang, deputy general manager of marketing and sales at COMAC, said at the ongoing Aviation Expo China in Beijing on Wednesday.The CR929 will mainly target markets in China, Russia and other Asia-Pacific countries. Its competing models include the Airbus'A330 and Boeing's B787.Besides, the ARJ21, China's first home built regional passenger jetliner, has already been put into use with 15 aircraft by Chengdu Airlines and Genghis Khan Airlines. In August, three major State-owned airlines－Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines－each ordered 35 new ARJ21 aircraft, indicating the model will start all-around commercial use in the country."The market for the ARJ21 is better than we expected. We have an order of 596 aircraft, and about 200 of them have been put into production plan. Now, we have two production lines in Shanghai," Yang said."With a growing demand from customers, we will be able to expand the annual capacity to about 50 in total. We are also looking at the opportunities to export the aircraft to Southeast Asian countries and Africa," he said.In late August, the ARJ21 aircraft undertook a three-day demonstration flight in Southwest China, to showcase its performance in plateau areas. COMAC said the plateau market would become an important growth segment for the aircraft, as the model is suitable to fly in highland areas.Separately, COMAC released its forecast for China's aviation market in the next 20 years on Wednesday. It predicted Chinese airlines would need 10,344 airplanes by 2038. Boeing released its forecast on Tuesday and raised its forecast for China, saying that over the next 20 years, Chinese carriers will need 8,090 new airplanes.

                Riyadh joins US-led coalition after attack
            </a>
            <p>
                Pompeo heads to Saudi Arabia amid fallout from strikes blamed on TeheranDUBAI, United Arab Emirates - Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday it joined a United States-led coalition to secure the Middle East's waterways after an attack targeting its crucial oil industry.Riyadh's decision to enter the International Maritime Security Construct came ahead of a planned visit by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo from Wednesday.Saudi officials separately planned to share information about the weapons used to attack a Saudi oil field and the world's largest crude oil processing plant on Saturday.Yemen's Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack, but the US and Saudi Arabia say they suspect Iran carried out the assault. Iran denies that, though it came amid a summer of heightened tensions between Teheran and Washington over its unraveling nuclear deal with world powers.The state-run Saudi Press Agency carried a statement on Wednesday quoting an unnamed official saying the kingdom had joined the International Maritime Security Construct.Australia, Bahrain and the United Kingdom already have joined the mission."The kingdom's accession to this international alliance comes in support of regional and international efforts to deter and counter threats to maritime navigation and global trade in order to ensure global energy security and the continued flow of energy supplies to the global economy and contribute to maintain the international peace and security," the statement read.US military officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.The coalition aims to secure the broader Persian Gulf region. It includes surveillance of the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of the world's oil travels, and the Bab el-Mandeb, another narrow strait that connects the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden off Yemen and East Africa. Smaller patrol boats and other craft will be available for rapid response. The plan also allows for nations to escort their own ships through the region.The US Navy already has sent Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers to chokepoint positions, like either end of the Strait of Hormuz. There, they observe ship traffic and monitor for anything unusual as drones and other aircraft fly surveillance routes overhead.The US blames Iran for the apparent limpet mine explosions on four vessels in May and a further two in June that were sailing in the Gulf of Oman near the Strait of Hormuz, something Iran denies being behind. Iran also seized a British-flagged oil tanker and another based in the United Arab Emirates.It's unclear what role Saudi Arabia will play in the coalition. Bahrain already serves at the headquarters of the US Navy's 5th Fleet.Wednesday's announcement also came after Saudi Arabia's energy minister said late on Tuesday that more than half of the country's daily crude oil production that was knocked out by the attack had been recovered and that production capacity at its targeted plants would be fully restored by the end of the month."Where would you find a company in this whole world that went through such a devastating attack and came out like a phoenix?" Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said about state-owned Saudi Aramco, which was the target of the attacks. His question to reporters, many of them Saudi, drew applause.Prince Abdulaziz said Aramco will honor its commitments to its customers this month by drawing from its reserves of crude oil and offering additional crude production from other oil fields. He said production capacity would reach up to 11 million barrels a day by the end of September and 12 million barrels in November.He said production at the Abqaiq processing facility is at 2 million barrels per day.Oil prices spiked on Monday, with benchmark Brent crude having the biggest percentage gain since the 1991 Gulf War. Prices dropped on Tuesday around the time of the Saudi announcement. Brent traded on Wednesday morning around the same prices as the day before, with a barrel costing over $64.Pompeo was due to land in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, where he was scheduled to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Pompeo later will travel to the United Arab Emirates on Thursday to meet with Abu Dhabi's crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Both nations are US allies and have been fighting against the Houthis in Yemen since March 2015.Agencies
