                Editor's note: Four employees of Haier Group, China's largest home appliances manufacturer, were fired for taking a nap during their lunch break, which sparked heated discussions online. Haier later issued a notice on its platform saying the four employees did not take a nap during break time, but slept in public reception areas during working hours. This, the company claimed, violated Haier's employee code of conduct and their contracts should be terminated. Should employees be fired for taking a nap at work? Readers share their opinions.thunderbird (Canada)No one should be napping on company time. If discovered, such behavior is subject to disciplinary action. In some severe cases, repeated misconduct may lead to termination of employment (in some Canadian government establishments). I agree with the manager, no one should be sleeping on their job.

                Zhang Ziyang is hoping to see his career continue to rise. Cheng Si reports.Winning a bronze medal at the 45th WorldSkills Competition in Kazan, Russia, in late August was not a finale for Zhang Ziyang, who was involved in the baking event, but a fresh start for his career."I think some time or another, I will win the world baking championship, but there is still a long way to go, requiring greater efforts and patience," the 20-year-old said.Zhang, from the Wang Sen Institute of Western Cuisine in Suzhou, in the eastern province of Jiangsu, first came into contact with WorldSkills when he acted as a volunteer for his school's trials for the 2017 competition, which was held in Abu Dhabi."Back then, I thought the competition was really cool and amazing, and I hoped that one day I would be one of the competitors on the world stage," he said.Zhang said his poor academic performance in junior high school led his parents to send him to his uncle's bakery to learn how to make cakes at age 16."Academic studying won't bring me a good life; maybe cakes can," he said, laughing. "Initially, I didn't like learning to bake because I had no patience for the work. But gradually, I found it really interesting because delicious desserts can make customers happy."Having followed master bakers for a year, Zhang won a place at the institute in 2016 to learn how to make bread.

                SHANGHAI-The Shanghai Tourism Festival, which opened on Saturday night, has borne witness to China's development and the upgrading of people's consumption patterns since it was first staged in 1990.Twenty-five floats representing well-known Chinese tourist destinations such as Nanjing and Suzhou in Jiangsu province, and 32 performance groups from 19 countries and regions, including Germany, Switzerland and France, participated in dance and music shows in downtown Shanghai that attracted some 300,000 spectators.The 2019 festival, running to Oct 6, will feature 100 activities, including some for overseas travelers. An exhibition of folk cultures from countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative will also be held. Dozens of tourist sites, museums and galleries in Shanghai will offer half-price admission during the event.The first tourism festival in Shanghai attracted half a million tourists from home and abroad, while last year's attracted 12.7 million. As people's living standards have improved remarkably, tourism is not a luxury any more, but a necessity for many."In 1995, the company rewarded me with a trip to Hainan. I was so proud and cherished it very much," a 54-year-old Shanghai taxi driver recalled. "Now, our income has increased a lot and travel has become routine for most people who are willing to spend their own money to relax."Thirty years ago, there was a lack of ideal tourism resources, said Lu Guojun, a clerk with Shanghai Huangpu River Cruise Group, citing the swaths of cropland along the eastern coast of the river that flows through the city center.In recent years, with improved infrastructure and rapid development of the service economy, more companies have joined the development of river tourism, Lu said.Dai Bin, president of the China Tourism Academy in Beijing, said people's aspirations for a better life led to high expectations of tourism quality.In August, China issued a guideline to unleash the consumption potential of culture and tourism.On Friday, Shanghai signed agreements with six cities and regions, including Budapest, Phnom Penh and Bangkok, to boost culture and tourism exchanges.Culture and tourism promote mutual friendship and understanding, said Yu Xiufen, head of the Shanghai Municipal Administration of Culture and Tourism.Domestic tourists made 5.54 billion trips last year, up 10.8 percent year-on-year, and the total number of inbound and outbound tourists reached 291 million, up 7.8 percent.Total tourism revenue reached 5.97 trillion yuan ($842.7 billion) last year, up 10.5 percent, data from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism showed.

                NANJING - Blue-algae is still "a snake in the grass" in Taihu Lake, as the pollution treatment program in China's third-largest freshwater lake has entered its 13th year, according to the government in east China's Jiangsu Province.The provincial departments of finance and environmental protection said the annual budget of 2 billion yuan (282 million U.S. dollars) has been appropriated for the lake pollution treatment since 2007. By the end of this year, the total funding would reach 26 billion yuan.Water sample tests at 137 monitoring sites on the lake in 2018 showed the water quality of 94.2 percent of them is on par with the national Level IV standard.China classifies water quality into six levels, from level I, which is suitable for drinking after minimal treatment, to level VI, which is severely polluted.Taihu, located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze, China's longest river, suffered a severe outbreak of blue-algae, or cyanobacteria, in 2007, due to contamination from sewer drains.Although not poisonous, the algae bloom decimates fish and pollutes the lake, an important water source for 17 million residents.The Jiangsu provincial government said algal blooms are still a potential threat as they are likely to happen under conditions of rising temperatures, reduced wind speeds and a high concentration of nutrients.This year's pollution treatment funding is expected to be used to launch ecological restoration projects, build new water pipes of more than 400 km, boost the local sewage treatment capacity by 150,000 tonnes a day, and reduce agricultural pollution surrounding the lake.
