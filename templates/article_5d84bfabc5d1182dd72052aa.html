                US and Iran should be guided by reason
            </p>
            <p>
                Continuing to blame Iran for Saturday's attacks on two Saudi Arabian oil facilities, Washington is mulling imposing fresh sanctions on Teheran. But without foolproof evidence to support its action, the United States would put the cart before the horse if it announced new sanctions against Iran. That the news of the US considering such a move can increase the already high tensions in the Middle East is evident in Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif raising the specter of an "all-out war", and stressing that if the US or Saudi Arabia attacked Iran, it would have to fight to its last soldier. True, the attacks on the major Saudi facilities have shrunk the country's oil production almost by half and hiked global oil prices, sparking grave concerns over global oil supply. But the developments should prompt the US to more seriously consider the possible spillover effects of another punitive action against Iran on the regional situation and the world economy. Ignoring any such rational thinking, however, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the attacks an "act of war" against Saudi Arabia after Riyadh displayed missile and drone wreckage on Wednesday and other evidence claiming the raids were "unquestionably sponsored by Iran". Unfortunately, Pompeo's remark raises the fear of the US using military measures against Iran. Given Iran's pivotal location, that would affect global oil supply, not to mention there is no guarantee the US' move will not ignite, unwittingly or otherwise, the powder keg that the region has become. Judging by US President Donald Trump's remarks, it seems he understands the grave risk Washington would be taking by triggering another war in the Middle East. To be fair to Iran, it is not responsible for the current situation. The main cause of the tensions is the US' withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal despite the International Atomic Energy Agency saying Teheran had fully complied with the multilateral deal. Yet, amid rising tensions, both parties seem to have left some room for reconciliation. While the White House has not ruled out a meeting with Iran's top leader, Zarif said Iran hoped to avoid conflict, adding that Teheran was willing to hold talks with Riyadh, and the possibility of a return to negotiations with the US depends on whether Washington would provide full sanctions relief as promised under the 2015 nuclear deal. In the long run, therefore, keeping the Iranian nuclear deal alive, and ensuring it is implemented both in letter and spirit, is the only viable way of resolving the US-Iran conflict and defusing the tensions in the Middle East.

                Trump confirms U.S. will revoke California waiver to require cleaner cars
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed Wednesday the Environmental Protection Agency will revoke California's waiver that allows it to require automakers to build cleaner vehicles than federal requirements demand - a move that will set off a massive legal battle.Reuters and other outlets reported Tuesday the administration was set to formally announce the decision as early as Wednesday. The Trump administration will announce in the coming weeks a separate rule to roll back Obama-era fuel efficiency standards.Trump urged automakers to back the action, but so far none have publicly supported revocation of  California's authority. "Automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to California, you will be out of business," Trump wrote on Twitter.(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)

                Trump bars California from setting auto emissions rules, setting up court fight
            </a>
            <p>
                President Donald Trump says his administration is pulling a waiver that allows California to set its own auto emissions standards. California has already promised to fight the Trump administration move.President Donald Trump said Wednesday that his administration is barring California from setting its own auto emissions standards, setting up a fresh struggle over the president's push to unravel restrictions on businesses.In tweets announcing the move, Trump said the White House "is revoking" a federal waiver that allowed the state to craft its own rules on greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. The president argued he blocked California's ability to do so "in order to produce far less expensive cars for the consumer, while at the same time making the cars substantially SAFER."He also contends "there will be very little difference in emissions" under federal rules his administration plans to release than under standards California agreed to with automakers.Trump took the step over the protests of Democratic officials and activists in California, who argue it inhibits efforts to fight climate change and improve public health. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has said the state would file a lawsuit to stop the Trump administration from pulling its waiver."Our message to those who claim to support states' rights: Don't trample on ours," Becerra told reporters Wednesday. He added: "We're prepared to lead, we're prepared to fight. We'll do what we must."Speaking to reporters Wednesday, the state's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, said, "We are the pace car, as it relates to environmental stewardship." But he said his state is "dealing with an administration that lays claim, and a Republican Party that lays claim, to supporting free enterprise. The irony of that shouldn't be lost on anyone."The Trump administration's actions are "not free enterprise," Newsom said. "That's not about states' rights. That's about bullying and intimidation."Trump has moved to dial back Obama-era carbon greenhouse gas rules as he contends the restrictions have held back American businesses. In his tweets Wednesday, he pitched his latest move as a way to create a "new and uniform standard" and boost job growth."Automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to California, you will be out of business," Trump claimed, without citing why the state's rule would have put automakers out of business.Critics say his plans turn a blind eye to the dire threat posed by climate change.The Trump administration is set to announce proposals to set looser standards for auto emissions than those sought by his predecessor. In July, California signed a deal with BMW, Ford, Honda and Volkswagen that would set tougher standards than those desired by Trump.The automakers prepared to make cars nationwide that would meet the state's restrictions. Regulators under Trump have supported keeping emissions standards for new cars and trucks at 2020 levels through 2026, according to Reuters."A balanced fuel economy regulation is critical for the health of the U.S. auto industry," the Association of Global Automakers said in a statement. The group continued its call for a "unified national standard that continues the industry's significant progress in improving motor vehicle fuel economy, and that rewards investments in next-generation fuel-savings technologies."Ahead of Trump's announcement Wednesday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., criticized the administration's proposal. She said she "strongly" support Becerra's decision to go to court "to stop this ill-advised move."House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters that he hoped the state would side with the president, as he does not think the country should have more than one emissions standard.On Wednesday, UCLA School of Law environmental law expert Julia Stein wrote that "the administration is barreling forward into unprecedented territory ... where it will find itself on shaky footing from both a policy and a legal perspective.""It's just not smart policy. It's also unprecedented, unauthorized by the Clean Air Act, and unsupported by prior agency and court decisions," wrote Stein, project director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the UCLA School of Law.The fight is only the latest between California and the Trump administration. The state has already sued the administration dozens of times, over issues including the president's ban on travelers from several predominantly Muslim countries and his efforts to build barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.— CNBC's Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report.

                WRAPUP 5-Trump orders more Iran curbs, Saudi shows attack evidence
            </a>
            <p>
                * U.S., Saudi blame Tehran for unprecedented strike on oil plants* Attack exposes gaps in Riyadh's air defences* Oil prices fall on Saudi reassurances of restoring output* "We don't want conflict", says Iran's presidentJEDDAH/DUBAI, Sept 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he ordered a major increase in sanctions on Iran as Saudi Arabia displayed remnants of drones and missiles it said Tehran used in a crippling weekend attack on its oil facilities.Trump gave no explanation in a brief Twitter posting announcing the order, but the initiative follows repeated U.S. assertions that the Islamic Republic was behind Saturday's attack on the kingdom, a close U.S. ally."I have just instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to substantially increase sanctions on the country of Iran!," he wrote.Iran, however, again denied involvement in the Sept. 14 raids, which hit the world's biggest crude processing facility and initially knocked out half of Saudi production."They want to impose maximum ... pressure on Iran through slander," Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said."We don't want conflict in the region ... Who started the conflict?" he added, blaming Washington and its Gulf allies for the war in Yemen.Yemen's Houthi movement, an ally of Iran battling a Western-backed, Saudi-led coalition for more than four years, has claimed responsibility and said it used drones to assault state oil company Aramco's sites.However, the Saudi Defence Ministry held a news conference, displaying drone and missile debris it said was "undeniable" evidence of Iranian aggression. A total of 25 drones and missiles were used in the attacks launched from Iran not Yemen, the ministry spokesman added.Saturday's attack exposed the vulnerability of Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure and threw down a gauntlet to the United States, which wants to curb Tehran's influence in the region.Proof of Iranian responsibility could pressure Riyadh and Washington into a response, though both nations were stressing the need for caution.Trump has said he does not want war and is coordinating with Gulf and European states.Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the hit on the world's biggest crude exporter was a "real test of the global will" to confront subversion of the international order.His envoy to London, Prince Khalid bin Bander, told the BBC the attack was "almost certainly" Iranian-backed, however: "We're trying not to react too quickly because the last thing we need is more conflict in the region.""COMPELLING EVIDENCE"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was to meet Prince Mohammed in Jeddah on Wednesday to discuss the crisis before heading to the United Arab Emirates.U.N. officials monitoring sanctions on Iran and Yemen were also heading to Saudi Arabia to investigate.France, which is trying to salvage an international nuclear deal with Iran that Washington quit last year, said it wanted to establish the facts before reacting.A U.S. official told Reuters the strikes originated in southwestern Iran. Three officials said they involved cruise missiles and drones, indicating a higher degree of complexity and sophistication than initially thought.The officials did not provide evidence or explain what U.S. intelligence they were using for evaluating the attack, which cut 5% of global production.Saudi Arabia said on Tuesday the 5.7 million barrels per day of output lost would be fully restored by the end of the month.Oil prices fell after the Saudi reassurances, having surged more than 20% at one point on Monday - the biggest intra-day jump since the 1990-91 Gulf War.Saudi Arabia's finance minister told Reuters on Wednesday the attack had no impact on revenues and Aramco was continuing to supply markets without interruption.U.S. efforts to bring about a U.N. Security Council response look unlikely to succeed as Russia and China have veto powers and are expected to shield Iran.Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has offered to sell Riyadh defence systems, called for a "thorough and impartial" probe during a phone call with Prince Mohammed.The assault exposed serious gaps in Saudi air defences despite billions of dollars spent on Western military hardware and repeated attacks on vital assets during its four-and-a-half year foray into the Yemen war."The attack is like Sept. 11th for Saudi Arabia, it is a game changer," said one Saudi security analyst.IRAN-U.S. CONFLICTAlready frayed U.S.-Iran ties deteriorated further when Trump quit the nuclear pact and reimposed sanctions, severely hurting the Iranian economy. Iran has ruled out talks with Washington unless it returns to the pact.Trump said he is not looking to meet Rouhani during a U.N. event in New York this month. Rouhani and his foreign minister may not attend the General Assembly at all unless U.S. visas are issued in the coming hours, state media reported Wednesday.Washington and its Gulf allies want Iran to stop supporting regional proxies, including in Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon.Despite years of air strikes against them, the Houthi movement boasts drones and missiles able to reach deep into Saudi Arabia, the result of an arms race since the Western-backed coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015.Iran's clerical rulers support the Houthis, who ousted Yemen's internationally recognised government from power in the capital Sanaa in late 2014. But Tehran denies it actively supports them with military and financial support.Iran maintains the largest ballistic and cruise missile capabilities in the Middle East that could overwhelm virtually any Saudi missile defence system, according to think-tank CSIS, given the geographic proximity of Tehran and its proxy forces.But even more limited strikes have proved too much for Saudi Arabia, including recent ones claimed by the Houthis on a civilian airport, oil pumping stations and the Shaybah oilfield.(Reporting by Parisa Hafezi in Dubai and Stephen Kalin in Jeddah; Additional reporting by Guy Faulconbridge in London, Michelle Nichols in New York, Rania El Gamal, Davide Barbuscia and Marwa Rashad in Riyadh, Asma Alsharif and Sylvia Westall in Dubai, Alaa Swilam and Hisham El Saba in Cairo, Maria Kiselyova in Moscow; Tim Kelly in Tokyo, John Irish and Sudip Kar-Gupta in Paris, Phil Stewart and Steve Holland in Washington; Writing by Ghaida Ghantous and Andrew Cawthorne; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne and William Maclean)

                Trump names State Dept official Robert O'Brien as national security advisor, replacing John Bolton

                President Donald Trump named Robert O'Brien as his national security advisor on Wednesday, eight days after the abrupt departure of John Bolton.Trump says he fired Bolton, but Bolton says he resigned.The position does not require Senate confirmation.WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump named Robert O'Brien as his national security advisor on Wednesday, eight days after the abrupt departure of John Bolton.O'Brien, the State Department's top hostage affairs official, will become Trump's fourth national security advisor, following the departures of Bolton and retired Army Gens. Michael Flynn and H.R. McMaster.While O'Brien's recent work primarily dealt with matters involving U.S. hostages, he was assigned by Trump to help free rapper A$AP Rocky, who was detained in Sweden on assault charges over the summer. The rapper was found guilty, but was spared from jail time.O'Brien was also a partner in a boutique law firm focusing on high-stakes trials and appeals, and was a foreign policy advisor to Mitt Romney during the Utah senator's presidential run against then-President Barack Obama in 2012.O'Brien attended an Oval Office event in March, where Trump greeted a freed U.S. citizen who had been held in Yemen. The president called O'Brien "the greatest hostage negotiator in our history" at that event.Trump on Tuesday had named O'Brien and four other finalists for the role, including Vice President Mike Pence's national security advisor Keith Kellogg and Bolton's former chief of staff, Fred Fleitz.In selecting O'Brien, Trump said: "I have worked long & hard with Robert. He will do a great job!"Pence tweeted congratulations to O'Brien later Tuesday.The national security advisor does not require Senate confirmation. The position comes with a staff of hundreds of specialists from the Pentagon, State Department and U.S. intelligence agencies.The White House, Pentagon and State Department did not respond to CNBC's requests for comment on the president's announcement.Bolton, who was named national security advisor to succeed McMaster in March 2018, was known for his hardline approach to foreign policy, including calls for a pre-emptive strike on Iran and a hawkish position on North Korea. Trump announced on Sept. 10 that he fired Bolton saying that his advisor "disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions." Bolton said he resigned.Trump has said he fired Flynn for lying to the FBI and Pence about his contacts with foreign officials, while the president was reportedly frustrated with McMaster's detailed reports on national security matters.O'Brien's ascension comes as the Trump administration has pulled the United States back from global commitments and pushed forward on ambitious projects like the denuclearization of North Korea, a growing military footprint on the southwest border with Mexico, rising tensions with Iran, a bitter trade war with China and a recently aborted effort to negotiate the end of the U.S. war in Afghanistan.

                Trump orders Mnuchin to 'substantially increase' sanctions on Iran

            <p>
                President Trump says he ordered the Treasury Department to "substantially increase" sanctions on Iran.The action comes after the U.S. accused Iran for the weekend attacks on critical Saudi oil installations.It was not immediately clear what the president directed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to do.President Donald Trump said Wednesday he ordered the Treasury Department to "substantially increase" sanctions on Iran.Trump's announcement follows strikes Saturday on the world's largest crude-processing plant and oil field in Saudi Arabia. The U.S. accused Iran of carrying out the attacks.It was not immediately clear what steps the president directed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to take. Asked about the sanctions later Wednesday during stops in California, the president told reporters he would announce details over the next 48 hours. The Treasury Department, White House and State Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests to comment.The strikes triggered the largest spike in crude prices in decades and renewed concerns of a budding conflict in the Middle East. All the while, Iran maintains that it was not behind the attacks.U.S. crude and benchmark global Brent oil prices dropped Wednesday after the White House announced sanctions instead of military action.On Tuesday, Trump said aboard Air Force One that he does not intend to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week."I'm not looking to meet him. I don't think they're ready yet, but I'd prefer not meeting him," Trump said. Rouhani likewise said he would not meet with Trump.The foreign ministry of Russia, a key strategic ally to Iran, called Trump's plan destructive and said it would not solve anything, Reuters reported, citing news agency Interfax.On Sunday, Trump warned that the United States was "locked and loaded" to respond to the attack on the Saudis, but a day later, he dialed down his rhetoric, saying there was "no rush" to take action and that the U.S. was coordinating with allies.Secretary of Defense Mark Esper also spoke with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to the kingdom Tuesday.The Pentagon's top Air Force general said Tuesday that while the service had not yet received direction to send additional bomber aircraft to the region, the U.S. was closely monitoring the area.The latest confrontation represents another brick in the crumbling edifice between Washington and Tehran after a string of attacks in the Persian Gulf in recent months.In June, U.S. officials said an Iranian surface-to-air missile shot down an American military surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz. Iran said the aircraft was over its territory.Hours later, Trump said Iran made a "very big mistake" by shooting down the spy drone. The downing came a week after the U.S. blamed Iran for attacks on two oil tankers in the Persian Gulf region and after four tankers were attacked in May.The U.S. in June slapped new sanctions on Iranian military leaders blamed for shooting down the drone. The measures also aimed to block financial resources for Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Though Trump has threatened to bring military action or even "fire and fury" against American adversaries, he has also said he does not want to throw the U.S. into another prolonged military conflict. In a tweet Tuesday, Trump called his measured response to the strikes "a sign of strength that some people just don't understand!"U.S. congressional leaders from both major parties had urged Trump to respond to the strikes.

                Trump is better off never cutting a trade deal with China, CME Group chief economist says
            </a>
            <p>
                Since early 2018, the U.S. and China have engaged in a trade dispute with both countries imposing tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of one another's imports. Trump initiated the tariffs citing unfair trade practices from China and accused it of intellectual property theft.Talks to resume the trade dispute have so far yielded little in the way of a solution. In fact, the situation deteriorated in recent weeks.President Donald Trump would be better off not cutting a trade deal with China as it could backfire on him ahead of the 2020 U.S. election, according to the managing director and chief economist at the CME Group."The political issue is very serious here," Bluford Putnam told CNBC Wednesday."President Trump faces a Democratic opposition that really doesn't like China, but he also faces — on part of his Republican Party — people that want him to be much tougher on China. So, he's way better off never cutting a (trade) deal. If he cuts a deal, he'll be criticized from both sides," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe.""If he just stays tough, he rides through it just fine. Which is, by the way, the same issues (Chinese President) Xi Jinping has: He can't give in to a bully like President Trump, so what's he going to do? He doesn't want a deal either," he added.Putnam believes there won't be any decision on a deal before next year's U.S. election. Having espoused an "America First" policy to voters ahead of the 2016 election, Trump will be aware that the opposition Democratic Party, and voters, will be quick to criticize his approach to global trade and China if the U.S. economy suffers as a result.Since early 2018, the U.S. and China have engaged in a trade dispute with both countries imposing tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of one another's imports. Trump initiated the tariffs citing unfair trade practices from China and accused it of intellectual property theft.Talks to resume the trade dispute have so far yielded little in the way of a solution. In fact, the situation deteriorated in recent weeks with new U.S. tariffs on $112 billion of Chinese consumer goods, and more due later this year. China responded with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods worth $75 billion. The new tariffs could cost the average American household $1,000 a year, according to a J.P. Morgan estimate and are seen to have hit both U.S. and global growth. In July, the International Monetary Fund forecast U.S. growth to be 2.6% in 2019 and moderating to 1.9% in 2020.The fund downgraded its forecast for global growth to 3.2% in 2019, down from its April forecast of 3.3%, citing "trade and technology tensions that dent sentiment and slow investment" as one of the reasons. It forecast global growth of 3.5% in 2020. CME Group's Putnam said U.S. citizens did not pay too much attention to economic metrics if their lives were going smoothly enough."In the American public, and I think in general, it's about the narrative that consumers are willing to tell. It's the stories they internalize — and they don't internalize the numbers like we do in finance. As long as people have their jobs and they're not worried about their neighbors losing their jobs, the confidence level will be high enough that the average voter … is going to be fine with the general slugging along with the economy," he said.Putnam believes the 2020 election would instead be fought on "diplomacy, on the trade war and immigration and health care issues."

                Oil falls 2% after Trump orders increased sanctions on Iran instead of military action
            </a>
            <p>
                President Donald Trump said he ordered the Treasury Department to "substantially increase" sanctions on Iran.Trump had warned on Sunday that the U.S. was "locked and loaded" to respond to the Saudi incident.Oil production capabilities were fully restored and that oil output will be back to pre-attack levels by the end of September, Saudi energy minister said.Oil prices retreated on Wednesday, extending the decline in the previous session after President Donald Trump said he ordered the Treasury Department to "substantially increase" sanctions on Iran.Trump's announcement follows attacks on the world's largest crude-processing plant and oil field in Saudi Arabia that had forced the kingdom to cut its production in half. Oil prices jumped the most in history on Monday due to the disruption.Brent crude oil futures were down 36 cents, or 0.56%, at $64.21 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled 2.1% or $1.23 lower at $58.11 a barrel. The latest comment from the president marks a softening in his rhetoric as he had warned on Sunday that the U.S. was "locked and loaded" to respond to the Saudi incident.Oil tumbled as much as 7% on Tuesday after the Saudi energy minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said oil production capabilities were fully restored and that oil output will be back to pre-attack levels by the end of September.Fifty percent of the oil production loss from the attack has been restored in the past two days, bin Salman said, adding that production capacity would reach 10 million barrels of crude per day (bpd) by the end of this month and 12 million bpd by the end of November.Trump said Monday he's in no rush to respond to the coordinated attack. When asked if Iran was behind it, President Donald Trump said "It's certainly looking that way at this point."Drone and missile debris found by investigators at the Saudi Aramco attack site is proof of Iran's involvement in the drone attack, a Saudi defense ministry representative told media on Wednesday. He said the drones used in the attacks were Iranian Delta-wing unmanned aerial vehicles.Iran maintains that it was not behind the attacks. Iranian president Hassan Rouhani said the attacks on Aramco were a "reciprocal response" to the aggression against Yemen.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has blamed Iran for the drone strikes, saying in a tweet Saturday that Iran has launched an "unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply."Oil pared some of its loses after an unexpected rise in crude inventories.U.S. crude inventories increased by 1.1 million barrels from the previous week, according to the Energy Information Administration. Analysts expected a decrease of 2.5 million barrels.— CNBC's Maggie Fitzgerald contributed reporting.

                Iran is 'almost daring Donald Trump to respond,' says former diplomat
            </a>
            <p>
                President Donald Trump doesn't want war  with Iran — but Tehran seems inclined to "test the Trump administration," according to Gerald Feierstein, a former U.S. Ambassador to Yemen.Ultimately, the United States is still looking for "ways to get the Iranians back to the negotiating table," and Trump understands the American people don't want a military conflict, said Feierstein."Clearly, the Iranians look inclined to test the Trump administration, to call Donald Trump's bluff," he said.President Donald Trump doesn't want war with Iran — but Tehran seems inclined to "test the Trump administration," according to Gerald Feierstein, a former U.S. Ambassador to Yemen.Ultimately, the United States is still looking for "ways to get the Iranians back to the negotiating table," and Trump understands the American people don't want a military conflict, said Feierstein, who is currently senior vice president at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.Multiple drone attacks on Saturday crippled Saudi oil production, and knocked out 5.7 million barrels of daily crude oil production — that's half of Saudi Arabia's production and more than 5% of the world's daily crude production.The attacks on the oil plants of state-owned Saudi Aramco — on the world's largest crude processing facility in Abqaiq, and the kingdom's second-largest oilfield in Khurais — caused global oil prices to surge amid fears of supply disruption.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to meet Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman to talk about the attacks.Pompeo has blamed Iran for the attacks but Tehran refuted those allegations. On Tuesday, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei announced on state TV that the Iranian government "will never talk to America.""Clearly, the Iranians look inclined to test the Trump administration, to call Donald Trump's bluff, if you will, to see if he really has the will to really go all the way," Feierstein told CNBC on Wednesday. "So far, their bets have paid off."Yemen's Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, have been behind a series of attacks on Saudi pipelines, tankers and other infrastructure in the past few years amid rising tension between Iran and the U.S., and its allies like Saudi Arabia.The Islamic Republic, a target of U.S. sanctions for decades, has been blamed for recent attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. Washington has also blamed Tehran for the downing of a U.S. military drone."Whether you're talking about the tanker attacks or previous pipeline attacks or now this, they continue to raise the ante, they raise the bar, almost daring Donald Trump to respond," Feierstein added.Still, Feierstein said, "the Trump administration would not want to do things that would take the opportunity or the possibility of a negotiation away completely."Saudi Arabia would not want to be drawn into a war either, said Feierstein.The reason the Saudi government has been reluctant to point fingers at Iran is because it "will be very difficult to walk away from ... possible retaliation" if they do, he added.— CNBC's Natasha Turak and Yun Li contributed to this report.

                UPDATE 1-Wary of conflict with Iran, Trump takes go-slow approach to attack on Saudi oil
            </a>
            <p>
                on Saudi oil@ (Adds Trump exchange with Senator Lindsey Graham)WASHINGTON, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Known for acting on impulse, President Donald Trump has adopted an uncharacteristically go-slow approach over whether to hold Iran responsible for attacks on Saudi oil facilities, showing little enthusiasm for confrontation as he seeks re-election next year.After state-owned Saudi Aramco's plants were struck on Saturday, Trump did not wait long to fire off a tweet that the United States was "locked and loaded" to respond, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran.But four days later, Trump has no timetable for action. Instead, he wants to wait and see the results of investigations into what happened and is sending Pompeo to consult counterparts in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates this week."There's plenty of time," Trump told reporters on Monday. "You know, there's no rush. We'll all be here a long time. There's no rush."Two U.S. officials told Reuters on Tuesday that Washington believes the attack was launched from Iran, with one of them saying it originated in Iran's southwest.U.S. officials say Trump, who is famously skeptical of his intelligence community, wants to ensure the culprit is positively identified in a way that will pass muster not only with him but with the American people."In responding to the greatest attack on the global oil markets in history, I think not rushing to respond and ensuring everybody is on the same page is where we should be," said a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Trump's stance today is in stark contrast to 2017, less than three months into his presidency, when he waited only two days before launching air strikes to punish Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces for a chemical weapons attack.AMERICA FIRSTTrump's caution reflects the "America First" world view that found support with his base in the 2016 presidential campaign and that he is trying to promote again as he seeks a second term in 2020.Pillars of that view are that the Iraq war was a waste of blood and money, that the end of the war in Afghanistan is long overdue, and that Washington should be reimbursed for deployment of U.S. troops abroad, from South Korea to Germany.Jon Alterman, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former State Department official, said Trump also "has grown increasingly cautious as the reality of any military actions increased.""Theres a large constituency the president has that thinks it would be lunacy to go to war against Iran," he said. "There's a large part of his base that thinks the craziest thing we could do is committing ourselves to endless wars in the Middle East."The attacks on Saudi targets have stymied for now what had been an effort to open talks with Iranian leaders to try to get a sense of whether they were ready to strike a deal on their nuclear and ballistic missile programs in response to economic sanctions that have taken a toll on Iran's economy.Trump's willingness to consider easing sanctions on Iran alarmed his national security adviser, John Bolton, when the president raised the idea at a meeting last Monday, a source close to Bolton said. By the next day, Bolton was out.Bolton's departure removed a central anti-Iran voice from the president's inner circle. A well-known foreign policy hawk, Bolton was said to be furious in June when Trump abruptly called off air strikes in response to Iran's shooting down of a U.S. drone."If Bolton were there, he would be saying it was definitely Iran, and we need to strike right now," said a former senior administration official.Trump rebuked Lindsey Graham, one of his staunchest supporters in the U.S. Senate, after the Republican senator said in a tweet on Tuesday that Iran had seen Trump's response to the drone downing as a sign of weakness."No Lindsey, it was a sign of strength that some people just dont understand!" Trump said on Twitter.In Venezuela, despite repeated vows that all options were on the table, Trump also resisted Boltons suggestions for a stronger focus on military planning in the country, where a U.S.-led campaign of sanctions and diplomatic pressure has failed to push socialist president Nicolas Maduro from power.Barring a major escalation, future U.S. measures are expected to continue to stop short of military action due to a lack of support from U.S. voters but also because of opposition from allies in Latin America."We have to be realistic," a Venezuela opposition source said. "Trump will not be sending in the Marines to rescue us." (Additional reporting by Jeff Mason Editing by Mary Milliken and Sonya Hepinstall)

                ROK to do all it can for successful DPRK-US talks: unification minister
            </a>
            <p>
                SEOUL - ROK (The Republic of Korea)'s Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul said Thursday that his country will do all it can for the successful working-level denuclearization talks between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the United States, which were expected to resume in the near future.Kim made the remark at a ceremony to mark the first anniversary of the third summit in Pyongyang last September between ROK's President Moon Jae-in and top DPRK leader Kim Jong-un.Citing the impromptu meeting on June 30 at the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjom between the leaders of the two Koreas and US President Donald Trump, the minister said the DPRK-US working-level talks would resume in the near future.Choe Son-hui, the DPRK's first vice foreign minister, said earlier this month that the DPRK was willing to hold talks with the United States in late September to comprehensively discuss issues the two sides had taken up.Kim said both Pyongyang and Washington would cherish the opportunity for the working-level dialogue though it would not be easy as the two sides are required to overcome a "wall of age-old distrust and confrontation".The minister said that only when the DPRK and the United States make productive, reasonable negotiations based on sufficient trust, the DPRK would take a big step toward the denuclearization.He said the South Korean government will do all it can for the DPRK-US working-level dialogue to bear good fruit, while closely communicating with the US side and opening communication channels between the two Koreas.

                US and Iran should be guided by reason: China Daily editorial
            </a>
            <p>
                Continuing to blame Iran for Saturday's attacks on two Saudi Arabian oil facilities, Washington is mulling imposing fresh sanctions on Teheran. But without foolproof evidence to support its action, the United States would put the cart before the horse if it announced new sanctions against Iran.That the news of the US considering such a move can increase the already high tensions in the Middle East is evident in Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif raising the specter of an "all-out war", and stressing that if the US or Saudi Arabia attacked Iran, it would have to fight to its last soldier.True, the attacks on the major Saudi facilities have shrunk the country's oil production almost by half and hiked global oil prices, sparking grave concerns over global oil supply. But the developments should prompt the US to more seriously consider the possible spillover effects of another punitive action against Iran on the regional situation and the world economy.Ignoring any such rational thinking, however, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the attacks an "act of war" against Saudi Arabia after Riyadh displayed missile and drone wreckage on Wednesday and other evidence claiming the raids were "unquestionably sponsored by Iran".Unfortunately, Pompeo's remark raises the fear of the US using military measures against Iran. Given Iran's pivotal location, that would affect global oil supply, not to mention there is no guarantee the US' move will not ignite, unwittingly or otherwise, the powder keg that the region has become.Judging by US President Donald Trump's remarks, it seems he understands the grave risk Washington would be taking by triggering another war in the Middle East.To be fair to Iran, it is not responsible for the current situation. The main cause of the tensions is the US' withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal despite the International Atomic Energy Agency saying Teheran had fully complied with the multilateral deal.Yet, amid rising tensions, both parties seem to have left some room for reconciliation. While the White House has not ruled out a meeting with Iran's top leader, Zarif said Iran hoped to avoid conflict, adding that Teheran was willing to hold talks with Riyadh, and the possibility of a return to negotiations with the US depends on whether Washington would provide full sanctions relief as promised under the 2015 nuclear deal.In the long run, therefore, keeping the Iranian nuclear deal alive, and ensuring it is implemented both in letter and spirit, is the only viable way of resolving the US-Iran conflict and defusing the tensions in the Middle East.

                Fed lowers rates, open to another cut
            </a>
            <p>
                Divided FOMC votes to trim key interest rate to 1.75-2%; Trump wanted to see it go to 0%The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates Wednesday by a quarter-point for the second time in two months to ease the disruption of the continuing US-China trade dispute and offset the weight of a global economic slowdown.The Fed suggested that it is open to a third rate cut this year, possibly in October or December.Seven of the 10 members of the Federal Open Market Committee voted to lower the short-term rate to 1.75-2 percent. Two committee members again voted to hold rates steady, and a third wanted a half-point cut."The quarter-point cut is already built into the financial markets and the real economy. It will make no difference to either," Gary Hufbauer, an analyst at the Washington-based Peterson Institute, told China Daily. "The cut will certainly not offset the disruption caused by the trade dispute."Kamal Khan, chief US editor at Investing.com in New York, said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had the difficult task of explaining the need for the rate cut when the Fed doesn't foresee a recession."The quarter-point cut won't be enough to derail a slowdown and more concerns about a US recession if trade relations between the US and China start to sour again," he told China Daily. "But it should help the economic data look even better in the near term."President Donald Trump blasted the Fed's action, tweeting after it was announced: "Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No 'guts,' no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!" Last week, Trump tweeted that "The Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less, and we should then start to refinance our debt."At a news conference Wednesday, Powell said the central bank is "fully committed to pursuing our goals of maximum employment and stable prices". He stressed that it will "act as appropriate to sustain the expansion" of the nation's economy.The unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, near a 50-year low, but hiring has slowed, and low wage growth suggests employers have little difficulty finding workers. Inflation, excluding food and energy because of their volatility, is about 1.5 percent, below the Fed's 2 percent target.The Fed's policy statement outlining the reasons for the rate cut differed little from its July statement. The FOMC again said the "implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures" were the main reasons for the cut.Assessing the nation's economy, the Fed noted that consumer spending is "rising at a strong pace", while business fixed investment and exports have weakened.The Fed said disruptions from the US-China trade dispute have worsened since the July 30-31 FOMC meeting, and the global economic slowdown has not yet bottomed out. US manufacturing also has weakened.Repeating language used in July, the Fed said "it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion"."Economic and financial conditions have changed only modestly since the FOMC met in July, with growth remaining somewhat soft but wage and price measures looking a bit firmer," Jan Hatzius, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said in a research report. "Beyond the September meeting, we continue to expect the FOMC to deliver a third and final (quarter-point) cut to 1.5-1.75 percent in October."Fed: Also adds $75b in liquidity to systemThe Fed pumped $75 billion into the financial system on Monday and Tuesday, the first such action in about 10 years, to alleviate a sudden shortage of cash. The move reflects a divergence between funding needs and cash available.The Federal Reserve is charged with maintaining a stable monetary and financial system. Rate cuts are part of the Fed's effort to maintain a strong economy, full employment and stable prices.In December 2008, as the economy sank, the Fed cut rates to 0.25 percent, the 10th cut in just over year, and didn't begin raising rates until December 2015. Prior to 2008, the lowest fed funds rates was 1 percent in 2003, to combat a recession that began in 2001.The fed funds rate climbed to 20 percent in 1979 and 1980 to curb double-digit inflation. In 1971, President Richard Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard, and inflation soon rose to 9.6 percent from 3.9 percent.In response, the Fed continued to hike rates. In 1979, Fed Chairman Paul Volcker held rates steady at a record high, all the way to 20 percent, leading to a recession that ended inflation.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 200 points, or 0.8 percent, within 30 minutes of the Fed's announcement on Wednesday, but rebounded to close at 27,147.08, up 36.28 points or 0.13 percent.

                Trump to revoke Calif. emission rules
            </a>
            <p>
                US President Donald Trump has moved to revoke California's right to set its own vehicle-emissions standards, drawing criticism from state officials who said such a move is an attack on states' right and a blow to the global warming fight."This will lead to more production because of this pricing and safety advantage, but also due to the fact that older, highly polluting cars, will be replaced by new, extremely environmentally friendly cars. There will be very little difference in emissions between the California Standard and the new US Standard, but the cars will be far safer and much less expensive," Trump wrote in a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday."Many more cars will be produced under the new and uniform standard, meaning significantly more JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to California, you will be out of business," he added.The Trump administration's decision to formally revoke California's car emissions rules authority is expected to be made on Thursday morning.Andrew Wheeler, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary, are expected to announce the formal abolition of the waiver at Environmental Protection Agency headquarters.Trump made the announcement while on a trip in the Golden State. He arrived in California on Tuesday and made stops in Palo Alto, Beverly Hills and San Diego for campaign fundraising.Some California lawmakers vowed to take legal action to block Trump's move."I'm confident we will prevail eventually. It will take years and years and years, more uncertainty, more anxiety. But California will prevail because we're leaders in this space," the Los Angeles Times quoted California Governor Gavin Newsom as saying during a news conference Wednesday.California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols said the measure will have dire consequences."Millions of people in California and other states that follow our standards will be breathing dirtier air. They will suffer from more pollution, more asthma cases, more hospitalizations, more premature deaths," Nichols said.Former California governor Jerry Brown joined the fray. Responding to Trump's tweets, he said: "Your toxic tweets are insufferable, but your pillaging of our clean air is criminal."California's authority to set its own tougher emissions standards was enabled by a waiver issued by Congress during the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970.California's tighter emissions standards are followed by 13 other states, which represents roughly a third of the national auto market, according to The New York Times.If the Trump administration's move is upheld in court, it could permanently block states from regulating vehicle greenhouse gas pollution. If it were rejected by the Supreme Court, it would allow states to set their own emissions standards.On Wednesday, Trump showed off a section of wall along the U.S. border with Mexico in a bid to illustrate his commitment to crack down on illegal border crossings.The Republican president, who is on a three-day swing through the US West that has included a rally in New Mexico and a number of fundraisers in California, also used his trip to criticize the homelessness problem in Los Angeles and San Francisco, two heavily Democratic cities.Trump traveled to Otay Mesa, a community in San Diego, to view the construction of a 30-foot-high (9-meter-high) steel and concrete barrier that is replacing existing border fencing. Trump said the wall goes deep into the ground, making it difficult to tunnel underneath, and is topped with heat-absorbing material to deter climbers.Reuters contributed to this story.

                US expels two of Cuba's UN diplomats, citing 'influence operations'
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - The Trump administration on Thursday ordered the expulsion from the United States of two members of Cuba's delegation to the United Nations and restricted travel of the remaining mission members to Manhattan, drawing strong condemnation from Havana.In an announcement just days before world leaders gather for the annual UN General Assembly, the US State Department accused the two Cuban diplomats of trying to "conduct influence operations" harmful to US national security but did not elaborate on the accusations or release their names.It was the latest sign of deteriorating US relations with Cuba, since US President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, which has rolled back the detente initiated by his predecessor Barack Obama."The Department of State today notified the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the United States requires the imminent departure of two members of Cuba's Permanent Mission to the United Nations for abusing their privileges of residence," said Morgan Ortagus, the department spokesperson, in a statement."This is due to their attempts to conduct influence operations against the United States," the spokesperson added, without providing further details on the issue.Besides, the US required Cuba's UN mission's travel should "essentially be restricted to the island of Manhattan," according to the statement.Agencies-Xinhua

                The paradox of prosperity
            </a>
            <p>
                An economist looks at how improved material wealth coincides with rising inequality and gives special attention to China's role in the global economy, Andrew Moody reports in London.Douglas McWilliams believes China is a classic case of the paradox at the heart of the global economy.Although it has delivered 800 million out of poverty in the past 40 years, the gap between rich and poor has also grown, something the Chinese government is very determined to address.This, though, is a global phenomenon and one that the well-known British economist addresses in his new book, The Inequality Paradox: How Capitalism Can Work for Everyone, which was officially launched earlier this month."China has made the biggest single contribution to the fall in global poverty in human history and progress is still being made," the 67-year-old says.China aims to entirely eliminate extreme poverty by the end of next year."But within China, as with other countries, inequality has increased as poverty has decreased. This is the paradox."Inequality is now a central issue of economic debate. It is a particular problem in the West, where many feel left behind since the global financial crisis of 2008. And this has given rise to increasing disaffection and rising populism.It was also addressed by the French economist Thomas Piketty in his seminal 2013 book, Capital in the Twenty-first Century. He blamed the problem on the rich seeing a greater rise in the value of their assets than the increase in wages of those who have to work for a living.McWilliams, who was speaking at the central London office of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, the economics consultancy he founded more than 25 years ago and of which he is executive deputy chairman, thinks Piketty is only partly right."What he argues is about 20 percent true. IMF studies that have looked at this carefully do point to people with assets exploiting others being part of the story. I think, though, Piketty's explanation misses the real driving point," he says.McWilliams believes what has driven inequality is globalization-which China has largely benefitted from-and technology with the Fourth Industrial Revolution threatening to destroy jobs in the developing as well as the developed world."With globalization, you have had nearly three-quarters of the world's population suddenly becoming economically active in just a few decades. This is bound to be disruptive. It has created increased inequality in the West, but it has also been associated with a significant reduction of poverty in the East," he says.McWilliams insists Donald Trump-style protectionism is no answer to globalization."King Canute (the 11th-century English Viking king, who tried to hold back the tide) had similar ideas. But it didn't work, did it? China, in fact, is one of the best examples of isolationism not working. It looked in on itself after the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) voyages of Zheng He and hardly developed for several centuries afterwards."McWilliams believes such technologies as artificial intelligence and robotics, which will destroy vast swaths of jobs, pose huge challenges to policymakers if societies don't become more equal."It is no longer just about machines replacing people but machines making the machines that replace people," he says."People will just have to find new things to do. In the UK, we have actually had the growth of the lifestyle economy with the number of people claiming to be musicians going up nearly five times and, similarly, writers three times."He believes the only solution may be that everyone becomes entitled to a universal basic income and that this might be more imminent than many currently think."In some of the oil states in the Middle East, there is already an effective basic income. My maths says the economics in the US start to add up in about 10 years' time, and in Europe and China is about 20 to 25 years' time."McWilliams was partly brought up in Asia. His father was a civil engineer in Malaysia before McWilliams returned to the UK to attend the Roman Catholic independent school Stonyhurst College in Lancashire before studying economics at Oxford.He has held a number of prominent jobs, including stints as chief economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry, the leading US-business organization, and an economic adviser to former UK chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne.His latest book comes just three years after the success of his first, The Flat White Economy, which looked at how the growth of media, internet and creative businesses was transforming economies.McWilliams says the issue of inequality is not so important to people when they are being delivered from poverty. It's only later when people become concerned about disparities in their material wealth."When you are starving, you just want food. When you are well off, you start to demand luxury goods. In China, you cannot ignore the fact that life expectancy has gone up as well as nutritional standards, and health has massively improved," he says.McWilliams says globalization and technology can have an exponential effect on disparity. In the book, he cities the fact that England soccer player Wayne Rooney earned 53 times more than the legendary Bobby Charlton of an earlier era."This was because Rooney played on the global stage, whereas when Bobby Charlton played, even people in the UK couldn't watch him on the TV since only a very few matches were broadcast live," he says.McWilliams believes that one of the ways to reduce inequality is through education, and that is why countries like China are right to place emphasis on this."There is no greater determinant of how much people will earn in their lives than their level of education. I was brought up in Asia, and my mother ran a kindergarten. The thing that humbled me is that poor people would pay half their salaries to educate their children. I think we have slightly lost that in the West."Unlike Piketty, McWilliams does not believe that taxing the rich is a solution to reducing inequality."Piketty argues that if you shoot the rich the problem goes away. I don't believe that."McWilliams' consultancy earlier this year produced a report on how the Belt and Road Initiative would boost global GDP by 4.2 percent in 2040. It has also produced several other reports on China's economy."I am confident about the China economy because the government has done all that it needs to do to get to the next level, and, therefore, it is unlikely to get stuck in the middle-income trap."On the UK, he supported Brexit in the referendum but insists he is not a "head-banger" on the subject and is increasingly frustrated by the uncertainty it is creating."My guess now is that whatever happens it is going to be hugely disruptive, and the pain will have been prolonged by the fact the country has taken so long to make up its mind."As for inequality across the world, McWilliams says that after writing the book, which is persuasive and, arguably, easily one of the best on the subject so far, he is pessimistic."I think we are going to have to fight, and fight very hard, to prevent the gaps in society from widening," he says.

                Trump taps O'Brien to replace Bolton
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump on Wednesday named Robert O'Brien, the State Department's chief hostage negotiator and an established figure in Republican policy circles, as his new national security adviser. O'Brien, the fourth person in two years to hold the job, becomes the administration's point person on national security amid rising tensions with Iran following the attacks on Saudi oil installations and fresh uncertainty in Afghanistan after the halt in talks with the Taliban. The announcement of O'Brien's selection came a week after Trump ousted John Bolton from the post, citing policy disagreements. O'Brien, who made headlines in July when he was dispatched to Sweden to monitor the assault trial of US rapper A$AP Rocky, was among five candidates Trump said on Tuesday were under consideration. "He's worked with me for quite a while now on hostages, and we have a tremendous track record on hostages," Trump said on Wednesday on a tarmac in Los Angeles, hours after revealing the pick on Twitter. "Robert has been fantastic. We know each other well." O'Brien, standing alongside Trump, said it was a "privilege" to be picked. "We've had tremendous foreign policy successes under President Trump's leadership. I expect those to continue. We've got a number of challenges," he added. O'Brien said the administration's focus will continue to be on keeping the United States safe and rebuilding the military. He said he would advise Trump privately on the situation in Saudi Arabia. Trump abruptly forced out Bolton on Sept 10, after he and the hawkish national security adviser found themselves in strong disagreement over the administration's approach to Iran, Afghanistan and a host of other global challenges. The sudden exit marked the latest departure of a prominent voice of dissent from Trump's inner circle as the president has grown more comfortable following his gut instinct over the studious guidance offered by his advisers. Former Missouri US senator Jim Talent, who has been a friend of O'Brien's for years, said that while the new adviser is tough, has a high degree of stamina and doesn't fold under pressure, he is not the type of person who is going to try to steamroll his own policy opinions. "He does not have the... brand of Bolton," Talent said, adding that it would be hard to "pigeonhole" O'Brien as a "neocon" or label him with other foreign policy tags. Talent said O'Brien, a lawyer, formerly arbitrated international legal cases and probably wore a tie more often than others in Los Angeles. But he's not a "buttoned-up" kind of person, Talent said. As the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs at the State Department, O'Brien worked closely with the families of US hostages and advised administration officials on hostage issues. He helped secure the release in February of US citizen Danny Burch, who was freed after 18 months in captivity in Yemen. He has also worked on the case of missing US journalist Austin Tice, who was captured in Syria in 2012. Associated Press (China Daily 09/20/2019 page11)

                US vows more Iran sanctions as stakes rise
            </a>
            <p>
                Trump orders screws to be tightened as Mike Pompeo meets more Gulf alliesWASHINGTON－US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he had ordered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to "substantially increase sanctions" imposed on Iran, amid escalating tensions between Washington and Teheran.Trump gave no explanation in a Twitter post announcing the order, but it followed repeated US assertions that the Islamic Republic was behind Saturday's attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia and came hours after Riyadh said the strike was a "test of global will". Iran has denied any involvement in the attacks."I have just instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to substantially increase sanctions on the country of Iran!" Trump wrote.The Sept 14 raids hit the world's biggest crude oil processing facility and initially knocked out half of Saudi output. Saudi Arabia is the world's leading oil exporter.Responsibility was claimed by Yemen's Houthi group, which on Wednesday gave more details of the raids, saying they were launched from three sites in Yemen.In a remark that may further strain an already tense political atmosphere in the Gulf, the Houthis also said they had dozens of sites in the United Arab Emirates, Riyadh's top Arab ally, listed as possible targets for attacks.Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday that the US backs Saudi Arabia's "right to defend itself". He had earlier described the assault－targeting the heart of the country's oil industry－as an "act of war".Pompeo's comments on Twitter came as he was in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, after meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's defense minister. The Saudis on Wednesday displayed missile and drone wreckage and cited other evidence they alleged shows the raid was "unquestionably sponsored by Iran".In response, Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif warned on Thursday that any US or Saudi military strike on his country will result in "all-out war".It would cause "a lot of casualties," he stressed."I am making a very serious statement that we don't want to engage in a military confrontation," Zarif said. "But we won't blink to defend our territory."He added that any sanctions placed by the US on Iran－imposed after Washington withdrew from an international agreement aimed at curbing Teheran's nuclear program－would need to be lifted before any further negotiations could be considered.Pompeo was to next visit the United Arab Emirates to meet with Abu Dhabi's crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The UAE joined the kingdom in its war in Yemen against the Houthis.The UAE said on Thursday it had joined a US-led coalition to protect waterways across the Middle East.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Wednesday that UN experts have left for Saudi Arabia to probe the blasts, as he warned of "devastating" consequences if the crisis escalates.The UN experts "have already left for Saudi Arabia and obviously they will be doing their job according to the mandate that the Security Council has given them", Guterres said.Agencies

                California vows to fight Trump administration for clean air
            </a>
            <p>
                LOS ANGELES - On a fundraising stump through California on Wednesday, US President Donald Trump escalated his contentious relationship with the Golden State by authorizing the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to revoke California's waiver that allows it to establish its own safer standards for clean air and water.The political fallout was instantaneous.California Governor Gavin Newsom characterized Trump's latest decree-by-tweet as a "political vendetta" against California and deplored his attempt to threaten the health of Americans everywhere and interfere with California's right to protect their residents with safer air and water standards.The governor said in a statement that Trump's move "could have devastating consequences for our kids' health and the air we breathe, if California were to roll over. But we will not.""The Trump Administration is revoking California's Federal Waiver on emissions in order to produce far less expensive cars for the consumer," Trump said in a tweet on Wednesday.Newsom, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, and California Air Resources Board (CARB) Chair Mary Nichols and other civic leaders have vowed to fight this destructive move, contending that California's clean air and water standards are essential to protecting the health and safety of millions of Californians and addressing the escalating climate crisis."As President Trump arrives in California to rake in campaign cash, his Administration is preparing to announce his desperate plan to rob our state of its long-standing authority to set vehicle emissions standards," warned Becerra. "To those who claim to support states' rights -- don't trample on ours."Under the federal Clean Air Act, California is the only state permitted to set their own emissions standards, subject to a waiver from the EPA. Other states may elect to follow California's stricter standards or the less stringent federal standards, but may not set their own. To date, thirteen US states, the District of Columbia, and the province of Quebec in Canada have chosen to adopt CARB standards.Becerra added: "We can't afford to backslide to the days of dirty air and unregulated emissions. For us, this is about survival. When you endanger our people, our economy, or our planet, we rise with the full force of the law behind us."Historically, smog has been a uniquely challenging problem in California cities due to the state's unusual combination of geography, weather systems, automotive culture, and dense population growth. As far back as 1943, residents of Los Angeles and San Francisco experienced episodes of smog that caused burning lungs, nausea, and eyes ailments and forced many residents to wear masks to protect them from the toxic air.California Air Resources Board, California's clean air agency, was formed in 1967 to be responsible for researching and establishing the state's vehicle emissions standards, attaining and maintaining healthy air quality; protecting the public from exposure to toxic air contaminants; and providing innovative and affordable approaches for complying with air pollution rules and regulations."For the first time in its 50-year history, the US Environmental Protection Agency is trying to stop states from taking reasonable actions to cut smog," said CARB Chairperson, Mary D. Nichols."Shame on the Trump Administration for putting the health of millions of its citizens at risk for absolutely no reason," she admonished.For Dan Jacobson, director of the Environment California Research and Policy Center, the outlook was grim. He told Xinhua that the roll-back will mean, "More kids with asthma, more premature deaths caused by air pollution, and more global warming ..."He was more optimistic about a win for California in the courts, noting "it is a fact that the environmental argument, the public health argument and most of the business arguments are on our side."A scientific study published last year in America's leading medical publication, the Journal of the American Medical Association, predicted that Trump's roll-back of environmental protections were likely to "cost the lives of over 80,000 US residents per decade and lead to respiratory problems for many more than 1 million people."A recent survey by the Public Policy Institute of California on Californians and the Environment showed that a whopping 72 percent of California adults and likely voters favor the new state law mandating reductions in greenhouse gases."While the White House is abdicating its responsibility to the rest of the world on cutting emissions and fighting global warming, California is stepping up," said Governor Newsom.
