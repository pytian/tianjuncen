            <p class="style-content">
                BEIJING - China's logistics business continued to expand in August, but the expansion rate was lower than the previous month, according to a recent survey.The logistics performance index for August came in at 50.9 percent, 0.2 percentage points lower than in July, according to the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing.A reading above 50 percent indicates expansion while a reading below reflects contraction.Despite a cyclical decline of the index, it still remains in the expansionary territory, said He Hui, director of the China Logistics Information Center.The new orders index rebounded in August, as market demand picked up.The index of new orders was 50.7 percent in August, up 0.2 percentage points from July, indicating the peak season for traditional production and construction is approaching and the logistics demand of upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply chain has increased.The average inventory index was 50.3 percent in August, up 1.2 percentage points from July, reflecting increased logistics-related storage business.Looking into the future, the indexes of new orders and business activity expectations are at 50.7 percent and 58.8 percent, respectively, indicating the logistics business will continue to be stable in the near future, according to the federation.

                As a tech reporter, I have been overwhelmed by big 5G announcements and advertisements over the past two years. Late July, I finally got to lay my hands on the much-awaited 5G smartphones from several Chinese manufacturers.Pinning hopes on the new-generation devices to revive a market mired in an innovation lull and a sales slump, smartphone makers are scrambling to woo early adopters and hope to gain a first-mover advantage in the global 5G battle.However, their eagerness to seek the honor of being remembered as the first out of the gate, generates a bit of mirth - in fact, it highlights what appears to be a developing bubble in the highly competitive sector.For instance, Huawei, the world's second-largest smartphone vendor, said its Mate 20X is the first 5G smartphone model that has been approved by China's telecom industry regulator to connect to the network. And the company unveiled the 5G model on July 26 at a gigantic product launch.But its rival ZTE Corp cut in, with just three days ahead of Huawei's event, announcing on July 23 on social networking platforms that its 5G smartphone would become available for pre-orders immediately and calling it the first 5G handset that went public in the country.Even e-commerce platforms are scrambling for the honor of being China's first retailer to sell the first home-made 5G commercial model. JD.com Inc circulated a news release headlined "An epoch-making moment: China's first 5G smartphone was sold from JD" on Aug 5.JD's rival Suning also claimed it sold out the country's first 5G smartphone on Aug 5, with a male customer apparently buying the phone at 00:00 - the stroke of midnight on the intervening night of Aug 4 and 5 - at Suning's offline store in Beijing. Its news release was headlined "China's 5G era came, with Suning selling the first 5G smartphone".Such confusing, amusing claims raise a question or two: is it really that important to be remembered as the first one to sell a 5G smartphone? And, does the sale of the first-ever 5G phone signify a truly historic moment?Undoubtedly, 5G smartphones are an important evolution of 4G handsets, with internet speed becoming as fast as to allow rapid downloads of movie-size files. And being the first one to sell 5G handsets is an important part of marketing campaigns to promote sales. It can brighten a company's brand image. And companies' eagerness to bring 5G handsets to the market also highlights the vitality of China's smartphone industry.But the reality is that smartphone makers are roughly at the same level of research and development of 5G handsets. Tech industry insiders told me it is entirely possible that only one of the top five players could really be the first one to launch a 5G device. This view is supported by the launch schedules of companies' 5G plans that are close to each other.Instead of vying to be the first one to sell 5G smartphones, a bigger challenge companies should address is this: how to ensure a smooth transition from the 4G era to the 5G smartphone age?And when 5G network coverage is very limited in China and no telecom carriers have officially launched 5G data packages so far, selling 5G smartphones does not make much sense. Most consumers can only enjoy 4G services even if they have 5G handsets.So, in my view, what matters really is which company exploits the emerging 5G tech best to create additional value for consumers.

                    Some internet firms see hog heaven in pork market
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The supply and price of pork has received a lot of attention recently in China due to African swine fever, and local governments have unveiled policies to stabilize prices and encourage pig farming.China is the world's biggest pork producer and consumer, producing about half of the world's total. Over the past 10 years, Chinese hog farmers raised more than 650 million pigs, with an annual pork consumption of 50 million tons.Statistics showed that the value of the market related to pigs is expected to be as high as 3 trillion yuan, which includes 1.4 trillion yuan direct from the pork industry, Futures Daily reported. Pork is the most commonly consumed meat in most parts of China.Faced with a mega market and high returns, some internet companies have also followed suit.NetEase quietly began to raise organic, non-GMO black pigs about 10 years ago. In 2015, NetEase CEO Ding Lei served it to a group of internet bosses, turning the pork into an online hit.In November 2016, a black pig from NetEase Weiyang, the agricultural affiliate of NetEase, was auctioned off for 270,000 yuan. After that, the pork was formally sold on NetEase's e-commerce brands Yanxuan and Kaola, with a price tag of 48 yuan for 0.5 kg. It also opened physical stores.NetEase Weiyang received 160 million yuan in A-round financing in April 2017, led by Meituan Dianping and Sinovation Ventures. Next, the company announced its plan to build a 3,400 mu (226.66 hectare) pig farm in Gaoan county, Jiangxi province.Last March, Aliyun, Alibaba's cloud computing subsidiary, announced that the company plans to put AI technology into the pig farming industry. Presently, Aliyun has invested hundreds of millions of yuan in this project, and predicted the number of pigs being raised to reach 10 million by 2020.Chinese e-commerce giant JD also set up its agriculture and animal husbandry unit last November, putting pig facial recognition technology into pig farming. This high technology can identify different pigs by their faces, monitor them and record their weight and health condition.However, the smart pigs from Aliyun and JD are not ready for slaughter for the market just yet. We can imagine that under the high-tech pig farming project, the risks of pigs infected by African swine fever could be controlled while reducing cost increases in the future.Wang Ying, an analyst at Hua Chuang Securities, said that pork prices in China will keep rising in the short term after African swine fever spread around the country since August last year. In the middle term, the average price of pork is expected to top 30 yuan per kilogram.

                    Crawfish craze keeps industry on a roll
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Sector expected to maintain steady growth trend in nation as consumer demand for product surgesSeafood-savvy Chinese are eating more crawfish at restaurants and through e-commerce purchases. Resembling small lobsters, the delicacy has been quite popular on Chinese dining tables and for late-night snacks over the years.May, when crawfish mature, is the start of the peak season for crawfish consumption, and it runs until September. Crawfish can be cooked in various flavors such as spicy, minced garlic, stir-fried ginger and scallion, braised soy sauce, and innovative flavors such as cooking with salted egg yolk, cheese, and fermented bean curd."Crawfish has become one of the most sought-after and highly recognized summer foods in the country. Continuously launched new flavors in the market further stimulated the demand from consumers. They helped to enlarge consumer group scales, and raise the average spending and eating frequency," said Neil Wang, president of consultancy Frost & Sullivan in China."The process of eating crawfish is kind of complicated, which limits the use of mobile phones during meals, and thus it helped to create a natural social networking scenario for diners," he said.As an indication of how much crawfish has triggered the appetite of Chinese consumers with sophisticated tastes, a search of the words "crawfish delivery" through Dazhong Dianping, a Chinese customer review app that is similar to Yelp, results in more than 3,100 restaurants that offer deliveries in Beijing alone.Depending on different sizes, prices of cooked crawfish at restaurants are usually around 80 yuan ($11.3) to 200 yuan per dish, and most reviews from consumers said they like the food very much, according to Dazhong Dianping."Sales of crawfish have grown remarkably and rapidly in the past few years, and now it has stepped into a more stable growth period with more rational prices. Next, its growth rate is expected to slow down," said Cui He, director of China Aquatic Products Processing and Marketing Alliance.Last year, the total industrial output of crawfish in China was worth 369 billion yuan, up 37.5 percent year-on-year, according to a new crawfish sector growth report released by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in late August.In May last year, the government released crawfish sector related guidelines about the standardization of circulation grade, safety and hygiene index, packing requirement, transportation and storage requirement, providing more specific guidance and monitoring of the crawfish market.Talking of the industrial chains, sales in the crawfish cultivation sector hit 68 billion yuan last year. The processing industry yielded sales of 28.4 billion yuan, and the sales of the tertiary industry, mainly catering, came in at 272.6 billion yuan, the report said.In 2018, the total output volume of crawfish reached 1.64 million metric tons, and the total breeding areas stood at 1.13 million hectares. Among the total, crawfish cultured in rice fields accounted for over 70 percent.The yields from Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Jiangxi provinces, respectively, took the top five spots. Among which, the output of Hubei province reached 812,400 tons last year, which made up about half of the country's total output.The competition between industrial players has become more intense. Last year, major Chinese e-commerce platforms such as JD, Tmall and Freshhema, saw substantial sales of crawfish, and their cold chain distribution and logistics systems have developed fast. Fresh crawfish, peeled crawfish, condiments, cans, crawfish noodles, and many other categories, can be easily ordered online."Now, many e-commerce retailers would prefer to purchase fresh crawfish directly from breeding places, and process locally, and thus eliminate intermediate links and costs. This would be beneficial for both consumers and farmers," Wang of Frost& Sullivan said.Meanwhile, 140,000 new crawfish restaurants were opened nationwide last year, surging nearly 70 percent year-on-year, and more restaurants have launched express delivery business of crawfish. Retailers focused more on developing branded crawfish with local or national impact, according to a report by China's leading group-buying provider Meituan.Orders of crawfish delivery last year were 2.6 times higher than the previous year, and the transaction value was 4.3 times higher, Meituan said.From January to May this year, another 5,000 new restaurants selling crawfish have opened. Major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Chengdu each have more than 3,000 such restaurants."In the long term, the crawfish segment in China will maintain a steady growth trend, but the growth rate will slow down. The overall supply-demand relationship of the industry will become more balanced," said the Meituan report."The industrial chain of crawfish has been further extended, and the industrial structure will get upgraded. Crawfish will be produced on a larger and more organized scale," the report said.
