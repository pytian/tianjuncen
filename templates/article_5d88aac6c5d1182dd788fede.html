                CR929 plane will be able to fly 12,000 kilometers and carry 280 passengersThe largest joint effort between China and Russia in the aviation industry-building the CR929 long-range wide-body jetliner-has begun looking for suppliers, according to Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC).The company also said in a statement distributed to reporters at the International Aviation and Space Salon 2019 in Zhukovsky, near Moscow, that the CR929 project is now in the preliminary design stage and is proceeding well.Next, project teams from China and Russia will deepen cooperation to boost research and development of the jumbo jetliner, it added.COMAC brought a 1:1 model of the CR929's forward fuselage, consisting of the cockpit and a short section of the passenger cabin, to the Russian air show, which ran from last Tuesday to Sunday.It was the first time the Chinese airliner manufacturer displayed a large-size model of the CR929 overseas, the company said.Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the model on Tuesday and boarded it to see the inner arrangement and equipment after they inaugurated the Russian air show that morning.Research and development of the CR929 was launched in 2016. The next year, China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International Corp was established in Shanghai to take responsibility for the endeavor.With an initial targeted market in China and Russia, the first version of the aircraft-CR929-600-will be able to fly 12,000 kilometers and carry 280 passengers, according to COMAC.In another development, COMAC announced during the Russian show that the last two C919 prototypes will be delivered to conduct flight tests around the end of this year.The C919, COMAC's first jetliner, conducted a successful maiden flight in May 2017 at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport. Currently, four of them are in testing. A total of six prototypes of the jetliner will undergo intensive flight tests.Launched in 2008, the C919 project is China's first attempt to break the Airbus and Boeing duopoly in more than three decades, after its Y-10 jetliner project was abandoned in the mid-1980s.The aircraft is set to compete against the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737 series. It will be able to carry up to 168 passengers and has a maximum flight range of about 5,500 km.To date, COMAC has received 815 orders for the C919 from 28 buyers worldwide, according to the company.

                North Carolina faces 'long night' as Dorian's Bahamas toll rises to 30
            </a>
            <p>
                CHARLESTON/MARSH HARBOUR, United States - North Carolina braced for a "long night" of strong winds and driving rain as Hurricane Dorian moved near the US state's coast on Friday after devastating the northern Bahamas, where it left at least 30 people dead and thousands homeless.Authorities in the state of Florida - which was largely spared by the storm - blamed six more deaths on the hurricane, US media reported, though they occurred as the victims were preparing for the storm's arrival or were evacuation-related."Dorian should remain a powerful hurricane as the center moves near or along the coast of North Carolina," the Miami-based National Hurricane Center, or NHC, said on Friday morning, after downgrading it to a Category 1 storm.It warned that although weakening, the hurricane was still packing winds of 150 kilometers per hour, with some areas of the Carolina coast forecast to see dangerous storm surges of up to 2.1 meters and between six and 12 inches of rain."We know we're in for a long night and we'll be eager to see the sunshine in the morning," North Carolina's Governor Roy Cooper told CNN on Thursday night.The slow-moving monster storm also spawned several tornadoes but there were no immediate reports of casualties.US President Donald Trump said on social media that he had spoken to the governors of North and South Carolina, telling them he is "ready to assist".Dorian was a Category 5 hurricane - the highest on the five-level wind scale - when it slammed into the northern Bahamas on Sunday, leaving a trail of immense destruction.The full extent of the damage in the northern Bahamas was becoming known on Thursday as rescue teams fanned out searching for survivors and bringing relief to victims.Bahamas' Prime Minister Hubert Minnis told CNN that at least 30 people were killed in the storm, which caused what he called "generational devastation".The death toll is expected to rise as an international humanitarian effort to help the Caribbean country gains momentum.The United Nations announced the purchase of eight tons of ready-to-eat meals and said it will provide satellite communications equipment and airlift storage units, generators and prefab offices to set up logistics hubs. UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said about 70,000 people "are in immediate need of lifesaving assistance" on Grand Bahama and Abaco.A British Royal Navy ship docked at Abaco and distributed supplies to hurricane survivors. On Grand Bahama, a Royal Caribbean cruise ship dropped off 10,000 meals, 10,000 bottles of water and more than 180 generators, as well as diapers and flashlights.American Airlines said it flew a Boeing 737 from Miami to Nassau to drop off 14,000 pounds of relief supplies. The airline is also giving frequent-flyer points to customers who donate at least $25 to the Red Cross.AGENCIES

                China's aerospace capabilities on display at Russia air show
            </a>
            <p>
                Domestically developed drones, carrier rockets, amphibious plane showcasedAs a rising power in the global aerospace sphere, China is rapidly increasing its presence in the international market and making use of all suitable occasions to promote its planes, drones and carrier rockets.At the International Aviation and Space Salon 2019 held from Aug 27 to Sept 1 in Zhukovsky, a small town near Moscow, China displayed a host of its latest products.Aviation Industry Corp of China, the State-owned aircraft giant, showcased models of the domestically developed AG600 Kunlong seaplane, the world's newest and largest amphibious aircraft, and the Wing Loong armed drone series at the biennial Russian air show, also known as MAKS 2019.With a length of 37 meters and a wingspan of 38.8 meters, the AG600 is roughly the size of a Boeing 737.Powered by four domestically designed WJ-6 turboprop engines, it has a maximum takeoff weight of 53.5 metric tons. It is the world's biggest amphibious aircraft, surpassing Japan's ShinMaywa US-2 and Russia's Beriev Be-200.The seaplane will mainly be tasked with aerial firefighting, and maritime search and rescue operations. It can also be refitted to conduct marine environmental inspections, marine resource surveys as well as personnel and supply transport, according to AVIC.It is designed for ground-and water-based takeoffs and landings and has an operational range of about 4,500 kilometers. It can carry more than 50 people.When assigned to fight forest fires, it can collect 12 tons of water from a lake or sea in 20 seconds and use it to douse blazes over an area of about 4,000 square meters, the company said."If the seaplane is put into service, it will be able to extensively reduce economic losses caused by natural disasters," Li Yang, an AVIC marketing manager for the AG600, said at the MAKS 2019.Li said mass production of the AG600 is expected to start in 2023 after the aircraft's scheduled receipt of all necessary certificates from the Civil Aviation Administration of China.Two AG600 prototypes are currently undergoing tests. Designers and engineers are preparing for the first prototype to carry out sea-based flight tests, he said.As the major military equipment from AVIC showcased at the Russian air show, Wing Loong I and II combat drones, developed by AVIC's Chengdu Aircraft Design and Research Institute, feature advanced designs, reasonable prices, easy-to-use controls and reliable technical support, information from the company said.They are capable of reconnaissance and surveillance, electronic jamming, targeted strikes and border patrols. Besides military operations, they can perform civilian tasks such as disaster monitoring, environmental inspections, resource surveys and meteorological research, according to Wang Yaoxin, vice-president of China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corp, an AVIC subsidiary and the biggest exporter of aviation defense products in China.China is in talks with several countries on cooperation projects concerning these drones, he said.According to AVIC, at least 100 Wing Loong I units have been delivered to foreign users, and Wing Loong II has received at least one foreign contract.Wang Yanan, editor-in-chief of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, said the AG600 may be of interest to countries with extensive coastlines or many islands because the seaplane is suitable for maritime operations as it is much faster and more flexible than ships.Speaking of the Wing Loong drones, he said they must be attractive to many foreign militaries that have no combat drones and seek affordable ones."The Chinese drones sell well in the international market and perform well in battle, which wins them a good reputation. Moreover, they can be refitted to adopt foreign weapons, offering more options to users," the editor said.China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, a major defense and space contractor in China, featured its Kuaizhou 11, said by its designers to be China's largest and most powerful solid propellant carrier rocket, at the MAKS 2019.It is scheduled to make its debut flight at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China before the end of this year.It will be mainly tasked with ferrying small satellites to low-Earth or sun-synchronous orbits with altitudes ranging from 400 kilometers to 1,500 km.Kuaizhou 11 has a length of 25 meters, a diameter of 2.2 m, and a liftoff weight of 78 metric tons. It can place a 1-ton payload into a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 700 km, or a 1.5-ton payload into a low-Earth orbit, the company said.Chinese private firms also used the air show as a window for their technologies and products.LandSpace, a Beijing-based space startup and one of the leading private rocket makers in China, brought scale models of its carrier rockets to the MAKS 2019 and announced during the event that it has begun inviting payload partners from around the globe to consider using its ZQ 2 liquid-propellant, medium-lift rocket.Zhang Long, president of Land-Space, said that ZQ 2's debut mission in 2021 will ferry several small satellites to a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of about 500 kilometers, adding that some domestic and foreign firms have reached out to his company and expressed interest.The ZQ 2 will be capable of placing 2-ton payloads into a sun-synchronous orbit of 500 km or 4-ton satellites into a low-Earth orbit at altitude of 200 km.DJI, the world's leading consumer drone maker, showed multiple industry drones to the air show visitors. It said its products are in service with Russia's major infrastructure operators, such as Russian Railways and Moscow United Electric Grid.China was the country partner at the event this year.

                Boeing Max jet's return could vary by region
            </a>
            <p>
                          Regulators worldwide may recertify the Boeing 737 Max jet for commercial service at different times, creating a staggered return of the plane and underscoring a lack of trust in the US Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, an industry expert said.              In the past, overseas regulators have generally followed the lead of the FAA and accepted its findings, but that may change after crashes of the two Max jets that killed a total of 346.                  Investigators have focused on the Max's anti-stall device that may have erroneously pointed the nose of the planes down to avoid a midair stall and into a fatal plunge.                      "The FAA and its oversight by Congress resulted in destroying the reputation built on half a century of certification expertise," James Hall, managing partner of Hall and Associates in Washington and a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, told China Daily. "When the FAA failed to ground the aircraft after the first accident or immediately after the second, the FAA forfeited its leadership on aviation issues."                          Hall has criticized FAA's use of Boeing employees as part of the process to declare a plane safe. In an opinion article published in The New York Times, he called it a "worrying move toward industry self-certification".                              Patrick Ky of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said the FAA's worldwide reputation is in a "very difficult situation".                                  "It's likely that international authorities will want a second - or third - opinion," he told CNN. "And (that) was not the case one year ago. I think that's going to be a very strong change in the overall worldwide hierarchy or relationship between the different authorities."                                      Some analysts said technological innovation in contemporary planes has outstripped the ability of regulators to keep up with advancements. They note that the FAA's practice of relying on industry insiders is no different from the US Food and Drug Administration's reliance on experts from the companies it regulates.                                          "I think it's just concern on the part of some regulatory agencies that withdrew their airworthiness certificates before the FAA did," Robert Mann, president of US consulting agency RW Mann and Co told China Daily.                                              "It shows their comfort level is different from the FAA's comfort level. I don't see it as anything other than having a different point of view on how the aircraft is tested for recertification and how pilot training ought to be handled."                                                  The FAA said review of the software update continues for the Max jet's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, the anti-stall system implicated in the two crashes.                                                      "The FAA has a transparent and collaborative relationship with other civil aviation authorities as we continue our review of changes to software on the Boeing 737 Max," the agency said in a statement. "Our first priority is safety, and we have set no time frame for when the work will be completed."                                                          scottreeves@chinadailyusa.com                                                              (China Daily 09/12/2019 page12)
