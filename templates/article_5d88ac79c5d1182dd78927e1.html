            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - US billionaire Tom Steyer on Sunday became the 11th Democratic candidate to qualify for the next round of debates.Steyer's campaign announced that Steyer have met both the support rate and donor numbers needed to participate in the next round of debate slated for October.A CBS poll released Sunday showed Steyer enjoying 2 percent support rate among Democratic voters, giving Steyer the fourth poll with 2 percent support rate.To qualify for the next round of debates, a candidate must have four polls with at least 2 percent support rate and 130,000 individual donors, which Steyer achieved in August.The accomplishment for Steyer came too late to put him into the third round of debate in September, which will have 10 candidates.Tulsi Gabbard, a Congresswoman from Hawaii, also moved closer to the debate stage with a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Saturday, bagging her third poll with at least 2 percent support rate. She has also met the donor threshold.Both the CBS and Post-ABC poll shows former Vice President Joe Biden and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren with clear advantages over other candidates.

                    In sharp exchanges, Democrats go after front-runner Biden, Harris
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Joe Biden had to fend off attacks Wednesday during a Democratic presidential primary debate about his stances on health care, immigration and criminal justice, as several Democrats trailing in the polls looked to increase their standing.Ten candidates faced off on the stage of the Fox Theatre in Detroit, Michigan, one night after 10 other Democratic hopefuls clashed on the same stage.US Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, in calling out the former vice-president on favoring giving visas to "PhDs", said it was that type of division on immigration that Republicans were supporting. Booker also chastised Biden for invoking "President Obama more than anyone in this campaign".Biden went back at Booker over his tenure as mayor of Newark, New Jersey, saying Booker hired (former New York City Republican mayor and Donald Trump adviser) "Rudy Giuliani's police chief".Booker criticized Biden's support of a 1994 crime bill that the senator said disproportionately affected minority citizens."There are people right now in prison for life for drug offenses," Booker said, accusing Biden of using "phony rhetoric" in touting the crime bill. "I believe in redemption. You offered no redemption."New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who in his second debate again made a move to be heard over the fray, asked Biden if he had counseled former president Barack Obama against deportations of undocumented immigrants.Biden said his conversations with the president were private."You still haven't answered my question," de Blasio replied.US Senator Kamala Harris of California, who pressured Biden in the June debates by criticizing his opposition to school busing to integrate schools in the 1970s, found herself fending off attacks on her own record as California attorney general.Biden said Harris did nothing about racial polarization in public schools in San Francisco and Los Angeles.US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii said Harris put 1,500 people in prison for marijuana convictions and "laughed when she was asked if she smoked marijuana". Gabbard said Harris "actually blocked evidence" that would have freed a death row prisoner.Entrepreneur Andrew Yang, whose parents came to the US from Taiwan, said the candidates should have been talking about all the jobs lost to artificial intelligence."We've already automated away millions of manufacturing jobs," Yang said. "Amazon is closing 30 percent of America's stores and malls and paying zero in taxes."Earlier in the debate, Biden opposed the "Medicare for all" approach to the American healthcare system, an issue that was prominent in Tuesday's debate and favored by top-tier candidates, the senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts."You can't beat President Trump with double talk on this plan," Biden told Harris. "The plan no matter how you cut it costs $3 trillion. It will require middle-class taxes to go up, not down.""In 2019 in America for a Democrat to be running for president with a plan that does not cover everyone, I think is without excuse," Harris countered."The ultimate choice is an election," de Blasio said. "This should be the party that stands for universal healthcare."Booker, who said "we spend more than every other nation" on health care, said pitting progressives versus moderates on the issue was self-defeating.On trade with China, Gabbard said that US tariffs on China have had a "ravaging and devastating effect" on American farmers.Biden said he would "renegotiate" the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed trade agreement from which Trump withdrew the US."Either China is going to write the rules on 21st century trade or we are," Biden said.US Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, when the issue of racial polarization was addressed, said: "I can explain to white women in the suburbs that when their son is walking down the street with a bag of M&Ms in his pocket, wearing a hoodie, his whiteness is what protects him from not being shot."Also on the stage Wednesday were US Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado; Julian Castro of Texas, former secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and Washington state Governor Jay Inslee.

                    US Representative Seth Moulton ends bid for Democratic presidential nomination

            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - US Representative Seth Moulton, who mounted a long-shot bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, ended his campaign on Friday, warning that the party must now decide how far left it wants to move."But today, I want to use this opportunity ... to announce that I am ending my campaign for president," Moulton was to say at a speech before a Democratic National Committee meeting in San Francisco, according to remarks provided by his campaign."Though this campaign is not ending the way we hoped, I am leaving this race knowing that we raised issues that are vitally important to the American people and our future."Moulton, a 40-year-old Iraq War veteran who represents a district in Massachusetts, failed to garner the support he needed to qualify for the Democratic debates. Without appearing in the debates, he had little hope of gaining traction.Moulton stopped short of endorsing one of his rivals for the nomination, but said the race appears to have narrowed."I think it's evident that this is now a three-way race between (former Vice President Joe) Biden, (US Senator Elizabeth) Warren and (US Senator Bernie) Sanders, and really it's a debate about how far left the party should go,” Moulton told the New York Times in an interview ahead of his announcement.He built a political career by challenging the party's establishment including after the Democrats took control of the US House of Representatives in 2018, when Moulton helped organize opposition to Representative Nancy Pelosi's bid to again become speaker of the House. He failed at that effort.Reuters

                    2020 election poll: Warren, Sanders catch Biden
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                With about 15 months to go before the 2020 US presidential election, the battle among Democrats over who will face Donald Trump is showing more clarity.A Monmouth University poll released Monday shows Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in a virtual dead heat.However, the poll also shows that the heretofore front-runner Biden has lost ground to Warren, US senator from Massachusetts, and Sanders, US senator from Vermont. They both polled at 20 percent, with Biden at 19."The main takeaway from this poll is that the Democratic race has become volatile," said Patrick Murray, who runs the polling institute at Monmouth in West Long Branch, New Jersey. "Liberal voters are starting to cast about for a candidate they can identify with. Moderate voters, who have been paying less attention, seem to be expressing doubts about Biden."Biden, former vice-president under Barack Obama, has had some verbal miscues on the campaign trail recently, mistaking his location in New Hampshire for Vermont and misidentifying the cities where two recent mass shootings occurred."But they are swinging more toward one of the left-leaning contenders with high name recognition rather than toward a lesser-known candidate who might be more in line with them politically," Murray said.Biden, 76, has looked to stake a more moderate ground, and his campaign has promoted him as the "most electable", meaning the candidate who would give the Democrats the best chance to defeat Trump, 73. Warren, 70, and Sanders, 77, an advocate of socialist policies, represent the progressive wing of the party.According to the Monmouth poll, Biden has lost support over the past two months among Democrats who call themselves moderate or conservative (from 40 percent to 22 percent), with the shift among these voters accruing to both Sanders (from 10 percent to 20 percent) and Warren (from 6 percent to 16 percent). Biden also lost support among liberals (from 24 percent to 15 percent).The poll of 800 voters included 298 people considered registered Democrats or Democratic-leaning. It had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.7 percent within that group and was conducted by telephone from Aug 16 to 20."It's important to keep in mind this is just one snapshot from one poll," Murray said. "But it does raise warning signs of increased churning in the Democratic nomination contest now that voters are starting to pay closer attention."The Biden campaign said in a statement that the poll was based on a relatively small sample size, and that an average of polls by RealClearPolitics has him ahead of the field, The New York Times reported.US Senator Kamala Harris was fourth in the Monmouth poll with 8 percent. Harris had gotten a bounce in the polls in June after she called out Biden in the first debate for his opposition to busing to racially integrate schools in the 1970s.But in the next debate, in July, Harris faced sharp criticism by another Democratic presidential candidate, US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, for her record as California attorney general. Harris has since dropped to single digits in several polls.The Monmouth poll is one of those approved by the Democratic National Committee for deciding which candidates qualify for primary debates.The next round of Democratic debates will be held Sept 12-13 at Texas Southern University in Houston. The 10 candidates who have already qualified for those debates are Biden, Sanders, Warren, Harris, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana; former HUD secretary Julián Castro; Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas; and entrepreneur Andrew Yang, whose parents were born in Taiwan.

                    Third debate for Democrats a fiery one
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Democratic presidential candidates tackled the US-China trade dispute at their third debate Thursday, with most criticizing President Donald's Trump handling of it.Entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who was the first to be asked about the trade issue, said: "I would not appeal the tariffs on day one, but I would let the Chinese know we have to hammer out a deal. We have to let the Chinese know that we recognize that President Trump has pursued an arbitrary and haphazard trade policy."Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, used one of Trump's one liners against him. Buttigieg said Trump earlier this year derisively said he would like to see him try to negotiate with President Xi Jinping of China."I'd like to see him make a deal with President Xi Jinping," the mayor said.US Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota talked about bins of soybeans sitting in the Midwest with no market because of the trade deal. She said Trump is "treating farmers like poker chips in one of his casinos".US Senator Kamala Harris of California said the US needs to partner with China on the climate and North Korea.US Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said US trade policy is working for "giant multinational corporations", and she would like to see unions and environmentalists at the trade negotiating table.Testy exchanges on healthcare also stood out, as the candidates argued whether Medicare for All was better than combining private insurance with a public option."I, who wrote the damn bill, intend to eliminate all out-of-pocket expenses, all deductibles, all co-payments. … no more than $200 a year for prescription drugs. We're going to stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry," US Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont bellowed."And while Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill," Klobuchar rebutted, taking a more centrist stance. "And on … page 8 of the bill, it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it. And that means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance.""We are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on Earth, Sanders said. "We have got to recognize this country is moving to an oligarchical form of society where a handful of billionaires" control everything.Former vice-president Joe Biden clashed with Sanders and US Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on the cost of Medicare for All. Biden said their healthcare plans would increase taxes on the middle class. He said his plan "costs $740 billion. It doesn't cost $30 trillion" in reference to Medicare for All.
