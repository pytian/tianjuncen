                Bianca Andreescu beats Serena Williams in US Open final
            </p>
            <p>
                NEW YORK — Bianca Andreescu displayed the same brand of big-serving, big-hitting, in-your-face tennis that Serena Williams usually does.And now the 19-year-old from Canada is a Grand Slam champion, earning her first such title while preventing Williams from collecting a record-tying 24th.Andreescu took charge early in the US Open final, going up by a set and two breaks, then held off a late charge by Williams to win 6-3, 7-5 for the championship Saturday night."Being able to play on this stage against Serena, a true legend in this sport, is amazing," said Andreescu, who was appearing in her first major final, while Williams was in her 33rd. "Oh, man, it wasn't easy at all."This is the second year in a row that Williams has lost in the final at Flushing Meadows. This one had none of the controversy of 2018, when she got into an extended argument with the chair umpire while being beaten by Naomi Osaka.Williams has now been the runner-up at four of the seven majors she has entered since returning to the tour after having a baby two years ago. The 37-year-old American remains stuck on 23 Grand Slam singles titles, one shy of Margaret Court's mark for the most in history."I'm just so proud that I'm out here and competing at this level. My team has been so supportive through all the ups and downs and downs and downs and downs," Williams said. "Hopefully, we'll have some ups soon."Andreescu, the first player from Canada to win a major singles title, went up 5-1 in the second set and served for the victory there, even holding a match point at 40-30. But Williams erased that with a forehand return winner off a 105 mph serve.That launched a four-game run for Williams, who broke Andreescu again to make it 5-all."I was just fighting at that point," said Williams, a six-time US Open champion. "Just trying to stay out there a little bit longer."The Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd was overwhelmingly supporting Williams, not surprisingly, and spectators got so loud as she tried to put together a successful comeback that Andreescu covered her ears with her hands after one point."I just tried to block everything out," Andreescu said afterward. "I'm just glad with how I managed, really."Suddenly, this was a contest.Or so it seemed.But as well as Andreescu handled everything — herself, her far-more-experienced and successful opponent, and even the moment — Williams was far from her best, especially while serving. She got broken for the sixth time in the final game.This was the largest age gap in a Grand Slam final, and it came almost exactly 20 years to the day since Williams won the US Open for her first major title in 1999, a year before Andreescu was born.Andreescu is the first woman to win the trophy at Flushing Meadows in her main-draw tournament debut in the Open era, which started in 1968 when professionals were allowed into Grand Slam tournaments. She only has participated in four majors in her brief career.Just think: A year ago, Andreescu was losing in the opening round of qualifying. On Saturday, there she was, putting her hands on her head, dropping her racket and then pumping her fists when it ended. After a hug from a smiling Williams at the net, Andreescu kissed the blue court and rolled onto her back, soaking in the applause.About two hours earlier, the 15th-seeded Andreescu was standing in the hallway leading from the locker room to the court, doing a prematch interview in which she sounded like someone whose mind was as confident as her play would soon be, saying, "I'm just going to take it like it's any other match."She began the day with a 33-4 record in 2019, including 7-0 against top-10 opponents, and without a loss in a completed match since March 1. Andreescu missed a chunk of time in that span with a shoulder injury, which clearly is no longer hindering her.Andreescu took it to Williams, figuratively and literally. Andreescu produced the kind of power Williams is more accustomed to dishing out than dealing with from the other side of the net. One shot went right at Williams, who leaped to avoid the ball at the baseline.And Andreescu was fearless, always pushing, always aggressive, punctuating plenty of winners with cries of "Come on!" — the way Williams does — or "Let's go!"Even her coin-toss choice showed just how bold she is: Andreescu opted to receive, a decision that at first glance might have seemed unusual, given that she was facing the woman generally regarded as the possessor of the greatest serve in the game, now or ever.On this day, though, it worked out. Williams double-faulted eight times in all, including three times on break point, part of her 33 unforced errors, nearly twice as many as Andreescu's 17.There were other ways in which Williams was not at her best, seemingly unsure of herself, including one odd-looking check-swing on a backhand in the second set that then let Andreescu put a shot away to go up 4-1.When she was 16, Andreescu wrote herself a fake US Open winner's check, part of her efforts to visualize success. Kept updating the amount of prize money as it rose in real life.On Saturday night, she really did get that champion's check, to the tune of $3.85 million.AP

                NY 'tiger mom' hothouses nine daughters with Mandarin lessons
            </a>
            <p>
                It is not uncommon for non-Chinese heritage people to learn Mandarin nowadays as the world's oldest written language is becoming increasingly popular with the rapid rise of China.But it is phenomenal that 58-year-old Lynn Berat, who holds two PhDs from Yale University, kind of "forced" her nine daughters to learn Mandarin from infancy in a bid to have them well-prepared to be what she called "citizens of the world".Completely bilingual Berat fell in love with Chinese culture when she was giving lectures at Peking University in early 1980s. She quickly realized the Chinese language is "pictographic" and "very different" from Indo-European languages."It requires a greater effort than a language with an alphabet. Chinese seemed to be something that they (her children) should learn from infancy," Berat said."If they were going to learn it, then they needed to be completely bilingual. And so we're working on that," she said.Berat has actually created a purely Mandarin speaking environment for her nine girls, now aged from 11-19, ever since they were born: a Mandarin-speaking nanny, a Chinese/English bilingual kindergarten and primary school as well as various extracurricular courses including Chinese dances, musical instruments and chorus."So their life has really been sort of all Chinese all the time," Berat said. "Living in New York, it's been possible to immerse them deeply in Chinese language and culture."The New York metropolitan area is home to the largest Chinese population outside Asia, with the number of Chinese Americans estimated at about 800,000.Interestingly, when Berat's youngest ones, twin sisters Logan and Lachlan attended the bilingual Pre-K at the age of 4, both of them easily passed the Chinese test but failed in the assessment of English.It was such a "highly irregular thing" for children whose parent's home language was English. They would have been sent to a school for children with "severe learning disabilities" if the teacher and the principal had not known the stories of their older sisters."I have to say you have no idea how proud I am of that because to me, it meant that they were really working hard with their brains for Chinese. It kind of indicates the degree of our commitment to the Chinese."Apart from Chinese, all her girls have also learnt Spanish and French, and can speak Albanian, which is Berat's mother tongue.

                15-year-old American Gauff's US Open run ends against Osaka
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW YORK — First, the tears came from Coco Gauff, as the 15-year-old American's US Open came to an end against defending champion and No. 1 seed Naomi Osaka.Then it was Osaka's turn to cry, moments after comforting Gauff with a hug and some words of encouragement Saturday night.Gauff has generated all sorts of attention already by making it to the second week at Wimbledon in July and becoming the youngest woman to win two matches at Flushing Meadows since 1996. In this much-hyped showdown under the lights in Arthur Ashe Stadium that ended 6-3, 6-0 in Osaka's favor, Gauff often looked exactly like what she is: an immensely talented player who is still learning her way at tennis' top level.She pounded serves at up to 119 mph but also double-faulted seven times.She overcame a slow start to get within 4-3 in the opening set but also then dropped the last eight games in a row."She told me I did amazing," Gauff said during an unusual on-court interview for a match's loser, something that was Osaka's idea, knowing the way the packed house was supporting her opponent.

                Nadal edges Medvedev for 4th US Open title, 19th Slam trophy
            </a>
            <p>
                NEW YORK — Rafael Nadal held off a strong comeback bid to win his 19th Grand Slam title by edging Daniil Medvedev 7-5, 6-3, 5-7, 4-6, 6-4 in a thrilling US Open final that lasted nearly five hours Sunday.This one was not easy for the second-seeded Nadal. Not at all. That's because after Nadal grabbed the opening two sets and went up a break in third, Medvedev mounted a charge, shifting styles and rattling Nadal.Medvedev broke in the last game of each of the next two sets to force a fifth. But his attempt to become the first man since 1949 to win a US Open final after trailing by two sets to none came up just short.Nadal broke to lead 3-2 in the fifth and again for 5-2. But he failed to serve out the victory there, double-faulting on break point, then couldn't convert two match points at 5-3.At 5-4, Nadal saved a break point, and finally converted his third championship point to earn his fourth trophy at Flushing Meadows.Add that to 12 at the French Open, two at Wimbledon and one at the Australian Open, and Nadal is now only one major trophy behind Roger Federer for the most by a man in tennis history.AP

                Sustainability struts at Fashion Week
            </a>
            <p>
                Movement raises consciousness in glamorous industry accused of contributing to pollutionThe models will be on the catwalk, the photographers and celebrities in the front rows as Fashion Week gets underway in New York.And though it won't be taking center stage with the glamorous clothes, the sustainable fashion movement is gaining increasing attention from the global apparel-making industry.Its aim is to get the industry — from luxurious clothing designers and makers to producers of cheaply made fast fashion — to recognize itself as a major environmental polluter with inefficient and costly production that wastes raw materials and adds to greenhouse emissions by using excessive amounts of energy.Sustainability is becoming one of the first things newcomers learn as they enter this industry, as experienced by He Binli, a recent graduate from the Parsons School of Design in New York. The young designer is planning a debut show in this year's Fashion Week that kicked off Friday with women's spring-summer 2020 shows.During her two years at Parsons, the 26-year-old He, from Guangzhou, China, frequented local Goodwill thrift stores. They are her go-to places for fabrics and secondhand clothes that fuel her explorations in the field.Designing with recycled material, a practice welcomed by the school, is one way that He is involved with sustainable fashion, a movement getting increasing attention from the clothes-making industry, estimated at $2.5 trillion globally by consultancy McKinsey in 2017.Industry leaders and much smaller enterprises also are increasingly adopting the concept.The movement is also taking aim at consumers who throw away used clothes that end up in landfills. Much of that clothing contains synthetics that are not biodegradable, which increases pollution.In New York City alone, 200 million pounds of clothing ends up at city landfills every year, according to the World Economic Forum.Swedish fast-fashion brand H&M initiated a recycling program that rewards customers with discounts when they send in used clothes. Zara and Ralph Lauren also have launched special product lines or sustainability-focused campaigns."It is slowly becoming mainstream now that we know the full truth of our impact, and brands can't get away with hurting people or the environment any longer," said Tara James, founder and designer of sustainable fashion brand Study NY.The industry contributes to around 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions due to its many supply chains and energy-intensive production, according to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and it consumes more energy than the aviation and shipping industries combined.The production of clothes also costs and pollutes a significant amount of water. Cumulatively, the clothing industry produces about 20 percent of global wastewater, according to UNFCCC. The international organization pointed out that producing a pair of denim jeans alone can take as much as 24.6 gallons of water.The push for profits has been stopping companies from manufacturing in an environmentally friendly manner, say industry insiders and observers."They want to keep their profit margins," said Lauren Fey, founder of the New Fashion Initiative, a New York-based nonprofit dedicated to highlighting environmental and social impacts of the fashion industry.It would be costly if the companies "slow down, review their processes and implement changes in production", she said."Larger brands can be reluctant to change their established list of suppliers fearing that they will encounter higher prices or lack of consistency," said James.With the fashion industry being "notoriously opaque", companies can find it challenging to trace their supply chains all the way to the farm or fiber stage, she explained."These corporations do not know what is going on in their supply chain," said Stephanie Benedetto, CEO and co-founder of Queen of Raw, a digital marketplace for unused fabrics.When companies expand rapidly, and their supply chain consists of more than 10 tiers of suppliers, the wasting of raw materials becomes inevitable, Benedetto said, and the excess fabric that sits in companies' warehouses is worth as much as $120 billion.The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a UK-based charity group advocating a sustainable economy, estimates that 87 percent of the total fiber input used for clothing is landfilled or incinerated during productions or after purchases.Fast fashion, the contemporary production model where cheap clothing is made rapidly to feed consumer demand driven by trends, is a major source of waste, according to industry insiders."We now see a rapidly growing resale market for luxury and other well-made brands. However, because of the cheaply constructed nature of fast fashion, it doesn't have a very high resale value and is so overly abundant," thus it is more likely to end up in landfills rather than consignment shops, said James.However unsustainable fast fashion is, it is lucrative because of booming consumer demand, Benedetto said.Consumers favor fast-fashion products because they make the concept of being fashionable accessible to many more people, said James, who believes the entire apparel industry is to blame for making fashion disposable and by introducing the concept that "clothing should only be worn once for social media''."This ultimately will change when enough consumers are educated about the complexity of the issues and demand transparency, living wages and less environmental impact," said Fey, who is seeing millennials and Gen Z embracing used clothing and shopping for used goods.James, who started designing sustainable fashion more than a decade ago, is seeing significantly more sustainable materials available for designers. Sustainability also has come to the forefront of most fashion education, at least at New York's schools, said James, who has taught at Parsons, Pratt and the Fashion Institute of Technology."We see both a dynamic network of private and public sector stakeholders focusing on and addressing pieces of sustainable fashion from organic dyes and water use, to electric vehicles in product transportation and material use in-store designs," Wagner said.
