                African nation sees huge change in development of infrastructure Zimbabwe is beginning to reap economic benefits from infrastructure projects financed and built by China, barely a few months after some of the projects were commissioned. A survey compiled and released last month by hospitality group Africa Albida Tourism, entitled Africa's Living Soul: A Tourism Survey of the Victoria Falls Region, revealed a 50 percent growth in international tourist arrivals into Victoria Falls, from all key sources markets in 2015, which follows the refurbishment of Victoria Falls International Airport in 2016.  Harare Power Station, one of Zesa's five energy producing stations. Zimbabwe suffers from a major power deficit. Tonderayi Mukeredzi / For China Daily.A loan from Exim Bank of China and an upgrade of the airport by China Jiangsu International Co has increased the terminal's capacity to 1.5 million passengers per year. The survey by Africa Albida noted that international visitors to the Victoria Falls Rainforest (Zimbabwe side only) rose by 36 percent between 2015 and 2017. "Hotel room stays increased by 20 percent over the two-year period, indicating an increased use of alternative accommodation options on the Victoria Falls Zimbabwean side of the river," observed the Ross Kennedy hospitality group. "Area arrivals surpassed 500,000 in 2017. Arrival growth has continued into 2018 with a 26 percent increase in total rainforest visitors in the first half of the year. Foreign visitor number growth rose 28 percent versus 15 percent local." Arrivals into Victoria Falls from China, one of Zimbabwe's key source markets, also rose from a paltry 983 in 2016 to 5,359 in 2017. Many important new air links were opened up by the airport's upgrade, with many international airlines now landing at Victoria Falls, one of the seven wonders of the world. In the energy sector, Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority CEO Josh Chifamba said last month that energy imports had fallen by nearly 50 percent during the second quarter of the year, after the power utility increased generation at Kariba South Hydro Power plant by 300 megawatts. "We have significantly reduced power imports in the second quarter (compared to the first quarter) because we are now getting optimum output from Kariba," Chifamba told The Herald, a local newspaper. The expansion of Kariba, commissioned in March this year, was undertaken by Chinese construction and engineering giant Sinohydro Group through $533 million of Chinese funding. China Jiangsu International Co was once again tasked with modernizing the Robert Mugabe International Airport to enhance the airport's annual passenger handling capacity from the current 2.5 million to 6 million. The airport upgrade is being funded by a $165 million loan from Exim Bank of China and will be completed after three years. China is also financing the expansion of the Hwange Power Station - at an estimated cost of $1.5 billion. Works on the massive project, which upon completion in 2022 will add a further 600 MW to the national grid, has already begun and is being undertaken by SynoHydro. The two Chinese funded power projects are expected to help Zimbabwe become self-sufficient in power generation. Currently, the country has a peak power demand of 2,000 MW, but only produces 1,452 MW, leaving a shortfall of about 600 MW, which is met through costly imports from neighbouring nations. During the last decade, Zimbabwe has suffered from an infrastructure finance deficit, estimated at US $1.5 billion by the Infrastructure Development Bank of Zimbabwe, in 2016. The lack of adequate, reliable, affordable and sustainable infrastructure has caused a debilitating energy burden on consumers, but that is all in the past. Elsewhere, Inspur Group Co Ltd has built the Zimbabwe Centre for High Performance Computers at the University of Zimbabwe for $5.5 million, endowing the country with Africa's second largest supercomputer, and becoming the fourth African to own such a facility. Nathaniel Zhang, deputy director of Inspur Zimbabwe, said work on the $5 million phase-two of the ZCHPC has begun. "We have also developed the national information data center for government, which is an e-governance platform that allows various ministries to share information, for a cost of $6 million," Zhang told China Daily.
