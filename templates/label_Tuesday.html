                            NEW DELHI - Indian space scientists on Tuesday were desperately trying to establish communication with their broken moon lander that went silent moments before it was due to make a historic soft landing. The Press Trust of India news agency reported on Monday that the lander was unbroken but was lying tilted on the lunar surface, and that the chances of restoring communication were low. The fresh image of the crash-landed lander, called Vikram - after the founder of India's space program - was said to have been obtained by the onboard camera of the unmanned moon orbiter, which continues to be in a perfect condition

It means South Korea will no longer enjoy minimum trade restrictions on sensitive goods including electronic components, and Japanese companies must receive case-by-case approval from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan before such goods can be exported

                            Tang Ke, chief of the market and economic information department at the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said in mid-July that the spread of African swine fever had slashed the population of hog herds in China and that this would result in strained supply of pork products during the second half of this year, pressuring businesses to raise prices.Pig farmers who are required to slaughter infected hogs will receive subsidies within three months, half the previous period of six months, according to a statement jointly released by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs on Wednesday.China plans to boost financial support for pig farmers to stabilize production after the spread of African swine fever has reduced herds in the country
