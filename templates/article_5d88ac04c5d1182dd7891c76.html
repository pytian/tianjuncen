                Sino-US trade talks expected to resume next week
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                China is unlikely to soften its position on issues concerning its core interests in upcoming consultations with the United States, experts said, as both countries are reportedly looking to resume talks sometime next week. Following the top leaders' meeting at the G20 summit last month, Reuters reported that top representatives of the US and China are planning an imminent return to the negotiating table to try to resolve their trade differences. The talks will continue in earnest this coming week, said White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow during a Wednesday briefing. "I don't know precisely when. They're on the phone. They're going to be on the phone this coming week and they'll be scheduling face-to-face meetings," Kudlow said.

                Upcoming Xi, Trump meet raises hopes for two countries to narrow differences The upcoming meeting between presidents of China and the United States in Japan has raised hopes for the two countries to narrow differences, but concrete efforts are still needed to reach a mutually beneficial deal, officials and experts said. President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump agreed in a phone conversation on Tuesday to meet on the sidelines of the Group of 20 Summit to be held in Osaka next week. The news, which came amid rising trade tensions between the two nations, boosted the stock market sentiment. The US Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 353 points, or 1.4 percent, on Tuesday. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Lu Kang said at a news conference on Wednesday that a mutually beneficial accord between China and the US not only conforms to the aspirations of the peoples of both countries, but also meets the expectations of international community. White House adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters that the market says talk is better than no talk. Xi agreed with Trump to have the two countries' trade teams maintain contact on how to solve the dispute, but he stressed that the two sides should solve their problems through dialogue on an equal footing, with the key being to accommodate each other's legitimate concerns. He also urged the US side to treat Chinese companies in a fair manner. China's Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai said in Washington on Tuesday that differences do not necessarily lead to confrontation for China and the US, and that the two countries should not allow disputes and disparities to define their relationship. He said the China-US relationship will remain one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world. They have far more common interests than differences, their cooperation far outweighs frictions, and cooperation is the only right choice for the two countries, he added. Observers said the two presidents have put the brakes on the escalating trade frictions but hurdles remain for the two countries in clinching a deal. The meeting the two leaders agreed upon sends a positive message to the world, which demonstrates that both countries have a stronger readiness to find a solution to the trade friction through negotiations and consultations, said Ruan Zongze, executive vice-president of the China Institute of International Studies. Ruan said that narrowing differences will not happen overnight, but the head-of-state diplomacy can play a significant role. US Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said the current moment is one of "increasing tensions" between the United States and China. "We need to work out our differences with mutual respect, and make sure that we recognize that it would be a big mistake if China and the United States were to somehow end up in a hugely adverse adversarial relationship," he said. Both will be better off if they maintain a strong dialogue and find a way forward where both countries can continue to prosper, he said. "We are competitors in many ways, but competitors can make each other better in many ways," Hollen said. "What we do not want, in my view, is to fall into some kind of new cold war going forward." The US Trade Representative's Office was holding hearings starting on Monday in which US business executives pleaded for officials to spare them from the effects of Trump's threat to impose tariffs on another $300 billion in Chinese imports, with levies up to 25 percent, on top of the $250 billion worth already targeted. Zhou Yuan, a senior researcher at the Oriental Think Tank in Beijing, said China and the US are in an interconnected and intertwined global village, and unilateralism can only lead to conflicts. A trade war, by its nature and throughout history, has been a lose-lose proposition, Zhou said. Contact the writers at caodesheng@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 06/20/2019 page3)

                    Huawei suppliers' stock rises
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                US decision to ease curbs on tech giant draws mixed response from analysts Shares of suppliers of Huawei Technologies Co surged on Monday after US President Donald Trump said he agreed to allow the Chinese technology giant to resume purchases of some components and software from the United States. But the decision to ease restrictions on Huawei received a mixed response from analysts. Many warned that the world's largest telecom equipment maker needs to remain vigilant and keep investing in core technologies. DBG Holdings Ltd, an electronics manufacturing service provider for Huawei, soared by the daily limit of 10 percent in Shenzhen, Guangdong province. Largan Precision, which supplies smartphone components to Huawei, also surged by the 10 percent daily limit in Taipei. The increases came after Trump said in a tweet, "At the request of our high-tech companies... I agreed to allow Chinese company Huawei to buy products from them which will not impact our national security." Lyu Tingjie, a professor at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, said this is positive news for Huawei's consumer-oriented business, with its smartphones and personal computers likely to be relieved of the pressure of being cut off from the operating systems of Google and Microsoft, both US tech companies. "The US government made a concession and knew banning Huawei would harm the US tech companies' interests. But it has failed to define what products will continue to be restricted. Huawei's core network and 5G base station business may still suffer from the ban," Lyu said. "Huawei must remain vigilant and continue investing in core technologies to perfect its backup plan," Lyu added. Last month, Washington added Huawei to its Entity List, which restricts companies from providing Huawei with technology originating in the US without government approval. On May 21, Huawei was granted a 90-day general license allowing it to keep the existing networks and issue updates to existing phones, tablets and other devices through mid-August. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said in two US television programs on Sunday that Huawei will remain on the US blacklist, and "what's happening now is simply a loosening-up for general merchandise", such as chips and software generally available around the world, but not products considered to have national security sensitivity, the Associated Press reported. Huawei did not comment on the latest development, but released a document on Saturday quoting founder Ren Zhengfei as saying, "The US Entity List is not a death threat for us." Ren reiterated that the company itself can supply all of its high-end core chipsets, though it may need some time to find replacements for some components. Wang Yanhui, secretary-general of the Mobile China Alliance, said easing restrictions gives the right amount of time that Huawei needs to find alternatives and accelerate the development of its own technologies, but the company needs to "remain wary of challenges ahead". China International Capital Corp, a securities company, said in a research note that restarting sales of some US products to Huawei has strengthened investors' confidence in the development of 5G in China. masi@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 07/02/2019 page3)

                    Senior US officials should respect the Osaka consensus
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Editor's note: The top leaders of China and the United States recently reached an important consensus on resuming economic and trade consultations on the basis of equality and mutual respect at their Osaka meeting, sending a positive signal to the international community and global market. However, shortly after the meeting, certain senior officials in the US once again voiced their old complaints casting a shadow over the prospect of the talks. Wu Yuehe, a columnist for People's Daily, comments: In a recent interview with the media, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said US President Donald Trump's decision to allow Huawei to buy US products does not amount to an "amnesty", and the US will continue to focus on such issues as intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and cyber theft. The underlying message in his remarks was inconsistent with the consensus between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump at the Osaka meeting. His remarks coincide with a few hawkish politicians in the US Congress openly calling for the containment of Huawei saying it is "one of the few effective leverages" to force China to make concessions, which reveals their ulterior motive. The essence of China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutual benefit and win-win results. The differences between the two sides should be resolved through dialogue and consultation on an equal footing. This requires sincerity and action from both parties. Trump's stance in Osaka - that the US would properly manage differences over trade and other areas with China, would not impose new tariffs on Chinese goods, and US companies could sell to Huawei equipment "without serious national security concerns" - raised hopes that the two sides would finally be able to reach an agreement. So Kudlow's recent remarks are, at the least, very disappointing.

                Semiconductor stocks rallied on the news that US President Donald Trump will allow Huawei to resume purchases from American companies, but the decision sparked strong opposition among Republicans and Democrats, underscoring short-term uncertainty and the possibility of long-term change in the industry.Investors bid up the shares of major Huawei suppliers, including Broadcom, Qualcomm, Micron Technology, Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo. The US semiconductor industry welcomed the apparent progress in the on-going US-China trade dispute."China is about 30 percent of the global market for semiconductors," Mike Russo, vice-president of SEMI, an advocacy group, told China Daily. "The industry as a whole and all nations involved benefit from access to markets. Companies re-invest profits in research and leverage new technology. Folks are jockeying for access — no one has sewn it up."Worldwide semiconductor sales totaled $468.8 billion in 2018. Sales are expected to drop 12 percent this year to $412.1 billion before posting moderate growth of about 5.4 percent in 2020, the Semiconductor Industry Association said.At the end of the G20 summit meeting in Osaka, Japan, on June 29, Trump said that sales to Huawei could proceed as long as they did not pose a "great, national emergency problem".Huawei executives have long expressed frustration over American officials' clamping down on the company without presenting evidence that Beijing could use Huawei products for espionage, as Washington has claimed for years.European and Asian officials have also complained privately that recent American intelligence briefings have not demonstrated clearly how the Chinese government has used Huawei to steal information.Huawei has challenged the rulings in federal court, arguing that Congress produced no proof that the company was a security threat before acting against it, and that it was being punished without due process, the New York Times reported.The United States government's latest argument in the case, outlined in a court filing last week, suggests that the Trump administration believes it may not have to produce conclusive evidence of past wrongdoing by Huawei to uphold at least some of its actions.Lawrence Kudlow, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said Trump did not offer a "general amnesty" to Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker.Kudlow said the company will remain on the Entity List that limits the export of technology that could compromise US national security.The development of new markets like cloud computing, self-driving vehicles and 5G wireless networks have made semiconductors one of the top-performing technology subsectors over the last three years.But Japan's recent trade restrictions on exports to South Korea may foreshadow what's ahead for the US and China if there is a nationalist shift in trade.South Korea announced that it may invest one trillion won (about $856.6 million) in equipment and materials needed to produce semiconductors and display panels after Tokyo decided to restrict exports. Tokyo expressed doubts about South Korea's trustworthiness when its courts ordered Japanese companies to compensate Koreans for forced labor in World War II.In 2010, Japan broadened its supply chain when China cut sales of rare-earth metals used in a range of high-tech applications. Japan now derives much of the needed materials from Australia and Vietnam. The US is reopening a rare-earth mine in California to diversify its supply.Despite a thaw in US-China trade negotiations, Huawei Technologies plans to develop its own mobile phone operating system after it lost access to Android software updates from Google due to US restrictions. If the US restricts exports of semiconductors to gain leverage in the trade dispute, China may seek to develop its own chips. That could cost US companies billions of dollars. Major Chinese Internet companies, including Alibaba Group, Tencent and Baidu spent a combined $15 billion on cloud computing services last year, or about 15 percent of worldwide expenditures."The trade fight also gives China even greater impetus to wean itself off American technology," New York investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a research report. "The country already was pursuing an aggressive plan to build up a homegrown semiconductor-design-and manufacturing industry.Trump had urged US allies not to purchase equipment from Huawei because it could be used for Chinese espionage. Huawei has denied the charge. While it's unclear if Trump's decision to relax restrictions on Huawei is a policy reversal or a bargaining chip to be used in future negotiation, the president faces growing opposition in Congress.Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, tweeted: "If President Trump has in fact bargained away the recent restrictions on Huawei, then we will have to get those restrictions back in place through legislation. And it will pass with a large veto proof majority."Semiconductor manufacturers focus on the design of new, more powerful chips and try to avoid politics. But politics has impinged on the industry.The Semiconductor Industry Association said in a statement that the progress made by Trump and President Xi Jinping in Osaka "is good news for the semiconductor industry, the overall tech sector and the world's two largest economies. We are encouraged the talks are restarting and additional tariffs are on hold and we look forward to getting more details on the president's remarks on Huawei."

                    Trade deal possible if expectations realistic: China Daily editorial

                Little has been revealed about what each party actually said during their latest conversation. But Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He's phone call with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday has made headlines anyway.Information available so far suggests the conversation was at least partly about bringing the negotiators back to the negotiating table.Although tentative, this surely is a constructive initial step toward building on the all-important outcome of the June 29 Osaka meeting between the Chinese and US leaders, which secured a pause in the two countries' trade war. After all, this was the first high-level contact at the operational level since then.Progress was made after the two leaders agreed to further negotiations when they met in December, and it is to be hoped that will be the case after their consensus this time.However, considering how the subsequent talks broke down, how the two parties responded, and what they want from each other, it would be advisable to be realistic about what to expect, otherwise the trade impasse will be perpetuated and their respective economies will continue to suffer.Both countries need and want a trade deal and fine trading ties. This is the understanding both countries have reached after a grueling year of tit-for-tat tariffs. Which is why, despite all the drawbacks, we remain convinced Beijing and Washington will indeed make every effort to find a way out.While Beijing is fighting fiercely against the rising noise of "decoupling" the Chinese and US economies, the latter appears equally anxious for that not to happen. If Beijing is driven mostly by concerns about looming economic woes, Washington has the 2020 election as an additional incentive.White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow stated it is "very, very important" for Beijing to "move immediately, quickly" on agricultural purchases, even though he said there is "no timeline" and urged quality, not speed, for the negotiations.The immediate question of what comes next, however, may easily produce another round of foot-dragging.Washington hopes to "pick up where we left off", according to both US President Donald Trump and Kudlow. Beijing, on the other hand, wants all tariffs to be removed as a precondition for a deal, which was not where the negotiations left off.But then its perceptions of goodwill are no doubt fragile given the timing of substantial distractive factors in overall bilateral relations, such as the disturbances in Hong Kong and US arms sales to Taiwan.All in all, it is to be hoped the two sides can engineer a deal, but whether they can or not remains to be seen. It will require realism and pragmatism from both.

                    Fed chief to testify on rate cuts
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                US inflation is low, and the June jobs report that came out last week was strong, suggesting an economy with no major problems ahead.Yet, many expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates a quarter of a point when it meets July 30-31.Analysts, pundits and politicians are wondering why.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will give his views on the need for an interest rate cut — or the importance of holding rates steady — when he testifies on Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee and Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee.Some believe the slowing rate of growth, dipping to an estimated 1.3 percent in the second quarter of 2019 from an annualized rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter, calls for a booster shot.Others foresee trouble ahead from the ongoing US-China trade dispute because tariffs raise prices and have the potential to disrupt supply chains, tossing production and retail sales into turmoil.That would be a serious problem because consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the US gross domestic product, the monetary value of all goods sold and services provided.US President Donald Trump argues that the current rate of 2.25-2.50 percent limits economic growth. "If we had a Fed that would lower interest rates, we would be like a rocket ship. We don't have a Fed that knows what it's doing," Trump said last week.A cut reduces bond yields, making stocks more attractive to investors. A cut also may reduce credit card and home mortgage rates, boosting retail and home sales.A cut would be bad news for small savers, however, because interest earned on deposits will decline.The market was mixed Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 22.65 points, or 0.08 percent, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up. All three indices declined Monday.Larry Kudlow, White House economic adviser, on Tuesday said Powell's job is safe "at the present time".The Federal Reserve is an independent governmental agency, and its actions do not have to be approved by Trump or anyone else, and asFed spokeswoman Michelle Smith said in June: "Under the law, a Federal Reserve Board chair can only be removed for cause."But Trump's comments may create a problem for Powell. If he cuts rates he may be seen as caving in to Trump's demands and thereby eroding the independence of the Fed.Trump needs a strong economy when he seeks re-election in 2020. Since 1900, about 80 percent of incumbent presidents have been re-elected. Since Franklin Delano Roosevelt won the White House in 1932, every incumbent president who campaigned with a strong economy has been re-elected. President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, lost his bid for re-election in 1980 because unemployment reached 7.15 percent and inflation was 12.67 — a toxic combination known as "stagflation" that strangled the economy.By contrast, the June 2019 jobs report showed that US employers added 224,000 non-farm jobs, up from 72,000 created in May. It was the 105th consecutive month employment has increased, the US Labor Department reported. The annual inflation rate was 1.8 percent for the 12 months ended in May, below the Fed's target of 2 percent. The Labor Department will release its next report on Thursday and provide the inflation rate for the 12 months ended June 2019.The June job numbers are the first full-month look at the labor market since Trump hiked tariffs on May 10, to 25 percent from 10 percent on Chinese Imports valued at $200 billion. The labor force participation rate, the share of working-age adults employed or looking for a job, rose to 62.0 percent from 62.8 percent in May. The unemployment rate edged up to 3.7 percent in June because more Americans returned to the labor force to look for a job.In June, Goldman Sachs analyst Jan Hatzius correctly forecast that the Fed would hold rates unchanged while being open to possible cuts later this year. The Federal Open Market Committee now projects at least one cut by December."Most of the dovish Fedspeak over the past several weeks has emphasized the increased uncertainty (especially with regard to trade policy) around a fairly optimistic central case as a reason for potential rate cuts," he said in a research note to investors. "But while trade uncertainty has not gone away, the decision by presidents Trump and Xi (Jinping) to return to the negotiating table and suspend the next tariff increase has reduced it, at least in the near term."

                    IMF warns of 'self-inflicted' growth curbs

                Countries should not use tariffs to target bilateral trade imbalances or as a substitute for dialogue in pressing for reforms, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday amid reports that US officials will travel to China to resume trade talks.In its World Economic Outlook (WEO) update, the IMF revised downward its projection for global growth to 3.2 percent in 2019, and 3.5 percent in 2020.Albeit only 0.1 percentage point lower for both years than in the IMF's April forecast, it comes after previous significant downward revisions, the lending organization said on Tuesday."Global growth is sluggish and precarious, but it does not have to be this way, because some of this is self-inflicted," said IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath."Dynamism in the global economy is being weighed down by prolonged policy uncertainty as trade tensions remain heightened despite the recent US-China trade truce; technology tensions have erupted threatening global technology supply chains, and the prospects of a no-deal Brexit have increased," she said at a news conference.The downward revisions for 2019 are almost across the board for the major economies, though for varied reasons. In China, the slight revision downward reflects, in part, the higher tariffs imposed by the United States in May, she said at the briefing in Santiago, Chile, according to transcripts provided by the IMF.In the US, 2019 growth is expected to be 2.6 percent, 0.3 percentage point higher than in the April WEO, but will moderate to 1.9 percent in 2020, as fiscal stimulus unwinds, according to the WEO update.With global growth subdued and downside risks dominating the outlook, the global economy remains at a delicate juncture."It is therefore essential that tariffs are not used to target bilateral trade balances or as a general-purpose tool to tackle international disagreements," she said.The combined effect of tariffs imposed last year and potential tariffs envisaged in May between the US and China could reduce the level of global GDP in 2020 by 0.5 percent, the economist said.Gopinath said that "with trade tensions we would hope that both the US and China would find a way to quickly resolve their tensions, and at the same time, that both countries also work towards improving the rules-based multilateral trading system".De-escalating tariffs and removing all additional tariffs the US and China have levied on each other's imports since early last year has been a major topic for China-US trade talks.On Tuesday, US media reported that US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will travel to Shanghai for face-to-face trade talks with Chinese officials.While Bloomberg said they would travel to China on Monday, CNBC reported that would happen sometime between Friday — the start of a six-week congressional recess in Washington — and Thursday, Aug 1.Lighthizer's office hadn't confirmed the report by Tuesday evening.White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow called it a good sign that top US officials would be traveling to China to restart talks, and the US stock market rallied Tuesday partly in reaction to the reports, which investors believed lifted hopes of a trade agreement.If held as reported, the meetings in Shanghai would be the first since trade talks between the world's top two economies stalled in May, and after the leaders of the two countries met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan last month, where they pledged to resume negotiations and avoided further increases in tariffs.Cheng Li, director of the John L. Thornton China Center of the Brookings Institution, said it is better for the two sides to resume the dialogue following their recent two rounds of phone talks.While previous rounds of high-level trade negotiations all took place either in Beijing or Washington, Shanghai is a venue that is "less political", according to Li.He said he agreed that if the two sides were to reach an agreement, all the tariffs added since the trade dispute started early last year must be removed.China has made it clear that it wants an equal trade agreement that must address the country's core concerns, such as lifting all additional tariffs, making trade procurement figures realistic, and that the text of any deal must be "balanced".

                    Farm bureaus warn of loss of China business

                Ministry of Commerce announces China to cease imports of all US agricultural productsChina has announced that it will stop buying all US agricultural products amid growing trade tensions, a move that will hit American farmers hard, US farm bureaus are warning.China's Ministry of Commerce made the announcement on Tuesday after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose a further 10 percent tariff on $300 billion of Chinese goods starting Sept 1. This would be in addition to the existing 25 percent tariff s on $250 billion of Chinese imports.It also announced that it may impose additional tariff s on US farm products, in a move that will hurt struggling American farmers, warns Peter Furey, executive director of the New Jersey Farm Bureau."Both sides are feeling the pain, and unfortunately, American farmers are bearing the brunt of the adverseeffects," Furey told China Daily. "However a return to normalcy can be achieved, we would certainly like that expedited."China is the world's top buyer of soybeans. The country has purchased 14.3 million tons of last season's soybean crop, the smallest amount in just over a decade, Reuters reported. At least 3.7 million tons still need to be shipped. In comparison, China had bought 32.9 million tons of US soybeans in 2017 before the trade dispute.The latest escalation in tensions came after US President Donald Trump said last week that Beijing had not made good on its promise to buy large amounts of American farm goods. He then threatened to slap the new tariff of 10 percent on Chinese goods.An official from China's National Development and Reform Commission hit back, calling Trump's accusations that China had not purchased enough "groundless", broadcaster CCTV reported.China's decision to limit US agriculture imports will have a dire impacton farmers and deliver a "body blow to the thousands of farmers and ranchers who are already struggling to get by", Zippy Duvall, from the American Farm Bureau told Reuters. Larry Kudlow, Trump's chief economic adviser, said farmers would be given assistance. Trump has already compensated farmers with a $28 billion aid package. Last week, the US Department of Agriculture signed up farmers for a program that will hand out $14.5 billion.In that aid package, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the government will pay a minimum of $15 per acre to farmers hurt by the trade war with China under an aid package. American hog farmers also have suffered a loss of at least $1 billion in the ongoing trade war, Reuters reported. China increased its retaliatory tariff s on US pork in April 2018, and again in July 2019.Rachel Gantz, communications director for the National Pork ProducersCouncil, told China Daily that China was one of its top five export markets. "We continue to reiterate the importance of ending the trade dispute with China so US pork producers can get back to competitive access and more fully participate in a historic sales opportunity."Furey agreed, adding that most farmers just want things resolved:"Prior to the Trump administration initiating all of this, China was a very important, large market for American commodities, and American agriculture is an export-dependent industry. We produce far more commodities than our domestic economy can consume, and that says something because the American economy is so large."So, we depend on exports to balance supply and demand," he said."We had worked very hard to build that China market, and the Chinese and American commodity shippers were in a strong position with each other. … We would like to see a return to what we had achieved."

                    G7 leaders struggle for breakthrough
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Summit produces no communique as differences remain on key issuesG7 Leaders posed for a family photo in the French oceanfront town of Biarritz on Sunday evening as a sign of unity, but the meetings have been marred by sharp differences on key issues.It is the first time in the 45-year history of the G7 summit that no joint communique is issued. Leaders had stark differences over trade, climate change, Iran nuclear issues and inviting Russia back to the table.In a meeting with US President Donald Trump on Sunday morning, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson congratulated Trump on "everything the American economy is achieving", and quickly added: "But just to register a faint sheep-like note of our view on the trade war: We're in favor of trade peace on the whole, and dialing it down if we can.""We think that, on the whole, the UK has profited massively in the last 200 years from free trade, and that's what we want to see... We don't like tariffs on the whole," said Johnson, whom Trump has often praised.Like Johnson, many European leaders, from European Council President Donald Tusk to French President Emmanuel Macron, voiced their opposition to the trade wars during the meeting.The summit kicked off on Saturday as China and US announced a new round of tit-for-tat tariffs in their escalated trade conflict.When asked by reporters on Sunday, Trump admitted to having second thoughts about raising tariffs against China. The words have been widely interpreted as hope for a possible truce between the world's two largest economies.But White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham and White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow later said Trump only responded "in the affirmative－because he regrets not raising the tariffs higher".Grisham said Trump's "answer has been greatly misinterpreted".Some analysts interpreted the move as White House crisis management of Trump's conciliatory message which might be harmful to his 2020 election campaign.Trump has been sending conflicting messages on China trade. On Sunday he said US and China were getting along very well and were talking. On Monday, Trump said that China is ready to come back to the negotiating table and the two countries will start talking very seriously."I think we are going to have a deal," he said, according to CNBC.While Trump was isolated on the trade war at the summit, he claimed victory on Sunday when he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said they hope to sign a trade deal in New York next month.Trump said that Japan had agreed to purchase excess US corn, but Abe referred to a potential buy of the corn and said it would be handled by the private sector.Abe said that more work remained, but expressed optimism that it would be finalized in September.Inviting Russia?Aside from trade, Trump met strong opposition from other leaders about whether to invite Russia back to the G7 summit. Russia was kicked out of the G8 in 2014.On Sunday, the French government said G7 leaders had agreed during the Saturday dinner that it is far too soon for Russia to be invited to rejoin the exclusive club.But Trump said no such decision had been taken to keep Russia out. The US will be the host of next year's summit and the host usually can decide who is invited, but doesn't have the power to restore membership."Trump evidently fought vigorously at the G7 to have Russia invited back, but was rebuffed by the Europeans," Carl Bildt, former Swedish prime minister, said in a tweet on Monday.Douglas Paal, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the G7 is on life support. "Trying to bring Russia back into it will do nothing to revive it," he said.The Guardian contributed to the reporting.
