                Winter tourism visitor numbers set to soar
            </a>
            <p>
                Nation attracting both local and overseas skiersFor 30-something business consultant Jeff Oliveira, winter vacations mean hitting the slopes of the Altay Mountains in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.Unlike the French Alps or Aspen in Colorado, United States, the area in northwestern China is hardly known, even among avid skiers.Oliveira, founder of research and consultancy company skiChina, grew up skiing in his hometown of Boston and elsewhere in North America. But he would rather spend the winter season in Xinjiang than at other popular ski destinations."People like myself want that novelty of skiing in a place that's off the radar of the international skiing community," he said.However, the novelty factor is just part of Xinjiang's allure. Oliveira keeps returning to the region every year, as he likes its "world-class terrain and snow". He is organizing a group tour next month, bringing skiers from North America to explore remote areas of Xinjiang.But the region is just one of several Chinese destinations attracting both local and foreign skiers, with a Beijing think tank expecting more tourist arrivals spurred by China hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics.The China Tourism Academy expects visitor numbers to rise to 340 million in the 2021-22 winter season, up from about 170 million in 2016-17, according to Xinhua News Agency.The academy also forecast that winter tourism revenues would rise from about 270 billion yuan ($39 billion) in 2016-17 to 670 billion yuan in 2021-22.By then, the winter tourism boom will be associated with a combined value of 2.88 trillion yuan in tourism and other sectors, Xinhua said.Meanwhile, a report in January by tech giant Tencent and internet consultancy Analysys estimated that tourism related to winter sports activities will generate 40 billion yuan in revenue by 2020.Gino Andreetta, CEO of Club Med Greater China, said hosting the Winter Olympics in 2022 will increase tourist interest in the country.Global vacation resort chain Club Med's Asia-Pacific snow holiday report said China has joined Japan, South Korea and Switzerland as a top snow-break destination for Asian travelers.On the radarReleased in September, the study was based on surveys of more than 5,000 respondents in the Asia-Pacific region and covered travel made during the past three years.Andreetta said most tourists surveyed who traveled to China for winter vacations came from nearby countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea. Most of them were affluent millennials who spend the majority of their leisure time skiing and snowboarding."China is now very much on the radar of the regional snow holidaymaker and (becoming) an emerging future powerhouse for winter holidays," he said.In 2015, China won the bid to host the Winter Olympics, making Beijing the first city in the world to host both the Summer and Winter Games. This spurred the launch of a winter sports development plan that aims to build 650 skating rinks and 800 ski resorts by 2022.However, hosting the Winter Games is just the latest initiative to attract winter tourism dollars. Several of the country's northern provinces have cold, snowy winters that have been attracting visitors for years, especially those from tropical countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific.One of the most popular winter destinations is Heilongjiang province in Northeast China, the country's coldest region, with temperatures dropping as low as-50 C and the winter season lasting eight months.This weather appeals to tourists, both domestic and foreign. The town of Yabuli, home to China's largest ski resort, hosted the 1996 Asian Winter Games and the 2008 National Winter Games. The Yabuli Ski Resort has 46 ski runs that extend for a total of 88 kilometers and can accommodate both novice and more-experienced skiers.Heilongjiang's main winter attraction is its capital. Harbin, also known as the "ice city", has lured millions of tourists over the past three decades, enticed by the massive and colorfully lit ice sculptures that decorate its streets during winter. These sculptures are part of the city's annual ice and snow festival, established in 1985.Last year alone, the festival attracted 18 million visitors and raked in 28.7 billion yuan in tourism revenue for Harbin, according to the Associated Press.Jilin, another northeastern province, has emerged as a key winter tour destination. According to the local tourism authority, Jilin welcomed 62 million tourists in the 2016-17 winter season, 20 percent more than the previous year.The province's top two winter resorts－Wanda Changbaishan International Ski Resort and Vanke Songhua Lake Resort－received more than 300,000 tourists in the 2016-17 winter season.In Northwest China, tourists have been heading to Xinjiang in recent years, attracted by the light powder snow that covers its vast landscape during the winter season. The slopes of Mount Altay attract skiers and other winter tourists, with 3 million visiting Altay prefecture last year during the season, according to Xinhua.

                Editor's note: Groundbreaking campaigns have broken barriers in the 2018 US midterm elections, with historic candidates changing the face of Congress and statehouses across the US. Women have run in record numbers, and Native Americans, Muslims, Latinos, immigrants, millennials and LGBT candidates have already made history with their campaigns.Here are some trailblazing candidates who are diversifying American politics.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, youngest woman elected to CongressNow age 29, New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has become the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. Elise Stefanik previously held the record when she was elected to Congress at age 30 in 2014.Ocasio-Cortez is the daughter of a Puerto Rican mother and a Bronx-born father and grew up in a working-class community. She ran a grassroots campaign that took on the "Queens Democratic party machine" and championed progressive proposals, such as the abolition of the Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE), a single-payer healthcare plan and tuition-free college.

                US govt shutdown puts a damper on DC's Christmas festivities
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - The lights were not twinkling. The toy trains were not whirring. Even the nearby bathrooms were locked.The US national Christmas tree, symbol of a country's seasonal cheer, instead stood as an icon of a government in paralysis, as the partial shutdown stretched into the holiday with an array of federal services frozen, about 800,000 public servants either idled or about to be and the disruption to the broader public bound to grow when the quiet spell ends later this week.Already facilities at many national parks were shuttered, if the parks were accessible at all, and thousands of federal buildings were to remain closed when the workweek resumed unless US President Donald Trump and members of Congress quickly break through a budget impasse that the White House said could drag on into 2019.Under cloudy skies in a brisk wind on the third day of the shutdown, the capital put on little holiday wonder for visitors like Greg Forcherio of Columbia, Maryland, a government contractor with no office to work in after the holidays as long as federal buildings stayed closed. He, his wife and their toddler on Monday came to see the giant, glittering spruce tree brought from Colorado to serve as the national Christmas tree, normally a focal point for Washington holiday visitors.But a locked chain-link fence blocked access to the site and the nearby White House visitor's center and its bathrooms were closed, with a hand-scrawled sign directing visitors to portable toilets, which also were chained shut. "Kind of annoying when you've got young children," Forcherio said.Access to the site was restored later on Monday and finally, as night fell on Christmas Eve, the lights returned. The government had announced a day earlier that it would be sealed off because of the shutdown and because repairs had slowed after an episode of vandalism on the tree before the weekend. It reopened with money from the National Park Foundation, a charity.Extra stress In the mountain town of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, Taylor Futch said the shutdown has already put extra stress on her family, whose sole income comes from her husband, a wildlife biologist who works with black bears for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. With two young daughters, the couple is facing an $800 land payment due at the beginning of January as well as a mortgage, car payment and the usual bills."We're trying to gather up a couple things just in case I need to start selling stuff on Facebook or eBay," she said. "If his paycheck doesn't get here on Friday, we may not have enough for the mortgage."The immediate impact was blunted by the timing of the shutdown - spanning a weekend and now Christmas Eve and Christmas, both federal holiday days. But there was little chance to solve anything before Thursday at the earliest, when the House and Senate return to work.Meanwhile, some people believed the shutdown won't be long before resolved."I think this happens every few years. When people with stiffened jaws look at each other in the eyes. And they're just staring each other down for now. They will find a compromise," A local visitor Darin Imbriaco said.AP-XINHUA

                Farmers opt for solar power as new cash cow

                Clean energy source adopted in US amid falling pricesThe fertile fields of the United States' Midwest have always been ideal for farmers to grow corn, soybeans and wheat.But as they deal with tariffs and the worst agricultural prices in a decade, many farmers are turning to a new, nontraditional "crop" instead-solar panels.The number of farmers choosing to lease their land to companies installing solar panels to provide electricity is not known, but the practice is being adopted nationwide.Peter Gray, a spokesman for the Illinois Solar Energy Association, said, "Hundreds of solar projects are being developed on agricultural land in Illinois."Elsewhere, solar companies are also working with farmers in the states of California, Colorado, Texas, Oregon, North Carolina, Washington and New York.Daniel Kirschen, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle, said: "It's a question of economics. Farming is not always very profitable. In some situations, it is more profitable to lease the land to a solar farm than to use it to produce agricultural products."Farmers are grappling with low prices. The price of corn is 7 percent lower than usual and soybeans are selling for 15 percent lower, according to the University of Illinois.Max Quillen, a farmer in Lyndhurst, Virginia, who owns Waynesboro Nurseries, a 647-hectare farm, feels the need to diversify and is ready to invest in solar panels.Quillen said his great-grandfather bought the land in 1934, but times have been tough lately.The farmer, who has sold beef, trees and plants, has struck a deal with a company called Community Energy Solar to install solar panels on his land, but is awaiting full approval from the board of supervisors in Augusta County."The solar deal for us would be on roughly 25 percent (162 hectares) of our land. Most of the panels will be placed on land that was used for cattle," Quillen said."Some of the land we own is for cattle, some is for growing trees, and some, to be quite honest, is useless ... Our neighbors are also going to put land into the project. So, the total size is 1,100 acres (445 hectares)," he said."The contracts are for 35 years. We really want to keep the land in our family, as we get a lot of benefits from it. It will diversify our income so that we can keep farming, and it will alleviate some of the financial pressure."

                SOLAR POWER SEEN AS NEW CASH COW
            </a>
            <p>
                Amid falling crop prices, many US farmers lease land so companies can install panels The fertile, lush green fields of the United States' Midwest have always been ideal for farmers to grow corn, soybeans and wheat. But as they deal with tariffs and the worst agricultural prices in a decade, many farmers are turning to a new, nontraditional "crop" instead - solar panels. The number of farmers choosing to lease their land to companies installing solar panels to provide electricity is not known, but the practice is catching on nationwide. Peter Gray, a spokesman for the Illinois Solar Energy Association, said, "Hundreds of solar projects are being developed on agricultural land in Illinois." Elsewhere, solar companies are working with farmers in the states of California, Colorado, Texas, Oregon, North Carolina, Washington and New York. Daniel Kirschen, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle, said: "It's a question of economics. Farming is not always very profitable. In some situations, it is more profitable to lease the land to a solar farm than to use it to produce agricultural products." Farmers are grappling with low prices. The price of corn is 7 percent lower than usual, and soybeans are selling for 15 percent lower, according to the University of Illinois. Max Quillen, a farmer in Lyndhurst, Virginia, who owns Waynesboro Nurseries, a 647-hectare farm, feels the need to diversify and is ready to invest in solar panels. Quillen said his great-grandfather bought the land in 1934, but times have been tough lately. The farmer, who has sold beef, trees and plants, has struck a deal with a company called Community Energy Solar to install solar panels on his land, but is awaiting full approval from the board of supervisors in Augusta County. "The solar deal for us would be on roughly 25 percent (162 hectares) of our land. Most of the panels will be placed on land that was used for cattle," Quillen said. "Some of the land we own is for cattle, some is for growing trees, and some, to be quite honest, is useless ... Our neighbors are also going to put land into the project. So, the total size is 1,100 acres (445 hectares)," he said. "The contracts are for 35 years. We really want to keep the land in our family, as we get a lot of benefits from it. It will diversify our income so that we can keep farming, and it will alleviate some of the financial pressure." US farmers saw their net income fall by 16 percent last year, but the Department of Agriculture predicted on March 6 that such income - a broad measure of profitability - will rise by 10 percent, or $6.3 billion, this year to $69.4 billion. The higher income projection comes despite continued retaliatory tariffs on US agricultural products, but largely reflects expectations for yields and slightly higher prices for some commodities, according to the department. Farmers' income was affected last year by the US-China trade dispute and by huge stockpiles of corn and soybeans. When it comes to solar farms, there are two main types. Photovoltaic farms generate electricity by using thousands of panels covered with cells to convert light into power, while solar thermal farms generate hot water and steam by using mirrors to concentrate the sun's heat onto a column that makes steam by spinning like a turbine to create electricity. The average cost of a solar power project from 2010 to 2017 fell by 80 percent, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Farmers who convert part, or all, of their farms for solar projects can either sell the energy back to an electricity company, or use it to power their businesses or even their homes. Leases tend to be for 20 years or longer, with an option to renew. At least 29 states in the country and Washington, DC, have a renewable energy portfolio standard - a regulation for utility companies to supply a minimum amount of electricity from solar power, wind and renewable energy. Eight other states have set renewable energy goals. In Illinois, farmers interested in solar power have been given an added incentive to invest in it following the enactment of a law that stipulates that renewable energy resources must provide 25 percent of power in the state by 2025. Beekeepers Travis Bolton and his wife Chiara, who run the Bolton Bees Company in St Paul, Minnesota, believe that solar panels on farmland are beneficial because they promote clean energy and are good for the environment. The couple uses solar energy to produce honey. "The product we develop from the solar rays we call solar honey," Travis Bolton said. "There is a lot of farmland where we are ... The crops grown here are mostly corn and soybeans. But there are lots of other crops grown in the area such as apples, strawberries and blueberries, which benefit from pollinated surroundings. What we do helps other farmers." Bolton said he thinks adopting solar power is a good business move for farmers, who are having a tough time with crop prices. "It's a really great opportunity to turn some of their land into solar energy and get a guaranteed return on leases of 25 years. That sounds really good to someone who is potentially struggling right now," he said. China manufactures 60 percent of the global supply of solar panels, according to the International Energy Agency. It is also the largest market for photovoltaic and solar thermal energy, but last year, US President Donald Trump slapped a 30 percent tariff on imported solar panels amid the trade war between the two countries. In December, the US Congress approved a five-year, $867 billion bill to help farmers, retaining the $50 million annual funding for the Rural Energy for America Program. REAP provides farmers with financial assistance to "purchase, install and construct renewable energy systems, make energy-efficiency improvements to nonresidential buildings and facilities, and use renewable technologies". There is also a 30 percent federal income tax credit for solar investments. But while the environmental benefits and income potential are undeniable, the move to incorporate more solar energy and panels on farms faces opposition from some quarters. Rob Rhykerd, a soil scientist and chairman of agriculture at Illinois State University, said there are fears that solar panels could take the most vital, fertile land out of production, which could have dire consequences for crop output. "We need to be very strategic about where we put these solar panels. So, let's put them on marginal land ... maybe land that we've taken out of production. That way, we're not competing with production," he said. "I'm not opposed to farmers putting solar panels on their farms. I just want them to make sure they are making a really good, informed decision, as this is going to impact the land for years to come." Opposition to solar farms has emerged in different states, including Washington, where Governor Jay Inslee had to step in over a dispute in Kittitas County and decide whether the state's first solar farm should be sited on cropland. He gave approval in October. Farmers Jeff and Jackie Brunson, who own 405 hectares of land near Ellensburg, Washington, planned to lease more than 32 hectares to Tuosso Energy, a company in Seattle, to create a solar farm, but neighbors were upset that it would transform the land. "They aren't happy ... but we don't regret it one iota," Jackie Brunson told the Seattle Times newspaper. Disputes have also raged in Oregon, where the State Land Board overturned Jackson County's approval of a solar project on 32 hectares of farmland. In Augusta County, Virginia, some of farmer Quillen's neighbors are also unhappy about the proposed project. "Most of the neighbors are in favor of it," Quillen said. "But some are concerned that solar panels could be toxic or polluting. But perhaps they just don't want to see them. I completely disagree." Stan Sikorski, one of his neighbors, complained that he would be able to see the panels from his home, which would disrupt his view. Quillen said he has taken this into consideration and will provide landscaping near the solar panels. In Currituck County, North Carolina, complaints from locals about the dilapidated state of two solar projects on 915 hectares of farmland led county commissioners to ban new solar projects in 2017. But Gray, from the Illinois Solar Energy Association, said most solar energy companies have promised to restore the land to its original state after the project is completed. "Because of the strong interest in solar from farmers and landowners, the Illinois Solar Energy Association worked with the Illinois Farm Bureau to create legislation that protects farmers' interests and ensures that farmland will be returned to its prior use at the end of a solar project," he said. Kirschen, at the University of Washington, warns that solar energy from farms may not be able to power towns and cities without some issues being addressed. "The unfortunate fact about solar energy is that its density is relatively low. To power a large city, you will therefore require quite a large area of land devoted to solar parks, " he said. "Since there are many other demands for land, areas devoted to solar parks may have to be located in remote, sparsely populated places where land is not well-suited for agriculture. This will require the construction of large transmission lines to carry the power generated by these solar parks to cities and other locations where there is a large demand for electricity. "We also have to take into account that solar parks do not produce at night, and produce much less when it is cloudy. Solar energy will then need to be supplemented by energy storage or other forms of producing electrical energy." Gray added that the advantages of solar power far outweigh the disadvantages. "Solar energy creates construction and other jobs, property tax revenue to fund local schools and services, and income for landowners. Community solar projects in Illinois will allow consumers to purchase locally produced clean energy and lower their electricity bills. Solar power is an important way to reduce pollution from the energy sector and fight climate change," he said. belindarobinson@chinadailyusa.com  Some farmers in the United States' Midwest have placed solar panels in their fields.Photos Provided To China Daily A bird's-eye view of Waynesboro Nurseries, a 647-hectare farm in Virginia that is ready to invest in solar panels.Provided To China Daily(China Daily 04/09/2019 page1)

                Tiny houses entice budget-conscious
            </a>
            <p>
                ELIZABETHTOWN, Pennsylvania - In a country that nearly always believes bigger is better - think supersize fries, giant cars and 10-gallon hats - more and more people in the United States are downsizing their living quarters.Welcome to the world of tiny homes, most of them less than 37 square meters (400 square feet), which savvy buyers are snapping up for their minimalist appeal and smaller carbon footprints.The tiny homes revolution, which includes those on foundations and those on wheels, began a few decades ago, but the financial crisis of 2008 and the coming-of-age of millennials gave it a new impetus.The proliferation of home improvement shows on networks like HGTV fueled the trend, inspiring customers ready to personalize their own small living spaces.Cost is one of the driving factors. A tiny home of just over 200 square feet with a customized interior can go for about $50,000, which is a massive savings over a McMansion in the suburbs."We have a housing crisis and we have crumbling buildings around us. It's just hard to find good quality living at an affordable price," says Brandy Jones, who took the plunge with her husband and two sons.Eight months ago, they moved into a tiny house in Reading, Pennsylvania, about 100 kilometers northwest of Philadelphia.Jones says that for a new house in the area, the family would have had to budget for about $300,000. The tiny home option "is a huge difference. It makes living affordable."In most cases, the savings is not enough of a motivating factor: The average newly-built family home in the US measures about 2,600 square feet, according to the Census Bureau.Marcus Stoltzfus, the director of sales and marketing for Liberation Tiny Homes in nearby Leola, Pennsylvania, says that over the past 40 years, US people "went into this McMansion phase, where they built those massive homes".Now, in some parts of the country, "people are realizing that living with less is very advantageous to your lifestyle", he said.No 'wasted space' Scott Berrier, who moved into a 370-square-foot home about four months ago with his wife Melissa, says he's happy not to have as many possessions as before."We really like the whole minimalist approach - kind of paring down and not having clutter everywhere and everything," Berrier explained, adding that his home is simply more functional."The biggest difference I notice is that we use every single space. There is not any wasted space," he said.Roland Figueredo, who plans to leave his New York apartment in July for a tiny house in Oregon, says he's ready for a change."We truly are trying to simplify our life and getting rid of our crap," he said.Even if public opinion is changing, it's not always easy to go against societal norms and materialistic expectations.When Berrier told friends of his plans, several of them warned him that his new home would make him feel claustrophobic.Stoltzfus admits the trend can seem "very hipster-ish" and suffers from a bit of a negative image, but he believes that will change over time."The more that folks travel, work from home, this trend will definitely be up there," he said.Berrier says wanting to live a more minimalist life extends to the environmental impact of homeownership."You're not leaving as much of a carbon footprint. You're not using as much electricity, as much water" as in a traditional home or apartment, he notes.Despite the advantages, the tiny homes movement is far from widespread. Rough estimates put the number of tiny homes in the US at a little more than 10,000.The first sticking point is financing. Would-be homeowners are finding it impossible to get traditional loans for nontraditional houses.Banks are instead offering medium-term loans of up to seven years - at significantly higher interest rates than regular loans.But the main obstacle is a legal one: Most municipalities and towns ban residents from living year-round in anything on wheels, and often have statutes requiring homes to be at least 900 square feet.Several US states such as Colorado, Nevada and North Carolina are seen as more progressive on the issue, but the country's most populated areas have for the most part ignored the movement.Historically, bungalows, caravans and mobile homes have a bad reputation in the US. They are perceived as badly made and decidedly lower-class.But the Berriers' home is impeccably decorated with a bathtub, a sunroom and a movie screen - no "trailer trash" here."There are preconceived notions. They haven't seen it enough. It's just something new. I think that's the problem," Berrier said.Agence France - Presse

                Alaska records its warmest month ever; future records likely
            </a>
            <p>
                ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Alaska has been America's canary in the coal mine for climate warming, and the yellow bird is swooning.July was Alaska's warmest month ever, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Sea ice melted. Bering Sea fish swam in above-normal temperatures. So did children in the coastal town of Nome. Wildfire season started early and stayed late. Thousands of walruses thronged to shore.Unusual weather events like this could become more common with climate warming, said Brian Brettschneider, an associate climate researcher at the University of Alaska Fairbanks' International Arctic Research Center. Alaska has seen "multiple decades-long increases" in temperature, he said."It becomes easier to have these unusual sets of conditions that now lead to records," Brettschneider said.Alaska's average temperature in July was 14.5 C. That's 3 C above average and 0.4 C higher than the previous warmest month of July 2004, NOAA said.The effects were felt from the Arctic Ocean to the world's largest temperate rainforest on Alaska's Panhandle.Anchorage, the state's largest city, on July 4 for the first time hit 32.22 C at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, 5 degrees higher than the city's previous recorded high of 29.44 C.Sea ice off Alaska's north and northwest shore and other Arctic regions retreated to the lowest level ever recorded for July, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado.Arctic sea ice for July set a record low of 7.6 million square kilometers. That was a South Carolina-size loss of 80,000 square kilometers below the previous record low July in 2012.Sea ice is the main habitat for polar bears and a resting platform for female walruses and their young. Several thousand walruses came to shore July 30, the first time they've been spotted in such large numbers before August.Effects were less obvious in the Bering Sea off Alaska's west coast. Lyle Britt, a NOAA Fisheries biologist who oversees the agency's annual Bering Sea groundfish survey, was on a trawler east of the island of Saint Matthew during the first week of July."The temperature out there for us was in the high 70s," Britt said. "On those boats, everything up there is designed to conserve heat, not vent heat. It was unbearably warm inside the boat."On the ocean bottom, Britt's crew for the second consecutive year found scant evidence of a "cold pool," the east-west barrier of extremely cold, salty water that traditionally concentrates Pacific cod and walleye pollock, the species that make fast-food fish sandwiches, in the southeastern Bering Sea.Alaska's wildfire season started in April. July's dry and hot temperatures extended it. An expected rainy season marked by southwest winds pushing up moisture and soaking fires did not show up on time, said Tim Mowry, spokesman for the state Division of Forestry."It extended our fire season through the month of July," Mowry said.Alaska by mid-July can usually free up crews to fight fires in other states, but only about 15 people have left this year. High fire danger around Anchorage, the Kenai Peninsula and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough has kept crews in Alaska."We've pretty much held on to all our resources in-state at this point," Mowry said.A burn ban and water sprinkler restrictions remain in place for Haines, just outside the Tongass National Forest. July extended a drought in the rainforest, said Rick Thoman, another climate expert at the International Arctic Research Center.Cities in the southern half of the rainforest have limited or no hydropower because of low water levels. That means power has to be generated by burning diesel fuel, Thoman said.July was the hottest month measured on Earth since records began in 1880, NOAA reported Thursday. And a United Nations report earlier this month warned that global warming threatens food supplies around the world.But Alaska's recent heat has had silver linings. Barley and other crops are ready to harvest, said Stephen Brown of the University of Alaska Fairbanks Cooperative Extension Service.The growing season has been extended by a month, and if extra days become the norm, they will expand what can be grown in the state. Brown used heat radiated from his blacktop driveway to grow fruit not usually seen outside greenhouses."I've got a bumper crop of tomatoes and jalapenos this summer," he said.On the other hand, the weather has stressed birch trees and left them vulnerable to leaf-eating insects."That gives the leaf miners opportunity to really whack them good," he said. "I'm looking at my lawn right now, and I need to rake leaves."Brettschneider, the climate researcher, sees mostly negative effects from the hot July and climate warming. Alaska looks the way it does because of the temperature regime, he said, and in 50 years, Alaska may look like Idaho."We should expect changes. We should expect the forests to be in different locations. We should expect wildlife to move. We should expect plants to move. And in many cases, if they can't move fast enough, we should expect them to just go away," he said.AP

                Big Tech scrutinized on business practices
            </a>
            <p>
                48 states investigating Google's advertising; Facebook probed on consumer data-handlingGoogle and Facebook have dominated internet search and social media for years, and now some states are saying they may be too big for the nation's own good.Attorneys general from 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have opened a probe into major tech companies, focusing on Google, which is owned by Alphabet Inc, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced Monday outside the US Supreme Court.A second group of state attorneys general, led by New York, is focusing on Facebook Inc, it was announced on Friday.Silicon Valley companies have faced a lot of pushback in recent years, whether it has been over data and privacy breaches or the companies' inadvertent roles in political discourse, to censorship, even to the price of housing in the San Francisco Bay Area.Their executives have not infrequently been called to Washington to testify about their various business or privacy procedures, and it's usually a bipartisan effort in the questioning.Paxton is leading the Google probe, which will focus on the company's advertising business.Google, which did not comment Monday, specifically has faced accusations that its web search leads consumers to its own products at the cost of competitors."There is nothing wrong with a business becoming the biggest game in town if it does so through free market competition, but we have seen evidence that Google's business practices may have undermined consumer choice, stifled innovation, violated users' privacy, and put Google in control of the flow and dissemination of online information," Paxton said in a statement.On Friday, Google, perhaps anticipating the state probes, posted a comment by Kent Walker, senior vice-president of global affairs: "We have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so," he wrote. "We look forward to showing how we are investing in innovation, providing services that people want, and engaging in robust and fair competition.California — where Google is headquartered — and Alabama are not part of the investigation.Several of the attorneys general in Washington on Monday called the investigation "preliminary", but said they expected it would expand to cover other issues, including data privacy.Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said the probe was "for the benefit of the tech ecosystem to help level the playing field".Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge called Google's online search engine a "juggernaut", and argued that free internet search sometimes comes at the cost of the freedom to choose the best products.US President Donald Trump has called for closer scrutiny of social media firms and Google, accusing them of suppressing conservative voices online.US Senator Josh Hawley, who as Missouri attorney general opened a probe of Google in 2017, lauded the announcement as "a very big day for the folks who care about antitrust enforcement"."I hope that Congress will get serious about acting. And I hope the United States Senate will lead the way there," he said.Facebook, which also owns its onetime rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has more than 1.5 billion daily users, has been criticized for allowing misleading posts and so-called "fake news" on its service.Will Castleberry, Facebook's vice-president for state and local policy, said last week that the company would cooperate with state attorneys general.Facebook recently paid a $5 billion settlement for sharing 87 million users' data with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.Facebook said it would do more to protect user privacy, but the deal was criticized by regulators and lawmakers for not doing enough to rein in the Menlo Park, California company's market power or make company executives accountable.Last week, Google's YouTube agreed to pay a $170 million fine and limit advertising on children's videos in a settlement of claims that the company violated privacy laws.Google also has felt the heat in the European Union, which has stricter privacy protections than the US. It was fined $2.7 billion in 2017, $5 billion in 2018, and $1.7 billion in March over antitrust violations.On the US federal level, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are probing Facebook, Google, iPhone maker Apple Inc and online retail king Amazon Inc for potential violations of antitrust law.Alphabet said Friday that the Justice Department in late August requested information and documents related to prior antitrust probes of the company. The company added in a securities filing that it expects similar demands from state attorneys general, and that it is cooperating with regulators.The potential penalties for the investigations into whether the companies used their market power unfairly include everything from breaking them up to large fines.US Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, one of the top-tier candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has vowed to break up Amazon, Google and Facebook if elected, to promote competition in the technology sector.Tech companies, however, also are some of the biggest political donors. Google spent $21 million to lobby in 2018; Amazon $14.2 million, and Facebook $12.62 million.Facebook co-founder-turned-critic Chris Hughes says the social media company has too much power over speech and that it is willing to "sacrifice security and civility for clicks".For an antitrust case to succeed, the government would have to take the company to court and win. It is rare for a company to be broken up, but Standard Oil in 1911 and AT&T in 1982 are two examples of major breakups.While any future fines from the FTC, Justice Department or state attorneys general could capture headlines, the major tech companies are the world's most valuable by stock market valuation and can easily pay large fines. They each have more than $50 billion in revenue a year.Democratic lawmakers in Washington have on several occasions suggested one way to address Big Tech's market power on social media would be to make it easier for consumers to move data like photographs and contacts from one application to another, potentially opening up competition.The idea, which is already part of European law, has the support of US Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, a Democrat who leads the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia.In the New York case, the state's attorney general said Friday: "Even the largest social media platform in the world must follow the law and respect consumers. … We will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook's actions may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers' choices, or increased the price of advertising," said New York Attorney General Letitia James.Joining New York in the probe of Facebook are the attorneys general of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, and the District of Columbia.Reuters contributed to this story.
