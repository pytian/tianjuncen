                Nation develops its sweet tooth
            </a>
            <p>
                Sugar consumption rises along with living standardsDespite its unattractive name, zangzangbao (dirty, dirty bread) is a popular snack in China. Food lovers line up at teahouses and bakeries eager to snap up the chocolate-and cream-filled croissants with a dusting of cocoa powder on top.The snack was introduced by a trendy Beijing bakery in 2017, and the name reflects the fact that it can be quite messy to eat. Customers usually end up with sticky fingers and lips after eating the sweet treats.Zangzangbao is just one of the trendy snacks that are appealing to a rising number of consumers with a sweet tooth. The country's expanding middle class is demanding tasty, sweet food, drinks such as bubble milk tea and luxury chocolate.The demand for sweet delights is rising in tandem with China's influence on the global sugar trade.It is the world's second-biggest sugar importer, and analysts expect this huge demand to continue dictating pricing trends in the next few years.Charles Clack, a commodity analyst at Rabobank, a banking and financial services company in the Netherlands, said: "Local production is expected to stay relatively stable in the coming years, but will not be enough to satisfy overall Chinese demand for sugar. Imports will be key to satisfying China's sweet tooth. A marginal improvement in Chinese demand in coming seasons may also see imports rise slightly."According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, China will be one of several Asian countries that will experience their largest increases in sugar consumption in coming years. From last year to 2027, it expects China's sugar consumption to rise by 1.9 percent on average annually.

                Chinese liquor maker Wuliangye posts solid profit growth

            <p>
                SHENZHEN - China's leading liquor producer Wuliangye Yibin Co Ltd reported a 31-percent net profit growth in the first half of 2019.The company's net profit jumped to about 9.3 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) from 7.1 billion yuan in the same period last year, the company said in its preliminary earnings estimate report filed to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.Its revenue grew 26.5 percent year-on-year to 27.2 billion yuan during Jan-June period.The company earlier set a revenue target of 50 billion yuan, an annual growth of 25 percent, for this year.The liquor maker said the profit and revenue growth came after its product structure adjustment and both sales volume growth and price hikes of its core product Wuliangye, a well-known brand of baijiu in China.Boosted by the strong earnings growth, Wuliangye saw its shares jump 3.7 percent to close at 121.18 yuan in Shenzhen bourse Tuesday.

                World Baijiu Day promotes Chinese liquor
            </a>
            <p>
                 The fifth World Baijiu Day falls on Friday - the pronunciation of the numbers "eight" and "nine", representing the date, is similar to that of baijiu, or white liquor.This year, pubs, bars and restaurants in over 30 cities around the world, including Beijing, Shanghai, London and Stockholm, are celebrating the festival with baiju-inspired cocktails, infusions, liqueurs, gelatos, chocolate and pizza.Canadian Jim Boyce, who has lived in Beijing for over a decade, launched World Baijiu Day in 2015 to promote the liquor’s culture outside China."China's national spirit, baijiu, represents about one-third of global spirits’ sales but is little known beyond its home base of China. World Baijiu Day aims to change that with events in dozens of cities," said Boyce, a consultant in the wine business.

                Growing appeal raises bar for wine buffs in China
            </a>
            <p>
                Pouring a glass of wine to have with dinner was once a rare sight in Chinese households, yet within the space of just 10 years, wine is now a popular evening tipple around the country.During a recent livestream event organized by China Daily, four wine experts discussed China's rapidly changing attitudes toward alcohol and the domestic wine industry.According to Claudia Masueger, CEO of China-based wine retailer Cheers, domestic consumers are becoming increasingly sophisticated and knowledgeable as the industry develops."Wine is now a huge subject in China," Masueger says. "It's a lifestyle. It's a fashion statement. And what the Chinese really love is that they can combine it with their local food."China is the sixth-largest wine producer in the world, and currently makes more wine than Chile, Portugal and South Africa.Yet until recently, most wine made in China was consumed domestically. Rarely exported, its appeal was limited to local drinkers who had already developed a taste for homegrown wine."Chinese wine used to be undrinkable. It has only improved in the last couple of years," says Masueger. "China now produces some very expensive, yet very nice wines. But the bad reputation remains. The Chinese should be able to enjoy good quality, affordable wine."When Masueger first arrived in Beijing in 2008, she embarked on a mission to change the wine scene. Back then, the only good wine were the expensive imports served in five-star hotels.In recent years, Chinese of all classes have started to drink alcohol more regularly, according to global consulting firm INS. No longer considered a niche product, wine enjoys widespread demand among Chinese consumers.And with this more mainstream appeal, consumers are now more willing to try new wines-both local and imported-and incorporate them into their daily diets, says Masueger.Wine is becoming a healthier alternative to baijiu, a liquor that used to be served with dinner. Now both drinks can be served with evening meals when paired with different types of foods."People now try to mix local dishes together with wine," says Masueger. "Riesling goes well with hotpot, as does moscato."Masueger believes that once consumers are introduced to new types of wines-whether red, rose or white-they will start to incorporate them into their daily lives.

                Moutai's trademark application rejected
            </a>
            <p>
                China's alcohol brand Kweichow Moutai's trademark application for "national banquet" was rejected by the Beijing Intellectual Property Court, Sina Finance reported on Tuesday.The trademark for "Moutai Guoyan" or "Moutai for national banquet" applied to liquor products may lead mis-recognition of the quality and ranking of Moutai, the court said.Meanwhile, if "Moutai Guoyan" became a registered trademark for alcohol and enjoyed exclusive usage rights, it would be unfair to other industrial players and have certain negative impacts on public interests, according to the court.As far back as September 2001, Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd applied to register "Guojiu Moutai", or "Moutai the national alcohol", as a trademark, but was initially rejected in August 2002. The company tried a further nine times to register the trademark in 2006 and 2010, but these attempts were also unsuccessful.Kweichow Moutai's efforts in trademark application reflects Chinese company's awareness of the importance of intellectual property rights, the comprehensive strength of which has been steadily improved, according to the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO).In the first half of this year, China's number of trademark registrations reached 3.52 million, up 67.8 percent year-on-year, and the number of granted invention patents' saw a 9.9 percent year-on-year growth to a total of 238,000, SIPO said.

                Chinese liquor brand Wang Mao has bolstered its fashionista credentials this week with the first-ever sponsorship collaboration between London Fashion Week and a Chinese spirit maker.Wang Mao, a sub-brand of well-known baijiu maker Moutai, has become an official spirit partner of London Fashion Week September 2019.Usually distilled from sorghum and wheat, baijiu contains between 40 and 60 percent alcohol by volume, and is a mainstay of special social occasions in China, from Spring Festival dinners to weddings and business banquets.Founded in 1879, Wang Mao was merged to become the State-run Moutai Distillery in the early 1950s, and the brand was relaunched in 2018 by Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd to target the 30-to 50-year-old customer group.Yuan Bin, chief executive of Wang Mao, hailed the collaboration, saying the brand takes pride in the heritage of Chinese culture while also valuing the creativity and fashion sense."London Fashion Week, from what we see, is a unique one amongst the four big international fashion weeks, because on one hand it highlights the history and tradition, but at the same time it absorbs innovative ideas and concepts, which fits in very well with our brand," Yuan said.As part of the collaboration, Wang Mao was able to promote its products at the London Fashion Week September 2019, with two cocktails being created using the liquor as their base ingredient.Gemma Juviler, commercial director at British Fashion Council, which organizes London Fashion Week, said it was a win-win partnership."What the British Fashion Council has done, with our international strategy, is really focus on China, because when we're helping designers to build and grow their business, one of the most important structures that they can think about is how to successfully enter the Chinese market," she said."Given its resonance with an international market, specifically in China, I think associating Chinese brands such as Wang Mao with the British Fashion Council and particularly London Fashion Week is a really good message for the audience back in China."Drinks columnist Douglas Blyde welcomed the partnership, saying: "It is a vote of confidence from China to the UK to invest alongside the catwalk here. With the right guidance, Wang Mao could create some amazing, memorable drinks which will be as flamboyant and distinctive as the fashion spectacles they may be enjoyed alongside."With more Chinese businesses keen to make inroads into the international arena, Wang Mao is not alone in tapping into the potential of the major fashion platforms.Since 2018, Alibaba's Tmall has held special China Day events at the last four New York Fashion Weeks, showing the best in Chinese fashion.And Chinese e-commerce giant JD has a three-year partnership with the British Fashion Council that runs until the end of 2021, to provide a channel for Chinese brands at London Fashion Week.
