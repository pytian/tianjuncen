CIS also works with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences on a quarterly Chinese-language magazine called Contemporary Korea, bringing together researchers from both countries as well as those from the region to examine the latest news on ROK politics, economy, culture and education. "In the past, ROK students mainly studied majors such as Chinese language and literature, but now they are interested in every subject, from history and business management, to science and engineering," said Lee Joon-sik, who has worked in Chinese-language education for nearly 40 years

With Chongqing municipality serving as one of its transportation hubs, the corridor uses ports in Guangxi's Beibu Gulf coasts to provide access to Singapore and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations members by sea, and links with China-Europe freight trains coming from many western Chinese cities before heading to Central Asia, South Asia and Europe. The land-sea corridor can greatly shorten the travel distance of seaward exports from China's western and even central region, according to Guangxi's officials

                            Trump this week also said Afghanistan remains dangerous and "we have to have a presence" - a stance that could complicate talks with the Taliban, whose top demand has been the departure of all US and allied troops, which number close to 20,000. US President Donald Trump, who wants to bring home at least some of the 13,000 troops he says remain in Afghanistan before next year's election, was briefed on the negotiations on Friday.Previously, Khalilzad has said the intra-Afghan negotiations will be the occasion to work out thorny issues such as constitutional reforms, the fate of the country's many militias and even the name for Afghanistan, as the Taliban still refers to it as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan

Holden Chow Ho-ding, who is the DAB's vice-chairman and also a legislator, said the proposed act aims to pressure both the government of the Hong Kong special administrative region and the central government, which could lead to the escalation of tension between China and the US and harm both countries and the rest of the world. What is happening in Hong Kong is not a crisis of human rights but a crisis of rule of law, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular news conference in Beijing on Tuesday

                            US President Donald Trump last year pulled his country out of the Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.French officials said Macron decided to make the "surprise" invite after hosting a dinner of G7 leaders on Saturday night, when G7 leaders agreed that Macron should hold talks and pass on messages to Iran.In an interview with Euronews last week, Zarif said the crisis over the nuclear deal raises questions over Europe's independence from the US which is "imposing its will" on its allies

                            One of the biggest challenges in the Chinese market is convincing consumers that wearing wigs is fashionable "and not just something for people who experience baldness or actors who need to play roles", said Wang Shixin, director of the technology center at Henan Rebecca Hair Products Inc. But it now makes its own fiber material, with nearly 200 stores helping to promote its latest products in first－and second-tier cities across China, Zhang said.Wig-making has also been a business for centuries in Xuchang's Quandian village after German merchants discovered how hair of residents there was "straight with a healthy sheen", said Zhang Tianyou, vice-president of major wigmaker Henan Rebecca Hair Products

Plus, the failure of May's initial Brexit plan meant the deal with the EU would face strong resistance from British members of parliament. Ironically, it also means Britain which decided to leave the EU has to take part in the European Parliament elections on May 23

                            British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced he would seek to trigger a snap general election after defeat in a key House of Commons vote meant he lost control of the Brexit process.The defeat means members of Parliament were due on Wednesday to vote on a bill that would delay Britain's departure from the European Union if a new withdrawal deal cannot be agreed before Oct 19.The government's motion that could trigger an election was expected to be voted on later, possibly also on Wednesday, but it would need a two-thirds majority to pass and that would require the support of opposition MPs
