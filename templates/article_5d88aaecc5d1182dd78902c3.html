                "China: A Whole New Game" was the headline on the cover of the April 24, 1971 issue of Time magazine. Right beneath it, a group of Americans beamed for the camera atop China's Great Wall. One of them, a young woman in the center wearing a headscarf, was Connie Sweeris, the then-US women's singles and doubles champion.Yesterday, the Time magazine cover appeared on a big screen as Sweeris spoke to a 300-strong audience at the Asia Society in New York, looking back on her weeklong tour in China 48 years ago, an event that unveiled a new chapter for the Sino-US relationship.Sweeris was a featured speaker at a Vision China forum, "China-US Relations: 40 Years & Beyond", hosted by China Daily and Bank of China."In April 1971, on our last day of competition at the 31st World Table Tennis Championships in Nagoya, Japan, we were told that we had been invited to visit China," she said. "But no American had been allowed to go into China for 22 years."On April 10, having flown from Japan to Hong Kong the day before, the Americans crossed the bridge connecting Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, where they were more than happy to venture out on their own."Everyone was either walking or riding a bicycle, and before we knew it, we had a crowd following us. People were very friendly and always tried to talk to us," said Sweeris.A real thrill came when Sweeris played against Lin Huiqing, who won three golds at Nagoya, in front of 18,000 people at Beijing's Capital Stadium. The showing of the video footage at Asia Society last night was met with thunderous applause from the listeners.Another fond moment is the meeting with the then-Chinese premier Zhou Enlai. "When I shook hands with the premier, he seemed very personable and gracious," said Sweeris. "The premier asked Graham Steenhoven, president of the USA Table Tennis Association, if he had any criticism of the trip. And he responded by saying, 'You feed us too much food!' Everyone laughed."Sweeris said that she was made aware of the importance of her trip to China before it officially kicked off."At the train depot in Hong Kong, we were barraged by reporters from all over the world wielding cameras."The media sensed right. History was unfolding fast: In February the next year, US President Richard Nixon would visit China, followed two months later by a Chinese table tennis team's reciprocal tour of the US in April 1972.Connie Sweeris was among the hosts, together with her husband and fellow player Dell Sweeris, who appeared in historical footage jumping high and slashing at the ball. He attended the event Tuesday."In 1972, Lin and I got a chance to live our memory as were played matches in Detroit, Washington, New York, Los Angeles, Memphis, Tennessee, and a number of other cities," she said.That memory has been given pride of place. These days, the basement floor at the couple's home in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was occupied by a table tennis table, with two giant paddles decorating one side of the walls.A few steps away is the "ping-pong corner", where layers of glass cabinets are filled with all the trophies they won, and all the memorabilia from events known today as the "ping-pong diplomacy".These include a red pocket book of Chairman Mao Zedong's quotes, in English of course, that was handed to Connie Sweeris upon her entering the Chinese mainland across the bridge.Then there were the pictures and the media reports, among them the Time magazine cover story that ran for several pages. One of the inside page headline pronounced: Ping heard around the world.

                    China releases application guide for Antarctic travel
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                BEIJING - China's Ministry of Natural Resources has recently released an application guide for tourist activities at the Great Wall station in Antarctica.Enterprises that have travel plans to the Antarctic research station can submit applications to the ministry on working days from Sept. 15 to 30 every year, the ministry said on its website.The Great Wall station, built in 1985, is China's first research base on the continent. It is located near a nature reserve where groups of penguins and seals are often seen.The research station is the most popular destination for domestic tourists. With only 30 staff, it receives more than 2,000 Chinese visitors each summer and is faced with increasing pressure to perform its regular tasks and maintain its safety and environment.China is a consultative member of the Antarctic Treaty. In order to fulfill the obligations of the international conventions, all applying enterprises must strengthen education on environmental protection for visitors, and comply with the protection requirements of the Antarctic environment, wild animals and plants, the ministry said.China is now ranked second as a tourist source for Antarctica after the United States.

                    A father's visit to his daughter in Hangzhou
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                My jaw dropped and all I could say was, "Wow," after 36 hours traveling from my hometown, Ahuachapan, 100 kilometers west of El Salvador's capital, San Salvador.Although I am used to long distance traveling, this was my first visit to an Asian country, China, and I was in Shanghai. I was impressed by all the skyscrapers above me, the city's modern well-signaled highways (many in English) and the crowds of people walking and touring along the Bund.For me, it was like an epiphany. Even though the US and Europe have always impressed me with their progress and development compared with other countries (especially developing countries like mine), this encounter made me realize there is a large part of the world I had no idea about at all.After graduating from college, my kid had been working here for a year as a teacher and I intended to find out if all her stories – and what the internet says – are true.After two days in Shanghai, visiting places like the Oriental Pearl Tower and the Financial District shopping at the famous Nanjing Road, we started our trip to where my daughter lives, Hangzhou.When we arrived, she led us to her apartment, just across the street from the Zhejiang University of Technology. Although it was not as developed as Shanghai in 2016 – no English street signs, only Chinese characters – the people were so friendly they immediately made me feel welcome and appreciated.Everyone we met was respectful to my daughter and to me by extension: I was her baba and in China, that counts for a lot! Even though I was 55 at the time, according to Western standards not that old, elders are treated with a kind of special respect here. I appreciated that, and in return I would provide the same treatment to whomever we met.Although there were the expected cultural differences, I learned that family is of great importance in China, as in Latin America, particularly El Salvador. All this made me feel very comfortable and safe about my daughter living here. She could teach a lot, but possibly learn even more from Chinese people than we ever imagined.Little did I know that this was going to be the city in China with which I would fall deeply fall in love.I was amazed the first time I saw the West Lake of Hangzhou. Every story I'd heard about it didn't come even close to describing the beauty of its calm waters and its relaxing walking trails, well-kept gardens and surrounding pagodas. The city almost encircles it, so it's like an oasis in the middle of a frantic and continuously growing city.Visited by thousands every day, all year long, I would undoubtedly nominate it as one of the seven natural wonders of the world. A breathtaking view from the fifth level of the beautiful Leifeng Pagoda gave me confirmation of this.Afterwards, to relax a little and grab a bite, we visited the famous Long Jing Village, one of the finest green tea plantations in China. Coming from an intensive quality-coffee growing country, it was an all-new but somehow familiar experience that really delighted me because of the similarities between our two highly regarded drinks.After a six-hour ride on a high-speed train covering the 1,200 kilometers to Beijing, sometimes at 330 kilometers per hour, and a car drive a little way up north, I was facing the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall. The world's largest man-made structure built many centuries ago was more than I could ask for.Using the state-of-the-art funicular to climb to the top, it was inspiring to walk by and absorb the beauty of the landscape. All these experiences moved me to make myself the promise to return to China and learn from its noble people and their ancient culture, only that time I would learn to speak some Chinese.
