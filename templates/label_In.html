                             Wang said that in the initial stage, a number of African countries had just won their independence and were in great need of foreign development aid. "While African countries will still need funding, projects and materials, they now want to learn more about China's experience in governance and economic development, including how to stimulate market potential and the private sector," Wang said. In recent decades, Africa has witnessed far-reaching changes, and has seen one of the fastest rates of economic development globally, meaning there are now different requirements for aid from China, Wang added

The first conference on improving mass organizations organized by the CPC Central Committee in 2015 determined a direction for the work concerning women in the new era by showing how to promote reforms of the Women's Federation and how to make the organization and work of Women's Federation more politically responsive, up to date, and geared to the demands of the masses. In the 12 sessions of the National Women's Congress concluded thus far, guidelines for women movement and work as well as main pertinent tasks were worked out in line with general CPC and government policies for nationwide implementation of relevant plans

Will Chinese tech companies be willing to rely on US chips? For that matter, will countries around the world be willing to be dependent on US technology? The decisions being made now are irreversible.

The first tenet is reflected by the 'Prosper Africa' initiative, whose stated goal is to substantially increase trade and investment between the US and Africa. The recovery of those growth levels could take long, due to the decline in industrial production and particularly as the US-Sino trade war is taking its toll

At the same time, China's growing economic power will create problems for the US and the international order, and friction is likely over market access, forced technology transfer, State-directed industrial policies to support national champions, overcapacity, and coerced transfer of intellectual property. But no other country - including China - is about to replace the US in terms of overall power resources in the next few decades

                            Many observers consider the 21stCentury to be “Asia’s Century” and the BRI seems certain to strengthen that claim and have a significant impact on economic realignment and progress in the coming decades, BRI also seems to be one of the forces for the further development of globalization in contrast to the pulling back from free trade and investment that Washington has set itself on in the last two years. Indeed, as President Xi stated in May 2017, at China’s first Belt and Road Summit hosted in Beijing, the BRI is for everyone regardless of geographical location, as any interested country is welcome to join in the investment in the project and supply their expertise.Of course, the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 has both a land and a maritime element, and it not just about reach but also about depth, improving infrastructure in key cities and areas in the many countries to be linked by the project

Thus, China's position to what is happening in Hong Kong is deeply steeped in historical context and China's role in promoting sovereignty of nations, free of foreign interference.China's recent history and policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries make foreign meddling in Hong Kong affairs extremely unpalatable The protests in Hong Kong, now in their third month, must be an encouraging index of sovereign ambitions to China's detractors and competitors

                             According to veteran diplomats, interactions between China and the US in Shanghai, and what they have achieved in the city in past decades, are part of the two countries' shared legacy and are lessons that need to be passed on. "But at the time, political support within the US toward developing relations with China was not very strong, and many US politicians were unable to observe China's economic growth and social changes that had taken place," Wu added. Yuan Peng, a leading US expert and president of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that despite the Taiwan question, many new issues that emerged - including the Korean nuclear situation, the South China Sea, global economic governance and climate change - were not included in the landmark joint statements issued by the two governments in 1972, 1978 and 1982

In a communique after their two-day annual meeting in France on April 6, the G7 demonized BRI as a sign of China's global dominance and an obstacle for Western alliances. China's aid to Africa is making a more significant impact than the West's condition-based programmes, which were ultimately bad experiments on Africa's economies

                             As the Chinese pangolin only produces one newborn a year, it will take a long time for the species to recover," he said. In 2017, the International Union for Conservation of Nature placed Chinese pangolins on the Red List of Endangered Species, as a team of experts believed that the population had dropped by 90 percent in the previous decade. The number of live Sunda pangolins being saved from illegal cross-border trade has posed a heavy financial burden on local wildlife animal rescue and protection centers, most of which lack experience in breeding pangolins in captivity and do not have the budget to house the animals

We believe that with the growing maturity of multinational corporations' operations onshore in China, foreign parent companies will be increasingly seeking to tap the domestic bond market as an important and highly cost-effective source of RMB funding to support their Chinese expansion needs.In 2018, China took several solid steps toward allowing even greater access for foreign financial institutions, which include relaxing the regulation on foreign ownership limits and accelerating the progress of creating a fairer arena for bank branch openings and debt fundraising

Should we steer economic globalization, or dither and stall in the face of challenge? Should we jointly advance regional cooperation, or go our separate ways?This is my answer: We must advance with the trend of times, live up to our responsibility and work together to deliver a bright future of development and prosperity for the Asia-Pacific.As China works hard to pursue innovation and higher quality of growth, new forms of business will keep emerging, more innovations will be used, and development of various regions in China will become more balanced.Fourth, we should continue to make economic development more inclusive and deliver its benefits to our people

                            According to Nicholas You, the executive director of Guangzhou Institute for Urban Innovation, cities are entering into a new era, where they are taking on roles that were traditionally not within their mandate, perhaps due to inability of the existing institutions to respond effectively to local challenges. That implementation of the new urban agenda, and SDGs at the local level, is going to compel many cities to think beyond their traditional mandate," he said.The Guangzhou International Award for Urban Innovation has become a vital platform for cities across the world to share best practices and learn from each other on localization of new urban agenda or NUA and sustainable development goals or SDGs
