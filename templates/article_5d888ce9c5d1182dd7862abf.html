                Chinese soybean farmers flourish in new pastures Alexander Mikhailovich Somov is head of a small village called Dmitlovo in the Russian Far East. The 75-year-old recalled that in 1992, when he moved to the village, there were only about 100 residents and 300 buildings, including a school, several small shops, a pig farm and some abandoned properties. Due to poor transportation links and a lack of job opportunities, young people kept moving away from Dmitlovo, which is 70 kilometers south of Birobidzhan, the capital of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast. "At one time, there were fewer than 10 families in the village," Somov said. The village's future appeared bleak until 2014, when two Chinese farm owners, Ying Junfeng and Ying Xiufeng, from Suifenhe, Heilongjiang province, arrived. The brothers rented 3,000 hectares of wasteland - most of it marshland - and began to grow soybeans. Ying Junfeng said that when they first arrived, the locals did not believe they would stay for long. It was only after the new arrivals spent four years constructing a 6-kilometer road with farm excavators and bulldozers to connect the village with other districts that they finally gained the locals' trust and appreciation. Now, at least one member of almost every family in the village works on the soybean farm. The average wage is 1,000 roubles ($15.50) per day - higher than that in Birobidzhan, according to Somov. "We greatly appreciate our Chinese friends coming here, because if they had not, the village would have disappeared," he said. China and Russia have strengthened agricultural cooperation in recent years, particularly in the soybean industry, amid trade tensions between Beijing and Washington. Last year, China imported 817,000 metric tons of soybeans from Russia, up by nearly 65 percent on 2017. Most of the imports came from the Russian Far East, according to the Ministry of Commerce. In June, the two countries signed a development plan to deepen soybean cooperation, and in late July, China approved imports of the crop from across Russia. Exports to rise Valery Dubrovskiy, director of investment for the Far East Investment and Export Agency, a nonprofit organization, said Russia will open 1 million hectares of arable land to foreign investors, and it expects most of the funds to come from China. The South China Morning Post reported last month that the land is suitable for dairy farming or for cultivating crops, including soybeans. Maxim Oreshkin, Russia's Minister of Economic Development, said his country and China have listed several key sectors that need to be developed and improved. "The two countries should not only implement large projects, but also provide diversified end-use goods and investment, whose volumes will grow very quickly," he said. In particular, he said that Russia plans to increase soybean exports to China, the world's largest importer of the crop. There is high demand in China for soybeans, as they are the source of tofu, soy milk, soybean oil and even animal feed, but 90 percent of the country's requirements are met through imports, mainly from countries such as the United States, Brazil and Argentina. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, soybean demand in China is about 110 million tons per year, while the nation's output is about 16 million tons. However, since last year, the US has imposed several rounds of additional tariffs on Chinese imports. In retaliation, China has levied tariffs on a range of US imports, including soybeans. Before the trade dispute erupted, the Chinese market accounted for about 60 percent of US soybean exports, but last year the proportion fell to 17.9 percent due to US trade protectionist policies. Sergey Lukanin, researcher at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations at the Russian Academy of Sciences, said that when trade tensions between China and the US began, he thought that Russia could theoretically fill the gap in soybean supplies resulting from the dispute, and as a result, agricultural cooperation between Russia and China could flourish. Chen Yangfen, a researcher with the Institute of Agricultural Economics and Development at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said China needs to diversify its soybean import sources to ensure a stable supply of agricultural produce amid the trade tensions with the US. At the same time, Russia also needs to seek new growth drivers while facing economic sanctions from the West. "China and Russia have strong complementarities in agricultural markets, capital, land and technology resources," he said. "Both countries have good relations, so deepening agricultural cooperation, especially in the soybean industry, is a natural move." Some Chinese companies have already started to grow agricultural produce, including soybeans, in Russia to sell to the Chinese market. Chen said the Russian Far East, which has a large area of reclaimable land that can be cultivated and is ready to attract investment, has been the main target for Chinese companies. An estimated 95 percent of the soybeans in the Russian Far East border region with Heilongjiang province are grown by Chinese, he added. "In Russia, about 250 million hectares of land are suitable for growing soybeans, but to date, only about 3 percent has been used," Chen said. The good relations between China and Russia, which mean low political risks, are an advantage in growing soybeans in Russia, he said. Moreover, the nations' geographical proximity means that the cost of sending the produce to China is much lower than that for shipping it from the US or Brazil. Strict regulations Ying Junfeng, the soybean grower in Dmitlovo, said the soil in the area is fertile and suitable for cultivation and growth. In addition, Russia has strict regulations on food processing safety, environmental protection and the use of pesticides and fertilizers. "Russia prohibits the cultivation of genetically modified crops," he said. "Therefore, non-GMO Russian soybeans could be a selling point in the Chinese market." Wang Shilin, manager of Suifenhe Baoguo Economic and Trade Co in Suifenhe city, Heilongjiang, said the company has invested 160 million yuan ($22.6 million) in its two farms in Primorsky Krai in Russia's Far East that cover a total of 16,000 hectares of arable land, along with a 0.7-hectare pig farm with 6,000 animals. This year, its farms are expected to produce 15,000 tons of soybeans and 50,000 tons of corn. Shilin said that under Russian law, grain cultivation must follow European Union standards and strict restrictions should be imposed on pesticides, fertilizers and seeds. "Moreover, Russia has encouraged grain exports with zero tax," he said. Yue Hongwen, deputy general manager of Suifenhe Liangyun Agricultural Products Development Co, which was established in 2014, said it has a mature agricultural production chain in Russia, including planting, breeding, processing and logistics. The company decided to invest in the Russian agricultural sector in view of the increasing demand for soybeans in China. In Russia, land rentals are lower, the soil is fertile and planting costs are relatively affordable, he said. By the end of last year, the company had a 30-hectare farm in Russia with more than 100 sets of large agricultural machinery, and was planting on 10,000 hectares of arable land, mainly in Primorsky Krai. It has an annual output of about 20,000 tons of maize, 12,500 tons of soybeans and more than 8,000 tons of oat grass. "In the next five years, we intend to cultivate an additional 50,000 to 60,000 hectares of high-quality organic land in Russia," Yue said."We will focus on growing organic and non-GMO agricultural produce for the Chinese market." He said the investment return from growing soybeans in Russia initially ranged from 30 percent to 40 percent. However, as costs have increased, the return has fallen as more companies from South Korea, Japan and China have arrived in Russia in the past two to three years to grow soybeans. "Taking tax and logistics costs into account, Russian soybeans, although they are non-GMO, are not competitively priced in China, as those grown domestically receive government subsidies," Yue said. Chen said China and Russia have great potential for agricultural cooperation. But in the Russian Far East, infrastructure is backward, including soybean processing. Compared with other main soybean producers such as the US and Brazil, temperatures in the Russian Far East are much lower, and as the crop is non-GMO, this restricts the yield. In 2017, the soybean yield per hectare in the US was 3.29 metric tons. In Russia, it was 1.40 tons and in Brazil it was 3.38 tons, he said.

                Sino-Russian partnership gets verve to improve world order
            </a>
            <p>
                To the China-Russia partnership, the 24th regular meeting between their heads of government, which concluded in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Wednesday, gave a shot in the arm. There is no better way for the two sides to secure international support as both have come under increasing external pressure to change their diplomatic maneuvering on the global stage. The joint communique Beijing and Moscow issued proves the claim that the Sino-Russian partnership, now officially described as comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era, has reached a historical high. Not least because the document literally instills the idea of comprehensive strategic partnership into all aspects of bilateral relations, showcasing the two sides' shared commitment to formulating a new kind of Sino-Russian partnership in global governance. Emphatically, it reiterates the importance of securing mutual support. With both under pressure of externally imposed economic hardships, Beijing and Moscow are laying unprecedented emphasis on tapping the full potential of bilateral collaboration. And given their highly complementary economic structures as well as economic conditions, they do have room for such endeavors. The document they issued on Wednesday vows to raise bilateral trade, which surpassed $100 billion in 2018, to $200 billion by 2024 through trade facilitation. Besides promises of dovetailing their respective key development strategies, the Beijing-proposed Belt and Road Initiative and Moscow's Eurasian Economic Union, they have pledged to make joint efforts to address current issues, from collaboration on soy production to avoiding risks of sanctions from the West. While making their partnership true to its comprehensive nature, China and Russia have made it clear in the joint communique that their cooperation is not limited to bilateral affairs. Despite being a little less specific when it comes to such issues, the document does indicate the clear orientation of the two countries to work more closely together in the international arena. As responsible major countries, it says, China and Russia share the obligation for improving global governance and safeguarding international justice. That Beijing and Moscow have vowed to deepen cooperation on such multilateral international platforms as the United Nations, World Trade Organization, Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS reflects the seriousness with which they intend to work to build a world order that is fairer and more representative of nations. Since the current pattern of Sino-Russian interaction is the outcome of de facto Western isolation, it should come as no surprise if the two are found acting more in unison against rising protectionism and unilateralism that have cast a shadow over the world.

                US looks set to remain China's main soybean supplier in short term
            </a>
            <p>
                Russia is unlikely to replace the United States as China's main soybean supplier in the immediate future, according to industry insiders.Their prediction comes despite the fact that China and Russia have made great progress on cooperating in the soybean sector.Chinese imports of Russian soybeans have risen amid the trade dispute with the US, while Beijing and Moscow have pledged to increase their cooperation in the sector.The South China Morning Post reported recently that Russia would make 1 million hectares of arable land available to foreign investors. Most of the money is expected to come from China.Chen Yangfen, a researcher with the Institute of Agricultural Economics and Development at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said that to ensure grain security, China must diversify its soybean import channels. Cooperation between China and Russia in the sector offers great potential, he added."But we can see that Russia will not be able to replace the market share held by the US for a considerable period of time or fully meet Chinese demand for soybeans," Chen said.China needs to import 80 million to 90 million metric tons of soybeans a year, but Russia cannot meet this demand, he said."Last year, China's soybean imports from the US fell by 49.4 percent year-on-year, to 16.64 million tons," he said. "But Russia's total soybean output last year was only 4.02 million tons. There is still a huge gap between demand in the Chinese market and Russian soybean supplies."Moreover, Russia mainly grows non-genetically modified soybeans, while the demand in China is mainly for soybean meal and soybean soil. As a result, there is an imbalance between supply and demand.Yue Hongwen is deputy general manager of Suifenhe Liangyun Agricultural Products Development Co in Heilongjiang province, which in recent years has grown soybeans in the Russian Far East. He said that although Moscow encourages agriculture sector development in this region and welcomes farmers from overseas to grow produce there, it will take a long time for the scale of such business to increase.He Zhenwei, secretary-general of the China Overseas Development Association, said the trade tensions between China and the US have resulted in a "soybean gap" of millions of tons. Russia could be a good choice to fill the gap, due to its geographical proximity to China and because it produces high-quality, non-GMO soybeans.But as Russian soybean output is still far from sufficient to meet Chinese demand, He suggested that to increase output, Moscow should improve agricultural and port infrastructure in the Russian Far East, where most of the country's soybeans are grown.

                Sino-Russian agricultural links take root
            </a>
            <p>
                Chinese soybean farmers flourish in new pasturesAlexander Mikhailovich Somov is head of a small village called Dmitlovo in the Russian Far East.The 75-year-old recalled that in 1992, when he moved to the village, there were only about 100 residents and 300 buildings, including a school, several small shops, a pig farm and some abandoned properties.Due to poor transportation links and a lack of job opportunities, young people kept moving away from Dmitlovo, which is 70 kilometers south of Birobidzhan, the capital of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast."At one time, there were fewer than 10 families in the village," Somov said.The village's future appeared bleak until 2014, when two Chinese farm owners, Ying Junfeng and Ying Xiufeng, from Suifenhe, Heilongjiang province, arrived. The brothers rented 3,000 hectares of wasteland - most of it marshland - and began to grow soybeans.Ying Junfeng said that when they first arrived, the locals did not believe they would stay for long. It was only after the new arrivals spent four years constructing a 6-kilometer road with farm excavators and bulldozers to connect the village with other districts that they finally gained the locals' trust and appreciation.Now, at least one member of almost every family in the village works on the soybean farm. The average wage is 1,000 roubles ($15.50) per day - higher than that in Birobidzhan, according to Somov."We greatly appreciate our Chinese friends coming here, because if they had not, the village would have disappeared," he said.China and Russia have strengthened agricultural cooperation in recent years, particularly in the soybean industry, amid trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.Last year, China imported 817,000 metric tons of soybeans from Russia, up by nearly 65 percent on 2017. Most of the imports came from the Russian Far East, according to the Ministry of Commerce.In June, the two countries signed a development plan to deepen soybean cooperation, and in late July, China approved imports of the crop from across Russia.

                UN Security Council divided over Syria
            </a>
            <p>
                The UN Security Council on Thursday did not adopt either of two competing resolutions on a cessation of hostilities in Idlib, Syria, the last city in the war-torn nation that is still largely held by rebel forces.Germany, Belgium and Kuwait proposed a humanitarian cease-fire, which got 12 out of 15 votes. Permanent Security Council members China and Russia vetoed the draft, blocking its adoption.The other resolution, proposed by China and Russia, highlighted terrorism concerns by extremist groups operating inside the region. Nine members voted against it, and four abstained.After voting against the draft resolution, China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Zhang Jun said that regarding the Idlib issue, starting on Aug 31, the Russian and Syrian governments had implemented a cease-fire in Idlib, which has been maintained in general.The diplomatic efforts by relevant parties of the international community is ongoing, and the situation in Idlib is moving in a positive direction, he said."Under such a context, to steamroll a draft resolution that has major controversies, to a vote, is clearly unconstructive, and this move will not achieve the expected result," Zhang said."Terrorist organizations continue to expand their sphere of influence in the northwest region of Syria," he said. "This is the source of the humanitarian issue in Idlib. It also poses a grave risk to the safety and security in the region."Zhang called the council to unite in tackling the "grave challenge" together."China has constructively participated in the negotiation of the text and has proposed reasonable revisions. However, unfortunately the draft resolution just put to a vote did not touch upon the essence of the issue and did not address China's core concerns. For this reason, China voted against the draft resolution," he explained.Zhang said the humanitarian situation in Syria is a complicated and sensitive issue. All categories of humanitarian issues in Syria should be considered in a comprehensive manner and be addressed in a balanced way, instead of only selectively focusing on certain issues, much less to politicize humanitarian issues."The international community must fully respect the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Syria, fully listen to the views of the Syrian government, and seek a comprehensive solution to the Syria issue through political means," he said."At the same time, we should pay high attention to the postwar reconstruction of Syria and its economic and social development and to help Syrian people lead peaceful, stable and happy lives," he added.Zhang underlined that China also attaches great importance to the humanitarian situation in Syria, and that's why Russia and China proposed an alternative draft resolution, which took into consideration the humanitarian and counterterrorism issues of Syria in a comprehensive manner."This draft includes the call for observance of international law in counterterrorism and assurance of humanitarian access and reflects the humanitarian needs of the Syrian people," he explained.Zhang said China firmly rejects the "groundless" accusation made by the UK and the US against China."China has the right to make an independent decision on how it votes, according to the rights and wrongs of a situation, and preceding from the interests of the Syrian people. No country has the right to make a willful accusation on this," he said."I would like to point out that the current situation of Syria and the sufferings of the Syrian people are exactly the results of the wrongful conduct by some countries. It is these countries that should reflect on their own behavior," he said.Ursula Mueller, the UN assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, who spoke prior to the vote, said a unilateral cease-fire announced by Russia on Aug 30 has reportedly led to a decline in fighting in the northwestern region. However, insecurity and an "alarming" humanitarian situation persist."The fragile cease-fire has brought into focus an outlook that, for this Security Council, should be all too familiar: Further fighting will endanger and displace thousands of civilians. Further displacement will create even more needs. Further needs will stretch humanitarians that are already at their limit," she told the chamber."The world is watching … in hopes that a more humane outlook for Syria will be created, one where civilians are safe, needs are addressed, and humanitarians are protected."
