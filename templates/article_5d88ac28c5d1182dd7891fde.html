                    A bridge of development links Japan and China
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The Nippon Foundation, of which I serve as chairman, and its affiliated organizations, began working with China in the early 1980s, initially on efforts to eliminate leprosy in the country. China had launched reform and opening-up a couple of years earlier and was embarking on a path of economic development. On the streets of major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, people wore monotone clothing of dark blue, gray or green, and walking down a street felt like being in a black-and-white television scene.Since then, we have worked with many people in various fields both in Japan and China, primarily in the areas of personnel exchanges and human resource development. We have implemented more than 500 projects involving exchanges between Japan and China, directly involving about 50,000 people in the two countries.The black-and-white scene gradually acquired color. And today, China outshines Japan as a country that produces some of the world's most colorful images. Our overarching goal has been that the people of both countries enjoy peace and prosperity, and as I have devoted myself to these exchange programs, I have been a witness to China's astounding growth and development, which are unparalleled in human history.Southern Tour helped China meet challengesWhen I visited China with my father, Ryoichi Sasakawa, in the 1980s, we met several times with Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's economic reforms and socialist modernization. I clearly remember Deng saying: "Reform and opening-up are the only path China can take to survive." I also remember when this program faced a period of difficulty, Deng, despite his advanced age, made his famous Southern Tour of cities in South China to shore up support for reform and opening-up.Yangmingism, a school of neo-Confucianism based on the teachings of Wang Yangming that had its origins in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), was brought to Japan by its followers who fled China after the fall of the dynasty, and had a major impact on Japanese society. Yangmingism espouses the doctrine of "unity of knowing and acting", meaning that knowledge and action are one and the same, and cannot be separated. Or, in other words, if one does not act, one does not have knowledge. I believe the Chinese are truly the world's greatest practitioners of the unity of knowing and acting.Around the world, there are many national government projects that are presented as a distillation of the wisdom of the country's top leaders, but there are few examples that match the knowledge and strength of action seen in the Chinese people's determination to implement individual projects. The Pudong Development Plan is one such example.From a mere plan to a real wonderWhen I visited China in 1990, the year the plan was proposed, a Shanghai government official showed me around Pudong and explained the plan, using a model of the project and pointing to fields as far as the eye could see. The first briefing on the Pudong Development Plan in Japan was held the same year, when a delegation of city officials from China's coastal regions, led by Huang Ju (who became mayor of Shanghai in 1991 and was elected as a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee in 2002) were invited to Japan.In 1991, when I accompanied Huang on a tour of the major construction project for the Kansai International Airport, he told me how impressed he was by the project. But the Pudong Development Plan went far beyond our imagination, and it was the Chinese who were able to follow through with that transformation. And 20 years later, that plan on paper became the wonder that is the Pudong New Area, which is admired around the world.The Nippon Foundation and its affiliated organizations have implemented a variety of programs to meet China's needs at various stages of reform and opening-up, reorienting our direction as necessary along the way.In the late 1980s, we first worked to initiate and expand reciprocal visits between Japan and China, and in the early 1990s we supported economic transformation, including sharing our experience with privatizing State-owned enterprises. We also conducted numerous programs that brought officials from the central government as well as specialists who would be carrying out regulatory reform in rural areas to Japan.Having worked together with the Chinese during 40 years of reform and opening-up, we admire China's abundant, high-quality human resources. I am convinced that human resources are the most important driving force supporting peace and development in China, Asia and the world, and the Nippon Foundation and our affiliated organizations have engaged in many joint projects with China, with a focus on human resource development.Nippon has trained many future leadersThe Sasakawa Medical Fellowship, in cooperation with China's National Health Commission, has awarded and trained more than 2,300 medical students in various fields, most of whom have gone on to become leaders in the field of healthcare and medicine, as academicians in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, or heads of hospitals or medical schools. A scholarship recipient also directed the emergency response to the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake.Another good example is the Ryoichi Sasakawa Young Leaders Fellowship Fund, a program that five major universities in China joined in 1992, and an additional five in 1994. This program provides scholarships for graduate students pursuing degrees in the humanities at 69 universities in 44 countries, and has provided scholarships to more than 16,000 students around the world, of whom about 8,000 are from these 10 Chinese universities.Many of these students are now heads of universities, senior corporate managers, key government officials and judges. In these positions, they have been active in supporting China's reform and opening-up, and will continue to contribute to the country's social development.We have also been engaged in human resource development in China in countless other ways, which include a human resource training program in international relations at Peking University that has been going on for more than 20 years, Japanese language training across China, the training of technicians in the field of high-speed rail transport, and the donation of a total of 4 million books and publications to more than 70 universities in China.Economic relationship highly complementaryJapan and China are geopolitically inseparable. Their economic relationship is already mutually complementary: the Japanese cannot go about their daily lives without food and other products from China, and the same is becoming true in China with regard to goods from Japan.I am convinced that the two countries will maintain a healthy relationship for the next 40 years and beyond through continued efforts by the people of both countries to know each other better as tourism and other forms of exchanges become more popular.Japan does have major problems, but this also means it has been dealing for some time with issues that China is now beginning to face, including environmental issues, a declining birthrate and aging population, and regional revitalization. As such, Japan's experience and expertise will help China address these issues.The author is chairman of the Nippon Foundation. The foundation has been engaged in human resource development in China in countless ways including in training technicians and future academics.

                KIGALI - The Rwandan government on Sunday morning started commemoration marking the 25th anniversary of the 1994 Rwandan genocide against Tutsi, raising the curtain of a three-month remembrance period.The genocide claimed the lives of over 1 million people, mainly ethnic Tutsis. The annual commemoration is held every year from April 7 to July 4 in line with the period of the genocide.The commemoration, named "Kwibuka," meaning "to remember" in English, started with the laying of wreaths at the Kigali Genocide Memorial, the final resting place for more than 250,000 victims of the genocide, followed by a commemoration ceremony in Kigali Convention Center.President Paul Kagame, first lady Jeannette Kagame, African Union Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat, and President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker jointly lit the flame of remembrance after laying wreaths together with other heads of state and government at the memorial.Former heads of state and government, including former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, former Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, and other visiting guests also laid wreaths at the memorial earlier Sunday morning.Commemoration banners can be seen along streets in Kigali. Rwandan embassies overseas have also started commemoration activities.The United Nations General Assembly in January 2018 adopted a resolution that changes the designation of April 7 to "the International Day of Reflection on the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda" from the name of "the International Day of Reflection on the Genocide in Rwanda" as was used in a December 2003 resolution.

                KIGALI, Rwanda－Rwandans on Sunday started commemorating the 25th anniversary of the 1994 genocide that left more than 1 million people dead, with President Paul Kagame calling for continued efforts to transform the country."Rwanda's young people have everything needed to transform our country," Kagame said. "They have the responsibility to take charge more and more, and participate fully in securing the Rwanda we want and deserve."Three-quarters of Rwandans are under 30, and almost 60 percent of Rwandan people were born after the genocide, Kagame said.Rwandans are the last people in the world who should succumb to complacency, he said, adding that the suffering the Rwandan people have endured should be enough to keep their fighting spirit alive."The fighting spirit is alive in us. What happened here will never happen again," Kagame said.Dignitaries present at the ceremony also recognized Rwanda's recovery after the genocide, whose victims were primarily ethnic Tutsis.Rwanda is an example of how a deeply wounded society can rise again, thanks to the courage of its people, said president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker.The genocide commemoration event is an opportunity to celebrate the remarkable resilience of the people of Rwanda as well as the extraordinary leadership, said Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel.The leadership of the Rwandan government, coupled with the resilience of Rwandans, is what has made Rwanda move forward, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said.Rwanda's commitment to reconciliation is a testament to honoring victims and it's a lesson for the world to have hope in reconciliation, Ahmed said."I applaud the resilience of genocide survivors and all Rwandans. Rwanda has emerged from the darkest period to become one of the fastest growing economies in Africa," said Djiboutian President Ismail Omar Guelleh.New platform plannedMoussa Faki Mahamat, chief of the African Union Commission, told the ceremony that he is planning to set up a platform in charge of fighting against the most abominable genocidal ideologies and ethnic derivatives in Africa.Performances for remembrance were staged during the ceremony.Shortly before the ceremony, Faki, Juncker and other dignitaries laid wreaths at the Kigali Genocide Memorial, the final resting place for more than 250,000 victims of the genocide.Kagame, Rwandan first lady Jeannette Kagame, Faki and Juncker jointly lit the flame of remembrance at the memorial.Other activities on the first day of the commemoration include a Walk to Remember event and a night vigil at the Amahoro National Stadium.Heads of Rwandan national commissions for anti-genocide and reconciliation both spoke highly of Rwanda's reconciliation and unity after the genocide days ahead of the commemoration.Rwandans have reconciled whereby genocide perpetrators and survivors are able work together to develop their respective communities through community work, or Umuganda, and other national development initiatives, said Jean-Damascene Bizimana, executive secretary of the National Commission for the Fight against Genocide.Unity and reconciliation among Rwandans have reached more than 95 percent and the country is continuing to ensure that Rwanda will be a completely unified country in the next few years, according to Fidele Ndayisaba, executive secretary of National Unity and Reconciliation Commission.Xinhua

                CEIBS has another good reason to celebrate its 25th anniversary this year, after winning fifth in the Financial Times' most recent global MBA and EMBA rankings, Lin Shujuan reports in Shanghai.After spending five years as a global marketer in the pharmaceutical industries in Europe and the United States, Yann Biehler decided to do an MBA program in 2017 to further his learning and prepare himself for a possible move to China, a country he has always had a strong interest in since childhood.He applied to three international business schools in Asia including China Europe International Business School. And although he was accepted by all three institutes, enrolling in CEIBS seemed the most obvious choice."All businesses around the world talk about China, but you need to be in China to understand what China is," says the 29-year-old Frenchman, who started his two-year MBA program last August at CEIBS' flagship campus in Shanghai's Pudong New Area."Take something as simple as WeChat (a popular instant-messaging social media platform in China) for example-you cannot understand the importance of this tool without being here because there is no equivalent to WeChat in the world."Biehler is just one of the growing number of international students CEIBS has attracted over the years. Of the 175 students in Biehler's cohort, 64 are from overseas. Among them, 26 are from North America and Europe, up from 18 out of 179 enrolled in 2017."CEIBS' biggest competitive edge is China," says Ding Yuan, vice-president and dean of the institution.

                    Suzhou Industrial Park celebrates 25 years

                SIP poised to lead modern industry into the future under the framework of groundbreaking China-Singapore projectAfter 25 years of development, the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park has become a model of China's economic cooperation with other countries. The park is celebrating its 25th anniversary at a special conference marking its achievements on Friday.The major factors that have contributed to the park's success will be discussed at the conference, accompanied by a series of activities including the signing of key projects, the unveiling of an exhibition of achievements made in the past 25 years and an art performance in the evening."In the past 25 years, the main leaders of the SIP have changed six times, but they all uphold the main guideline of its development. This is another factor that contributes to the SIP's success," said Zhang Zhen, deputy director of Adopting Singapore's Experience Office at the Suzhou Industrial Park Administrative Committee.In February 1994, the SIP project was launched under the collaboration of Chinese and Singaporean governments, pledging to foster local innovation and boost high-tech enterprises. As a result, it has been ranked one of the best among more than 200 industrial parks of its kind in China.Over the past 25 years, the park has contributed about 800 billion yuan ($119.11 billion) in tax revenue, achieved more than $1 trillion in foreign trade volume, completed more than 900 billion yuan in investment in fixed assets and utilized $31.27 billion in foreign capital.The SIP is now home to more than 156 projects initiated by Fortune Global 500 enterprises and about 30 world-class educational and research institutions operated jointly with foreign universities.At its launch in 1994, the park was designated to be located in the Jinji Lake area in east Suzhou. The two parties announced it should be an industrial park led by high-tech industry, with modern industries as the major body and the tertiary sector as its supplementary part.In December of the same year, Samsung Electronics (Suzhou) Semiconductor was launched in the park, becoming the first foreign-funded enterprise in the SIP.Following Samsung, Siemens, Philips and more multinational corporations have set up R&D centers in the park. A group of Singaporean enterprises have also opened offices in Suzhou.The time period between 1994 to 2000 was the first phase of the SIP. The constant arrival of overseas companies laid a promising foundation for industrial development, said Zhang.Development in the park focused on an import-led export model, that is, it attracted foreign-funded companies with low-cost labor. As a result, transnational corporations relocated their manufacturing to the SIP and the products they produced were exported to other countries.From around 2005, the park began to upgrade its local industry and nurture its own enterprises, said Zhang, adding that with the development of local industry, the shortcomings of the park's service industry began to show.Therefore, the park began to cultivate the modern service industry on a large scale. In terms of financial innovation, it studied the successful operations from the Singapore side and introduced research institutions and enterprise incubators.If the task of the first 10 years of the park was to absorb and utilize Singapore's experience, then from 2006, the park entered an exporting stage, Zhang said.Under the greater development plan of Jiangsu province, the Suzhou-Suqian Industrial Park was the first such parks to borrow the SIP's experience.China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park Development Group, or CSSD, jointly developed by the governments of China and Singapore in August 1994, is the company that undertakes the park's planning and management work and has been playing a crucial role in introducing its experience to other industrial parks, said Yin Jian, vice-president of the company.Suzhou-Suqian park and Suzhou-Nantong Science and Technology Industrial Park are mirroring the SIP's experiences."The industrial parks project in Jiangsu is our first step to 'go out'. Leveraging our good understanding of Yangtze River region, we export our experience and help other cities to establish their urbanization projects," Yin said.For its next step, they will export SIP's experience to Northwest China and some foreign countries such as Indonesia under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, Yin added.According to the local administrative committee, by 2025, the SIP will develop a framework to construct a world-class high-tech industrial park; by 2035, it aims to become a world-class high-tech industrial park; and by 2050, it should complete the construction of a world-class high-tech industrial park.liyou@chinadaily.com.cnA bird's-eye view of the Suzhou Industrial Park, a model of China's economic cooperation with Singapore.Photos Provided To China Daily(China Daily 04/12/2019 page12)

                A total of 150 new projects signed up or broke ground on Friday to mark the 25th anniversary of the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park, showing the aim of the governmental cooperation project for a higher level of industrial upgrading and further optimization.Of the newly signed projects, 35 are research and development centers or regional headquarters. The total investment comes to about 50 billion yuan ($7.4 billion), with estimated annual sales exceeding 100 billion yuan once put into operation.Most of the new projects specialize in biochemical, artificial intelligence, nanometer technology and high-end equipment manufacturing. French biopharmaceutical giant Sanofi announced it is setting up its first Asian research institute, while Johnson & Johnson plans to set up an Asia Pacific open innovation center.Started in 1994, SIP in Jiangsu province is the country's largest project jointly developed by China and a foreign country, covering 278 square kilometers. In his visit to Singapore in November 2015, President Xi Jinping stressed that continued efforts should be made to develop the SIP, which is one of the major cooperation projects between the two countries.In his letter celebrating the 25th anniversary of the SIP, Premier Li Keqiang said the park has played a crucial role in mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Singapore, and should strive to become a first-rate high-tech industrial park to facilitate China's high-quality economic development.Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also wrote in a congratulatory letter that "the SIP's success reflects Singapore's close working relationship with China at every level".In 2018, the SIP's economic output of 257 billion yuan represented a 7.1 percent increase year-on-year, which was 227 times the number registered 25 years ago. The cumulative actual utilization of foreign capital totaled $31.3 billion in the park over the past 25 years.The park, once farmland, has attracted over 4,400 overseas projects from more than 70 countries and regions. Fortune 500 companies such as Siemens, Philips, Emerson and Samsung have launched 156 projects in the park. More than 500 companies, including Apple, Microsoft and Roche have set up research and development centers in the SIP.Up to 350 Singapore companies have set up offices and branches there. DBS was the first Singaporean bank to locate in the SIP in 2007. Xu Jiayong, head of the DBS Suzhou branch, said that while foreign-owned enterprises made up the majority of clients in the early days, State-owned enterprises, privately owned domestic enterprises and foreign companies now each account for a third of its clientele."Our long-term goal is to help introduce more overseas technologies into Suzhou and facilitate domestic companies' exploration of overseas markets with our global network," Xu said.The SIP's role as a bridge linking domestic and overseas markets is not only exemplified by foreign companies' footprint, but also the increasing number of domestic companies looking to invest abroad, officials said.With the national level overseas investment demonstration platform started here in 2015, the SIP has helped 309 domestic companies invest in 12 multinational projects worth of $10.4 billion in 53 countries and regions, serving the country's Belt and Road Initiative, they said.

                    Suzhou moving on up as economic powerhouse

                National-level development zones critical to innovation, financial, high-tech success Historic, hugely prosperous Suzhou in East China's Jiangsu province has become an economic powerhouse well known around the world for its financial strength. Located in the center of the Yangtze River Delta and only 25 minutes by high-speed train to neighboring Shanghai, the city's development history dates back to China's Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC). Suzhou's unique geography has helped to bolster its business prowess throughout the years. According to official statistics, the city's GDP hit 1.86 trillion yuan ($270.68 billion) last year, a year-on-year increase of 6.8 percent, ranking first among the cities in Jiangsu province and seventh in China. "Suzhou has become a hub for trade and business. It is also one of the forefronts of opening-up in China," said Li Yaping, mayor of Suzhou. "The city is one of the most popular destinations for global professionals to turn their dream into reality." The city has eight national-level development zones, including the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park, Taicang Port National Economic Development Zone and Kunshan Development Zone, two national high-tech districts and two bonded zones, which all make important contributions to the city's economic development. Among them, the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park, set up in 1994 under the collaboration of Chinese and Singaporean governments, is perhaps the brightest star. The park has attracted more than 4,400 overseas projects from more than 70 countries and regions, including 156 projects initiated by Fortune Global 500 enterprises and about 30 world-class educational and research institutions operated jointly with foreign universities. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the SIP. One of China's State leaders said the park has played a crucial role in promoting mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Singapore, and should strive to become a first-rate high-tech industrial park to facilitate China's high-quality economic development. According to official statistics, SIP's economic output reached 257 billion yuan last year, an increase of 7.1 percent year-on-year. The park's cumulative actual utilization of foreign capital has totaled $31.3 billion during the past 25 years. The park plays a prominent role in the biochemical, artificial intelligence and high-end equipment manufacturing sectors. Zhou Qinwei, chief operating officer of Innovent, a high-quality innovative medicine developer in the industrial park, said that though China reported strong results in biological development, many enterprises still struggle with small manufacturing capacity and high production costs, which makes it hard for them to meet global industrial standards. "Considering the geographic advantages and local government's support, Innovent chose to launch operation in the SIP in 2011 with the aim of becoming one of the largest biopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in China that complies with international standards," Zhou added. The company has set up strategic partnerships with several companies in the United States to develop, manufacture and sell biopharmaceuticals. Innovent launched its initial public offering in Hong Kong last year. Apart from the SIP, the Suzhou New District, or SND, is another powerful economic engine in the city. The district was approved by the State Council as a national high-tech industrial development zone in 1992 and officially named SND in 2002. In 2017, the district's GDP reached 116 billion yuan and its industrial output value totaled 310.9 billion yuan. The output values of emerging industries and high-tech industries accounted for 57.1 percent and 78.5 percent of the gross industrial output value, respectively. Alibaba Innovation Center Suzhou New District Base, launched in 2016, provides startups with one-stop services, including cloud resource support, technical guidance, entrepreneurship guidance, training and venture capital activities. By now, more than 60 startups, covering big data, new media and the internet of things, have gained support from the center and two of them have created output value of more than 10 million in two years. According to Xue Feng, manager of the center, in addition to providing services, they will also select some promising startups in which to invest. Suzhou' excellent economic outcomes have attracted global attention and many people are eager to learn more about the city's development and explore stories behind its charm. A total of 12 overseas journalists from seven countries, including the US, Germany and Singapore, visited Suzhou from April 26 to 28, and were impressed by the city's rapid economic development, as well as its beauty. During the three-day tour, they visited locations including the SIP, the SND and Zhenze ancient town in Wujiang district of Suzhou. A Singaporean journalist said that the trip provided a rare opportunity to gain an in-depth understanding of how this ancient city manages to become an impressive economic powerhouse.  East China's Suzhou, with development that dates back to the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC), has a perfect blend of modernity and tradition.Provided To China Daily(China Daily 05/20/2019 page7)

                    My life journey with Suzhou Industrial Park: Dramatic and inspiring
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                This year marks the 25th anniversary of Suzhou Industrial Park, a remarkable collaboration between China and Singapore since 1994. Now living in this wonderland, I look back at my past decades of life entwined with these two countries, and finally, here, at Suzhou Industrial Park. I feel all those ups and downs are dramatic while inspiring -- thanks to a series of reform and opening-up policies all along, we, as individuals, have been growing with our country and we all have benefited tremendously from those policies.In 1994 when I was in kindergarten, a girl still living in Yangzhou, East China’s Jiangsu province, the only impression I perceived of Suzhou was from a black and white photo, in which my mum, in her 20s, traveled in Suzhou and visited the famous Lion Grove Garden. That time, I learned from my mum’s bedtime story that Suzhou was a small, scenic city with profound Chinese traditional culture. While a little girl in the early 90s from an ordinary family, how could I know that in fact China and Singapore had kicked off a joint development project at Suzhou Industrial Park in the same year!In the following 10-plus years till 2005, I grew up a typical high school student. Though under pressure from schoolwork, I had a huge interest in the English language and read a number of English classics by referring to a dictionary as thick as a brick. Even now I am grateful for that period when I accumulated adequate knowledge and language skills, which further led to overseas study and job positions at foreign companies. On the other side, Suzhou Industrial Park had undergone rapid and significant economic development. With Singaporean expertise, Chinese governmental sectors initialized landscape and infrastructure constructions on the basis of sustainability. Gradually, those main functional districts we see now in Suzhou Industrial Park had all been set up by 2005, including the Jin Ji Lake Scenic Area, High Educational District, Science Park, Logistics Park and Export Processing Zones. A row of big names in fields of top-notched manufacturing, semi-conductors, and pharmaceutical companies were attracted to set roots in Suzhou Industrial Park, such as Bosch, Samsung and Lilly pharmaceutical. An open, friendly environment enabled many foreign companies to become the key economic drivers there. These 10 years have seen a foundation-laying course for both Suzhou Industrial Park and me.In December 2006, when I was just 17 years old, I left my parents for university life in Singapore. After a five-hour plane journey, the moment I stepped out of the cabin door, I felt stifled by the hot, moist air, which was very contrary to the cold, dry winter season in China that time. Known for its clean streets, green plants and high GDP per capita, Singapore was totally new to me in all aspects. Cars ran swiftly on spacious highways. Massive skyscrapers in the CBD housed numerous financial institutions and trading companies. People made apologies by saying “excuse me” to those around when they were just about to get off the subway train into crowds. It took me a long time before adapting to “Singlish” and other accents due to the multi-cultural society.Vegetables and fruits were well packed in fixed quantity or weight. Everything was so in order, reliable and dependable that you did not even have to give a second thought. While I was diligent to pursue my degree, I was unsure of something, something I was longing for. When I came to the Suzhou Industrial Park during winter break in 2010, I was struck by the beautiful night scenery of Jin Ji Lake with clusters of modern buildings around it. Local governments called for independent innovation, high-tech R&D and support from financial institutions. Incentive schemes had been deployed to attract high-level talents, and various cultural and community activities enriched people’s spiritual lives. Then I realized, yes, it was passion that I was longing for and I felt it when I stood at the lakeside.In 2015, with two years or so overseas working experience, I came back to China and started my working life in a foreign bank in the Suzhou Industrial Park. The bank itself, as one of the foreign corporations, has benefited from the opening-up policies and market liberalization promoted by the Chinese government. We have been gradually granted licenses to provide more types of credit and derivative product service to customers. We are proud that we have been serving many “big names” that in turn contributed their great performance to the local economy. This year as of June, seven well-known giants, including Huawei, Microsoft, Tencent and Siemens, set up AI innovation centers here. Jonson & Jonson, Emerson and Philips expanded their core businesses, such as new production lines and solution centers in the park. Not only did they bring 130 more investments sponsored by foreign capital, but also 363 new technological projects. With these boosters, the park has achieved gross regional product of 131.7 billion yuan ($19.1 billion) with year-on-year growth of 6.6 percent, according to comnews.cn. Throughout these years, government has put more focus on spurring industrial upgrading, technology innovation and AI application. Our bank also carried out rounds of self-review and processed re-engineering to better facilitate enterprises’ needs in credit, payment and wealth management. Being a bank employee, I understand we are the ground implementer of macroeconomic policies. We are committed to provide financial support to domestic manufacturers adopting advanced technology, assisting them in taking up a strong market position. We aim to render convenient and rapid service to private enterprises, helping them realize their dreams and thus create more job positions to the workforce. Our tailor-made product solutions motivate high-tech start-ups and new energy firms to further produce and inject valuable intangible assets, such as patents, into commercial applications. Therefore, we have witnessed growing numbers of companies in various scales booming and expanding, in harmony with the local ecosystem and environment.Now, as a “New Suzhounese”, in my leisure time, I enjoy strolling along Dushu Lake with my little baby. I love the peaceful time reading books in the cozy library. These life moments become most precious as I get older and more sensible. One day during my lunch break, I came across a flash mob event celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Suzhou Industrial Park. There, people sang songs expressing their gratitude and respect to this amazing industrial park, to this dynamic city and to our grand China. That was a touching moment and I couldn’t help bursting into tears. I’m looking forward to growing with my country with even more achievements and happiness!Tang Huan is a native Chinese living in Suzhou city. She spent more than eight years in Singapore. Now she is working for a foreign bank in the China Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park. The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.
