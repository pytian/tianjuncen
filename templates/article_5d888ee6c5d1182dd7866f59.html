                EU should work harder to foil US disruptive policies
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                After learning that my new assignment is to cover the European Union, an economist friend, who holds Dutch and US dual citizenship, told me that the EU, with all its current problems and uncertainties, remains one of the more hopeful and positive political forces in today's broken world.That was my hope, too, when I landed in Brussels on Wednesday. The border control and customs officers at the airport were very friendly and efficient, disproving frequent complaints about EU inefficiency.The local weather, which I had also heard a lot about before coming to Brussels, changed from beautiful fall sunshine in the morning to strong winds and rain in the afternoon－synonymous with the world we are living in. I was thinking about heading to Paris this weekend to cover a possible meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who will be among many world leaders attending an event in Paris to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.I am no longer sure about the trip, though, after Trump said on Wednesday that he would not meet Putin this weekend, contradicting the message from Moscow.The Trump-Putin summit in Helsinki in July was a positive step toward improving relations between the world's two largest nuclear powers. But the new US sanctions against Russia that followed are a great leap backward in US-Russia ties－as is Trump's threat to pull the US out of 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, if it were to become reality.The EU, which is at the heart of the treaty, is opposed to Trump's move, and has urged the US and Russia to remain engaged in constructive dialogue to preserve the treaty. And it warned that a new arms race would benefit no one; on the contrary, it would cause even more instability.The EU has also lashed out at the US for re-imposing full sanctions on Iran, effective on Nov 4, following Trump's decision to withdraw Washington from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.In stark contrast to the US move, French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire reiterated the plan for a special financial channel, known as Special Purpose Vehicle, to continue EU-Iran trade and maintain the EU's economic sovereignty.Also, he emphasized that "Europe refuses to allow the US to be the trade policeman of the world." And German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Wednesday that Europe must respond to Trump's "America first" agenda of trade protectionism and unilateral diplomacy with "Europe United".Advocating an EU payment system independent of the US, in order to save the Iran nuclear deal, Maas said Europe should form a "counterweight" to the US whenever Washington "crosses red lines". Writing in the German newspaper Handelsblatt, Maas said: "Single-handedly, we will fail in this task. The main goal of our foreign policy is therefore to build a sovereign, strong Europe."Back in July, the EU and Japan inked their free trade agreement sending a clear message about their trade intentions to Trump at a time when he imposed high tariffs on imports from the US' major trade partners. Although the EU faces many tough challenges of its own, such as migration, Brexit and growing populism in some member states, it has proved to be a rational and important force on global issues in contrast to the US. Thanks to Trump's "America first" policy, the US has been quitting international treaties, neglecting its obligations, abusing its superpower status and acting unilaterally and disruptively.So Brussels has to work even harder to prove it no longer dances to Washington's tune.The author is the chief of China Daily EU Bureau based in Brussels. chenweihua@chinadaily.com.cn

                    Last-gasp goal sends Belgium to last eight
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                ROSTOV-ON-DON -- Belgium staged a comeback at the Rostov Arena on Monday evening when two goals trailed behind Japan, sealing the victory with a last-gasp goal which sent them to the last eight.Japan, who led for more than 20 minutes, was persistent and went very close to making history by winning their first ever World Cup knockout game.This is the first time a team who had been trailing 2-0 won the last 16 clash since 1970, with two substitutes saved the most prolific team in group stage.The goal was crisp and the process fluent. The goalkeeper of Belgium Thibaut Courtois threw the ball to Kevin De Bruyne, who dribbled all the way to the Japanese half before passing to Thomas Meunier on the right. The defender from Paris Saint-Germain sent a low cross. Romelu Lukaku dummied while Nacer Chadli prodded the ball in.The goal drew deafening cheers from more than 41,400 spectators, and then the finishing whistle signaled an end of the intensive match.Chadli was summoned from the bench after the stroke of an hour along with Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini.The Japanese took the lead quickly after the beginning of the second half as a result of counterattack.Tottenham Hotspur defender Jan Vertonghen failed to block a pass from the distance to Genki Haraguchi, who drove the ball into the bottom corner.The only remaining Asian team soon doubled the advantage four minutes later, Shinji Kagawa, midfielder in Borussia Dortmund, delivered the ball to Takashi Inui, with the latter lashing it into the far corner from about 20 meters away.They nearly had a third goal before substitutions from Belgium, which was cleared by Courtois from close range.The Red Devils looked shambolic for a moment, but the redeeming Vertonghen once more rekindle hope in the 69th minute. From the left of the box he nodded at the ball, seeing it fly past goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima into the far top corner.The thrilled Belgians mustered up their efforts. Four minutes later, they had a shot over the bar.When people felt a pity for the miss, the real leveler came. Captain Eden Hazard who has scored two goals in previous games clipped the ball to Fellaini, who comfortably drove in the header.As time passing by, they grew into the game.Chadli, receiving from Meunier, attempted another header, while Lukaku followed, forcing Kawashima into a double-save.The Japanese missed a potential finisher in stoppage time, a dropping free-kick by Keisuke Honda from more than 36 meters away. Courtois made a brave save.A few minutes later, however, Belgium proved that they were still unbeaten in all their games, along with Croatia and Uruguay.Nobody was able to break the deadlock in the first half, although both had some very good chances.The Japanese had their first shot immediately after the opening whistle from Kagawa.Then the Belgians took a temporary control of the tempo. Following Axel Witsel's a deflected shot in the 16th minute came a corner. Hazard drove it to the middle but strong defense of the Japanese forced him to give up.A great chance came before the half-hour mark, when Lukaku, who has scored 17 in his last 11 games, received a cross from Dries Mertens on the right. But he fell off. The net, for a few seconds, were unguarded, but nobody managed to send the ball in.Although Belgium blew away a couple of chances, they reached the quarter-final for the third time, and will face Brazil who just beat Mexico."If you look at the stats there are not many games where you can come back from 2-0 down at a World Cup," said Belgium's coach Roberto Martinez. In fact, it happened only six times in history. The last time was in 1970 when the Federal Republic of Germany won over England 3-2."The reality is we went 2-0 down and you have to find solutions, you have to find a reaction, but what you need more than anything is the desire and togetherness of a group of players who are desperate to perform," Martinez said. "I think this is down to the personality, to the focus, to the desire, to the never-give-up attitude of the players and almost the belief of the players when the came on. Doing it within the 90 minutes was an incredible achievement."Hazard was later named as Man of the Match. "We were thinking it was going to be like two years ago against Wales [at UEFA EURO 2016], but we were also thinking if we can score goals the game is on," he said. "We have players that can change a game, we brought players from the bench who made the difference, so today we are just happy to have won and have gone through to the quarterfinals."When it comes to the match on Friday, it is going to be magnificent because playing against Brazil is always amazing as a football player. We are going to rest really well and going to really try to win that match," he said."Four years ago, in Brazil we did not make it to the round of 16 and the whole of Japanese football remembered how we lost against Colombia in the third match," said the crestfallen Japanese coach Akira Nishino. "For the last four years we have been training hard and of course we faced Colombia in the first match. We were all determined to take revenge.""And about eight years ago, in the round of 16, we went to extra-time and penalties, where we lost, therefore we were determined to go through to the next stage," he said.Japan, as the first team to reach the last 16 by having a better disciplinary record, had been criticized for having played in a farcical way in their third-round group match against Poland. The coach vowed to play a brilliant game against Belgium and so the team did."I wanted our team to have a different mentality to the ones we have had in the past and I think we succeeded in that. But maybe there was still something missing, so four years from now we would like to come back," Nishino said.

                    Resistance to Trump has spread across the world, even in US administration
                </p>

                US President Donald Trump was furious to learn, courtesy the Sept 5 op-ed in The New York Times, that a force of resistance exists within his administration where some officials have vowed to thwart part of his agenda and his worst inclinations.In the days that followed, Trump has lashed out at the anonymous author, labeling his or her act as “treason”, and tried to dig him/her out of his administration, including pressuring the Times to reveal the author’s identity. Senior White House officials have rushed to deny they penned the article.While it’s unclear whether Trump will be able to identify the author, he should not be surprised that there are people within his administration who are opposed to his policies.Just take a look at what’s happening in the United States and the world beyond.At the ongoing Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco, California Governor Jerry Brown is leading both domestic and global resistance against Trump’s climate policies. The Sept 12-14 summit has brought together local government officials, business leaders and NGO chiefs who are against Trump’s environmental policies. These people continue to push for a low-carbon economy even after Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord on June 1, 2017, and later scrapped Barack Obama-era coal emission standards.Brown has pushed for an aggressive environmental policy in his state, including signing a bill that calls for generating 100 percent of the state’s electricity from carbon-free sources by 2045 and issuing an executive order requiring California to completely eliminate net emissions across the state’s economy by the same year.Brown is among a group of US governors and mayors who have pledged to stick to the 2015 Paris Agreement. Under Brown, California became the first US state to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Chinese government in 2015 on regulating carbon emission.China and many other countries, too, are opposed to Trump’s climate policies. China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment is co-hosting the China pavilion at the San Francisco summit to highlight the country’s relentless efforts to combat climate change.China has been steadily transitioning toward a low-carbon economy by moving away from coal and investing heavily in renewable energy. China launched the world’s largest national carbon trading market last year, and has planted more trees and commissioned more electric buses to serve commuters.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has also been resisting Trump’s climate policies with many tweets on the importance and urgency of fighting climate change. He issued a statement on Monday saying he will convene a major climate summit in 2019 to bring climate action to the top of the international agenda.Apart from the climate front, governments across the world have also been criticizing the Trump administration for withdrawing the US from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and for threatening to punish foreign governments that don’t cut imports of Iranian oil to “zero” by Nov 4.The US’ major trade partners, such as China, the European Union, Japan and Canada, have been resisting Trump’s tariff wars that are threatening the global trading system and global economic growth.The list goes on.When Trump presides over the UN Security Council in New York this month as chair of the council, he would see many faces of resistance against his unilateral and protectionist policies, including from close US allies in Europe.He would see many more such faces if he chooses to speak at the 73th session of the UN General Assembly that opens on Sept 18 and would be attended by 193 member states.The author is a columnist with China Daily. chenweihua@chinadaily.com.cn

                    The facts and China's position on China-US trade friction
                </p>

                Information Office of the State Council, the People's Republic of China, September 2018CONTENTForewordI. Mutually-beneficial and win-win cooperation between China and the US in trade and economyII. Clarifications of the facts about China-US trade and economic cooperationIII. The trade protectionist practices of the US administrationIV. The trade bullyism practices of the US administrationV. Damage of the improper practices of the US administration to global economyVI. China's positionForewordChina is the world's biggest developing country and the United States is the biggest developed country. Trade and economic relations between China and the US are of great significance for the two countries as well as for the stability and development of the world economy.Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, bilateral trade and economic ties between China and the US have developed steadily. A close partnership has been forged under which interests of the two countries have become closer and wider. Both countries have benefited from this partnership, as has the rest of the world. Since the beginning of the new century in particular, alongside rapid progress in economic globalization, China and the US have observed bilateral treaties and multilateral rules such as the WTO rules, and economic and trade relations have grown deeper and wider. Based on their comparative strengths and the choices of the market, the two countries have built up a mutually beneficial relationship featuring structural synergy and convergence of interests. Close cooperation and economic complementarity between China and the US have boosted economic growth, industrial upgrading and structural optimization in both countries, and at the same time enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of global value chains, reduced production costs, offered greater product variety, and generated enormous benefit for businesses and consumers in both countries.China and the US are at different stages of development. They have different economic systems. Therefore some level of trade friction is only natural. The key however lies in how to enhance mutual trust, promote cooperation, and manage differences. In the spirit of equality, rationality, and moving to meet each other halfway, the two countries have set up a number of communication and coordination mechanisms such as the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, and the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue. Each has made tremendous efforts to overcome all kinds of obstacles and move economic and trade relations forward, which has served as the ballast and propeller of the overall bilateral relationship.Since taking office in 2017, the new administration of the US government has trumpeted "America First". It has abandoned the fundamental norms of mutual respect and equal consultation that guide international relations. Rather, it has brazenly preached unilateralism, protectionism and economic hegemony, making false accusations against many countries and regions-particularly China－intimidating other countries through economic measures such as imposing tariffs, and attempting to impose its own interests on China through extreme pressure.China has responded from the perspective of the common interests of both parties as well as the world trade order. It is observing the principle of resolving disputes through dialogue and consultation, and answering the US concerns with the greatest level of patience and good faith. The Chinese side has been dealing with these differences with an attitude of seeking common ground while shelving divergence. It has overcome many difficulties and made enormous efforts to stabilize China-US economic and trade relations by holding rounds of discussions with the US side and proposing practical solutions. However the US side has been contradicting itself and constantly challenging China. As a result, trade and economic friction between the two sides has escalated quickly over a short period of time, causing serious damage to the economic and trade relations which have developed over the years through the collective work of the two governments and the two peoples, and posing a grave threat to the multilateral trading system and the principle of free trade.In order to clarify the facts about China-US economic and trade relations, clarify China's stance on trade friction with the US, and pursue reasonable solutions, the government of China is publishing this White Paper.

                Victories rarely come easy on this season's PGA Tour Series-China－three playoff showdowns in the six tournaments played so far are proof of that.In the latest shootout, Kevin Techakanokboon was the last man standing as the rain lashed down in Nantong, Jiangsu province, on Sunday.The American made an eight-foot birdie putt on the second extra hole to defeat England's Stephen Lewton and win the Nantong Championship."I thought I was OK going to the last hole (of regulation), but that's not an easy finishing hole," said Techakanokboon. "Stephen made a great birdie, and I knew I at least needed par to win it."The other playoff winners this year were Taihei Sato from Japan in Chongqing and American David Kocher at the Haikou Championship.Techakanokboon began the day a stroke behind overnight leader Max McGreevy and turned in a stellar final day, shooting a 67 at Nantong Yangtze River Golf Club. However, a bogey on his last hole of regulation made Techakanokboon work a little harder for his second tour title, that goes with his 2018 Zhuhai Championship triumph.McGreevy carded a 69 to finish with a 16-under total, a stroke behind the playoff contenders.Techakanokboon and Lewton parred the first extra hole, with Techakanokboon prevailing on their third playing of the 18th when Lewton couldn't make a 30-foot birdie."I'm pretty pleased. You can't be too mad about it," Techakanokboon said. "I just wanted to come out and play well. I didn't have expectations or anything. There are a lot of positives to this one."Techakanokboon improved to third on the order of merit, positioning himself nicely for the second half of the season. The California native, who splits his time between the Golden State and his parents' birthplace of Thailand, has also enjoyed a steady climb in the world rankings.He fell as low as No 2,056 in the world before winning in Zhuhai seven months ago, a victory that improved his standing to 895. He entered last week's tournament at a career-high 761.As something of a consolation for McGreevy, the 54-hole leader took over top spot on the money list with his third-place finish, knocking Kocher to second in the process.Clubhouse notes:* Chinese mainland's Wang Yanzhang finished as the best amateur in Nantong, on a 2-under total, tied for 24th.* Xu Guozhen was the best-placed finisher from Chinese mainland, shooting a 74 on Sunday to end the week at 6-under, in 17th place.* Amateur Liang Enqi endured a difficult day, shooting a final-round 85 after firing a 69 the previous day. Liang had four holes of double bogey or worse. He tied for 62nd.* In only his third career start, American Andrew Hudson tied for sixth, at 9-under. The University of North Texas graduate opened and closed with rounds of 69.* Brad Gehl turned his opening-round 63 into his second top-10 finish since joining the tour earlier this year. He tied for fourth with Michael Perras.* The PGA Tour Series-China resumes with the Suzhou Open (June 10-16) before heading to Anhui province for the Huangshan Championship (June 17-23).

                    US pundits call for resolution of trade dispute
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                US opinion writers are urging leaders of the US and China to resolve the trade dispute quickly, warning of major damage to both nations if tariffs remain in place.Many editorials note American farmers have lost Chinese markets and argue that Donald Trump needs the votes of farmers to win reelection in 2020.The US Chamber of Commerce estimates that 455,000 American jobs are put at risk by tariffs, and consumer prices are expected to rise in the US as a result of the tariffs on Chinese imports."China is not the enemy," Jeffrey Sachs, a professor at Columbia University, wrote in an opinion column published by CNN. "It is a nation trying to raise its living standards through education, international trade, infrastructure investment and improved technologies."In short, it is doing what any country should do. Yet the Trump administration is now aiming to stop China's development, which could prove to be disastrous for both the United States and the entire world," he wrote.Sachs continued, "Trump is lashing out against China. (He) is willfully trying to crush successful companies like Huawei by changing the rules of international trade abruptly and unilaterally. China has been playing by Western rules for the past 40 years. Now, the United States is trying to pull the rug out from under China by launching a new Cold War."The Wall Street Journal warned, "Prepare for some collateral economic damage as the two sides ratchet up their dueling tariffs" and noted, "This is a political trade risk the economy hasn't faced since the 1930s, and no one knows where it might end."The Journal's editorial writers argued that reaching an agreement would benefit both nations and shouldn't be hard to hammer out:"The outlines of a good deal seem clear enough. China makes specific commitments to reform its policies and markets to let foreign companies compete fairly without regulatory predation or theft. In return, Mr. Trump ought to agree to lift the tariffs he's imposed. This would give Mr. Xi a victory he can point to as he tries to sell China's trade concessions (at home). Mr. Trump can say the tariffs served their purpose, and he's achieved something with China no other president has."The Washington Post criticized Trump for imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico as part of trade negotiations and said: "This unforced error is doubly regrettable because Mr. Trump arguably had the upper hand going into his trade talks with China. The Chinese economy is more dependent on exports to the United States than vice-versa, and China's growth rate has been slowing while the US economy is creating jobs at a brisk pace."In a world where Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular his complaints — shared by previous US presidents—against China represented a rare case in which other nations conceded him the moral high ground. A savvier president would take advantage of that."Earlier this month, the US repealed tariffs on steel and aluminum after reaching a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico.Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University's Jackson Institute of Global Affairs and former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, wrote in Project Syndicate that the current trade dispute with China is similar to the 1980s trade dispute with Japan:"'When governments permit counterfeiting or copying of American products, it is stealing our future, and it is no longer free trade.' So said US President Ronald Reagan, commenting on Japan in September 1985. Today resembles, in many respects, a remake of this 1980s movie, but with a reality-television star replacing a Hollywood film star in the presidential leading role — and with a new villain in place of Japan."The New York Federal Reserve Bank estimated that US tariffs on China will cost American households about $831 a year.At the Nomura Investment Forum Asia held recently in Singapore, Chief US Economist Lewis Alexander said the net effect of tariffs is likely to be negative for America, boosting inflation 0.5 percent in the next 12 months and slowing the economy.There has been some speculation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to stimulate the economy. But Alexander told CNBC such a move while inflation is ticking up could overheat the economy and lead to a painful downturn.In Forbes magazine, columnist Jack Nasher argued: "Trump will be in serious trouble if tariffs on US products continue. The effect of the higher tariffs Trump announced would hit US economic growth by half a percentage point in 2020 and cost around 300,000 jobs. This could jeopardize Trump's 2020 reelection. Hence, tariffs are not a permanent option, but only a bargaining chip. (Investor) Warren Buffett is right when he says that a trade war would be bad, but 'There are times in negotiations when you talk tough. With some people in negotiations, the best technique is to act half crazy.'"

                    Esper in first visit to Asia as Pentagon chief
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Intermediate-range missile deployment, Indo-Pacific Strategy are his key agendaAlthough the Pentagon has highlighted intermediate-range missile deployment in Asia and the United States-led Indo-Pacific Strategy as key agenda items of its new chief's first Asia trip, media reports show that some die-hard military allies of the US responded to the proposals with a cold shoulder.Analysts said Washington is unlikely to score a major victory during the tour when shifting blame to China, as its Asia-Pacific allies and partners are showing prudence and avoiding taking sides between the two top economies in the world.US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper arrived in South Korea on Thursday as the last leg of his five-stop trip, according to Seoul-based Yonhap news agency.He has finished visiting Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Mongolia.Speaking to reporters in Sydney on Saturday, Esper said he "would prefer months" for placing ground-launched, intermediate-range missiles in Asia, one day after the US withdrew from the landmark Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, Reuters reported.He also lashed out on China's role in the Indo-Pacific region on Sunday, saying the US "also stands firmly against a disturbing pattern of aggressive behavior, destabilizing behavior from China".However, South Korean Defense Ministry spokeswoman Choi Hyunsoo said in a news conference on Monday in Seoul that the US and South Korea have never officially discussed on deploying such missiles in Asia, and South Korean military has neither considered this regard, Yonhap news agency reported.Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya said that Esper told him that the US has yet to enter the stage of discussing where to deploy the missiles, Japan's Kyodo News Agency reported.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday that Washington "has tried to drive a wedge" among Asia-Pacific countries by promoting the Indo-Pacific Strategy.The US has been using China as an excuse on the INF Treaty and other issues, and it is "hastily seeking to deploy intermediate-range missiles in Asia" after its withdrawal from the INF Treaty, Hua said.Fan Jishe, director for Strategic Studies of the Institute of American Studies of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said it is unlikely to see Esper help US make major difference in the region through this trip, and Esper is more expert in fulfilling President Donald Trump's ideas in boosting competition among major countries.It is unlikely to see US allies in this region - including Australia - to accept US plans for ground-launched missile in the near future, which China firmly opposes. The situation in the region is tense enough for such deployment, Fan said.Liang Fang, a professor of naval studies at the PLA National Defense University, warns that the majority of potential sites for US missile deployment may fall in China's neighborhood, and China will be a major victim of US withdrawal from the treaty.The US is sabotaging strategic stability in Asia and in the greater world, Liang said.
