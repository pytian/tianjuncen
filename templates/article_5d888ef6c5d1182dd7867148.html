            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                It is often said that art imitates life. Films, many of which are inspired by real events, are no exception. The firefighting movie The Bravest released last week is one of them. It was adapted from the Mongolian writer Bao'erji's book, featuring an anthology of interviews of firefighters who joined the battle to put out the fire caused by a pipeline explosion in Dalian, Northeast China's Liaoning province, in July 2010. The movie, released for eight days, has already raked in 890.55 million yuan ($126.42 million), second only to Ne Zha, the current domestic box-office champ.In addition to The Bravest, many films based on real events have achieved very good box-office results, such as Dying to Survive and Operation Red Sea. The reason why those films succeed is because their stories have strong resonance among viewers, who are moved by the details. Here are some Chinese films based on real events, which have earned great results at the box office and high points on Douban, China's most popular film review site. Let's take a look.

            <p class="style-content">
                NAIROBI - China is devoted to modernizing its defense forces to enhance its capacity to handle new security threats, said Wang Yang, military attache at the Chinese Embassy in Kenya late on Tuesday.He made the remarks at an event celebrating the 92nd anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China, which was also attended by some Kenyan officials and foreign diplomats."The PLA has been making great and historical contributions to the Chinese people's liberation, socialist construction and reform," said Wang."In the new era, we are currently committed to building a fortified national defence system and a strong military that are commensurate with the country's international standing and its security and development interests," he said.Wang stressed that Beijing has no intention to pursue hegemony, but will rather promote peaceful development and win-win partnerships."We advocate a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept. We also advocate a road of common construction, sharing and win-win security, and actively participate in international security dialogues and exchanges," he said.China is now a major contributor to the UN peacekeeping operations in global hotspots, said Wang, adding that China had by 2018 participated in 24 UN peacekeeping missions and contributed more than 40,000 peacekeepers.Beijing has been on the frontline of humanitarian assistance in global hotspots and has also dispatched troops to protect critical shipping routes like the Gulf of Aden and Somalia's coastline, he said."In the past decade, over 100 vessels and 26,000 officers and sailors have been regularly deployed in 31 escort task groups. They escorted more than 6,600 ships, and rescued, protected or assisted over 70 ships in distress," he added.The offical also said he was optimistic that China-Kenya defense cooperation will be strengthened.

                    Houthi missile attack, suicide bombs kill 51 in Aden
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                ADEN, Yemen -- A rebel missile struck a military parade in Yemen's southern port city of Aden as coordinated suicide bombings targeted a police station in another neighborhood of the city on Thursday, killing at least 51 people and wounding dozens, a security official and witnesses said.The missile hit the neighborhood of Breiqa where a military parade was underway by the newly-recruited Yemeni army forces backed by the United Arab Emirates, a member of the Saudi-led coalition that has been fighting the Houthi rebels since 2015.The Western-backed Sunni Muslim coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government ousted from power in the capital Sanaa by the Houthis in late 2014.The Yemeni government of Abdu-Rabbu Mansour Hadi controls the southern port city of Aden. The Houthi movement, which says its revolution is against corruption, holds Sanaa and most of the biggest urban centers of the nation in the Arabian Peninsula.Since the rebels seized the country's capital, Sanaa, in 2014, the southern port city of Aden has served as the temporary seat of the government.The parade was taking place in the pro-coalition al-Galaa camp, said the Yemeni official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. The official didn't give a breakdown for the casualties at the parade.The website of the Houthi rebels, Al-Masirah, quoted spokesman Brigadier General Yehia Sarea as saying that the rebels fired a medium-range ballistic missile at the parade, leaving scores of casualties, including military commanders.A short while earlier, a car, a bus and three motorcycles laden with explosives targeted a police station during a morning lineup, said Abdel Dayem Ahmed, a senior police official. He said four suicide bombers were involved in the attack. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the bombings.Ahmed told The Associated Press that 11 were killed in the attack at the police station and that at least 29 were wounded.A Yemeni health official said that along with the 51 killed, at least 56 people were wounded in Thursday's attacks. Both the security and health official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters.Thursday's attacks were the deadliest in Aden since November 2017, when a local affiliate of the Islamic State group targeted the city's security headquarters, leaving 15 dead, mostly policemen.The conflict in Yemen began with the 2014 takeover of Sanaa by the Houthis, who drove out the internationally recognized government. Months later, in March 2015, a Saudi-led coalition launched its air campaign to prevent the rebels from overrunning the country's south.In the relentless campaign, Saudiled airstrikes have hit schools, hospitals and wedding parties and killed thousands of Yemeni civilians. The Houthis have used drones and missiles to attack Saudi Arabia and have targeted vessels in the Red Sea.Agencies - Xinhua

                SANAA -- At least nine people of two internally displaced families were killed when a Saudi-led coalition airstrike struck a house in Yemen's northwestern province of Hajjah on Sunday, medics and local residents said.The airstrike hit the house in Mustaba district, killing the nine people, including five children, two women and two men, they said.Local resident Abdullah Shuaib told Xinhua by phone that other 18 neighbors, including four children, were wounded in the airstrike.There was no comment from the coalition on the airstrike.Saudi Arabia has been leading an Arab military coalition against Iran-allied Houthis in Yemen for more than four years in support of the exiled internationally-recognized government of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.

                    Chinese envoy urges reason, restraint amid Yemen's Aden clashes
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                UNITED NATIONS - A Chinese UN envoy on Tuesday called for reason and restraint amid infighting around the Yemeni port city of Aden.A series of clashes have occurred in the city in August between formerly-allied separatists and pro-government forces, which have led to dozens of civilian deaths and injuries to hundreds of others."We hope all parties concerned will act in the best interest of Yemen and his people, maintain reason and restraint, resolve their differences through dialogue and negotiation, and restore stability and normal life in Yemen as soon as possible," said Wu Haitao, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations.He stressed a political solution is the only way out for Yemen, adding all parties in the country should resolve the issue through political means.Also, he said that as regional countries play an important role in the Yemeni issue, they should strengthen dialogue and cooperation with the United Nations to create favorable conditions for parties in Yemen to ease tension, enhance mutual trust and dialogue, and promote the political process.Wu noted the Security Council should continue to remain united and lend support to Yemen political process.He said China supports maintaining Yemeni sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity, as well as the United Nations' role as the main channel of mediation.Meanwhile, Wu urged the international community to step up its humanitarian assistance for Yemen, expressing the hope that the donor countries will strengthen coordination with the United Nations to make good on their pledges.At a UN conference in February, donors pledged $2.6 billion for Yemen humanitarian aid, marking a 30-percent increase from that in 2018. However, many aid programs are closing down due to the slow fulfillment of the pledges.As for humanitarian access, Wu called for parties concerned to make sure that humanitarian supplies can reach all people and areas in need of such assistance.China has provided Yemen with multiple shipments of humanitarian aid, including food and medicine through bilateral and multilateral channels, he said, adding China is willing to continue to do so to the best of its ability.The Yemeni separatists, known as the Southern Transitional Council forces, completely seized the strategic southern port city of Aden earlier this month, following days of intense street fighting with government forces.Considered as Yemen's temporary capital, Aden is where the Saudi-backed Yemeni government has based itself since 2015.The impoverished Arab country has been locked in a civil war since late 2014, when the Houthis overran much of the country and seized all northern provinces including the capital Sanaa.

                    China sends new naval fleet for escort mission

                QINGDAO -- The 33rd fleet from the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy on Thursday left the port city of Qingdao in East China's Shandong province for the Gulf of Aden to escort civilian ships.The fleet is mainly composed of naval forces from the the Northern Theater Command of the Chinese navy, including a destroyer, a frigate and a supply ship.It has more than 600 officers and soldiers, dozens of special operation soldiers and two helicopters onboard.The PLA Navy began to carry out escort missions in the Gulf of Aden and the waters off Somalia in December 2008.Over the past decade, the Chinese navy has dispatched 106 vessels and over 28,000 officers and soldiers to escort more than 6,700 Chinese and foreign ships.

                    Navy sends its most capable combat ship on escort mission

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                One of the most moving episodes in the Chinese blockbuster Wolf Warrior 2 is the one in which the captain of a Type 052D guided-missile destroyer shouts "Fire!" to order the launch of supersonic cruise missiles to hit rebel troops in an imaginary African nation holding Chinese hostages.However, this scenario could not have happened in real life because in the Gulf of Aden there have been no Type 052D destroyers－now considered the most capable combat ship in the People's Liberation Army Navy.Instead, the Navy has sent other vessels to the once pirate-plagued waters to protect civilian vessels for nearly 11 years.That is about to change, as the Navy has decided to dispatch a Type 052D to take part in its latest escort mission. The CNS Xining, the fifth in the Type 052D class, is sailing toward the Gulf of Aden.The Xining, with the number 117 on its hull, was commissioned in January 2017. It is part of the PLA Navy's 33rd escort flotilla, together with CNS Weifang, a Type 054A guided-missile frigate and CNS Hoh Xil Hu, a Type 903A supply ship. All of the ships belong to the naval force of the PLA Northern Theater Command, known as the North Sea Fleet.The flotilla set sail from a naval base in Qingdao, Shandong province, on Aug 29. It will travel at least 11,000 kilometers before reaching the Gulf of Aden in the next two weeks.A Type 052D destroyer has a standard displacement of 6,300 metric tons, according to the Navy. It carries a wide range of weapons, including a single-barrel 130 mm naval gun, a close-in weapon system, 64 HHQ-9 long-range antiaircraft missiles and YJ-18 or YJ-83 cruise missiles.The vessel uses a host of cutting-edge technologies. The Navy said that the Type 052D destroyer has a stealth design and can act as a flagship for a strike group.It is capable of conducting anti-ship, anti-submarine and air defense operations, and has been described by some Western observers as a "carrier killer".The first Type 052D destroyer, CNS Kunming, joined the Navy in March 2014. The Navy has built at least 17 Type 052Ds and 11 of them are in service, according to military observers who follow the weapons' development of the PLA Navy.The 33rd escort flotilla has more than 600 officers and sailors, including dozens of special operations troops.The Navy began to carry out escort missions in the Gulf of Aden and the waters off Somalia in December 2008. In the past decade, it has sent 106 ships and more than 28,000 naval personnel to escort at least 6,700 Chinese and foreign ships, according to the Navy.
