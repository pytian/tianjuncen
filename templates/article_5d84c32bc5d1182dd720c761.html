                Japan expresses regret at S. Korea removing it from preferential trading list
            </a>
            <p>
                TOKYO - The Japanese government on Wednesday described South Korea removing Japan from its preferential list of trading partners as "extremely regrettable" and a move that required more explanation.According to Japan's top government spokesperson, Tokyo believes it has not received sufficient explanation from Seoul regarding not just the details of its revocation from the list, but also the thinking behind the move."It's extremely regrettable that the review was made. We will continue to urge South Korean authorities to fulfill their accountability to the international community," Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said of the matter at a press briefing Wednesday.The move by South Korea on Wednesday follows similar actions from Japan on Aug 28, when it removed South Korea from its "white list" of preferential trading partners.South Korea, the first country to be removed from Japan's list, is no longer entitled to privileged trade procedures that previously allowed Seoul to import goods, including but not limited to electronic components, that could be diverted for military use.South Korea had been on the list of nations entitled to simplified export control procedures since 2004, which cover a wide range of items, except for food, timber and other goods.In order to then export the products to countries not on the white list, the whitelisted countries only need to obtain approval from Japan's trade ministry.The South Korean government had urged Japan not to proceed with its removal from the white list, which it estimated could have a negative bearing on more than 1,000 items in key industries spanning the auto and petrochemical sectors.Bilateral ties between Japan and South Korea have sunk to their lowest level in recent years owing to a wartime labor dispute spilling over into a tit-for-tat trade row.

                Supercomputing star
            </a>
            <p>
                Women like Lu Yutong are a rare exception in this field, Li Wenfang reports in Guangzhou.When it comes to supercomputing-a field dominated by men-it's unusual to see a woman in high places. But here she is.Lu Yutong served as the first program chair for the world's oldest conference dealing with high-performance computing, the ISC, which was held in Frankfurt, Germany, in June.Lu is unusual in China, too. She is director of the National Supercomputer Center in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, and one of 10 fellows of the conference, a group of people deemed to have made important contributions to the advancement of high-performance computing.Although she has been participating in the event for 10 years and was the first Chinese to deliver a keynote speech at the event in 2015, she sees herself as representing something bigger-the global position of China and the influence of the country's technological achievements."If not me, someone else would do it sooner or later," she says, adding that the relatively small club of people devoted to high-performance computing worldwide wants more participation-from research to volunteer work.Gender equationGender parity remains elusive among researchers, according to a UNESCO science report in 2015. Globally, women's participation in research is something of a leaky pipe, it says.Women are actively pursuing bachelor's and master's degrees and even outnumber men at those levels, with 53 percent of graduates, the report says. But their numbers drop off abruptly at the PhD level. Suddenly, male graduates (57 percent) overtake women. The discrepancy widens at the researcher level, the report says, with men representing 72 percent of the pool globally."The sheer drop in female researchers to less than 30 percent globally indicates that serious barriers remain to the full participation of women in science and engineering," the report says."At the transition from master's to PhD level then, as they climb the rungs of the career ladder, a number of women are lost to science. Even women who embark on a career in science or engineering often leave their jobs for family reasons or change career paths more often than men."Nevertheless, Lu says, in the field of supercomputing, where men greatly outnumber women, they are not competitors but colleagues, because the project is massive and calls for concerted cooperation in a team of only a few hundred people."We work for the same cause," Lu says. "I don't think women have obstacles in scientific research. They are by no means inferior in intelligence or capability to men. They should not set limits on themselves and should instead make their presence felt in their professions, capitalizing on their strong logic and communication skills."Lu's career in supercomputing started before university graduation, when one of her teachers was involved in the development of the Yinhe-2. Back then, all the programs used character-based interfaces and any typographical error would mean starting the work all over again.Lu needed to concentrate and take every step patiently."The older generation of workers for the Yinhe project developed the processor and all the hardware and software independently and with meticulous care," she says. "Their spirit has been passed on all the way to Tianhe-2."

                Sci-tech board starts new era for investors
            </a>
            <p>
                China's stock market becomes more diversified and mature, thanks to continuous reform and opening-up measuresThe initial excitement surrounding the launch of a new market is bound to fade over time, but Shanghai's sci-tech innovation board, or STAR Market, has attracted continued interest from investors since its dazzling debut in late July.After getting off to a strong start with share prices soaring an average of 217 percent from offer prices in the initial two weeks of trading, the STAR Market's first batch of listed firms retreated later in August and broadly stabilized this month, ending 139 percent higher than offer prices on average on Wednesday.Turnover has declined but remains high, with about one in 10 floating stocks of STAR-listed firms changing hands on average on Wednesday, topping all A-share sub-markets, according to financial information provider Wind Info.As rationality gradually replaces exuberance, it is the STAR Market's groundbreaking reforms under the trial registration-based initial public offering system that account for investors' continuing interest in the tech board, experts said.Marked by the debut of the STAR Market, a new era may be dawning for China's 29-year-old A-share market, featuring accelerated market-oriented, law-based reforms and deeper integration with the global financial community, they said."Overall, the market-oriented reforms on the STAR Market have borne fruit, while more could be done looking forward," said Eugene Qian, president of UBS Securities and a member of the UBS Asia-Pacific Executive Committee.Registration-based IPO on the STAR Market "has been a success so far", Qian said. Easier listing standards have enabled pioneering new-economy companies to seek floats domestically, and the IPOs of the first batch of floats were priced reasonably, according to Qian.Securities authorities lifted the unspoken IPO pricing ceiling of 23 times earnings for the new tech board, giving the market a bigger say in IPO pricing. As for secondary trading, daily price fluctuation and short selling limits were also loosened.On the back of the market-oriented reforms, more institutional investors from home and abroad are expected to join STAR Market secondary trading after the market becomes more sizable and less volatile over the next few quarters, Qian said."I think it (the debut of the STAR Market) is the beginning of a whole new era of the A-share market potentially," Qian said, as the STAR Market serves as a prelude to more market-oriented reforms, including the adoption of the registration-based IPO system on the ChiNext board in Shenzhen, which aims to attract innovative and fast-growing enterprises.China's A-share market was born in December 1990, when the Shanghai Stock Exchange debuted with only eight listed firms capitalized at more than 1.2 billion yuan ($170 million) in total.Only 29 years later, the market has become the world's second-largest following the United States in terms of capitalization, with nearly 3,700 listed firms valued at more than 50 trillion yuan in total, or more than half of the country's annual GDP.Looking at the A-share market's history, the most significant watershed was the split share structure reform initiated in 2005, said Wang Maobin, investment department chair at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.The reform floated a large volume of non-tradable A shares that were largely State-owned. Non-tradable shareholders were required to bargain with and pay tradable shareholders compensation to make their shares tradable.The overhaul triggered a bull run from 2006 to 2007, with the Shanghai Composite Index peaking at 6124 points in October 2007, the highest level ever.The market became much more liquid and less volatile through the reform, while illegal trading behavior such as insider trading and market manipulation dropped markedly, according to Wang."Investors began to earn profit from growth in listed firms, rather than only from losses of other investors."The reform also ushered in an era of development marked by steady, gradual change characterized by growth in the number of institutional investors, improvement in market rules, enrichment of trading tools, and two-way market opening-up over the past decade, Wang said.

                A shares attracting foreign funds as economy maintains steady growth
            </a>
            <p>
                China's A-share market is becoming more attractive to overseas investors as the country maintains a steady pace of economic growth and capital market opening-up amid a precarious global recovery, experts said.When the market opens next Monday, two major investment index compilers, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indices, will implement their latest A-share inclusion steps. The former will roughly triple the weighting of A-share constituents, while the latter will add more than 1,000 A shares to its global benchmarks, after their competitor MSCI Inc raised A-share weighting in August.Founder Securities estimated the moves will trigger about $30 billion to $40 billion in foreign inflows into A shares.Huang Jun, chief Chinese analyst at currency trading platform forex.com, said the three major global equity index providers' successive inclusion moves demonstrated the increasing allure of Ashare assets to global investors.China's economic growth has slowed in the past two years but still showed "clear advantage" compared with other emerging markets and advanced economies, Huang said.In the first half of this year, the world's second-largest economy expanded by 6.3 percent. The figure slowed from 6.6 percent for the whole of 2018, but was the highest among all major economies worldwide, official data said."(The economic situation of) China has been stable with solid development foundation, which is the biggest reason why global capital favors the country," Huang said, citing the dampening effect of Brexit on the eurozone and emerging market debt issues such as those in Argentina and Turkey on global investors' confidence in these economies.Besides China's growth prospects, investment opportunities in A shares also derive from the potential enhancement in valuation, said Lynda Zhou, equities chief investment officer in China at Fidelity International."With deepening reform of China's asset management sector, onshore risk-free interest rates are expected to decline sustainably, pushing up the valuation levels of equity assets," Zhou said.Meanwhile, as the market's investor structure, which is dominated by retail investors, may make short-term stock price performance deviate from the true value of listed firms, long-term investment opportunities abound, she said."We believe the valuation levels and growth prospects of A-share listed firms still have an advantage (over global peers)," Zhou said, adding that she pays particular attention to investment opportunities related to consumption upgrading, high-end manufacturing and independent technologies.The A-share market regained upward momentum after the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index hit an intraday low of 2733.92 points in early August, the lowest since mid-February. The SCI went up by 0.25 percent to close at 2985.66 points on Wednesday.Foreign inflows accelerated along with the recovery, with net inflows via northbound trading of stock connect programs between mainland and Hong Kong bourses standing at 28 billion yuan ($3.95 billion) during the first trading week of September, the highest since the first week of November last year.By the end of the first half of this year, foreign capital accounted for 7.6 percent of the A-share market's free float capitalization, up from no more than 3 percent at the beginning of 2016, data collected by Fidelity International showed."Global investors have been structurally underweight in China for many years," said Michael Orzano, senior director of global equity indices at S&P Dow Jones Indices.But this situation has been gradually changing as investors' exposure to the A-share market rose after the market became more accessible and gained inclusion in global equity benchmarks, Orzano said.China has made steady progress in opening up the A-share market in recent years. The authorities quadrupled daily transaction limits for stock connects last year, and continuously relaxed regulation of qualified foreign institutional investor schemes, including announcing an end to quota limits of the schemes last week.

                Casualties of car bomb soar to 20 deaths, 93 wounded in S. Afghanistan
            </a>
            <p>
                 QALAT - The death toll of a car bomb on Thursday that rocked Qalat city, the capital of southern Afghanistan's Zabul province, has risen to 20, with over 93 others wounded, provincial government spokesman Gul Islam Sayal said."Twenty people lost their lives and 93 others wounded in the car bomb that hit a hospital in Qalat city today morning," Sayal told Xinhua.Earlier, Interior Ministry spokesman put the number of casualties at 15 dead and 66 injured.Sayal said the target of the militants was the civilian hospital and all the victims including women and children are civilian people.Taliban outfit has claimed responsibility for the blast and in contact with media claimed that a suicide bomber targeted the provincial office of National Directorate of Security or the country's counter-intelligence agency, inflicting huge casualties.Sayal rejected the Taliban claim, saying all the victims killed in Qalat's attack Thursday morning are the innocent civilians.The armed group which has stepped up activities mostly in the shape of suicide bombing has also claimed responsibility for the deadly bombings that claimed scores of lives in Kabul, Charikar and Jalalabad cities over the past week.

                China's A-shares see foreign inflow spike amid global indices inclusion
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - Foreign capital inflow into China's A-shares market remains robust since the beginning of September after major global benchmarks announced widened inclusion of A-shares.Net foreign capital inflow reached 45.9 billion yuan (about $6.5 billion) since the beginning of this month through stock connect schemes with the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, according to a Friday report by the Economic Information Daily.The figure accounts for about 27 percent of foreign capital inflow since 2019, which stood at 167.4 billion yuan.The influx came after global index provider MSCI raised index weighting for Chinese A-shares from 10 percent to 15 percent, effective from Aug 27.Another benchmark FTSE Russell strengthened the A-shares' weighting in one of its indices from 5 percent to 15 percent, while the S&P Dow Jones Indices will weigh 1,099 A-shares at 25 percent in an upcoming inclusion.The two moves to take effect on Sept 23 are expected to generate $5.1 billion worth of inflow into the A-shares, according to FTSE Russell estimates and analysis from China Merchants Securities.Analysts believe the A-shares are at the outset of a hot streak of foreign capital influx with more to follow as the country further opens up its financial sector.China's forex regulator scraped two investment quota restrictions for foreign institutional investors earlier this month to better facilitate participation in the financial markets.
