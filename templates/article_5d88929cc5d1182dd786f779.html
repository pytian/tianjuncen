                FedEx probed over rerouting of parcels

                Such behaviors harm legitimate rights of Chinese users, State Postal Bureau says China launched an investigation into FedEx solely because the United States express delivery service provider allegedly failed to deliver clients' parcels to designated addresses, which is a severe violation of Chinese postal service regulations. The case shouldn't be overinterpreted, Chinese postal service and commercial officials said. The State Postal Bureau recently received complaints from FedEx clients saying the company rerouted their parcels to other destinations rather than designated addresses, without informing them or seeking their permission. Since such behaviors seriously violated relevant laws and regulations of China's express service industry and harmed the legitimate rights of Chinese users, the bureau decided to launch the investigation, Ma Junsheng, head of the bureau, said in a statement posted on the bureau's official website on Sunday. "The fundamental rule of the express service is that service provider must deliver parcels to the designated addresses and receivers. Postal service administrators have the right to look into any violations," he said, without naming the clients who lodged the complaint. On Saturday, China said FedEx was put under investigation after Huawei Technologies claimed the company, without offering any explanation, diverted two parcels destined for addresses in China to the US. The Chinese telecommunications equipment maker said FedEx tried to reroute two other packages sent from Vietnam to Huawei addresses elsewhere in Asia without authorization. "Express service providers should never interrupt normal services for non-commercial purposes," Ma said. "FedEx values our business in China. Our relationship with Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and all of our customers in China are important to us," the company said in a statement posted on its official website on Saturday. "FedEx holds itself to a very high standard of service. FedEx will fully cooperate with any regulatory investigation into how we serve our customers." On Tuesday, FedEx China had said in a statement that a small number of Huawei parcels were rerouted because of its mistakes. "It's quite unusual for FedEx to reroute all four parcels by mistake. Even if they did, they will be held responsible for contract infringement," said Yin Shaocheng, a law professor of Capital University of Economics and Business. Huawei was among the Chinese tech firms that were recently put on the US's Entity List, which bars US companies from selling components and software to them. Some people started to speculate the investigation was related to escalating trade war between China and the US. "People shouldn't over-interpret the FedEx case," Wang Shouwen, vice-minister of commerce, said at a news conference releasing the white paper, titled China's Position on the China-US Economic and Trade Consultations, on Sunday. "Foreign companies will be put under investigation when possible violations occur, in accordance with Chinese laws. It gives no ground for blame," said Wang, adding that China will further protect the rights of foreign investors. cuijia@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 06/03/2019 page3)

                SAN'A, Yemen - One of two powerful bombs mailed from Yemen to Chicago-area synagogues traveled on two passenger planes within the Middle East, a Qatar Airways spokesman said Sunday. The U.S. said the plot bears the hallmarks of al-Qaida's offshoot in Yemen and vowed to destroy the group.The airline spokesman said a package containing explosives hidden in a printer cartridge arrived in Qatar Airways' hub in Doha, Qatar on one of the carrier's flights from the Yemeni capital San'a. It was then shipped on a separate Qatar Airways plane to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, where it was discovered by authorities late Thursday or early Friday. A second, similar package turned up in England on Friday.The airline spokesman disclosed the information on condition of anonymity in line with the company's standing policies on conversations with the media. He did not give any timeframe for the two flights in question — the airline operates daily passenger flights from Yemen that could also carry courier packages.Related readings: US eyeing Saudi-born bombmaker in bomb plot Tamil rebel jailed for bomb attack in Sri Lanka Time-bomb ticks as second board turns a year old Suicide bomb attack kills nine at Sufi shrine Car bomb explodes in Northern Ireland - policeIn Washington, President Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser John Brennan said authorities "have to presume" there might be more potential mail bombs like the ones pulled from planes in England and the United Arab Emirates.U.S. inspectors were heading to Yemen to monitor cargo security practices and pinpoint holes in the system. An internal government report, obtained by The Associated Press, said the team of six inspectors from the Transportation Security Administration will give Yemeni officials recommendations and training to improve cargo security. The report also says the agency is considering extending its security directive to increase inspection of cargo for all flights through Nov. 8."We're trying to get a better handle on what else may be out there," Brennan told NBC's "Meet the Press" as he made the rounds of the Sunday talk shows representing the Obama administration in the wake of the latest terrorist scare. "We're trying to understand better what we may be facing."He told CNN's "State of the Union" that "it would be very imprudent ... to presume that there are no others (packages) out there."Brennan noted that because of the continuing threat, the world's largest package delivery companies — FedEx and UPS — have suspended air freight from Yemen. Police in Yemen have arrested a young woman on suspicion of mailing the bombs and also detained her mother.While he said "we feel good" about the steps taken since the thwarted plot, "I think we have to presume there might be" additional bombs.The explosives, addressed to Chicago-area synagogues, were pulled off airplanes in England and the United Arab Emirates early Friday morning after intelligence officials were tipped off about them. That touched off a tense search for other devices.

                    FedEx has only itself to blame for loss of trust from customers: China Daily editorial
                </p>

                A company prefers, of course, to be above reproach. But, failing that, the next best thing is unquestionably to get rid of the body, for it is being found with it wrapped in the carpet that brings remorse and the loss of trust from its customers.Which is the position FedEx finds itself in now.It has claimed that it misdirected three of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei's packages to the United States in May due to what it called "operational error".Yet investigation by the Chinese authorities has found these were not due to any oversight but rather part of a deliberate pattern of behavior in which the US express services company is also suspected of holding up more than 100 Huawei packages entering China, as well as other violations of the law.And with the investigation still on-going, it is expected that more wrongdoings are yet to be revealed.Responding to China's investigation on Friday, FedEx blamed the mishandling of the packages on the "unclear" rules of the US Commerce Department, claiming they bring "great complexity" to its operation. "That is why we sued" the department, it said.As one of the first foreign express delivery companies coming to China nearly 40 years ago, FedEx is well aware of China's postal law. But it has obviously underestimated the country's determination to enforce it to the letter. Otherwise, it would have not given such a feeble excuse when it was discovered to have delivered the three Huawei packages to the US, not their intended destination, which for one of the top-notch companies in the industry handling 15 million packages a day is a rather telling slip.Not to mention that the on-going probe has just unveiled that it provided "customized services" for more than 100 packages of the same company, which has been tirelessly suppressed and vilified by the US governmentIt is interesting to see that its "operational error" excuse came shortly after the US government included Huawei on its entity list for export controls.Even more interesting is that the shipper sued the US Commerce Department on June 24 to stop the agency from enforcing the export regulations against it. The company said in its statement announcing the lawsuit: "FedEx is a transportation company, not a law enforcement agency."In the lawsuit, the shipper complains that to comply with the export controls it has to screen the names and addresses of senders and recipients prior to delivering any package in order to identify whether the senders and/or recipients are on the Commerce Department's entity list.It seems that FedEx is just the fall guy for the US government.It is natural for its Chinese customers, particularly those that are on the list or suppliers to the listed entities, to feel uneasy about tasking the US company with their deliveries given that it seems prone to acting as a tentacle of the long-arm jurisdiction the US government so delights in.China has announced it is drawing up an unreliable entity list and FedEx seems likely to be one of the companies named on it. But for that, it only has itself to blame, or the US government, which always likes to get others to do its dirty work.China welcomes any law-abiding foreign companies, but it will not turn a blind eye to those who try to bend it — whatever the reason.
