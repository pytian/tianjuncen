                    Collaboration deals enrich Sino-Bangladeshi relations

                Bilateral economic cooperation between China and Bangladesh can be further enriched by financial service and new regional collaboration deals, experts said. Their comments came after Alipay, which is under the umbrella of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group's, entered into a string of agreements in Bangladesh and Pakistan last year, assisting destination countries with technological upgrades to serve underbanked populations. In a partnership with bKash of Bangladesh, Alipay has created a local version of a mobile payment tool mimicking Alipay, with core functionalities such as money transfer embedded on feature phones. Xue Rongjiu, deputy director of the China Society for WTO Studies, said the new remittance service is an example of how new technologies can help countries meet their digital and financial inclusion goals. Following the growing global use of Chinese yuan or renminbi, Bangladesh Bank - the central bank of Bangladesh and a member of the Asian Clearing Union, allowed other banks in the country to open foreign currency clearing accounts in yuan in August 2018. The move showed the South Asian nation's recognition of yuan as an international currency to be used in import, export, and any kind of financial exchanges with China. Xue said the Bangladesh Bank's decision has diversified economic cooperation with China, as well as with other economies participating in the Belt and Road Initiative. From a service perspective, many opportunities will also come from the urbanization and industrialization in Bangladesh, said Yu Jianlong, secretary-general of the China Chamber of International Commerce. He said to sustain interconnected growth, Bangladesh has been working with China and other partners to push economic integration across Asia. To meet demand in Bangladesh, China has implemented a flexible visa policy for Bangladeshi citizens who want to go to China for business and cultural exchange. Aside from people-to-people exchanges, China, Bangladesh and Myanmar reached an agreement on electric power trade in Nay Pyi Taw last year to strengthen cooperation in electric power trading via promoting the interconnection of power grid and infrastructure development among the three countries. The trilateral agreement to trade electric power among neighboring countries has helped improve energy security, sharing of electric resources, infrastructure development and job creation, as well as strengthen a long-term partnership, said Chen Yao, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Industrial Economics.

                Bangladesh's presence in the Belt and Road Initiative has considerably expanded since 2016, said Sheikh Fazle Fahim, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry.BRI-related projects in the South Asian country, which have reached a value of around $10 billion, are expected to create jobs, boost industrial development, contribute to gross domestic product growth, and make Bangladesh a more attractive destination for foreign investors, Fahim said in an exclusive interview with China Daily on Wednesday."For Bangladesh, BRI-related investment is spread across multiple sectors which will contribute to Bangladesh's rapid GDP growth, including infrastructure, connectivity and shipping," he added.The $165 million Bangladesh Power System Upgrade and Expansion Project has benefited the country by helping provide electrical connections to more than 2.5 million rural people, significantly improving their lives, said Fahim.In addition to infrastructure and manufacturing projects, the official said there is also great potential in the information and communication technology sectors as well as those yet to be tapped under the initiative."In the future, we could also focus on innovation-driven development with joint collaboration in the new generation of information technology such as artificial intelligence, big data, quantum information and biotechnology, in addition to the expansion of smart technologies including intelligent human computer interactions, industrial robots, smart factories and smart logistics," he said.Fahim spoke highly of the economic cooperation between Bangladesh and China and said he believes it would become wider and deeper in the future.China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner. Bangladesh has become China's second-largest trading partner in South Asia, with bilateral trade between the two countries having nearly quadrupled in the past 10 years to exceed $12 billion in the last fiscal year, the FBCCI said.Around 400 Chinese companies are operating in Bangladesh in power, textiles, weaving, leather, footwear, construction, engineering and non-banking financial institutions, with a net investment of $1.03 billion in 2018, Fahim explained, adding that the number is gradually rising.In addition, he said the cooperation between the two countries in finance and e-commerce is becoming increasingly active.A consortium consisting of the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange acquired 25 percent of the shares of the Dhaka Stock Exchange last year.Ant Finance has become the strategic partner to Bangladesh's biggest online payment company Bkash. And UnionPay International has cooperated with Mutual Trust Bank, a private commercial bank in Bangladesh, to jointly launch debit and credit cards with mobile payment services."It is encouraging. However, there is more to be done," Fahim said.The official said that with China's further opening-up of its economy, the strongest sectors of Bangladesh such as leather, ICT and fast-moving consumer goods will have greater access to the huge Chinese market and this will boost the growth of Bangladeshi companies.In fields such as the telecommunication and digital economy, the presence of Chinese companies and businesses in Bangladesh would grow substantially.Fahim said the FBCCI will continue to play its role in helping Chinese investors in Bangladesh through policy advocacy and by providing services to make it easier to do business.Video photographers & editors: Sun Weiwei and Wang Yuxi

                Premier meets with Bangladeshi prime minister to enhance bilateral relationsChina and Bangladesh signed a number of agreements on Thursday focusing mainly on power generation and economic cooperation as part of efforts to boost bilateral ties.Premier Li Keqiang and visiting Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina witnessed the signing of the agreements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.During their talks, Li said China stands ready to strengthen high-level interactions, consolidate strategic mutual trust, enhance mutually beneficial cooperation and promote people-to-people exchanges to move bilateral ties forward.Li encouraged alignment of the development strategies of Bangladesh with the Belt and Road Initiative, consultations between the two countries on the joint feasibility study of a free trade agreement and jointly promoting the building of the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor for common development.He also underlined the need for the two nations to intensify communication and coordination in international affairs in order to play a positive role in promoting regional peace, stability and development.Bilateral trade volume reached $18.74 billion last year, a year-on-year increase of 16.8 percent, the Ministry of Commerce said.Against the backdrop of the ongoing global economic slowdown, such growth in trade between two countries is rarely seen, Li said. "This demonstrates that the potential for bilateral cooperation remains huge," he added.The Bangladeshi prime minister hailed the Bangladesh-China relationship as an example of high-level development and said Bangladesh is willing to actively participate in the BRI, work with China to strengthen regional connectivity and enhance teamwork in trade, investment, services and infrastructure.Both countries are committed to peace, stability, mutual benefit and win-win outlooks as well as resolving disputes through peaceful means, Hasina added.The two nations also agreed to set up a work group responsible for investment cooperation to press ahead with a bilateral investment pact, Wu Jianghao, director-general of the Foreign Ministry's Department of Asian Affairs, said after the two leaders' meeting.He said China has become Bangladesh's biggest sources of foreign direct investment, and vast potential remains there in investment cooperation in such fields as infrastructure construction and production capacity.The two countries also agreed to strengthen law enforcement and security cooperation, and enhance military exchanges and their defense partnership, Wu said.China supports Bangladesh and Myanmar in resolving the issue of Rohingya refugees through consultations in order to realize the early repatriation of displaced people from Bangladesh to Myanmar, he added.

                    Why do UK Chinese out-earn British counterparts?
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Experts reveal reasons behind surprise resultsChinese and Indian workers in the United Kingdom are earning more than their British counterparts, according to a new report.Pundits advise that the findings may be volatile because of being from a small sample, but say that the outcome is mainly due to the fact that families from those ethnic groups tend to invest heavily on higher education.The study by the UK's Office for National Statistics, also known as ONS, reveals that expatriate workers from China and India consistently had the highest median hourly pay of any ethnic group from 2012 to 2018.The new report is the first of its kind to comprehensively analyze the ethnicity pay gaps in the UK, which found that in 2018, employees from the Chinese diaspora on average earned 30.9 percent more than white British employees.Carol Woodhams, professor of Human Resource Management at the University of Surrey, said: "It is likely that Chinese families prioritize investment in education and tertiary qualifications."They may make well-informed choices relative to which subject majors to pursue, that lead to highly paid occupations. The evidence shows that Chinese workers commence their UK careers at a much higher hourly pay rate."Hamish Anderson, public policy analyst at the ONS, said: "One of the main reasons the Chinese ethnic group may see higher wages than other ethnic groups could be due to visa restrictions."For example migrants from China are likely to have higher qualifications or skills needed to enable them to get a visa in the first place. Although there is a difference between nationality and ethnicity so this obviously wouldn't apply to everyone."The study found three ethnic groups were shown to have a higher median hourly pay than white British in the UK last year, with those with a Chinese background earning 15.75 pounds ($19.65) an hour, while the average Indian worker earned 13.47 pounds, and workers from the mixed/multiple ethnicity group earned 12.33 pounds an hour. White British workers earned 12.03 pounds an hour.When looking at the findings, Woodhams said the first point to note is that this reflection is based on a relatively small sample of Chinese employees."This makes it statistically unstable," she said. "Small changes to the fortunes of this limited population could have large implications for the pay gap. There are also other influences that might not be immediately obvious. For example, there will be unequal geographic distribution of Chinese employees — there is likely to be a higher density of Chinese workers in cities where pay is higher, especially in London. This will raise the median Chinese wage."Woodhams pointed out there are other possible differences in ways that Chinese women engage in the labor market compared to their UK counterparts, adding "they may have less time out of the labor market and greater familial support for childcare responsibilities, lowering their incidence of part-time working and keeping careers on track."Geraldine Healy, professor of employment relations at Queen Mary University of London, said: "This is certainly an eye-catching headline. However, we do need some caution in taking the figure at face-value."In the report analysis, the white British contingent was estimated to account for 79.5 percent of the working population, followed by white other (7.9 percent) and black African, Caribbean or black British (3.2 percent). The ethnic groups that make up the smallest proportions of those employed within Great Britain are the Bangladeshi and Chinese ethnic groups, at 0.7 percent and 0.5 percent respectively."The Chinese make up the smallest proportion of Britain's migrant groups at 0.5 percent," said Healy. "Such a small sample means that estimates of average hourly pay are likely to be more volatile and inaccurate."The study also showed the two ethnic groups with the highest median hourly pay, Chinese and Indian, had a larger difference in hourly earnings between men and women.Chinese men on average earned 19.1 percent more per hour than Chinese women, and Indian men earned 23.3 percent more per hour than Indian women. Similar to the Bangladeshi ethnic group, the Chinese ethnic group has a smaller sample size than the other ethnic groups.Healy said: "We should recognize that these figures do not represent the full Chinese population in Britain … Nevertheless, this report is important as it draws attention to the Chinese, a growing ethnic group in Britain, who merit more research so that we can garner a more complete understanding of their employment experiences."In 2016, the British government set out to examine the barriers faced in the workplace by people from ethnic minority groups and to consider what could be done to address them.Woodhams said that based on the ONS analysis, race still plays a role in determining pay, with some of the patterns in pay determined by differences in the way that different racial groups are socialized to engage with work, careers and lifestyle."Some of it is also related to recent immigration patterns," she added. "First-generation Chinese immigrants are still paid less than their UK-born counterparts and much less than second-generation Chinese."To help improve employment and career prospects for those from ethnic minority backgrounds, Woodhams said, the government should work to ensure that everyone can fairly access career opportunities and realize their labor market potential."Government interventions to confront inequality on the grounds of race, therefore, need to commence with ensuring equality in health, housing and education so that all racial groups are in a good position to compete for the opportunities that the UK labor market brings, including self-employment," she said.

                DHAKA - The situation of dengue has deteriorated in Bangladesh as the mosquito-borne viral disease spread out in most parts of the country in less than a month.A total of 1,096 fresh cases of dengue were reported from the capital Dhaka and elsewhere in the country in the last 24 hours as of 8:00 am local time Monday, Abdur Rahim, a Health Ministry control room official told Xinhua on Tuesday.He said the total number of confirmed cases as of Monday in the country since Jan 1 rose to 13,637, registering a record high.The data reported by the Bangladeshi Ministry of Health gave an alert as Dhaka has seen a rapid surge of the disease.The number of dengue patients in the first 29 days of July rose to 11,450, which reportedly had surpassed the total number of patients in any past year.Ayesha Akhter, assistant director at the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), told Xinhua the number of dengue patients was 946 in July last year, saying some 10,148 people were infected with dengue fever in 2018 and 26 of them died.Officials said Dhaka and its neighboring districts are more vulnerable to the risk of mosquito-borne diseases and most hospitals in Dhaka and clinics are now crammed with hundreds of new dengue patients every day.Eight people have died of dengue so far this year, the Health Ministry official records showed.However, local media Prothom Alo reported on Tuesday that the death toll was registered at 47, saying the disease has spread to 59 out of 64 districts.Another local media Somoy TV reported on Tuesday that four people who had been diagnosed with dengue fever, died in hospitals in Dhaka and southern Barisal town, some 180 km south of Dhaka, in the early hours of Tuesday.Health and Family Welfare Minister Zahid Malik earlier said in a press conference that the government has taken actions.The minister asked all city corporations and municipalities to take necessary steps to destroy the breeding grounds of the Aedes mosquitoes.Dengue is transmitted by several species of mosquito within the genus Aedes. The first case of mosquito-borne viral infection was reported in Bangladesh in 2000, and some 100 people died from the disease from 2000 to 2003.Impoverished states are especially vulnerable to viruses because of insufficient biosecurity, deficient disease surveillance and protection measures.The monsoon period from June to September is usually the peak season of dengue fever in Bangladesh and transmission becomes rampant in the country.
