                UN nuclear watchdog starts general conference amid mounting Iran tension
            </p>
            <p>
                 VIENNA - The International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) 63rd General Conference opened here on Monday amid heightened tensions over the Iran nuclear deal.Many of the IAEA's 171 member states are represented at the meeting from Monday to Friday. The application of the IAEA's safeguards in the Middle East and in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as issues related to radiation safety and ways of strengthening the agency's technical cooperation activities are on the agenda.Discussing the crisis over Iran nuclear deal, IAEA Acting Director General Cornel Feruta told the conference: "A week ago I visited Tehran for talks with senior Iranian officials ... I continue to emphasize the importance of full and timely cooperation by Iran in the implementation of its Safeguards Agreement and additional protocol.""The agency continues to verify the non-diversion of nuclear material declared by Iran under its Safeguards Agreement," said the acting IAEA chief, noting that "Evaluations regarding the absence of the undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran continue."Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), condemned the "economic terrorism" pursued by the US administration and called on the international community to assume joint responsibility for saving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)."The violation of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution (2231) and the imposition of unilateral unlawful sanctions, as well as the application of extra-territorial national laws to other countries by the United States, certainly endangers international peace and security," he said."If the international community fails to save the JCPOA promptly, multilateralism will lose its effectiveness, and any further peaceful resolution of global conflicts will be challenged, which will subsequently serve the malign interests of warmongers," he said.While Iran said that the steps to downgrade its nuclear commitments aim to "provide a new window for diplomacy to preserve the deal," the US called it a nuclear blackmail."Iran continues to use its nuclear program to extort the international community and threaten regional security," according to a message from US President Donald Trump shared with the conference by US Energy Secretary Rick Perry.The European Union (EU), on the other hand, noted Iran's "stated intentions" to remain within the JCPOA and urged the country to reverse its steps and return to full JCPOA compliance, according to Petri Peltonen, Finland's under-secretary of state at the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment."The EU deeply regrets the withdrawal of the United States from the JCPOA and the reimposed sanctions, and calls upon all countries to refrain from taking actions that impede the implementation of the JCPOA," said Peltonen.The EU is deeply concerned that Iran has exceeded the JCPOA stockpile limit of enriched uranium, and is particularly concerned about the development reported by the IAEA regarding Iran's expansion of its centrifuge R&D activities, according to Peltonen.He stressed that the full implementation of the nuclear deal by Iran is and remains essential.Perry echoed US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's accusation that Iran was responsible for launching the recent drone attacks on two Aramco oil facilities in the east of Saudi Arabia, which caused major damages and halved Saudi oil output.Iran's Foreign Ministry on Monday rejected the US claims that Iran was behind the drone attacks, saying "such claims are baseless and are condemned."The United Nations' atomic watchdog confirmed earlier last week that advanced centrifuges had been installed at an Iranian nuclear plant in breach of limitations set by the 2015 nuclear deal with major powers.In reaction to the unilateral withdrawal by the US from the JCPOA and its sanctions on Tehran, and in response to Europe's "inactivity" to save Iran's interests under the deal, Iran decided in May this year to scale back its obligations under the JCPOA to build stockpiles of nuclear fuel and enrich low-grade uranium to a higher level of purity.It also decided to start up advanced centrifuges to boost the country's stockpile of enriched uranium.

                Lagarde wins approval as head of ECB
            </a>
            <p>
                She'll take central bank post as European economy faces Brexit, other challenges The European Parliament approved Christine Lagarde on Tuesday as the next president of the European Central Bank, at a time when the European economy is challenged by Brexit and trade conflicts. Lagarde received 394 votes in favor and 206 against, with 49 abstentions, in a secret ballot vote on Tuesday after a debate during which members of the European Parliament from both the euro and non-euro states praised and challenged her nomination. Lagarde was not present for the debate or the vote. The 63-year-old French lawyer and politician will replace Mario Draghi, an Italian economist, on Nov 1 in the Frankfurt-based ECB, which sets interest rate benchmarks and supervises banks for the 19 EU member states that use the euro as a currency. Lagarde was nominated for the job by the European Council on July 2. She resigned her job as IMF managing director on July 16, a post she had held since 2011. When the resignation took effect on Sept 12, Lagarde praised the IMF on Twitter as an institution "with a brain, a wallet - and a heart". Before the Tuesday plenary vote in Strasbourg, France, Lagarde had appeared before the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in Brussels, where she was grilled on Sept 4 by the members of Parliament. In the committee vote, Lagarde received 37 votes in favor and 11 against, with four abstentions. In her remarks to the committee, Lagarde said the job requires both a commitment to the basic mandate to keep prices stable and the "agility" to come up with new ways to meet unforeseen trouble. She will assume the job just a day after the scheduled Brexit on Oct 31. If Britain leaves the EU without a deal, many expect a huge disruption in normal business between Britain and the 27 EU member states. In addition, the trade war between the United States and China, the EU's two largest trade partners, is having a heavy impact on EU industries. The US has also been given the green light by the World Trade Organization to impose billions of euros in punitive tariffs on EU products in retaliation for illegal subsidies granted to Airbus, Politico reported. Lagarde has also voiced support for such European Central Bank measures as bond purchases and negative interest rates, which have drawn criticism for reducing savers' returns. She said the measures had helped create 11 million jobs since 2013 and eased financial turmoil. Without such measures "the crisis would have been a lot worse", she said, adding that she agrees with the bank's view that the economy would need monetary support "for an extended period of time". Lagarde said she would aim to communicate clearly with the public to explain the bank's decisions. She said that while "financial market operators" were likely to understand the ECB's message on monetary issues, "I want the people of the euro area to understand why decisions are being made." ECB Governing Council member Yannis Stournaras indicated that Lagarde will probably keep up the controversial, ultra-loose policy in the stimulus package rolled out by Draghi last week, according to Bloomberg. "There are strong monetary, economic and financial arguments suggesting that (Lagarde) will more or less continue along the same lines," the Greek central bank governor said in Athens on Monday. In recent remarks, Lagarde also suggested the ECB should "move towards more green products" and pledged to "continue to look at that and how the ECB can be an actor in this". While the amount of carbon assets in the ECB's portfolio "can't change overnight", a "move to a gradual transition to eliminate this type of assets" is something that should be done, she said.

                Sino-Finnish partnership entering into new era
            </a>
            <p>
                Further enhanced cooperation opens up new avenues for interconnectivity, trade, investment and innovation In April 2017, President Xi Jinping made a state visit to Finland on occasion of the centenary of Finland's independence. The visit came 22 years after the last time a Chinese president visited Finland. The two heads of state jointly announced the establishment of future-oriented new-type cooperative partnership between China and Finland. In January 2019, Finnish President Sauli Niinisto paid a visit to China. The two countries jointly launched the 2019"China-Finland Year of Winter Sports". This is the first time China and a foreign country jointly held thematic year of winter sports. Looking back, it's not quite hard to find that Finland has always been at the forefront of western countries in establishing diplomatic ties and developing cooperation with China. Sino-Finnish relationship has stood the test of time and changes in international circumstances. Finland was among the first Western countries to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. Finland was also one of the few countries which supported China's restoration of the legitimate seat in UN in the early 1970s. In recent years, under the guidance of the heads of state diplomacy, the two countries have witnessed frequent high-level exchanges and enhanced mutual political trust. At the beginning of last year, the speaker of the Finnish Parliament had led a joint visit of speakers from eight Nordic and Baltic countries to China. Cabinet members from Finland, including the prime minister, visit China or attend international conferences in China. Each year, nearly 40 Chinese provincial and ministerial delegations from political parties, governments, the National People's Congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the judiciary and military departments visit Finland to exchange governance experience. Such visits have, in fact, become the "new normal". In 1953, Finland has signed intergovernmental trade agreement with Chinese government, making Finland the first Western country to sign such agreement with the New China. In the past few decades, large number of Finnish companies, such as Nokia, have achieved great success in China. Many Chinese people, myself included, have their first mobile phone from Nokia. As China has grown into the world's second-largest economy, two countries have expanded cooperation in the fields of trade and investment. In fact, China has already been Finland's fourth-largest trading partner in the world as well as the largest in Asia for 16 consecutive years. China's investment in Finland has grown rapidly in recent years, and mutual investment between the two sides has been basically at equal level. At present, there are nine direct flights between China and Finland operated by three airlines, and two lines of China Railway Express have been extended to Finland. Finland was also the first place where the five-starred red flag was raised at the Olympic Games. In 1952, the New China sent its first ever delegation to the Helsinki Olympic Games. At the beginning of 2018, a pair of Chinese giant pandas, named" Hua Bao" and" Jin Baobao", came to Finland. Finland became the first Nordic country to welcome Chinese giant pandas. I often say that, Finland is among the few countries to have three Chinese ambassadors. Traditional Chinese cultural activities represented by the" Happy Chinese New Year - Chinese Temple Fair in Helsinki" have attracted wide attention and participation in Finland, while the number of overnight visitors from China to Finland has increased dramatically. Finland's unique educational philosophy and lifestyle are particularly popular among the Chinese people, especially the young. The comic book Finnish Nightmare has become a hit in China, and Jingfen (spiritually Finnish) becoming buzzword on the internet. China and Finland share common similarities in diplomatic philosophy. In the context of anti-globalization, unilateralism and trade protectionism, both countries firmly stand for multilateralism, economic globalization and free trade. The two sides hold similar positions on sustainable development, climate change, Arctic affairs and other issues. There are many areas of cooperation China and Finland can focus on: First, connectivity. Although Finland is a Nordic country, it is one of the nearest path from China to Europe. Therefore, cooperation on connectivity under the Belt and Road Initiative could be fruitful. China and Finland also face broad prospects for cooperation in the Arctic shipping-lane. In the future, we can even foresee the idea of" Ice Silk Road" and" Digital Silk Road". Second, trade and investment. The successful cases of Chinese investment in Finland in recent years, such as Tencent's acquisition of majority shares of Finnish game company Supercell and Anta's acquisition of famous sports company Amer Sports, provided excellent practice. Finland has advantages in high-tech fields of clean technology, bio-economy and circular economy. Excellent products, services and technologies from such areas are exactly what China needs. The China International Import Expo with other platforms in return offer a huge market for Finnish companies. There are also great potentials for Sino-Finnish cooperation in tripartite financial market, as Finland is the founding member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Third, innovation cooperation. China overtook Japan in the Global Innovation Index 2019 to rank 14, making it the only middle-income economy in the top 20. Innovation is one of Finland's unique features, especially in the information and communication industry, where Finland has accumulated talent, experience and technological advantages. Sino-Finnish cooperation in 5G, artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge scientific and technological fields can make new contributions to the growth of world economy. This year is "China-Finland Year of Winter Sports". The two sides will carry out nearly 70 activities, including cooperation in the fields of personnel training, equipment manufacturing, site construction, and event organization. In October, Finland will participate in the International Winter Sports Expo in Beijing as the guest of honor. In December, the closing ceremony of the" China-Finland Year of Winter Sports" will be held in Rovaniemi, a tourist resort in northern Finland. These series of activities will provide a great platform for enterprises and sports institutions related to ice and snow sports in China and Finland to promote exchanges and cooperation. It is believed that this will help China achieve the goal of"300 million people joining the ice and snow sports" and help China host the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. Finland, a member of the European Union, has just taken over the EU's rotating presidency since July. We believe that Finland will play a positive role during its rotating presidency to create favorable conditions and lay a solid foundation for the next EU institutions to cooperate with China and participate in the Belt and Road Initiative. Well begun is half done. Next year we will usher in the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Finland. Joint efforts will ensure the future of Sino-Finnish partnership to be even better. The author is Chinese ambassador to Finland.

                Italy, France vow to move in coordinated way after talks on immigration, Libya
            </a>
            <p>
                ROME - Rome and Paris showed a willingness to move in a coordinated way after Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and French President Emmanuel Macron held talks late Wednesday on such key issues as immigration and instability in Libya.Macron was the first European leader to pay a visit to Rome after the formation of Conte's new coalition government of the Five Star Movement and the Democratic Party."Opinions may diverge, but this must always happen within a solution-oriented dialogue based on mutual respect, as it is due between two founding members of the European Union (EU)," Conte told a joint press conference after the meeting.Echoing Conte's remarks, Macron said that "it can happen to quarrel sometimes, but we will always find ourselves in the end."During this visit, the two leaders vowed to move in a coordinated way."It is crucial for the EU to move towards a structural management of migration inflows, instead of (taking) an emergency approach," Conte said."We need to get this topic out of the anti-European propaganda," he said. "We also need to manage the phenomenon in an efficient and realistic way."The prime minister said he had "the full openness of president Macron" on working together for a European mechanism to manage arrivals and distribution of refugees, and for a more efficient repatriations of migrants not entitled to asylum.Italy has long asked EU partners to accept shares of the migrants brought to land by rescued ships operated by humanitarian groups in the Mediterranean."I am sure we can agree on such a European mechanism coordinated by the European Commission," the French president said."This would allow (countries of first arrival such as) Italy or Malta to have the guarantee before the rescue boats arrive that all these people will be taken care of," he said.The two countries' interior ministers will meet next week to follow up on these proposals, according to Macron.On the Libya issue, a topic that Conte's office had anticipated it would be a crucial issue in the talks, the two leaders discussed a common strategy, and in this case not only in the EU framework but also within the United Nations."On Libya, there is a real convergence between France and Italy," Macron told reporters."Rome and Paris have worked together, providing specific messages to our partners, and we are both convinced the only way out for the Libyan crisis has to be found in the dialogue and a political process," he added.
