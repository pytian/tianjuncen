                Next IMF boss must defend open world economy in testing times
            </p>
            <p>
                The appointment of France's Christine Lagarde to head the European Central Bank has created a vacancy at the top of the International Monetary Fund, which was established three-quarters of a century ago as guarantor of global monetary stability.Since the IMF and the World Bank were set up at the end of World War II to establish a cooperative global economic order after the chaos the conflict had wrought, the former has been led by a European and the latter by a United States citizen.That convention reflects the economic and political realities of 1945 when the US and Europe dominated the emerging new world order.There is nothing in the rules, however, to prevent non-Western candidates from taking the top posts. Many have argued that these institutions should cast the net wider to better reflect the realities of the 21st century in which countries such as China now have enormous economic power.There are no indications that the US and Europe are quite ready to relinquish their hold on the two main global financial institutions. This year, the tradition of naming someone from the US to lead the World Bank was maintained with the appointment of former Treasury official David Malpass as its president.As for the vacancy at the IMF, France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has already been quoted as saying the top job there should once again go to a European.Pragmatists would argue that what matters is not where these top officials come from but rather the policies they pursue. The IMF has been widely criticized over the years for pursuing Western interests by imposing austerity on developing countries in return for its fiscal support.In a world in which trade tensions are building and the model of wider globalization is under threat, there is, more than ever, a need for consensus in the top financial institutions, to preserve the benefits of cooperation.Lagarde's leadership of the IMF was viewed positively in Beijing, which supported her candidacy for the post she took up in 2011. She backed the inclusion of the Chinese yuan into the IMF's currency basket, previously made up of dollars, yen, pounds, and euros.Lagarde established a good relationship with Chinese leaders, and was among world leaders who were in Beijing in April to discuss investment opportunities in the Belt and Road Initiative. President Xi Jinping said that, in advancing the BRI, China was applying debt sustainability criteria recommended by the IMF.So what can China and other IMF participants expect of Lagarde's successor, European or not?The key credential of the next IMF chief will be to defend the interests of the new world economic powers while maintaining the trust of the US and Europe. One of the key challenges will be dealing with an irascible and unpredictable White House.Poorer developing countries will need to know that, if economic disaster strikes, the IMF will be there to bail them out without imposing crippling terms.There has been speculation that, given Asia's new role in the global economy, the IMF might break with tradition and appoint a non-Westerner. The New York Times reported that early shortlists for the top job included Singapore's Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Egyptian-American businessman Mohamed El-Erian.The potential European candidates include the Bank of England governor Mark Carney, a Canadian who also has British and Irish citizenship.China already has one of the most senior posts at the IMF, with former People's Bank of China official Zhang Tao serving as its deputy managing director.High on the new IMF chief's agenda will be confronting the impact of President Donald Trump's trade war on China, which Lagarde recently warned threatens global economic growth and which may cost $455 billion in lost output next year.She said there were growing concerns that the most recent US-China tariff s could further reduce investment, productivity and growth and that Trump's threats of tariffs on Mexico were also of concern.The World Bank has been equally gloomy, predicting that increased political uncertainty would push down world growth to 2.6 percent this year, its weakest since 2016."These are self-inflicted wounds that must be avoided," Lagarde said. "How? By removing the recently implemented trade barriers and by avoiding further barriers in whatever form."Any downturn will impact smaller economies as well as large ones, obliging the new IMF chief to deal with emerging crises. The IMF is due to disburse a new tranche of aid to Argentina any day now.At the end of the day, the nationality of the new IMF chief is perhaps the least important thing to consider about Lagarde's successor.As the Financial Times commented: "Far more important than nationality is the ability to do one job above all: to use the fund's weight to defend the open world economy and help sustain global cooperation."Harvey Morris is a senior media consultant for China Daily UK.

                US studies say BRI not a debt trap
            </a>
            <p>
                Two studies released in the past weeks should put to rest the blind accusation that China's infrastructure financing under the Belt and Road Initiative has sucked developing nations into a debt trap.Without providing any evidence, senior US officials, such as Vice-President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John Bolton, made such allegations last year.Deborah Brautigam, a leading authority on China-Africa relations at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, dismissed such accusations in an opinion piece in The New York Times on April 26.In the column, which ran under the headline "Is China the World's Loan Shark?", Brautigam said studies "found scant evidence of a pattern indicating that Chinese banks... are deliberately overlending or funding loss-making projects to secure strategic advantages for China".The Hambantota Port project in Sri Lanka is often cited by critics, but "that's a special case, and it is widely misunderstood," she wrote.Brautigam's opinion piece was based on studies conducted by her China-Africa Research Initiative at the SAIS, which included information on more than 1,000 Chinese loans in Africa between 2000 and 2017, totaling more than $143 billion, as well as a study by Boston University's Global Development Policy Center, which has identified and tracked more than $140 billion in Chinese loans to Latin America and the Caribbean since 2005.Based on the findings, Brautigam concluded that the risks of the BRI are often overstated and mischaracterized.A report on a study by New York-based independent research provider Rhodium Group, published on April 29, also dismissed the debt-trap accusation against China.Based on 40 cases of external debt renegotiation between 2007 and this year in 24 countries, the report said asset seizure was a rare occurrence. More often, China was inclined to renegotiate the debts or write them off, it said.Contrary to accusations that China uses its outsized weight to gain advantage over borrowing nations, the study found that China's leverage in negotiations was limited.The Brookings Institution, a Washington-based nonprofit public policy organization, interviewed a group of its scholars ahead of the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation held in Beijing late last month. None of them accused China of debt-trap diplomacy.Ryan Hass, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former official for China in the Obama administration, said much of the US government's narrative on the BRI has been built around debt-trap diplomacy. He said he is worried that the US government is making an argument that is more persuasive to itself than to others.The fact that the BRI has gained more support around the world, as seen in the recent forum in Beijing, is the best answer to those who might have ulterior motives. So far, more than 120 countries have participated in the initiative.Despite strong US pressure, Italy became the first G7 nation to join the initiative in late March.European Union officials have started to talk about how to align the EU's Connecting Europe with Asia strategy with China's BRI to achieve synergy.In Beijing last week, Philip Hammond, Britain's finance minister, described the BRI as having "tremendous potential to spread prosperity and sustainable development, touching as it does potentially 70 percent of the world's population, a project of truly epic ambition".He offered British expertise on project financing. Indeed, much of China's lending practices in the BRI were learned from Western nations, as well as Japan, which lent to China during the country's reform and opening-up drive in the past four decades.The BRI may not be perfect yet, but its benign intention of boosting economic growth in developing nations by building infrastructure, something China learned from its own experience, should not be questioned.Countries should join the BRI to help make it a greater success instead of trying to undermine it.The author is China Daily EU bureau chief based in Brussels.

                Winning trust will be key to EU-China cooperation
            </a>
            <p>
                In a recent opinion piece, Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador in London, asked if the United Kingdom will choose win-win cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative. The same question can be asked of the European Union.My experience as a former European trade commissioner tells me that, given the current political mood across the continent, Brussels' answer today might be "no." This is despite the fact that Europeans accounted for a third of the political leaders who attended the recent Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing.European parliamentary elections and the forthcoming change of political leadership in EU institutions present an opportunity to reconsider how Brussels and Beijing might engage constructively on trade and investment. Taking the BRI as a specific case study, an EU-China "win-win" situation is possible but will require both Brussels and Beijing to make tough decisions.Despite Italy's recent embrace of the BRI, the EU's stand toward China has hardened in many ways. The recent entry into force of the EU's investment screening framework, and the strengthening of trade defense and retaliation measures, both reflect growing European anxiety about China's economic advance.This shift is likely to continue. Polls predict the center-right European People's Party will win the largest number of seats in the European Parliament. Under the banner of "a Europe that protects", defending Europe's position in global value chains is likely to be at the forefront of future EU policy. As a result, a hardening in positions vis-a-vis Chinese trade and investment is possible.China also faces a big trust deficit with the European public. With a few exceptions, long-term European public opinion toward China has become less favorable. A poll by Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan American fact tank based in Washington, indicates that French and German citizens' favorability of China dropped between 2005 and 2018, falling from 58 percent to 41 percent in France and 46 percent to 39 percent in Germany. This is despite a Chinese investment of $67 billion in the two countries over the same period.Although Beijing may try to seek soft power via BRI investment, these figures suggest investment alone will not win over European hearts and minds.Brussels faces an important choice over how the next EU policy cycle frames relations with China. It could choose to focus on the "strategic rivalry" narrative and look to build European champions via protectionism and the exclusion of Chinese capital and technology.While this may create short-term gains for European industry, it is unlikely to be successful in the long run and would only increase the trust gap between the EU and its second-largest trading partner.A better approach would be for the EU to double down on cooperation with Beijing in areas of mutual interest. This should include collaboration on meaningful World Trade Organization reforms and helping China formalize and institutionalize its commitment to multilateral institutions.One way for the EU to feel more comfortable about an expanding China is to forge a viable and sustainable blocwide policy toward BRI investment. As German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier suggested at the recent BRI forum in Beijing, one approach would be for the EU to participate collectively in the BRI. Getting France, Germany and the other nations to agree on a single BRI position would be an extremely difficult task. That does not mean it is not worth pursuing.Beijing has its own hard work to do if it wants to counter growing skepticism in Europe. Brussels has encouraged Beijing to improve transparency and governance in the process of awarding BRI contracts, and to level the playing field for investors in China, including through reform of State-owned enterprises. Brussels will also be reassured if Beijing can demonstrate it is interested in engaging Europe as a whole, not just select parts - for example by taking up Altmaier's suggestion.Beyond rhetoric, Beijing should take the upcoming reset in EU institutions as an opportunity to show demonstrable commitment to addressing EU concerns.A "win-win" is possible for EU-China trade and investment, but repairing the trust deficit is key to moving forward constructively.The author is chairman of Global Counsel and president of the Great Britain China Centre.

                We should focus on real threats, not illusory ones
            </a>
            <p>
                Stories shape our world. We should choose them based on facts, not fear.We understand the world through stories. Stories can help bridge cultural gaps and connect us with others. They can also mislead and divide.Of late, an age-old narrative has reemerged. It poses a threat to the established international order, dividing the world into "us" versus "them." After the former Soviet Union, Japan and Islam before it, this time China has been cast as an antagonist.According to the "China threat" theory, China's rise represents a danger to the international liberal order. Peddled by certain interests, this story has proved attractive for many in the West.Fortunately, such false narratives can be overcome through examination of the facts.The recent Munk Debate held in Toronto, Canada, which saw a lively discussion in front of 3,000 people on the question, "Is China a threat to the international liberal order?" was an opportunity to clarify some of these myths.The Munk Debate, which brings together public figures with expertise in certain areas to debate different topics, was originally founded by Peter Munk, founder of the largest gold mining operation in the world, and Rudyard Griffiths, a Canadian author and television broadcaster.Joining me in arguing against the "China threat" theory was Kishore Mahbubani, a former Singaporean diplomat. Our debate opponents were former US national security adviser H. R. McMaster and Michael Pillsbury, the American director of the Center on Chinese Strategy at Hudson Institute, a Washington=based think tank.I urged the audience to look at the facts, and examine the three roles that China has been playing in the world today.First, China is a major beneficiary of the international order. Joining international institutions such as the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund and World Bank has helped China to grow rapidly, lifting about 800 million people out of poverty within four decades.Second, China is the second-largest donor to the United Nations. In addition, since 2012, it has provided more peacekeeping troops than all the other four permanent United Nations Security Council members combined.Third, China is the largest trading partner of over 100 countries, which creates major opportunities for foreign exporters and investors, as well as contributing over $120 billion to local economies every year through outbound tourism.On the climate change front, China has helped forge global consensus and is committed to the Paris climate agreement. In contrast, the US has shirked its environmental responsibilities by withdrawing from the accord.China has launched new initiatives to promote globalization and development that have been welcomed by developing and developed nations around the world.A total of 127 countries have signed agreements on the Belt and Road Initiative since its establishment in 2013. The BRI has created nearly 300,000 jobs and reduced trade costs in host countries by up to 2.8 percent, according to the World Bank.On the other hand, the "China threat" narrative ignores how China contributes to the international order while providing immense opportunities for the global community.It fails to capture the deeply interconnected nature of our global society, one knit together by the flow of people, goods, capital and ideas.In the globalized world, the real threats to global peace and prosperity are transnational and emergent. Examples include risks relating to the environment, rapid technological disruption and diseases.To confront these challenges, we must abandon false narratives and craft new stories that foster common goals and cooperation. Different cultures and civilizations should be given space to coexist and work together.Changes will not happen overnight, but transparency and open debate can help.Moving forward, I hope the stories through which we frame the world will be based on facts and not fears. Instead of an illusory "China threat", we should focus on real threats that we are now facing.The author is founder and president of the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing-based think tank.

                'America First' won't 'last long'
            </a>
            <p>
                European Parliament member slams Trump's aggressive trade policiesUS President Donald Trump's "America First" foreign policy tilt won't last long because it is inconsistent with a multilateral order that has given stability and prosperity to the world for more than 70 years, according to the chairman of the EU-China Friendship Group in the European Parliament."I don't think America First will last long," said Nirj Deva. "More countries need to embrace the multilateral system. I'm pleased to see that China has embraced the multilateral order and is not trying to create something separate," he said.Deva stressed that what the United States is doing, with its aggressive trade policies against major trading partners including China, is a "technique" that the US has used many times to restrain rivals."The Americans take any competition and any threat very seriously and do all sorts of things to stop the success of imports. So this is not just China today, it is a technique that America has used many times, for example, on steel from Britain, aluminum, Toyota cars and now Huawei," he said.From his perspective, trade tensions between the US and China are caused by US over protection of trade. In response to US moves, China has stood loyal to a multilateral system and promotes its Belt and Road Initiative, hoping for a future of shared prosperity among different nations of the world.Deva praised the Belt and Road Initiative, and suggested it could form the basis for the EU to establish an "extraordinary" partnership with China. "The BRI will create a huge market not only for China, but also for the EU," he said."The EU could be the provider of education, technology, great universities, where both European languages and Chinese languages could meet," he said. He noted that the EU has a very well-developed tertiary economy, with insurance and healthcare, while China has built a huge and sophisticated manufacturing and modern technology economy that can benefit from these EU services."This kind of partnership will bring a win-win situation for both and prosperity for millions and millions of people," he added.Having worked closely with China for more than 10 years, Deva has striven to promote understanding in the European Parliament and notes the major changes the nation has been through in a short time."I think China has behaved extremely well both internally and on the global stage. China has not only removed 700 million people from poverty in China itself, but has worked hard over the last 20 years to remove poverty from Africa by building infrastructure projects. Today the African continent is the fastest growing region in the world."The EU-China Friendship Group was established in December 2006, and is dedicated to promoting a greater understanding of China so as to create an environment conducive to enhance EU-China relations and cooperation at the EU decision-making level. It is the largest parliamentary friendship group and has organized more than 10 delegation visits to China.

                'Deeper policy reforms' of BRI to help tap regional economic potential: World Bank
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - "Deeper policy reforms" of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will help the mechanism boost trade among nations in the region and increase global real income, a study published Tuesday by the World Bank has found.Such reforms should be designed to "increase transparency, expand trade, improve debt sustainability, and mitigate environmental, social, and corruption risks," said the study done by a team of World Bank economists led by Michele Ruta, lead economist in the macroeconomics, trade and investment global practice of the World Bank Group.If those reform measures are fully implemented, the BRI could increase global trade by up to 6.2 percent, and up to 9.7 percent for what the study referred to as "corridor economies" -- a group of 71 economies, most of which signed collaboration agreements with China under the BRI framework.Through lowering trade costs, the initiative could lift 32 million people -- those who live on less than $3.2 a day -- out of moderate poverty, the study said.Global income could increase by as much as 2.9 percent, and foreign direct investment (FDI) for low-income corridor economies could rise by as much as 7.6 percent, according to the study.Right now, trade in corridor economies is estimated to be 30 percent below potential, and 70 percent of FDI in those economies has yet to be fully tapped, the study said."Real incomes for corridor economies could be an estimated two to four times larger if they implement reforms to reduce border delays and ease trade restrictions," it added.Ceyla Pazarbasioglu, the World Bank's vice-president for equitable growth, finance, and institutions, called for "ambitious reforms from participating countries" of the BRI so as to ensure its success, said a press release issued by the international financial institution."Improvements in data reporting and transparency -- especially around debt -- open government procurement, and adherence to the highest social and environmental standards will help significantly," Pazarbasioglu said.

                Belt and Road countries have huge solar energy potential: study
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON -- An international team led by Chinese researchers found that tapping solar energy and improving cross-border cooperation could help countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) leapfrog into a low-carbon future.The study published on Thursday in the journal Joule made for the first time a quantifiable estimate of the renewable energy potential in BRI countries, revealing that less than four percent of the region's maximum solar potential could meet its electricity demand for 2030.The researchers from Tsinghua University, Harvard University and other institutions selected 66 BRI countries that are connected geographically and they identified areas with sufficient solar radiation and lower land value, with places like forests and agriculture being excluded.Then they computed the spacing and packing density of solar panels to calculate maximized power yields for each area. Finally, they estimated the energy output in each hour after accounting for shading and temperature.The team found that those countries can generate as much as 448.9 petawatt hour of solar energy, about 41 times the demand for electricity in those countries in 2016.Also, the 2030 electricity demand for those countries could be met by converting only 3.7 percent of the region's solar energy and it would require an investment of $11.2 trillion and a land area of 88,426 square kilometers to achieve the goal, according to the study.The infrastructure building in BRI areas is rather energy-intensive and to rely solely on fossil fuels could bring substantial carbon dioxide for the next few decades, according to the paper's corresponding author Lu Xi at Tsinghua University."This is not sustainable. If we want to achieve the emission reduction goal set by the Paris Agreement, we need renewable energy," said Lu.The study also showed that countries with more than 70 percent of the energy potential consume only about 30 percent of regional electricity, which makes the cross-border power transmission grids and therefore international cooperation necessary.As BRI countries span multiple time zones and various climate conditions, the cross-border grids could help reduce the impact when sunlight isn't available in certain areas, according to the researchers."The BRI is an opportunity as it sets up a framework for collaborations between countries, associations, and industries to happen. There are also funds and banks committed to promoting green development of the BRI, which provides financial support," said Lu.a

                China helping world to create shared future
            </a>
            <p>
                President Xi's Thought on Diplomacy has opened new vistas, achieved new progress Editor's note: Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy is the fundamental guideline for China's diplomatic work in the new era. China Daily is publishing a series of stories to examine how Xi's proposals have become internationally accepted and made great contributions to world peace and human progress. When Brenda Kazule returned to Zambia after completing her master's degree at the Institute of South-South Cooperation and Development at Peking University in June of last year, she had a thick book in her unwieldy baggage. Kazule, a traditional-affairs officer from Muchinga province, said the book - Xi Jinping: The Governance of China - is important to her because it gave her insights about China's development as well as the governance of the world's most populous country by the Communist Party of China, and she wanted to share it with her colleagues. Since Xi Jinping was elected as general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee in November 2012 and president of China in March 2013, the country's diplomacy has opened new prospects and achieved new progress. The book is a collection of several dozen speeches and essays by Xi on a variety of topics. It interprets the concepts and principles of the top CPC leadership's governance and also helps foreign people better understand China's development path, its domestic and foreign policies and responses to international concerns about the country. Kazule said what impressed her most about the book was the country's targeted poverty-reduction policy and Xi's vision on building a community with a shared future for mankind. If poverty alleviation efforts aim to solve a problem in China, the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind paints a picture of the whole world working together for common development and prosperity - as in a global village, where all countries have a common destiny, she said. "China continues to promote the exchange and sharing of China's experience in development-oriented poverty alleviation in an effort to join other countries in implementing the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and building a community with a shared future for mankind, where people are freed from poverty and can achieve common development," Kazule added. When Xi visited the United Nations Office in Geneva in January 2017, he delivered a keynote speech, Work Together to Build a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind. In the speech, he called for building an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity, and he explained how countries can build such a community. The vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind, together with the idea of building a new type of international relations featuring fairness, justice and win-win cooperation, is the overarching goal of the nation's major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics. Li Xiangyang, president of the National Institute of International Strategy at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said there remains an insufficient level of democracy in the existing global governance system, and Xi's vision tries to provide a solution to problems in existing multilateral mechanisms. At a time when the international system is challenged by unilateralism and protectionism, there is an urgent need to improve the global governance system based on the principle of joint contributions for benefits shared by all, Li said, adding that Xi's vision serves as guidance for that purpose. The vision sees countries forging partnerships in which they treat each other as equals and engage in mutual consultation and understanding, and create a security architecture that features fairness, justice, joint contribution and shared benefit. In addition, the vision calls on countries to promote open, innovative and inclusive development that benefits all, increase exchanges between civilizations to enhance harmony, inclusiveness and respect of differences, and build an ecosystem that puts nature and green development first. "These five aspects, taken together, constitute the overall approach to creating a community with a shared future for mankind, depict a bright future for the progress of international relations and represent a major innovation in the theory of major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics," wrote Wang Yi, state councilor and foreign minister, in an article posted on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Over the years since Xi proposed the vision in 2013, China has been working to find ways to make it happen. Even as a "zero-sum game" mindset and "winner-takes-all" strategies prevail, China is showing the world that the real story of business is not black or white, and win-win results can be realized. As some Western countries move backward by erecting "walls", China is working hard to build "bridges" by promoting multilateralism for open and inclusive development, analysts said. Jin Canrong, a professor of international studies at Renmin University of China, wrote in an article that common development, universal security and shared governance are key elements of the new type of international relations, while a community with a shared future calls for equality, mutual respect, mutual benefit and win-win cooperation among nations. The Belt and Road Initiative has been a platform for building the community with a shared future for mankind and also a new path to improve global governance and increase mutual understanding between different civilizations. By the end of July, 136 countries and 30 international organizations had signed cooperation agreements with China on jointly building the Belt and Road. Miguel Angel Sanchez, general secretary of the Colombian Liberal Party, said the strategic purpose of the BRI is to align with China's development strategy, with participating countries achieving high-level, high-quality cooperation so as to improve people's livelihoods. It does not mean building an independent bloc with China at its center, but rather, it aims to secure common development while respecting cultural diversities, Sanchez added. China has made it clear that it strives to develop by upholding and maintaining world peace through its development. Xi has said on a number of occasions that China will do well only when the world does well, and vice versa. Simon J. Gill, United Seychelles Party whip and National Executive Committee member, said Xi's strategic vision represents an advanced power, as it focuses on people-centered development. China doesn't care only about itself, and it adopts a win-win approach that delivers tangible benefits to countries, Gill said, adding that Seychelles is also a beneficiary of cooperation with China. Analyzing the international situation, Xi has said the world is undergoing complex and profound changes unseen in a century as the trend toward multipolarity and economic globalization is surging and a new round of scientific and industrial revolution is in the making, with information technology applications continuing to make progress. Meanwhile, he said, global economic growth is sluggish, the development gap is widening, armed conflicts occur from time to time, a Cold War mentality and power politics still exist and nonconventional security threats - particularly terrorism, refugee crises, major communicable diseases and climate change - are spreading. Musa Emmanuel Umar, senior fellow at Nigeria's National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, said Xi's vision presents a road map for the international community to deal with challenges the world is facing. Xi has emphasized the importance of exchanges and mutual learning among different civilizations in building a community with a shared future by citing the ancient Chinese wisdom of "harmony without uniformity". During Xi's visit to France in March, French President Emmanuel Macron presented him with an original copy in French of An Introduction to the Analects of Confucius, which was published in 1688, as a national gift. It testified to the long-standing cultural bonds between the two nations, which lay a solid foundation for people to deepen their relationships. Boris Shmelev, director of the Russian Foreign Center at the Institute of Economics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said Xi's vision presents an opportunity to counter negative factors in international relations, particularly those arising from Washington's "America First" policy. China emphasizes the importance of upholding international law, and Russia supports its foreign policy, Shmelev said. caodesheng@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 08/20/2019 page1)
