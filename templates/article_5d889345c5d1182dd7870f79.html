                Chinese tourists key to sustainable development of South Pacific's tourism industry: tourism official
            </p>

                The Chinese tourists are not only very important for the world tourism industry, but also the key to the sustainable development of tourism industry of the South Pacific island nations in the coming years, said a South Pacific region's tourism official on Saturday."Tourism is, in fact, a key driver of the world economic growth. China now is not only the fastest growing tourism source market for the world, but also for the South Pacific region. We warmly welcome more Chinese tourists and hope they can help us maintain the sustainable development of our region's tourism industry," Chris Cocker, CEO of the Suva-based South Pacific Tourism Organization (SPTO) said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua on the sidelines of the two-day China-Fiji tourism symposium which is being held in Nadi, Fiji's third largest city.Cocker voiced his satisfaction with the Chinese outbound market as a potential source market to offset the decline of visitor arrivals from the region's traditional source markets."There are a growing number of Pacific countries, including SPTO members, exploring the Chinese outbound market as a potential source market to offset the decline of visitor arrivals from our traditional source markets, such as Australia. In contrast, China's market share rose dramatically to 7 percent in 2017 from only 3 percent in 2013," he said."Over the last five years, Chinese arrivals to Pacific island countries (PICs) grew by an average of 13.36 percent, increasing from 88,708 in 2014 to 153,119 in 2015, the peak year ... in 2019 Chinese arrivals to PICs is forecast to rebound ..."Similarly, in terms of shares, Chinese arrivals to PICs recorded a share of 4.9 percent in 2014 before making a significant increase to 8.1 percent in 2015, the peak year, before declining to a share of 5.9 percent in 2018, he added.Described as "a milestone in the tourism cooperation between China and the South Pacific region," Cocker said that the China-Pacific Tourism Year 2019, which was launched in Apia, Samoa in April this year, means a lot for the region as this will surely benefit the region which is keen to attract more Chinese tourists.According to Cocker, the tourism industries in China and the South Pacific region have been working together to make the vision of the tourism year a reality.The Pacific tourism industry is currently working on programs to be "China Ready," and the focus is to sustainably develop and promote the Pacific to niche Chinese outbound market segments who wish to experience the region's beautiful islands, unique cultures and the healthy, organic food experience of the region."Since the official launch of the China-Pacific Tourism Year 2019, our members have been holding workshops and orientation activities at the country level for their respective tourism industry members on how they can cater for the Chinese market. This will help them make the anticipated Chinese market enjoy what the region has to offer," he said.In addition to this, he continued, they had two exchange visits in June and July this year. The first was by a delegation of staff from the Pacific national tourism offices and the SPTO who were in Guangzhou, China's Guangdong Province from June 25 to July 4 to attend the tourism human resource development and training program."They participated in field visits, exchanging views with their counterparts in China and also attended sessions on tourism development, and this broadened the participants' understanding of China and the Chinese market that we are trying to attract to the Pacific."Cocker is optimistic about the prospect of the tourism cooperation between China and the region, believing that China's Belt and Roald Initiative (BRI) will help lift the tourism cooperation to a new level."SPTO welcomes this cooperation with China. We are confident that the tourism year will encourage visitors from China who want to experience the unique Pacific cultural diversity, pristine environments and hospitality of the Pacific peoples. We are very happy to see that in the first quarter of this year, the Pacific region has recorded 30,923 (Chinese) visitors. The outlook for 2019 looks positive, with Chinese tourists arrivals expected to increase by 4 percent," he said."Building on the positive momentum of the tourism year, we are ready to work with China to further unlock the potential of cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative, promote mutual visits, and enhance the understanding and friendship between our peoples," he said."I want to say something to the Chinese tourists: the Pacific region has good relationships with China. We are getting ready to welcome you with an open arm. Come to enjoy our unique culture and have a different and unforgettable experience."Founded in 1983 as an intergovernmental organisation for the tourism sector in the South Pacific, SPTO markets, promotes and develops tourism in the region in overseas markets.

                    Chinese farmers' paintings exhibition held in Fiji
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The Chinese farmers' paintings exhibition kicked off on Wednesday in Suva, capital of Fiji, winning praise from both Fijian and Chinese guests.During a grand opening ceremony held in the China Cultural Center, Chinese Ambassador Qian Bo said China and Fiji have developed a good relationship for many years and received fruitful achievements of bilateral cooperation in various fields. The cultural exchange programs increase the understanding and friendship between the two peoples.Under the guidance of building a community with a shared future for mankind and the Belt and Road Initiative featured with mutual respect and common development, China and Fiji are supposed to assume a long-term perspective to explore more cooperation opportunities, the ambassador said.For her part, Fiji's Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts Rosy Akbar praised the works of Chinese farmers, saying that "it provides us the opportunity to understand each our respective cultures, to share similarities and appreciate differences, and to strengthen the strong bond between the Fijian and the Chinese people."Deng Xianfu, director of the China Cultural Center in Fiji, said the 40 pieces of Chinese farmers' paintings are inspired by the water town of Xiuzhou, Jiaxing of Zhejiang Province. Each work captures the economic prosperity, the rich material civilization, and the colourful folk culture of people from the region."We hope that with the two-way cultural exchange, both Chinese and Fijian people can understand each other better and deepen the friendship between us," he said.Miao Huixin, one of the farmer artists, told Xinhua that it is the first time for him to show such paintings in South Pacific island nations like Fiji."I am very glad that I, along with my colleagues, can do something to promote the mutual understanding between the two peoples through our works. I believe that the exhibition can provide a wonderful opportunity for Fijian and Chinese artists and people to exchange ideas and appreciate Chinese folk art."The 15-day Romance of Soil exhibition is organized by the China Cultural Center in Fiji and China Arts and Entertainment Group Ltd.

                Reports early last month that foundations run by mobile payments app Alipay and two Alibaba co-founders would give 1 billion yuan ($144 million) to the Chinese women's soccer team over 10 years inspired a trip away from Beijing at the weekend.That's because another Chinese women's team - the one that plays rugby - was taking on Kazakhstan in Qian'an, in Tangshan, Hebei province, for the right to contest next year's Asian championship with Japan and Hong Kong.The link is that World Rugby, the body that runs the sport, admitted recently that a three-year-old deal that would have seen Alisports pump $100 million into rugby's development in China - also over a decade - had foundered.
