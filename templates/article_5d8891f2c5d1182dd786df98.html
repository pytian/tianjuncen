            </p>
            <p>
                Premier Li Keqiang's trip to Russia next week is expected to further expand pragmatic bilateral cooperation and voice the two countries' common stance and wisdom on global governance and building an open world economy, a senior official said. Li will pay an official visit to Russia from Monday to Sept 18 and attend the 24th China-Russia Prime Ministers' Regular Meeting, the Foreign Ministry announced on Monday. This year's meeting marks the first of its kind since China-Russia ties were upgraded to a comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era in June. The meeting will play an important and positive role in delivering new outcomes in bilateral cooperation, said Le Yucheng, vice-foreign minister. Le spoke at a briefing on Monday.
