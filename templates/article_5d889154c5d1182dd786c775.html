                Xi urges higher-level Asia-Pacific cooperation as mankind at historical crossroads
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                PORT MORESBY - Chinese President Xi Jinping called on Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies to bring their cooperation to a higher level based on a keen appreciation of the trend of the world and its economy.Underlining the trend of economic globalization, economic integration in the region, and an open economy, Xi urged the economies to keep the momentum of Asia-Pacific cooperation during a speech at the 26th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting hosted by Papua New Guinea (PNG) Prime Minister Peter O'Neill here on Sunday.CHARTING COURSE"Our world is undergoing rapid development and changes," Xi said at the meeting under the theme Harnessing Inclusive Opportunities, Embracing the Digital Future."We have reached a crossroads of history, when we must have a keen appreciation of the trend of our world and take the pulse of the world economy," he said, "That is how we will be able to respond to the call of our time and chart our future course accordingly."Firstly, the economies need to advance economic integration in the region so as to build an open economy in the Asia-Pacific, the Chinese president said."We should continue to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation," he said.He called on the economies to adopt an open, inclusive and transparent approach to the various kinds of free trade arrangements to ensure coordinated and positive interactions among them."We need to firmly uphold the rules-based multilateral trading system and say no to protectionism," he said.The World Trade Organization (WTO) is exploring a new round of reform, Xi noted, saying such reform should be designed to uphold the core values and underlying principles of the multilateral trading system."What we need is to make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all," he said.Secondly, Xi highlighted the need to pursue innovation-driven growth and foster new growth drivers.He called on the economies to fully implement the Internet and Digital Economy Roadmap in a balanced way, so as to unleash the growth potential of digital economy."We need to promote the building of digital infrastructure and capacity, make digital economy more accessible and bridge the digital divide," he said."Our goal should be for the benefits of digital economy to reach all member economies at different stages of development and for the people of the Asia-Pacific to get aboard the fast train of a growing digital economy," he said.Thirdly, Xi urged APEC members to improve the connectivity network to promote inclusive and interconnected development.Noting that efforts are required to turn their connectivity blueprint into reality, the Chinese president encouraged the APEC economies to take the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as a guide and adopt more concrete steps to make development more balanced, growth more sustainable, opportunities more equal and societies more inclusive.Fourthly, Xi called on APEC members to forge a closer partnership and jointly meet common challenges.He said it is important for the APEC economies to stay committed to the shared goal of common development and explore solutions to common challenges."We need to respect diversity and each other's choices of development path, promote integration and mutual learning on the basis of openness and inclusiveness, and engage in both healthy competition and mutually beneficial cooperation," he said, stressing the importance of jointly building a community with a shared future in the Asia-Pacific.CHINA'S COMMITMENTThis year marks the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up initiative, Xi said, adding that his country will pursue with resolve continued reform across the board.China will continue to pursue its fundamental policy of opening-up, he added.China follows a people-centered development philosophy and a new development vision that features innovative, coordinated, green and open development for the benefit of all, he said.The overall momentum of sustained and sound growth of China's economy will continue, he said.China seeks deeper cooperation on digital economy with other members of the Asia-Pacific so as to expand convergence of interests and create more growth areas, thus adding strong and fresh impetus to the Asia-Pacific economy, he said.China will work with all countries involved under the principle of consultation and collaboration for shared benefits to pursue the Belt and Road Initiative against high standards so that it will create even greater development opportunities for the people in the Asia-Pacific and beyond, he said.Xi said leaders of the Asia-Pacific share a common responsibility to chart the long-term development course for APEC and draw up a post-2020 vision.China is a champion of Asia-Pacific cooperation and has taken concrete steps to promote cooperation on the ground, Xi said.Close cooperation with other members of the Asia-Pacific is indispensable for China's development, while China's development, on its part, offers broad opportunities of development for the Asia-Pacific, he said.Xi pledged that China will stay deeply engaged in the Asia-Pacific cooperation process, deepen practical cooperation with other parties involved, and make new contribution to the development and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region.UPHOLDING MULTILATERALISMLeaders of the APEC economies agreed that the Asia-Pacific economy has bright prospect but is also facing challenges of trade barriers and protectionism.Under current circumstances, all participating sides should staunchly protect multilateralism and a multilateral trading system, stand against protectionism, and support APEC in playing an important role in facilitating trade and investment liberalization and realizing a balanced, innovative, sustainable and inclusive growth, the leaders said.Calling for advancing the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) and jointly building a vibrant and open Asia-Pacific, the leaders urged all sides to press ahead the work on drawing up a post-2020 vision and popularize the achievements of digitalization and innovation in all member economies.Earlier in the day, Xi and other APEC leaders also attended an informal dialogue on world economic situation and were briefed by chief of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde.The Chinese president arrived here Thursday to pay a state visit to PNG and attend the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting.PNG is the first stop of Xi's ongoing Asia-Pacific tour, which will also take him to Brunei and the Philippines.

                    President Xi calls for inclusive, rule-based world economy

                Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed the importance of building an open, inclusive, innovative and rule-based world economy while addressing the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit here on Saturday.In a keynote speech to the business leaders, Xi urged the international community to hold on to the right direction of world economy and work out an efficient global governance system.SAME SHIP"As we brave the rough waters of the global economy and confront the many risks and challenges, it is all too befitting that we have come together on this ship to chart the course for future development and cooperation," Xi said on board cruise ship Pacific Explorer in the Papua New Guinea (PNG) capital of Port Moresby, where the summit was held.While achieving its own development, China will make greater contributions to helping countries around the world realize shared prosperity, Xi said.In April next year, China will host the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing, the Chinese president announced, adding that the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a major and transparent initiative with which China shares opportunities and pursues common development with the rest of the world."Mankind has once again reached a crossroads," he said. "Which direction should we choose? Cooperation or confrontation? Openness or closing one's door? Win-win progress or a zero-sum game? The interests of all countries and indeed, the future of mankind hinge on the choice we make."Recalling the establishment of APEC, Xi said its birth and growth echoed the historical trend of openness and integration, the region's fervent desire for development and the people's need to meet challenges through cooperation.Today's Asia-Pacific has the world's most dynamic and promising economy, which is recognized as a key engine driving global growth, he said."The world today is going through major development, transformation and change. While economic globalization surges forward, global growth is shadowed by protectionism and unilateralism," said the Chinese president.A new revolution in science, technology and industry is in the making; but old driving forces are yet to be replaced by new ones, Xi said.

                BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN - China and Brunei on Monday agreed to upgrade their relations to a strategic cooperative partnership.The two countries also pledged to be good partners featuring mutual trust in politics, mutual benefit in economy, mutual understanding in people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and mutual assistance in multilateral affairs.The consensus was reached during talks between visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping and Brunei's Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah."The decision made by our two sides to establish a strategic cooperative partnership is to ... deliver greater benefits to our two peoples through our cooperation," Xi said.Xi arrived here on Sunday for a state visit to Brunei, the first by a Chinese head of state in 13 years to the Southeast Asian nation.During the talks, Xi expressed high appreciation to the Sultan for the great importance he has long attached to developing the China-Brunei relations.The Chinese president said he was deeply impressed by the warmth and hospitality of the Bruneian people on his first visit to the country, which Xi said vividly testifies to the profound friendship between the two peoples.Xi praised the bilateral ties, saying that China and Brunei enjoy a long and deep historical and cultural link, and are close neighbors across the sea as well as friends and partners who trust each other.During the talks, Xi called on the two sides to increase high-level exchanges to well steer the vessel of bilateral relations.China appreciates Brunei's firm adherence to the one-China policy and will continue to support Brunei in pursuing a development path that suits its own national conditions, Xi said.China sees Brunei as an important partner for cooperation in building the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and is willing to align the Belt and Road Initiative with Brunei's Wawasan 2035, a strategy for economic diversification, in a bid to boost the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries, he said.

                    Smaller nations beat back diseases
                </p>
            </a>

                Smaller African countries have a greater commitment than their richer continental counterparts to fighting Neglected Tropical Diseases, or NTDs, according to the Uniting to Combat NTDs, a nongovernmental organization.The NTDs, which can stunt growth in children, thrive in communities without access to clean water and inadequate sewage systems. The five common diseases are blinding trachoma, intestinal worms, mosquito-borne elephantiasis, snail-borne bilharzia and river blindness.NTD infections afflict more than 1.6 billion poor and marginalized people in the world and are a consequence of environmental and socioeconomic conditions, according to the World Health Organization. One in five people in the world, including over 600 million people in Africa, are infected.To increase the number of Africans accessing treatment, governments need to expand infrastructure such as roads and water and sanitation to create a safer and cleaner environment. More investments, using domestic mobilized resources, are also needed to boost local strategies.A new ranking released by the lobby group showed that Eswatini, Malawi, Mali, Sierra Leone and Togo are recording higher treatment levels for the five diseases when compared to the larger economies of Botswana and South Africa.Thoko Elphick-Pooley, director of Uniting to Combat NTDs, said the success came from commitment and leadership.Elphick-Pooley said free provision of drugs by international pharmaceutical companies to prevent and cure the NTDs has been one of the most effective strategies. "More than $17 billion worth of drugs have been committed by the companies since 2012, allowing governments, partners and communities involved in distributing and administering the drugs to deliver them at a cost of just 50 US cents per treatment per person," she said.Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, is a small, landlocked monarchy in southern Africa with 1.4 million people.While the number of people in need of treatment is much smaller than in Nigeria, Eswatini scored highly because of its commitment to reach every individual in need of treatment, according to the report.Richer countries with a higher UN Human Development Index, such as South Africa and Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Botswana all ranked low in the NGO's table. Botswana looks to change its rankings by pledging to mobilize its domestic resources and allocate $6 million to fight NTDs.South Africa, with the third-largest economy in the continent, performed dismally and was among 14 countries in the bottom of the league table whose performance was deemed not to be on track.This puts in doubt the progress of the continent in achieving the UN sustainable development goals, which aim at eliminating NTD epidemics by 2030.
