                New satellite terminal at Pudong opens
            </p>
            <p>
                The structure, world's largest, will help Shanghai handle 80 million passengersThe addition of a new satellite terminal to Shanghai Pudong International Airport is set to greatly help air passengers and improve transfer efficiency at one of the world's busiest aviation hubs, said officials from the Shanghai Airport Authority.The structure - the world's largest satellite terminal building - became operational on Monday. It is located in the south of the airport's existing terminal 1 and terminal 2.The 620,000-square-meter terminal, with 90 boarding bridges, is expected to handle 60 to 70 percent of the airport's total flights.Passengers departing from the new structure check in at the two older terminal buildings and then take a two-and-a-half minute subway ride to the new facility."It will greatly enhance the airport's boarding efficiency," said Hu Zhihong, general manager of Shanghai Pudong International Airport. "Only about 10 percent of passengers, down from 50 percent before the use of the terminal, will need to take shuttle buses."Ye Yuquan, deputy general manager with China Eastern Airlines' ground service division, said only about 35 percent of China Eastern's flights at the Pudong International Airport could be accessed via boarding bridges before."The new satellite terminal is expected to increase that figure to 100 percent," Ye said.Italian passenger Andrea Angelici was one of the passengers who took the first international flight from the new terminal to Rome, Italy."It is one of the best I have visited until now," he said.Shanghai's two airports had become overburdened with passengers and cargo in recent years. Together, they handled nearly 118 million passengers in 2018, making Shanghai the world's fourth busiest aviation hub after London, New York and Tokyo.With the new terminal, Pudong will be able to handle 80 million passengers annually, said Guo Jianxiang, vice-president of East China Architectural Design & Research Institute, who led a more than 100-member design team for the satellite terminal project since 2014.Shanghai's two airports are now operating four terminals along with the new satellite terminal, six runways, five cargo areas and a total of 435 parking stands, allowing the city to handle 120 million passenger trips and 5.2 million tons of cargo per year, said Xie Feng, head of the Shanghai Transport Commission.The H-shaped satellite terminal is a function-centered building with practical use and customer experience as its priority. "At the same time, it's a mix of both local and international," added Guo.The terminal provides more than 28,000 square meters of commercial space, of which nearly 10,000 square meters comprises the duty-free zone.The satellite terminal is also a world-class green terminal that will help save 9.95 million kilowatt-hour of power and 216,000 tons of water, reduce vehicle fuel consumption of 1,623 tons and 39,000 tons of aircraft fuel, and cut carbon dioxide by 115,000 tons per year, according to Feng Xin, president of Shanghai Airport Authority.According to Xie, the Yangtze River Delta region airports cluster master plan is still awaiting the central government's decision, but Shanghai will strive to enhance the development of Shanghai international aviation hub together with airports in cities, including Nanjing of Jiangsu province, Hangzhou of Zhejiang province, Hefei of Anhui province, Nantong of Jiangsu province and Ningbo of Zhejiang province."The development of city clusters in the Yangtze River Delta region requires the support of a comprehensive transportation system of air, rail, road and even water, both for passenger and cargo transportation," said Xie.As the designer of many airports in the Yangtze River Delta region of Shanghai, Nanjing, Yancheng and Yangzhou of Jiangsu province, Hangzhou, Ningbo and Wenzhou of Zhejiang province, as well as the Belt and Road Initiative of Urumqi in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Guo said it is extremely important for coordination of the plans."In the future, Yangtze River Delta will be connected to a huge comprehensive transportation network. Therefore, it is extremely important for all the transportation solutions to collaborate with each other at high efficiency," said Guo.wang_ying@chinadaily.com.cn(China Daily Global 09/18/2019 page3)

                Silk expo held in Nanchong
            </a>
            <p>
                The 2019 Western China Silk Expo opened in Nanchong, Sichuan province, on Tuesday.More than 200 silk enterprises, including those from Italy, the United Kingdom, France and Pakistan, were invited to the event, according to expo organizers.Under the theme "New Era, New Silk Road, New Future," the six-day event consists of one themed exhibition, three major activities and five special activities.The themed exhibition, held at the city's science and technology museum, has five pavilions covering 10,000 square meters. The pavilions display a variety of silk products, silk-related culture and tourism, as well as the culture and products from Nanchong and its neighboring cities, cities related to silk, and those along the ancient Silk Road.The three major activities focus on the opening ceremony and project signing ceremony, the 10th C21 Forum, and the China Cocoon and Silk Industry Development Summit.During the opening and project signing ceremony held on Tuesday morning, 30 deals worth 31.54 billion yuan ($4.45 billion) were signed. A further 100 major projects with a total investment of 287.4 billion yuan were also introduced at the ceremony.The five special activities include a model contest, a silk garments design competition, an industry development conference on mulberry leaf tea, a silk garment experience activity and a summit on the Silk Road themed tourism.It is believed that 5,000 years ago, the ancestors of Nanchong began to plant mulberry trees, raise silkworms and weave silk fabric along the Jialing River. The city quickly became an important source of silk products along the ancient Silk Road.After the foundation of the People's Republic of China, the city's silk industry entered a period of rapid growth. In the early years of the Republic, 80 percent of residents in Nanchong worked in silk-related industries.Today, Nanchong has formed a modernised industrial chain consisting of raw material supply, sericulture, silk reeling, weaving, product research and development, garment processing and export trade. There are 72 silk and garment enterprises in the city, providing jobs for more than 30,000 people.Local officials said the city has set up a plan to develop the silk and garment industry into one of its five pillar industries, with the annual output value surpassing 100 billion yuan, to help build Nanchong into an economic sub-center of Sichuan and a world-class silk tourism city.Peng Chao contributed to the story.

                Ter Stegen saves penalty as Barcelona draws 0-0 at Dortmund
            </a>
            <p>
                DORTMUND, Germany — Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen saved a second-half penalty as the Spanish giant began its Champions League campaign by drawing 0-0 at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday.Lionel Messi came on as a substitute for the last 30 minutes for his first appearance of the season but was unable to spark the visitors' struggling attack, with Dortmund creating the best chances of the game.Ter Stegen saved a penalty from Dortmund captain Marco Reus in the 57th and denied the home side with a string of saves on his return to his native Germany.Dortmund substitute Julian Brandt struck the crossbar and Paco Alcácer also went close against his former side. It was the first game in which the Spanish striker failed to score this season.The 16-year-old Ansu Fati made his Champions League debut to become Barcelona's youngest player in a UEFA competition, before coming off for Messi in the 59th. Messi hadn't played since injuring his leg in pre-season.Slavia Prague held Inter Milan 1-1 after conceding a late equalizer in the other Group F game in Italy.Defender Mats Hummels showed why Dortmund brought him back from Bayern Munich with several vital interventions, starting with a block to deny Antoine Griezmann's first effort for Barcelona, then a crucial headed clearance from the lurking Luis Suárez. Griezmann, on his Champions League debut for Barcelona, produced the cross.Dortmund's first big chance fell to Reus, who was denied for the first time by ter Stegen in the 25th. Jadon Sancho also missed a good opportunity.A Barcelona corner caused chaos in the Dortmund defense, with Roman Bürki punching the ball clear and Fati's effort from the rebound deflected over by Reus.Dortmund was more aggressive after the break but ultimately couldn't get past ter Stegen. Messi, meanwhile, looked far from his best and the home fans cheered loudly when he was crowded off the ball by three defenders as the Argentine failed to make an impact.More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Ciarán Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cfaheyAP

                Controversial Da Vinci exhibition attracts many visitors
            </a>
            <p>
                As the world's art mecca, the Louvre in Paris, is bracing for its October Leonardo da Vinci extravaganza, a recently-opened Da Vinci show in Beijing has already successfully stolen the limelight amid the global celebrations of the fifth centenary of the Renaissance master's death.Leonardo and his Outstanding Circle, hosted by the Art Museum of Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA), was shrouded in doubts and criticism even before its opening on Thursday.The show, putting the spotlight on the Leonardeschi, the Leonardo School, presents 30 paintings from personal collections that are said to be created by the Renaissance titan, his disciples and followers.Four of the showpieces, including Lucan Portrait of Leonardo da Vinci and Mary Magdalene, can be attributed to the Renaissance genius. Such is the belief held by Nicola Barbatelli, an Italian art historian and the exhibit's curator.
