                Netanyahu's challenger claims victory in Israeli elections
            </p>
            <p>
                JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's main rival, centrist Benny Gantz, claimed on Thursday victory in the closely-fought parliamentary elections.In a broadcast statement on Israel's main TV channels, he called on Netanyahu to join him to a "broad, liberal unity government under my leadership".He rejected Netanyahu's earlier call to form a unity government with Gantz' centrist Blue and White party and far-right and ultra-Orthodox parties as a "spin"."When you want to form a unity government, you do not come forward with political blocs and spins but rather honesty, statesmanship, responsibility and seriousness," Gantz said, referring to the political bloc deal Netanyahu signed earlier on Thursday with leaders of most of the right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties.Under Netanyahu's deal, the parties were committed to supporting only Netanyahu as the next prime minister.After 97 percent of the votes in Israel's parliamentary elections have been counted on Thursday morning, Gantz's Blue and White party was shown to win 33 seats. Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party won 31 seats.Israeli governing coalition needs at least 61 members to have a majority in the 120-seat parliament. However, both of the blocs of Gantz and Netanyahu failed to gain enough seats to form a governing coalition, with a unity government emerging as a likely option.The results mean Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, might come to end.Israelis cast ballots on Tuesday for the second time in five months after Netanyahu failed to form a governing coalition and call for snap elections.

                Israel faces potential deadlock in polls
            </a>
            <p>
                JERUSALEM - Israel is headed toward an unprecedented repeat election on Tuesday with no guarantee that the do-over vote will produce a more decisive result than the inconclusive one last April.The Israeli electorate is deeply divided and the fragmented parliamentary system makes coalition building a tricky business.In April, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seemed to have a clear path to power with his right-wing Likud party and its traditional Jewish ultra-Orthodox and nationalist allies securing a majority in parliament.But when Avigdor Lieberman's hard-line Yisrael Beitenu party objected to the parties' excessive influence, Netanyahu was left with just 60 supporters - one short of a majority. Instead of allowing an alternative candidate a chance to form a government, he dissolved parliament and called another snap election.Polls show Netanyahu's Likud and its main challenger, the centrist Blue and White party, in a head-to-head tight race. Both parties could struggle to form a majority coalition.A unity government between the two biggest parties may be the most reasonable way out of the gridlock, but the Blue and White has vowed not to serve under Netanyahu because of his likely indictment on corruption charges. Netanyahu, the longest serving leader in Israeli history, is unlikely to agree to sit in a government headed by anyone else.Meanwhile, the Israeli government agreed to turn the wildcat settlement of Mevoot Yericho in the Jordan Valley into an official settlement, the prime minister's office said.The approval follows Netanyahu's pledge last week to annex the Jordan Valley, which amounts to one-third of the West Bank, if he wins Tuesday's elections.Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas's spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, dismissed the entire cabinet meeting as illegal and called on the international community to "stop the Israeli madness aimed at destroying all the foundations of the political process".Peace Now, an Israeli NGO opposed to the settlements, said: "The government continues to show blatant disregard for reaching a two-state conflict-ending agreement with the Palestinians."The European Union and the United Nations condemned Netanyahu's Jordan Valley announcement last week.Beyond the cabinet approval, Netanyahu and opposition leader Benny Gantz were making last pitches to voters."Anyone who wants to ensure that we will continue to protect Israel, anyone who wants a strong right-wing government under my leadership, has to vote only (Likud)," Netanyahu wrote in Yediot Aharonot newspaper.Gantz argued he can heal divisions in Israeli society that he says Netanyahu has exacerbated."I see what kind of government Netanyahu wants to form: An extremist minority government that would decide for the majority and act toward immunity for Netanyahu," Gantz said.Agencies

                Netanyahu's political fate on the line as Israelis vote
            </a>
            <p>
                JERUSALEM - Israel voted in its second election in five months on Tuesday that will decide whether to extend Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's term as the country's longest-serving prime minister despite corruption allegations against him.The stakes could not be much higher for the 69-year-old right-wing leader who, as in April polls, faces a strong challenge from ex-military chief Benny Gantz and his centrist Blue and White alliance.Netanyahu voted in Jerusalem alongside his wife Sara and said he expected a close election, calling on Israelis to turn out in large numbers." (US) President (Donald) Trump said yesterday that the elections will be tight," Netanyahu said in reference to Monday's comments by the US leader, who has been a strong supporter of the premier, calling the polls"50/50"."I can guarantee you this morning that they are very tight."Gantz voted in his hometown of Rosh Haayin near Tel Aviv and called on the country to reject corruption and "extremism"."We want new hope. We are voting today for change," Gantz said after voting with his wife Revital."We will succeed in bringing hope. We will succeed in bringing change, without corruption and without extremism, all together."Polls opened at 7 am, local time, and were due to close in most areas at 10 pm.Ex-defense minister Avigdor Lieberman, Netanyahu's former right-hand man turned rival, could play a kingmaker role with his campaign to "make Israel normal again".About 6.4 million people are eligible to vote.The first exit surveys will be released just after polls close, while official results are not expected until Wednesday.Opinion polls have indicated another tight race, showing Netanyahu's Likud and Blue and White winning around 32 seats each in the 120-seat parliament.Netanyahu and Gantz paid a last-minute visit on Monday night to Jerusalem's Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews are allowed to pray. Netanyahu suffered one of the biggest defeats of his political career following the April vote.His Likud along with its right-wing and religious allies won a majority, leading Israeli President Reuven Rivlin to task the premier with forming a new government.But following weeks of discussions, Netanyahu failed, leading him to opt for an unprecedented second election rather than risk having Rivlin choose someone else.The danger for Netanyahu extends beyond remaining prime minister, a post he has held for a total of more than 13 years.If he wins, many believe he will seek to have parliament grant him immunity from prosecution while facing the possibility of a corruption indictment in the weeks ahead.Recognizing the stakes, Netanyahu spent the final days of the campaign seeking to appeal to right-wing nationalists - key to his reelection bid - and to boost turnout among his base.Those efforts have included a controversial pledge to annex the Jordan Valley, which makes up a third of the occupied West Bank.Agence France-Presse

                Israel Talks begin to form new government Israeli President Reuven Rivlin is starting his two-day consultations with all elected parties before deciding upon the prime minister-designate amid post-election deadlock. Rivlin was scheduled to begin hearing on Sunday the recommendations of various parties at his residence. The largely ceremonial president is tasked with picking the politician with the best chance of forming a stable coalition. It's usually a formality, but this time Rivlin plays a key role after an almost tied election result. In last week's vote, Benny Gantz's centrist Blue and White Party won 33 seats in the 120-seat parliament, while incumbent Benjamin Netanyahu's conservative Likud took 31 seats. Neither can muster a majority coalition with their traditional smaller allies. The emerging compromise appears to be some form of unity government between the two, though both insist upon leading it. Syria Second drone with bomb downed in 2 days A drone was shot down on Saturday in Quneitra Province in southern Syria, the second such incident in 48 hours, state media said. Authorities "dismantled a drone" after it was shot down on the edge of Jabal al-Sheikh in the Quneitra countryside, southwest of Damascus, state news agency SANA reported. The drone was loaded with bombs and C4 explosive, it said. The origin of the drone was not specified, though SANA reported it "came from the west". The Israeli army's Arabic-language spokesman said the drone did not come from his country. On Thursday, another drone was downed by Syrian anti-aircraft defenses over the village of Aqraba, south of Damascus, SANA reported, also without specifying the origin of the drone. United Kingdom Conservatives hold big lead over Labour British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative party has a 15 percentage-point lead over the opposition Labour Party, according to an opinion poll published on Saturday, ahead of a possible national election aimed at breaking the impasse over Brexit. The Conservatives garnered 37 percent in the Opinium poll for the center-left Observer newspaper, while Labour took 22 percent. Agencies (China Daily Global 09/23/2019 page6)

                Activists pluck plastic dumped into oceans on mass cleanup day
            </a>
            <p>
                PARIS - Thousands of volunteers wielding nets and bin bags scoured coasts, parks and riverbanks across the globe on Saturday, in a litter-picking drive highlighting the vast quantity of trash dumped worldwide, a day after mass international climate protests.Campaigners took part in World Cleanup Day from Manila to the Mediterranean, as hundreds of thousands of people across the world participated in demonstrations and activities calling for urgent action on the environment.Young people have been at the forefront of the movement, with masses of children skipping school on Friday for a global climate strike, which teen activist Greta Thunberg said was "only the beginning".Nearly four million people filled city streets around the world on Friday, organizers said, in what was billed as the biggest ever protest against the threat posed to the planet by rising temperatures.It kicked off a week of climate action called for by Thunberg, who was among several hundred young activists attending a climate summit at the United Nations on Saturday.The annual World Cleanup Day, held on Saturday this year, is an initiative that got millions into the streets and cleaning up litter across the globe since it began just over a decade ago.In France, volunteers posted images of their trash hauls on social media - heaps of assorted waste, soft drink cans and plastic containers.A climate protest on the streets of Paris attracted some 15,000 people, according to a tally by independent consultancy Occurrence, but the rally was marred by clashes between security forces and a relatively small number of troublemakers.'For us to help' While the types of trash collected varied, the most common material in the bin bags across the planet was plastic, amid surging concerns over the environmental costs of single-use items and microplastics in world waterways.In the Philippine capital, nearly 10,000 people swept across a long stretch of beach on heavily polluted Manila Bay, clutching sacks they filled with rubbish."It's for us to help the environment. Especially here in Manila, there's a lot of garbage," Mae Angela Areglado, a 20-year-old student said as she pitched in with the cleanup - held right next to the city's huge Baseco slum." (Plastic is) affecting the marine life because they think that it is food," she added.In the Pacific island nation of Fiji, which is among the countries worst affected by sea level rises and has become a vocal advocate for global climate action, people scoured palm-fringed beaches west of the capital Suva, heaving discarded car tires and engine parts from the coast.On Australia's Bondi Beach, activists sifted through the sand, carting off bits of plastic and cigarette butts.In Vietnam's capital Hanoi, around 1,400 volunteers went searching for litter under the scorching sun."Although our actions are very small - like cleaning trash from the sidewalk - it could spread a meaningful message," 18-year-old Hoang Thi Hoan said, as motorists zipped by on a busy street.Agencies
