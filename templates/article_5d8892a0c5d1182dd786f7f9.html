                Trump  relents on  deportation of ill migrants
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Advocacy groups for migrants who have entered the US illegally hailed a move by the Trump administration to back off a plan to deport those with life-threatening medical conditions to their home countries.The policy, announced Aug 7 by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) without public notice, set aside a "deferred action" program that had allowed some migrants to remain in the country while they or their relatives received medical treatment.On Monday, USCIS backtracked after strong negative public response and from more than 100 Democrats in Congress and said it would reopen and review cases pending on Aug 7. It's unclear if the agency will accept new cases.Those affected by the rule were told to leave the US within 33 days, but no one was deported under the now-withdrawn decision."I think sending vulnerable people back was too much," Abel Nunez, executive director of the Central American Resource Center in Washington, told China Daily."I think deporting sick children was a line the administration wasn't willing to cross. The images of vulnerable people on TV and in the newspapers were too much for them. I think Trump got blowback from his base, and I don't think he'll move on it again," he said.Antonio Meloni, executive director of Immigration Advocacy Services in New York City, said the proposal was misguided, and the Trump administration acted properly to rescind it."We tell people not to panic when a law changes," he told China Daily. "In most instances, lawsuits are filed, and it can be years before anything happens. Walking this one back is a good thing, and it shows the administration is clearly rethinking the law."A letter signed by 127 Democratic members of the House of Representatives and the Senate and sent to Ken Cuccinelli, director of USCIS, and Kevin McAleenan, acting secretary of Homeland Security, said: "Individuals requesting deferred action from USCIS are among the most vulnerable. Children and families submit such requests due to severe medical conditions like cancer, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis. In many cases, the treatments are life-saving."The letter continued, "Requiring that prospective applicants request this humanitarian relief by applying to an immigration enforcement agency that detains and deports hundreds of thousands of immigrants annually, will deter many vulnerable children and families from coming forward and seeking life-saving protection."The federal agency said, "As USCIS's deferred action caseload is reduced, the career employees who decide such cases will be more available to address other types of legal immigration applications on a more efficient basis."USCIS said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will review medical requests in the future.But an ICE official told NBC News it was blindsided by USCIS' decision to refer medical cases to them for review."ICE does not have a program for this nor do we plan to," an official told NBC on condition of anonymity.USCIS said it receives about 1,000 deferred action requests a year for medical reasons, and most are denied after a case-by-case review. "Deferred action" is a discretionary program to temporarily delay deportation on humanitarian grounds.Like the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama administration-era program for immigrants who entered the US illegally as children, deferred action for medical conditions is part of a temporary relief program offered by USCIS.Dr Sarah Kimball, a primary care physician at Boston Medical Center whose patients include migrants from Central America, said deporting people with acute medical problems could have catastrophic results."Imagine you're visiting the US when you're told for the first time your kidneys have failed," she told CommonWealth magazine. "You'll need dialysis to stay alive, a treatment not available in your home country. For patients with kidney failure, being deported is equal to being denied medical care."

                    US to further restrict immigration
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                US President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday will release the final version of the "public charge" rule that will affect legal immigrants seeking permanent residency, as the acting director of US immigration services offered a revised version of the famous poem at the Statue of Liberty that's in line with the new rule.The rule would penalize legal immigrants who received - or are deemed likely to receive - public assistance such as food stamps, Medicaid or government housing, and could prevent them from getting permanent residence that targets legal immigration.Ken Cuccinelli of the US Citizenship and Immigration services was asked during an interview with National Public Radio, or NPR, on Tuesday if in light of the new rule the words of US poet Emma Lazarus etched on a bronze plaque at the Statue of Liberty - "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore." - still applied to those seeking refuge in United States."They certainly are," Cuccinelli said. But then he added: "Give me your tired and your poor - who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge.""No one has a right to become an American who isn't born here as an American," Cuccinelli also told NPR. But later he clarified: "It is a privilege to become an American, not a right for anybody who is not already an American citizen, that's what I was referring to."The immigration chief added that the public charge rule was just "part of President Trump keeping his promises".Speaking to reporters in Morristown, New Jersey, later on Tuesday morning, Trump was asked about the Lazarus poem. "I don't think it's fair to have the American taxpayer pay for people to come to the United States," he said.Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell University Law School professor, told China Daily: "This rule is the latest attack in the Trump administration's war on immigrants. It will make it harder for working-class people to immigrate or stay in the US."The public charge rule doesn't go into effect until Oct 15, but has received a barrage of criticism from immigrants' rights advocates who plan to sue.Immigration rights groups criticized Trump and Cuccinelli, saying the new rule is another attempt to prevent some ethnic groups and poorer people from living in the US.The change in those who get public assistance could "disproportionately impact Asian communities", Joo Han, deputy director of the Asian American Foundation, told China Daily.New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Attorney General Xavier Beccera are among the officials who said they will sue the Trump administration to block the rule.

                    US rolls out new restrictions on benefits for immigrants

                US President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday released the final version of the "public charge" rule that will affect legal immigrants seeking permanent residency, as the acting director of US immigration services offered a revised version of the famous poem at the Statue of Liberty that's in line with the new rule.The rule would penalize legal immigrants who received — or are deemed likely to receive — public assistance such as food stamps, Medicaid or government housing, and could prevent them from getting permanent residence that targets legal immigration.Ken Cuccinelli of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services was asked during an interview with National Public Radio, or NPR, on Tuesday if in light of the new rule the words of US poet Emma Lazarus etched on a bronze plaque at the Statue of Liberty — "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore." — still applied to those seeking refuge in United States."They certainly are," Cuccinelli said. But then he added: "Give me your tired and your poor — who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge.""No one has a right to become an American who isn't born here as an American," Cuccinelli also told NPR. But later he clarified: "It is a privilege to become an American, not a right for anybody who is not already an American citizen, that's what I was referring to."The immigration chief added that the public charge rule was just "part of President Trump keeping his promises".Speaking to reporters in Morristown, New Jersey, on Tuesday, Trump was asked about the Lazarus poem. "I don't think it's fair to have the American taxpayer pay for people to come to the United States," he said.Stephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell University law professor, told China Daily: "This rule is the latest attack in the Trump administration's war on immigrants. It will make it harder for working-class people to immigrate or stay in the US."The public charge rule doesn't go into effect until Oct 15, but has been criticized by immigrants' rights advocates who plan to sue.Immigration rights groups criticized Trump and Cuccinelli, saying the new rule is another attempt to prevent some ethnic groups and poorer people from living in the US.The change in those who get public assistance could "disproportionately impact Asian communities'', Joo Han, deputy director of the Asian American Foundation, told China Daily.New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Attorney General Xavier Beccera said they will sue the Trump administration to block the rule.

                    Three US states, city join California in lawsuit against Trump's new immigration policy
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                SAN FRANCISCO - California Friday led a coalition of five attorneys general of US states and city to file a lawsuit against a new immigration policy by US President Donald Trump administration to deny possible permanent residency to immigrants who receive some of federal benefits.California Attorney General (AG) Xavier Becerra was joined by his counterparts from the states of Maine, Oregon and Pennsylvania, as well as the District of Columbia, to challenge Trump's policy to restrict immigrants' access to legal status if they use food or medical benefits offered by the federal government.The new policy, also known as the "Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Public Charge Rule," is targeting working immigrants and their families by creating unnecessary new barriers to lawful admission to the United States, Becerra said in the lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California."The Rule discourages hardworking eligible immigrants and their families from accessing critical health, nutrition, and housing programs that supplement their modest wages and help them make ends meet," he said.He asserted the "cruel policy" would force working parents and families across the nation to forgo those basic necessities out of fear, which is "simply unacceptable.""The Rule will disproportionately block admission of non-white, non-European immigrants from Asia, Latin America, and Africa," and create more obstacles for them in the path to US citizenship, Becerra said.California Governor Gavin Newsom also slammed the move by the Trump administration as demonizing immigrants and creating fear in immigrant families, "which is cruel and threatens our public health.""We're standing up to the Trump administration in court to protect our economy, our families, and our most sacred values," he said.California is home to over 10 million immigrants and half of all children in the state have at least one immigrant parent, according to Becerra's office.Two California counties joined an earlier lawsuit filed this week by 13 states, including the Washington state, to challenge Trump's public charge rule set to take effect in October.

                    Ukraine swaps prisoners with Russia
                </p>

                MOSCOW/KIEV, Sept. 7 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and Russia conducted an exchange of detainees on Saturday in a step towards easing tensions in east Ukraine's Donbass region and the thawing of bilateral ties.Planes from the two countries brought the freed inmates to Moscow and Kiev respectively. In the 35-for-35 format, Ukraine received 24 sailors, film director Oleg Sentsov, journalist Roman Sushchenko and 9 others.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was present at the airport along with relatives of the Ukrainian citizens.Kirill Vyshinsky, head of Russia's state-run news agency RIA Novosti's office in Ukraine, returned to Russia together with his fellow detainees.Upon his arrival in Moscow, Vyshinsky said he felt well and thanked Russian diplomats and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) for their efforts to secure his release.On May 15, 2018, the Ukrainian Security Service raided RIA Novosti Ukraine, accusing its staff of supporting the insurgents in Donbass and high treason, and detaining Vyshinsky, a Ukrainian native with Russian citizenship."We welcome the swap and are happy that Russian citizens came home," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday.Since taking office in May, Zelensky has held two phone conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin in August and July respectively, to discuss the situation in Donbass and an exchange of detainees."Unlike its predecessors, the new administration of Zelensky demonstrated a sound approach and willingness to compromise," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday.The ministry said it considers the swap of detainees a positive signal to break the current impasse in Russia-Ukraine relations and to implement the Minsk agreements on Donbass settlement.The ministry hopes that this step will create a positive background for substantive work within the frameworks of the Trilateral Contact Group consisting of Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE, and the Normandy Format of Russian, Ukrainian, German and French leaders, in a bid to further implement the Minsk Agreements to resolve the Ukraine conflict.Since April 2014, an armed conflict between Ukrainian government troops and pro-independence insurgents has been underway in Donbass.The Minsk agreements, reached in September 2014 and February 2015 respectively, are designed to peacefully end the conflict in Donbass, which envisage a ceasefire, a withdrawal of heavy weaponry from the demarcation line, a prisoner exchange and local elections, among other measures.

                    Naturalized Lin eyes Olympic glory
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                China's new US-born figure skater Lin Shan (aka Ashley Lin) has set her sights of earning glory for the host nation at the 2022 Winter Olympics.The 16-year-old Dallas native was granted Chinese citizenship earlier this year, and she's already dreaming of that podium moment in Beijing."My parents came to the United States from Shanghai," said Lin."They both work in computer companies. I am very grateful that they encouraged me to skate and they always support my dream."My biggest dream is to win a medal at the Olympics. And I am so happy that I can skate for China."An Olympic medal looks to be within Lin's reach after her impressive performance at last week's national championships in Changchun, Jilin province.Despite a major miscue in her short program, Lin won bronze in the women's singles with 171.99 points. Twelve-year-old An Xiangyi won the gold medal with 197.93, while Chen Hongyi was second (176.26)."I performed with all my heart," said Lin, who won bronze at the Junior All-American championships and was fifth at an ISU Grand Prix."It wasn't as good as my training, but I tried my best."China's former world champion and Olympic bronze medalist Chen Lu was impressed."Lin is a powerful skater; her jumps are strong and her style is international, which are her advantages," said Chen, who reckons Lin should peak around the time of the Beijing Games."Her best time is not now," Chen added. "The golden age for female figure skaters is 19 to 20, so Lin will be at her best at the Olympics."She needs to improve her skills and work on the details. Most importantly, she must make a breakthrough in her degree of difficulty."Xinhua
