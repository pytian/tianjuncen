                Xinjiang invests heavily in poor counties
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                URUMQI - Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region has allocated 23.6 billion yuan ($3.33 billion) of agriculture-related funds to its poverty-stricken counties, local authorities have said.The funds, distributed to 32 poor counties in the first eight months of this year, have been utilized to promote the agricultural production and infrastructure construction, with the priority being given to industrial projects which can bring the impoverished stable income, the regional finance department said.The funds have also been used to improve the living conditions by building more public facilities, including waste and sewage treatment facilities and public toilets.More than 93 percent of the funds went to four prefectures in southern Xinjiang, which have long suffered poverty, underdeveloped economy, extreme climate and fragile environment.Xinjiang invested over 33.4 billion yuan in poverty reduction last year. The region's poverty headcount ratio dropped from 19.5 percent in 2013 to 6.1 percent in 2018, with per capita disposable income of its rural residents surging from 119 yuan in 1978 to 11,975 yuan last year.

                    Northwest area sees increasing precipitation
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Some experts believe the changing climate is good for agriculture and environmental restorationLANZHOU - Northwest China, which used to be cold and dry, is now getting warmer and wetter.As early as the 1980s, academics noticed increasing rainfall in the northwestern region and speculated that the climate would become warm and wet."The speculation about climate change in Northwest China in the next 30 years has been confirmed," said Ding Yihui, an expert with the China Meteorological Administration.Chen Baofu works for an airport in Gansu province. As an experienced shuttle bus driver, Chen said he has noticed the changes on the road linking the airport and capital city Lanzhou over the past few years."The 70-kilometer-long road was built on barren mountains. But there is more rainfall here, and more plants grow on the mountains nowadays," Chen said.The arid climate is a major reason that the Mogao Grottoes, a UNESCO World Heritage site, have been preserved for thousands of years. However, as rainfall increased in the summer, the tourist attraction in Gansu was temporarily shut down, while the Gobi Desert nearby has also seen grass growing."We used global climate models to predict that this trend will last until the mid-21st century," Ding added.Statistics from the meteorological departments of northwestern provinces Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai and Ningxia Hui autonomous region showed these areas have seen climate warming and increasing precipitation since 1961, while the trend of warming and humidification has risen since 2000.In Gansu alone, the temperature has risen steadily at a rate of 0.29 C every 10 years from 1961 to 2015.Last year, the average temperature in Gansu was 0.7 C higher, and average precipitation increased by 27.7 percent as well.

                A man from Horgos, Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, spent 144 days riding horses to Lianyungang in East China's Jiangsu province to show his gratitude to local government for helping send his daughter to college.The 39-year-old man, Li Zhiyuan, traveled more than 5,000 kilometers to send the local government red silk banners, a traditional way to express gratitude in China.Starting April 27, Li overcame many difficulties and made many friends who helped both him and his two horses during the trip."Thank you for establishing the Sugang Middle School so that my daughter can receive a good education."She got admitted by a college this summer and became the first college student in our family.""All of my family members felt very proud of my daughter. My son is also attending a kindergarten established by Lianyungang," he said.The city invested more than 36 million yuan ($5.1 million) in establishing the middle school in Horgos in 2009, and teachers were encouraged to go to Horgos to help local children for several years."My family members have suffered a lot for being illiterate," said Li. "Your help has greatly changed my family."
