                Which way are Sino-US ties headed?
            </p>
            <p>
                In view of the interests of both countries, it is a rational and beneficial choice to seek mutually acceptable solutionsBidding farewell to 40 years of friendship, some in the United States want to replace cooperation with competition as the tone of Sino-US ties in future.At present, with right-wing conservatism and nationalism peaking, the US has listed China as a strategic competitor and the recent Sino-US economic and trade conflict is a clear manifestation of this accusation. The US has adopted a flurry of radical and inappropriate policies and measures to counter China, exposing Washington's short-term overanxiety. Whenever the US calms down, China and the US will come back to seeking rational major power relations, but it will take time.The US should not hold the unrealistic expectation that trade negotiations can resolve all major issues and concerns between the two countries. The current trade negotiations are the first ones opened under the threat of tariffs. The difficulty is unprecedented.It is even more difficult to resolve anything in months if the negotiations cover issues like tariff and non-tariff barriers, investment and market access, agriculture and the service industry, intellectual property protection, technology transfer, exchange rates and enforcement mechanisms.The US should not set an unrealistic negotiation schedule, which reflects its anxiousness and greed for success. It should recognize that it is impossible to find a complete solution to structural problems in the short term. It is also unrealistic to expect trade negotiations to resolve all major issues and concerns between the two countries.The Sino-US economic and trade negotiations could head in one of three directions:The first is the resumption of negotiations and conclusion of an agreement in the following several months, something the market expects. China and the US are complementary in terms of economy and trade. In fact, economic sectors of both countries as well as the global market expect a trade agreement acceptable to both sides to emerge in the near future. However, this scenario will emerge if only the two countries truly respect each other and hold realistic targets. It is particularly crucial for the two sides to arrive at an agreement on the elimination of punitive tariffs and on implementation mechanisms.In the second scenario, negotiations could lead to a stalemate. The negotiations could continue till next year. China and the US might require a long time to arrive at an agreement. During this period, the US will maintain tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China will continue to implement counter-measures. The US is likely to impose tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods and crack down on Chinese technology companies as a lever to maximize pressure.The Chinese side will continue to maintain rational restraint but the economies of both China and the US will suffer continuous damage, and the global economy will continue to face uncertainty and unpredictability.In the third scenario, it might be difficult for China and the US to arrive at an economic and trade agreement approved by both sides. The US will continue to implement a hawkish policy and impose punitive tariffs on all Chinese goods. China will be forced to adopt comprehensive counter-measures.In such a scenario, the Sino-US economic and trade conflict will not only undermine the economic growth of China and the US, but will also bring horrific damage to the global economy. A man-made economic crisis will force the global economy into a recession.China must work hard toward the best situation, but at the same time it must prepare itself for the worst. In the past year, China responded rationally to unilateral actions by the US, taking countermeasures on the same scale. But it also actively sought dialogue, consultation and negotiation. The Chinese side also conveyed to the US that if it wants to fight, China will accompany it to the end.China has the confidence to fight the US because it boasts an enormous manufacturing capacity and a large global market share and holds the interests of US companies in China as a bargaining chip.Sino-US competition in high-tech industry is normal market competition. But the US is trying in vain to combat the development of China's high-tech industry by imposing higher tariffs. On the one hand, China's high-tech products are exported not only to the US market, but also to the global market.On the other hand, China's high-tech industry development has its own unique development track and characteristics, and is supported by China's comprehensive industrial system. In recent years, with the expansion of R&D investment from the government and enterprises, China's overall innovation and R&D capabilities have been continuously enhanced.The US trying to slow down the development of China's high-tech industry with tariff policies can only stimulate China's indigenous innovation capability and increase its efforts to expand the global market.Economic globalization means that the global trade order and economic order are of paramount importance. China currently advocates maintaining the existing order and promoting World Trade Organization reform. China, together with its global value chain partners, will jointly safeguard the multilateral trading system.The author is director of the Regional Economic Cooperation Research Center at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.

                Time to cooperate, not decouple, envoy says
            </a>
            <p>
                As the China-US relationship sits at another crossroads, the world’s two largest economies should come together by expanding cooperation rather than “decoupling” from each other, Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai said Tuesday.“We have learned from the past four decades that cooperation is the only right option for us,” China’s top envoy to the US said as he delivered the keynote address at a Vision China event in New York. “It is something we should always uphold.”The forum, “China-US Relations: 40 Years & Beyond”, hosted by China Daily and Bank of China, featured commentary by experts intricately involved in Sino-American relations.“Decoupling our two countries in trade and industrial development goes against globalization and the tide of history. And considering China’s advantages in cost, market and supply chain and its growing edge in innovation, to decouple from China is to decouple from opportunities,” Cui said.Cui’s remarks came amid trade differences between the two countries that date to early 2018. Another round of talks between the countries’ top trade negotiators is scheduled for early October.“The trade war the US launched and repeatedly escalated was based on a wrong rationale in the very beginning, and its negative impact has now hit both countries and spilt over to the whole world,” said Cui.Scientific, technological and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries also are hard to decouple, Cui added.China and the US differ on some issues, said Cui; however, instead of justifying confrontation or conflict, the disagreements should be seen as opportunities and potential for complementarity and cooperation.“It is extremely dangerous and irresponsible to base America’s policy on alarmism and label China as a strategic rival and even adversary,” said Cui.He refuted the rhetoric that a rising China will “displace the US to be the world’s new hegemon”, and said China aspires to pursue happiness for its people, rejuvenation for the nation and harmony for the world.Despite the economic advancement achieved by China in past decades, the country still faces tough challenges, including eliminating poverty, preventing and resolving systemic risks, and preventing and controlling pollution, noted Cui.“China develops itself to deliver a better life to its people, not to scramble for global dominance,” Cui said.Cui pointed out that China’s development has served other countries, including the US, and any decoupling of China and the US is hardly possible, given the inseparable links between the two.The bilateral relationship has major bearing on world stability and prosperity, said Cui, and the two nations could cooperate to deal with global issues such as nuclear proliferation, terrorism, climate change, and natural disasters and challenges.While the US will remain “the world’s strongest country a long time to come”, whether it can take an open and confident approach to China’s development “will affect its future, and will determine the direction of China-US relations and very probably the future of the world”, Cui said.

                Capital's goal to expand reform: boost science and technology
            </a>
            <p>
                Tourism, education, and healthcare will also benefit from new measures, officials say Beijing has recently released an action plan to expand reform and opening-up in the city's service industry for more foreign investment and international cooperation, according to the city's commerce bureau. The capital city will focus on expanding opening-up in major fields including science and technology, finance, education, cultural tourism and healthcare, according to the plan. "Beijing is the first and only pilot city to expand opening-up in the service industry nationwide," said Yan Ligang, head of the Beijing Commerce Bureau. It has attracted high-end international resources, which helped create an open environment and lay a solid foundation for the city to carry out a range of reforms, Yan said. The three-year action plan consists of eight major fields with 190 measures, instructing eight relevant departments to conduct pilot measurement. These departments include the Beijing Science and Technology Commission, the Beijing Bureau of Economy and Information Technology, the Beijing Local Financial Supervision and Administration, the Beijing Education Commission, the Beijing Culture and Tourism Bureau and the Beijing Commission of Development and Reform. In the next three years, the city will seek breakthroughs in policy reform and industrial innovation, which includes reforming institutional business registrations, optimization of the funding environment for companies and the rolling out of preferential policies. The action plan also features the launch of major projects and Beijing will promote the construction of international communities and establish a sound environment for the service industry following international standards, Yan said. In addition, the city will set up a one-stop service center for foreign professionals and establish an online platform for a national scientific research innovation center. Wang Jianxin, an official of the Beijing Science and Technology Commission, said the commission would engage in introducing overseas technological talents, offering customs conveniences for technology companies, supporting companies in building an automotive test and development center and rolling out regulations to promote the commercialization of science and technology. "We will cooperate with related departments to mobilize high-end scientific research resources and strengthen international exchanges to contribute more to the construction of an innovation center with a global influence in Beijing," Wang said. From January to June, 755 foreign-invested companies involved in the service sector opened for business in Beijing, and the amount of foreign capital utilized was $8.59 billion. The added value of the service industry accounted for 82.8 percent of the city's GDP during the period. Li Yan, deputy head of the Beijing Local Financial Supervision and Administration, said Beijing has an edge in expanding opening-up in the financial sector with many financial institutions, large markets and outstanding innovation capabilities. The city plans to ease market access of various financial institutions and conduct measures such as expanding pilot projects for cross-border investment and financing and launching international exchanges and cooperation in green finance and financial technologies. "We will take stronger financial measures to serve the demands of financial institutions in the next three years," Li said. Beijing will expand the supply of international education services, cultivate educational pilot projects and expand its educational scale by 2021. Beijing should further optimize the layout and structure of international education, said Huang Kan, deputy director of the Beijing Education Commission. By 2021, the city is set to build 11 new international schools in Chaoyang district, Haidian district and other talent concentration areas. It is expected to build 50 new schools qualified to accept foreign students, and there will 330 schools eligible to receive international students in 16 districts in the city. It will also support 40 local schools to establish national talent cultivation bases under the Belt and Road Initiative. liangkaiyan@chinadaily.com.cn   An intelligent robot developed by foreign high-tech enterprises is displayed at the 2019 World Robot Conference in Yizhuang economic development zone in Daxing district, Beijing.Provided To China Daily(China Daily 09/19/2019 page10)

                The Sino-British Joint Declaration does not have any paragraph which sets out the implementation of "dual universal suffrage".Paragraph 3(4) of the Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that "the chief executive (of the HKSAR Government) will be appointed by the Central People's Government on the basis of the results of elections or consultations to be held locally". Annex I of the Joint Declaration stipulates that "the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be constituted by elections". Both are not related to the implementation of "dual universal suffrage".

                Government clarifies inaccurate claim on social media
            </a>
            <p>
                In response to an organisation's claim on a social media platform that "the fact that universal suffrage has yet been implemented in Hong Kong is a serious violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration", a spokesman for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government clarified today that the Sino-British Joint Declaration does not have any paragraph which sets out the implementation of "dual universal suffrage".Paragraph 3(4) of the Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that "the chief executive (of the HKSAR Government) will be appointed by the Central People's Government on the basis of the results of elections or consultations to be held locally". Annex I of the Joint Declaration stipulates that "the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be constituted by elections". Both are not related to the implementation of "dual universal suffrage".The spokesman reiterated that universal suffrage of "one person, one vote" for selecting the Chief Executive and electing all members of the Legislative Council is enshrined as an ultimate aim in the Basic Law of the HKSAR of the People's Republic of China. To achieve this aim, there is a need to conduct dialogues to narrow differences with a view to attaining a consensus agreeable to all sides. The HKSAR government will assess the situation carefully and take forward constitutional development in accordance with the Basic Law and the relevant Interpretation and Decisions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
