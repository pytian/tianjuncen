                DR Congo outlines growth trajectory
            </p>
            <p>
                The Democratic Republic of the Congo, or DR Congo, is vowing to change overseas perceptions of the country as poverty stricken and ridden with conflicts and diseases. Speaking during the recently concluded Makutano Forum, held in the country's capital Kinshasa on Sept 6-7, Felix Tshisekedi, president of DR Congo, expressed confidence and passion to set the country on a growth trajectory. Tshisekedi took office in January 2019 after winning the December election. The country had the first transfer of power through ballot box. His government faces the challenge of addressing political instability, improving governance and growing the economy. He announced his initiative in August. "My 100-day program is the beginning of a vast national development plan to make the DR Congo play its role in the African integration process," he said. The president said that the DR Congo has a lot of potential and promising prospects that can transform the country into one of the richest economies in Africa. Toward that end, he said they will diversify the economy to leverage on agriculture among other sectors. He said despite the country having 80 million hectares of arable land and 40 million hectares of irrigable land, the country imports 90 percent of its basic consumer goods.The president called on the youth, most of who have migrated to urban centers, to invest in agriculture, saying his government will improve the living conditions in the rural areas through creation of agribusiness zones and construction of basic infrastructure. "The DR Congo population is expected to hit 200 million by 2050, out of which over 60 percent will be below 25 years old. This is a real lever for development, but it can become a major risk, if we don't make the right decisions today. Currently, nearly 40 percent of the Congolese population lives in cities and this figure may exceed 50 percent by 2050," Tshisekedi said. Tshisekedi said his country was already awakened. "The DR Congo has for long been termed as a giant with clay feet, However, the country is now standing and ready to move forward," he said. Tshisekedi will also focus on developing the energy sector, a priority for industrialization. He said the DR Congo has a combined energy potential of more than 200,000 megawatts, including 100,000 megawatts in hydropower, which coupled with its natural resources and geographical position can make the country a true global energy web. He added that the country is rich in fresh water, thus it can help solve the desertification challenge threatening north and southern parts of Africa. edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 09/13/2019 page4)

                New international funds raise hopes of containing Ebola outbreak in DR Congo
            </a>
            <p>
                International agencies have heeded a World Health Organization emergency call to pledge funds to contain the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo.WHO on July 17 called the outbreak a "public health emergency of international concern", a rare designation only used for the gravest epidemics.The year-old epidemic in eastern DR Congo, the second deadliest on record, has expanded from the largely contained remote areas to urban areas, Agence France-Presse reported. More than 1,700 people have died.The Ebola virus is highly contagious and has an average fatality rate of around 50 percent. It was transmitted to humans from wild animals and spreads among people through close contact with blood, body fluids, secretions or organs of an infected person.Tedrus Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, said: "In the last couple of weeks there is renewed commitment to finance the shortages we were facing. The support has raised hopes that the epidemic could be restrained."Ghebreyesus' comments came after the World Bank announced $300 million financial support raised in a global response to the epidemic. This was the second round after $100 million disbursed by the bank since August 2018.Kristalina Georgieva, the chief executive officer of the World Bank, said the communities and health workers on the front line of the outbreak urgently need more support and resources from the international community to prevent the crisis from worsening.Italy pledged 300,000 euros ($333,600) to support medical treatment, immunization and burials in "sanitized" conditions, carried out by WHO in the North Kivu and Ituri regions of DR Congo.Italy's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation said in a statement that the contribution assured continuity to the response of the country's cooperation service since the Ebola outbreak last year.The United States, through the US Agency for International Development, pledged more than $38 million in additional assistance to help end the outbreak, including $15 million in new funding to WHO.This brought the total USAID funding for the Ebola response to more than $136 million since the beginning of the outbreak in August 2018.The European Union has also contributed 30 million euros in humanitarian funding for the Ebola response. This brought total EU financing toward the epidemic to 47 million euros since 2018.The World Food Programme on Friday announced that it requires $50 million over the next six months to implement its response and preparedness actions in DR Congo and neighboring countries: Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan.The agency plans to nearly double its food assistance and nutritional support to the 440,000 Ebola-affected people in DR Congo over the next six months, in what it termed as, stepping up preparations for a potential further escalation of the epidemic.The African Union has also announced plans to convene a fundraising forum in the first week of September to support the fight against Ebola in DR Congo.

                Japanese woman cleared of Ebola
            </a>
            <p>
                A Japanese woman suspected of having Ebola after returning from the Democratic Republic of the Congo had turned out to be a false alarm, the nation's health ministry said on Sunday.The Saitama woman, who is in her 70s, had tested negative for the infectious and deadly Ebola virus, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said in a statement, but she will continue to be hospitalized for doctors to monitor her condition as a precaution, it added.According to an earlier statement by the ministry, the woman, who was not been identified, lives in the Greater Tokyo region. She returned to Japan from the DR Congo on July 31.She had a fever of 38.2 C at 5 am on Saturday. It rose to 38.5 C at 5:50 pm and 39.2 C at 7 pm the same day, raising suspicions of a possible Ebola infection.After she was hospitalized by Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases, the woman was tested positive for type A influenza and negative for malaria.The Ebola alarm set off a panic in the country as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made quick instructions to treat the patient and prevent secondary infection, because millions commute every day from Saitama to Tokyo.When waiting for the result of the patient on Sunday, Abe's office tweeted several posts on Twitter to ease the panic, with one saying: "It is said that the disease is contagious only when the symptoms become evident. It is therefore highly unlikely that the passengers who were on board the same airplane with the patient face the risk of infection."The woman was based in the DR Congo for work for at least six months, local media said, without specifying her occupation.Japan's health ministry said since the woman's return to Japan, her temperature had been taken twice a day at a health quarantine station.Ebola victims will show symptoms after an incubation period of anywhere from two to 21 days. Symptoms include sudden fever, migraines, muscle pain then followed by vomiting, diarrhea or unexplained bleeding or bruising.The Ebola virus cannot be transmitted by air or by mosquitoes but can be spread by direct contact with blood or body fluids.This month marks one year since WHO declared an outbreak of the Ebola virus in the DR Congo, which left more than 2,600 people infected and 1,800 killed.

                Possible Ebola case in Rotterdam hospital false alarm
            </a>
            <p>
                THE HAGUE -- Emergency services in Rotterdam took an immediate action on Wednesday evening due to a possible case of Ebola, but investigation showed it was a false alarm.A woman came to the first aid post of the Maasstad hospital with signs of the highly contagious disease, fever and vomiting. A coordinated deployment of the emergency services was initiated afterwards by the Safety Region Rotterdam-Rijnmond.The woman with the symptoms of the disease came from DR Congo, but not from an area where the disease currently prevails. The Maasstad hospital initiated the Ebola protocol on the basis of the disease symptoms of the patient and the fact that she came from Congo.During the investigation people were not allowed to leave the hospital and no one was allowed to enter. Some visitors to the first aid post, where the woman had reported herself, were temporarily quarantined. The woman was treated in a special air filtered space. Just after midnight the Safety Region Rotterdam-Rijnmond announced she did not have Ebola.The Rotterdam hospital has a Ebola protocol since 2014, when there was an outbreak of the disease in West Africa. Since August 2018 a new Ebola outbreak occurred in the North East of Congo.

                Scientists identify effective Ebola drugs
            </a>
            <p>
                Scientists have found new treatments for the Ebola disease that has so far killed more than 1,800 people and infected more than 2,700 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the past year.Carrying out a trial in the midst of the major outbreak in the DR Congo, the scientists discovered that two of the five investigational drugs significantly reduced deaths.The independent data and safety monitoring board that meets periodically to review treatment data on Aug 9 recommended the drugs REGN-EB3 and mAb114.Begun last November, the study trial with 499 participants so far indicates that patients that received REGN-EB3 or mAb114 had a greater chance of survival compared to participants treated with three other drugs.In addition to mAb114 and REGN-EB3, since last November the trial, called Pamoja Tulinde Maisha ("Together Save Lives"), had tested ZMapp, remdesivir, and monoclonal antibody 1 to treat patients at centers in four DR Congo communities.Starting in August 2018 the Ebola outbreak has spread through north Kivu and Ituri provinces of DR Congo.Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the US National Institutes of Health, said the overall mortality of those given ZMapp at the four centers was 49 percent while that of remdesivir was 53 percent.REGN-EB3, developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, had the lowest overall death rate, at 29 percent, while mAb114, developed by Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, had a mortality rate of 34 percent.ZMapp had shown some efficacy during the massive 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.Christos Kyratsous, vice president of research, infectious diseases and viral vector technologies at Regeneron, said REGN-EB3 is a three-antibody cocktail designed with the goal of enhancing efficacy, reducing the development of viral sequences that lead to resistance, and increasing potential utility in future outbreaks as viruses continually evolveWendy Holman, CEO and co-founder of Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, said her company is focused on further developing mAb114.MAb114 was initially developed by the US National Institutes of Health, but Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP obtained licensing for it from the US Food and Drug Administration in the fourth quarter of 2018.Nancy Sullivan, chief of the Biodefense Research Section in Vaccine Research Center and her team discovered that the survivors retained antibodies against Ebola 11 years after infection.Researchers isolated the antibodies and tested the most favorable ones in the laboratory and nonhuman primate studies, and selected mAb114 as the most promising.Holman said the news from the Pamoja Tulinde Maisha trial helps to reinvigorate and keep them fixated on their mission.

                DR Congo's South Kivu province reports first confirmed Ebola cases
            </a>
            <p>
                BUKAVU, DR Congo -- Health authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) on Friday confirmed the first two cases of Ebola in the Mwenga Health Zone in Bukavu city, South Kivu province, which borders Rwanda and Burundi.According to a statement from the nation's coordination team in charge of Ebola response, the two cases were a 24-year-old woman and her seven-month-old baby, who resided in a host family in the Beni Health Zone, Mabolio.The woman had been listed earlier as a high-risk contact of a family member who was confirmed to be an Ebola case last month in Beni.The statement added that more than 120 contacts are already listed and the on-site response team's mission is supporting the Mwenga Health Zone in search of other contacts in the coming week."We want to reassure the population that the response teams are hard at work to carry out all public health actions around the case, and urge it to collaborate fully with our teams," said Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe, director of the National Institute for Biomedical Research, in a statement."We reassure neighboring countries that all steps are being taken to strengthen surveillance at points of entry and health control," he added.Since the beginning of the Ebola outbreak one year ago, the cumulative number of cases is 2,852, of which 2,758 are confirmed and 94 probable. In total there were 1,913 deaths of which 1,819 were confirmed. There are also 848 people healed, according to the latest report from the country's health ministry.

It's also part of the government's effort to lower interest rates, which are currently considered exorbitant."My ambition is to create several Congolese millionaires as well as support the establishment of many small and medium enterprises to create employment," he said.The president reassured the business community that he has embarked on actions aimed at avoiding all kinds of harassment on enterprises by state agencies.The Federation of Enterprises of Congo has been raising concerns regarding the missions of the General Inspectorate of Finance (IGF), which they termed a "bother".Tshisekedi also announced that he will convene a round table meeting to listen to the grievances of the business community with the aim of improving business environments. Through the meeting, he also plans to set up a mechanism for monitoring reforms for the country's business environment.He said his government will establish more vocational training centers to align skills training with labor market demands.The president also promised to create agro-industrial zones as well as develop infrastructure in the agricultural sector to reduce import of food stuffs. Currently, he said, the country imports 90 percent of its basic consumer goods, despite having huge agricultural potential.According to Invest in DR Congo, a national agency for the promotion of investments, the country has 80 million acres of arable land and 4 million acres of irrigable land, as well as many rivers with fishery resources. Most of the farmers are currently engaged in subsistence food agriculture.Anthony Nkinzo, the general manager of the National Agency for Investment Promotion, said there is need for strong commitment and responsibility to rebuild the country's image as well as attract more foreign investors."We anticipate for DR Congo with access to healthcare for all, education and training as well as improved infrastructure and a win-win public-private pact to grow the country's economy," Nkinzo said.Mahamadou Issoufou, the president of Niger, Ellen Johnson, the former president of Liberia and Dramani Mahama, the former president of Ghana, were some of the dignitaries who attended the forum.Nicole Sulu, the founder of Makutano network which is behind the forum, said attendance by the distinguished guests was an indication of a new era for African dialogue.She said the DR Congo is key for Africa's development because of its strategic location and natural wealth.The DR Congo is endowed with large mineral resources and has potential to install up to 100,000 MW of hydropower capacity, according to the United States Agency for International Development.The central African country is endowed with an abundance of rare mineral resources like diamond, gold, copper, cobalt, zinc, manganese and coltan. The country also has very rich forest resources.edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cn

                DR Congo aims for economic growth
            </a>
            <p>
                The Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) has announced measures to change the country's narrative, from poverty, conflicts and diseases, to a developing economy and favorable investment destination.Speaking during the recently concluded Makutano Forum, held in the country's capital Kinshasa on Sept 6-7, Félix Tshisekedi, president of DR Congo expressed confidence and passion to set the country on a trajectory of growth.Tshisekedi, who took office in January 2019 after winning the Dec 30, 2018 election and marking the country's first transfer of power through ballot box, is faced with the challenges of addressing political instability, improving governance and growing the economy. He announced his new government in August."My 100-day program is the beginning of a vast national development plan to make the DR Congo play its role in the African integration process," he said.The president said that DR Congo has potential and promising prospects that can transform the country into one of the richest economies in Africa. Toward that end, he said they will diversify the economy to leverage agriculture among other sectors.He said despite the country having 80 million hectares of arable land and 40 million hectares of irrigable land, it imports 90 percent of its basic consumer goods.The president called on the youth, of whom most have migrated to urban centers, to invest in agriculture, saying his government will improve living conditions in rural areas through the creation of agribusiness zones and construction of basic infrastructure."The DR Congo population is expected to hit 200 million by 2050, out of which over 60 percent will be below 25 years old. This is a real lever for development, but it can become a major risk if we don't make the right decisions today. Currently nearly 40 percent of the Congolese population lives in cities and this figure may exceed 50 percent by 2050," Tshisekedi said.Dr. Cheikh Kante, the minister in charge of the emerging Senegal Plan, lauded the president's call for youth to go into agribusiness, saying it's one of the initiatives that enabled his country to achieve food security."In just five years, Senegal created 196 farms. DR Congo has a huge agricultural potential and can be Africa's bread basket. Unfortunately the country has for long concentrated on the mining sector in the expense of the other sectors. DR Congo is a giant that President Tshisekedi should awaken by developing other sectors," he said.President Tshisekedi said the country was already awakened. "DR Congo has for long been termed as a giant with clay feet, However the country is now standing and ready to move forward," he said.Tshisekedi said they are also focusing on developing the energy sector, which is a priority for industrialization.
