                MTR chairman urges public to treasure HK railway amid unrest
            </p>
            <p>
                MTR Corporation Chairman Rex Auyeung Pak-kuen appealed to the public of Hong Kong to cherish the homegrown rail brand, which has braced up to throw its support behind the police in fighting against violence and vandalism that have roiled the railway system and the city. Auyeung, 67, made the appeal in an interview with a local Chinese-language newspaper. He expressed hopes for the people of Hong Kong not to push the renowned local brand that was built up by the efforts of generations into the sea. The city’s rail network, which carries an average of 5 million daily passenger trips, has become a primary target of repeated vandalism by radicals in the ongoing civil unrest that has gripped the city for more than three months.Following several deliberate disruptions of the railway services that paralyzed the metro services and affected hundreds of thousands of travelers, radicals set fires and smashed facilities at the major metro stations along the Island Line over the past two weekends.In light of that, Auyeung said the company has recruited a large number of new security guards to shield the metro operations from vandals and ensure the safety of its front-line staff members.This year marks the 40th anniversary of the start of MTR services in the city. It, however, saw its most severe challenge in its history, with more than half of the about 150 subway and light rail stations being sabotaged at a repair cost of up to HK$10 million. Not to mention, hundreds of thousands of passengers were affected by the overt challenge to the rule of law, a value the city holds dear. Auyeung did not expect the radicals would defy a High Court’s injunction order that bans deliberately obstructing the proper use of the metro services. But he assured that the cost will not be transferred to passengers by a hike in ticket fares. Several standoffs at the MTR stations turned into scuffles with MTR front-line staff amid the incessant weekend mayhem. This has saddened Auyueng, who said the railway has become sandwiched and battered by the political turmoil. Auyeung said staff members for the MTR are not trained to deal with confrontations and the corporation is not experienced in dealing with massive public activities. For societal order, the police should step in, he said.That’s why the MTR will brace up and continue to support the police for strictly enforcing the law in the face of violence and vandalism, said the newly appointed chairman of the city’s sole rail operator. Auyeung assumed office in July 1, at a time when the city’s political turmoil rocked the city for about a month. He apologized for falling short of the public’s expectations in handling the political unrest when the company arranged a free train to help anti-government radicals retreat after they confronted the police in the Yuen Long MTR station on Aug 21.Auyeung said that the special train service arrangement was to evacuate the crowd as ground traffic was obstructed, adding that it was not out of political consideration.In hindsight, it did give a bad impression to the public as it was like giving a ride to someone who refused to foot a bill after the meal and vandalized the property at the restaurant, he said.

                China demands US drop bill on HK
            </a>
            <p>
                China on Thursday demanded the United States stop advancing a Hong Kong-related bill and its interference in Hong Kong affairs on Thursday, after US lawmakers held a news conference to back the bill. US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a bipartisan group of members of Congress held the media event on the "Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019". Hong Kong separatists, including Joshua Wong Chifung and Denise Ho Wan-see, attended the event. China is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposed to the move, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Thursday.

                HK CPPCC members: patriotism should be reinforced and expanded
            </a>
            <p>
                For Hong Kong's prosperity and stability in the long-run, Hong Kong members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference said it is necessary to reinforce and expand patriotism.Member of the CPPCC from Hong Kong Samuel Yung Wing-ki said the patriotic force loving both the country and the city needs to be strengthened.To achieve this, he encouraged the city's CPPCC members to engage people from various backgrounds, especially young people, to brief them about the nation's latest development and opportunities in prominent national strategies.This will buttress their national identity as well as their recognition of the country, he said.This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the CPPCC, the advisory body to the Chinese government and a major player in the Chinese social and political system.Many of the city's CPPCC members have joined local groups, the founding President of Hong Kong Professionals and Senior Executives Association said, adding that they can lobby groups to hold more activities to increase local people's understanding of China.Besides lectures, the associations could invite government officials to explain policies relating to the Chinese mainland or organize delegations to visit mainland cities, he said.It is also important for CPPCC members of the special administrative region (SAR) to support the law-based governance of the SAR government, which Yung said is a basic requirement.One of the advisory body's main tasks is to offer suggestions to the government, in both the promulgation and implementation of policies, Yung said.To provide quality suggestions, Yung advised members of the advisory body to maintain a close connection with the public. This could help them better identify and investigate the deep-rooted problems in society, he said.Echoing Yung, Jackey Tse, a Hong Kong member of the Youth Federation of Jilin province, told China Daily that supporting the law-based governance of the SAR government is a must for Hong Kong to end the current turmoil, which has gripped the city for more than three months."To help society back on track soon, we must support the SAR government's administration and the police's law enforcement actions to bring law-breakers to justice," said Tse, who is also a member of the Jilin provincial committee of the CPPCC.There are various ways to throw weight behind the government's administration, Tse said. Young people could take the initiative to clarify rumors targeting the government among their peers, Tse said.In Tse's eyes, there is a need to strengthen the ranks of patriots among Hong Kong society, as it is a key way to guarantee the city's stability.Tse encouraged CPPCC members to put more efforts into connecting with the city's young people, introducing them to the opportunities across the boundary, as well as the policies benefiting Hong Kong people's lives on the mainland.He also appealed to Hong Kong's young people to put aside prejudice and embrace the development opportunities on the mainland in a more open and active manner.Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies – a Hong Kong and Macao affairs think tank – said Hong Kong's recent social unrest reveals the patriotism needs to be increased across society.Facing the China-US trade tension and foreign forces' constant intervention in Hong Kong internal affairs, Lau said now it is more urgent than ever to expand the force of people who love the nation and Hong Kong.Hong Kong members of the CPPCC should play greater roles in the city's political arena and serve as the bridge between the mainland and the city, Lau said.Lau added that committee members should do more policy research targeting the deep-seated social issues in Hong Kong to relieve the city's internal rift and tensions, which many believe are the cause of the protracted social unrest recently.
