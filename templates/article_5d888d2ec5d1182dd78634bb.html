                Shanghai among world's best financial centers
            </a>
            <p>
                Shanghai maintained its fifth position for the third year in a row in Global Financial Center Index released by UK's independent think tank Z/Yen on Thursday, showing the world's increasing recognition of Shanghai's financial status.While retaining its ranking, Shanghai closed the gap with the fourth placed Singapore, losing by just one point to the Southeast Asian city.As Z/Yen explained, Shanghai's consolidation of its position in the global financial market can be largely attributed to China's further opening-up, especially in the financial sector. In light of this, the municipal government of Shanghai has also sped up its financial opening-up. On the other hand, the business environment has been improving, with Shanghai ranking seventh globally in this category this year.It is the 26th time that Z/Yen has released the index. New York topped this year's list, followed by London and Hong Kong. Apart from Hong Kong and Shanghai, another five Chinese cities made to the top 100 list, namely Beijing, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Qingdao and Chengdu.

                Young people to skip school for global climate 'strikes'
            </a>
            <p>
                 Hundreds of thousands of students – if not millions – will skip school Friday worldwide to take part in a climate-change "strike'' against businesses and organizations that have been inactive on environmental issues.In New York, all 1.1 million public school students have been given the day off to attend the "Global Climate Strike'' starting at noon at Foley Square in downtown Manhattan. There will also be a rally to Battery Park.A tweet from the city's public school system, the nation's largest, said: "@NYCschools will excuse absences of students participating in the #climatestrike on Friday 9/20. Students will need parental consent. Younger students can only leave school with a parent."At least 800 protests are planned in 50 states, and more than 2,000 in 50 other countries.Students in Washington DC, Boston, Seattle, Miami, Los Angeles and Denver also are expected to demonstrate. Other large US school districts, including Cambridge, Massachusetts, are still deciding whether to give students the day off. All students who attend will need consent from their parents.Abby Andebrhan, 17, from Stillwater, Minnesota, is one of the students who will attend the strike. She told China Daily: "Since I am not 18 years old yet, I haven't been able to use voting as a way to make a difference. I believe that this Friday will be a monumental day in our movement because we will finally be able to march right down to the capitol and demand change.''The youth are calling on the world's leaders to help stop global warming, reduce fossil fuels and limit greenhouse gases. Under the terms of the 2015 Paris Climate agreement, they want to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, but the world is not on track to do this.The global youth protests come ahead of the United Nations' Climate Action Summit on Sept 23. Representatives from several countries will convene at UN headquarters in New York City to discuss what can be done to limit greenhouse gases.The Global Climate Strike is being led by Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old climate-change activist from Sweden.Thunberg gained international attention after she temporarily skipped school on Fridays from August 2018 (with the blessings of her parents) to protest outside the Swedish parliament at its lack of action on climate change.Ahead of the protest in New York, Thunberg told young people: "If you can't be in the strike, then, of course, you don't have to. But I think if there is one day you should join this is the day."Thunberg arrived in New York on Aug 28 after traveling from the UK on a boat with zero emissions. She no longer flies on planes in a bid to reduce the carbon footprint. The teenager spoke to Congress on Wednesday urging lawmakers to "wake up," and will be in New York on Friday to participate in the protest."The youth who are leading this are incredible for the overall climate movement," Sarah Goodspeed, youth and policy manager for an organization called Climate Generation: A Will Steger Legacy, told China Daily."They are really pushing everyone to fight harder and feel more integrity than a lot of folks have felt in the movement for a very long time. They feel a sense of urgency that the decisions we're making today are shaping the world that they are going to inherit in the future," she said.The youth-led movement, dubbed "Fridays for Future'', has seen many young people, some only 8 years old, in 100 countries follow Thunberg's lead and skip school on Fridays to demand environmental action from leaders."Young people across this globe are really coming together and are seeing this as a global movement, something we all are sharing, and affects many parts of the world," said Goodspeed.The last big environmental protest saw youth from more than 130 countries demonstrating. But this event could be bigger as organizers have planned 2,500 events in 150 countries.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has made climate change a centerpiece of his administration. He tweeted last week: "New York City stands with our young people. They're our conscience. We support the 9/20 #ClimateStrike."But his support came under fire from some, including the New York Post, which accused him of "out-and-out government sponsorship of a particular point of view".Karol Markowicz, a columnist for the Post, wrote that one mom, who had lived in what was Soviet Union, took to Facebook to say the strike is like "Soviet-style brainwashing and propaganda".Another mom of a 6-year-old pupil who has been given the day off from a Park Slope elementary school in New York, told Markowicz: "I am all for people supporting causes they believe in, but do not force your causes and beliefs on my first-grader."On June 1, 2017, US President Donald Trump announced that the US would withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate mitigation. In March, he retweeted the words of climate change doubter Patrick Moore, who said: "The whole climate crisis is not only Fake News, it's Fake Science. There is no climate crisis, there's weather and climate all around the world, and in fact carbon dioxide is the main building block of all life."Democrats have attempted to address climate-change issues in a plan called the "Green New Deal''. All the Democratic candidates seeking their party's 2020 presidential nomination have unveiled climate plans.Grace Roeske, 18, from Minnesota told China Daily: "Climate change is threatening the water we drink, the air we breathe, and the places we live and love. This matters, we all care …""With the Green New Deal we are ready to finish the unfinished business the past has left for us. To pass this deal we need mass mobilization to show that climate crisis is an urgent issue."

                Polish director to bring award-winning show based on Shakespeare's work to Beijing
            </a>
            <p>
                When Polish director Grzegorz Bral and Song of the Goat Theatre made their debut in China by performing Portraits of the Cherry Orchard, during the Wuzhen Theater Festival in 2015 in the namesake ancient town located in Zhejiang province, audiences were immersed in the atmosphere created by the director. Combining a story based on Anton Chekhov's drama, The Cherry Orchard, Bral brought characters alive onstage with music and dance. The work was staged for three consecutive nights and became one of the surprise hits of 2015's Wuzhen Theater Festival.Now, Bral and the theater will come to Beijing to perform their award-winning show, Songs of Lear on Oct 19 and 20 at Tianqiao Performing Arts Centre after a stop in Shanghai on Oct 12 and 13. In September 2017, the show was staged in Shanghai for the first time.With 12 women and men performers wearing simple, black outfits while chanting and weaving raw physicality and emotion, Songs of Lear is based on William Shakespeare's tragedy, King Lear and composed by Jean-Claude Acquaviva and Maciej Rychly.With the performers using folk instruments, cappella singing in Latin, English and Polish, and choreography, the performance showcases the madness, despair, disappointment, love of the characters.Speaking about the show, Bral says: "Music plays the core role in Songs of Lear. And the ensemble members have chosen crucial scenes from King Lear to weave a story out of gestures, words and music. Each song is a starting point for another 'dramatic poem'. Here, the music becomes character, relationships and events," adding that the creative process has been divided into several phases: preparation of the concert, dramatizing the songs, creating movement and visual structures, integrating text, music and movement and finally molding the performance into a mature shape.Since it premiered at the 2012 Edinburgh Fringe Festival, where it received three awards, including a UK Musical Theatre Matters Special Award, Songs of Lear is a constantly evolving creative research project in which audience may witness a very intimate artistic process.Further describing the show, Bral says: "It sounds like oratorio. But there are many elements of classical music, and this performance is the original work of its creators."Bral, a graduate of the Polish language and literature studies program, which he pursued at the University of Gdansk, Maria Curie-Sklodowska University in Lublin and the University of Wroclaw, also studied psychology at the Catholic University of Lublin and theater studies at the Theatre Academy in Warsaw.In 1996, together with Anna Zubrzycka, the former lead actress at the Centre of Gardzienice, he founded Song of the Goat Theatre and trained his actors and actresses with his "coordination technique", a concept he developed to combine intense acting training with music, text, voice, body and imagination.

                Climate protesters keep up efforts across Europe
            </a>
            <p>
                March in France ends in violence after hijacking by outsidersA 91-year-old man was one of 10 people arrested when members of the Extinction Rebellion climate change action group took part in a blockade of the English port of Dover on Saturday.The man, along with an 83-year-old woman and three others, was part of a group that broke away from an official demonstration, and another five activists were detained for trying to glue themselves to one of the key roads into the town, in an effort to demonstrate the vulnerability of the United Kingdom's reliance on food imports."The government must tell the truth and act now," said Chris Atkins from Extinction Rebellion Dover."As climate change develops, millions of ordinary Britons will face the real and growing threat of food shortages, hunger and starvation. Extreme storms and floods are already causing major crop failures across the world, with high temperatures also hitting livestock and agriculture."This crisis may seem far away now but given the dependency of the UK on food imports we are extremely vulnerable."A Sky News reporter spoke to the 91-year-old man just before he was detained. He said he was taking part because his generation had done the damage that caused the current crisis.The UK's dependence on food imports, especially through Dover, has also been a major issue in the on-going Brexit crisis.The Institute for Government reports that 2.5 million heavy goods vehicles pass through Dover each year, carrying around 17 percent of the UK's entire value of trade goods. Last year, then-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was heavily criticized after saying in a speech that he had "not quite understood the full extent" of the country's reliance on Dover.The latest protests in the UK come at the end of a week where young people all around the world have taken part in climate change demonstrations, inspired by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.On Saturday, what had been billed as a family-friendly peaceful climate change march in Paris was abandoned after infiltration by other protest groups led to violent clashes with riot police, vandalism and more than 100 arrests.The climate change protest and another over pension reform had both been permitted but other demonstrations, by groups including the yellow vest protesters, who have been involved in a series of previous anti-government confrontations dating back to last year, went ahead unauthorized, leading to more than 7,000 police officers being deployed.Tear gas was used to break up groups, thought to be made up of anarchists, who wore hoods, sunglasses and black scarves to hide their faces, with environmental group Greenpeace advising climate change protesters to leave the scene because of threatening circumstances."Brutalities (not by climate activists) occurred at the front of the procession. Following tear gas the march has halted," Greenpeace France tweeted, later adding: "Take no risk and leave the climate march."There have also been protests in Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government has made a breakthrough in its efforts to reduce greenhouse gasses by coming up with a new set of measures to combat carbon emissions.The deal is thought to cost around 48 billion pounds ($60 billion) by 2023, and includes a price on CO2 emissions from transport and buildings, and an increase in tax on air fares but a reduction on those for long-distance train tickets. "We are not living sustainably today", said Merkel.
