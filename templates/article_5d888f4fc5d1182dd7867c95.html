                At Uthiru Primary School in Kenya's Kiambu County, grade six students are glued to a video screen, quietly following an educational program.The new development that has made learning more real and enjoyable was facilitated by a project to provide satellite television access to 10,000 African villages.The project, announced by Chinese President Xi Jinping during the opening of the 2015 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, is a cooperative effort aimed at reducing the digital divide in Africa's rural areas.StarTimes, a Nairobi-based digital TV provider, is implementing the project, which involves installing two sets of solar power projector systems, one 32-inch digital TV set, satellite dishes and accessories to three public facilities in each village.It also involves providing 20 sets of satellite TV terminals, including set top boxes, satellite dishes and accessories, to 20 households with functional televisions.Peter Otieno, a teacher in charge of the ICT department at Uthiru Primary School, said the facilities have greatly benefited social studies and English language instruction.Through TV programs, Otieno said students' minds have been opened to a world of possibilities."During the news programs, pupils can learn the difference between reported and direct speech. We can also project our normal lessons that are integrated on the basis of information and communication technology, or ICT, by using a laptop," Otieno added.He said the project has also "made learning look real" to pupils, when they see the practical implications of what they have been taught in class."For those without TV sets at home, it's a motivation to go to school, because at break time the pupils are allowed to watch programs of their choice," he said.Two kilometers from the school is Uthiru Vocational Training Center, another beneficiary of the project.Anthony Mwangi, the institution's deputy principal, said the project has enhanced the overall learning experience. He said the Discovery World channel has been particularly educative by providing a compelling mix of history, culture, real life stories, investigation and mystery shows."Through these programs, students have learned a lot about China, enhancing the relationship between our two countries. Discovery Science has shown them how it's possible to build great machines," Mwangi said."We are grateful to StarTimes and the government of China. Our students are now able to connect to the world and learn."Uthiru Health Center, located a few kilometers from the vocational school, has also benefited from the project.Martin Ochieng, the center's clinical officer, said television in the waiting room helps keep patients calm. The clinic is the only public hospital in the area and averages 150-200 patients per day."Initially, patients got bored while waiting and they complained a lot, piling pressure on us. The TV keeps them patient and updated at the same time," said Ochieng."Their patience now gives the staff adequate time to address their issues and also stay abreast of what is happening around the globe."According to Wang Qianxu, vice-president of StarTimes Media (Kenya) Co Ltd, 16,000 individual households and 2,400 public institutions in 800 villages across all 47 Kenyan counties have benefited from the project.Similar stories are happening in South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana and 19 other African nations, involving a total of 10,112 villages.To implement the project, a committee of 12 representatives from StarTimes and Kenya's Ministry of ICT was formed. According to Augustus Munywoki, the project manager and a senior economist at ICT ministry, the committee developed criteria for beneficiaries' qualification in order to ensure fair distribution.A village with a connection to a power source, availability of three public institutions and 20 households with televisions were the major determinants for qualification. The data was then forwarded to StarTimes for the actual project implementation.StarTimes completed the installation work by the end of 2018, and it was checked and verified by an expert team from the Chinese government. The Kenya side's verification work is still underway.In Munywoki's opinion, the cooperative project is a win-win. The beneficiaries get free access to satellite TV programs, through which they can access news and information that can enhance their social and economic development."The goodwill project has helped the two countries' mutual understanding, which in the future will benefit cooperation with other countries. China is a very good friend of Africa," Munywoki said.To ensure the beneficiaries' satisfaction, StartTimes has set up 20 service offices across Kenya with 74 staff.In every remote village that the project covers, two technicians provide basic maintenance services.

                    China-Africa cultural cooperation draws hearts closer

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China and Africa have consolidated public support to further enhance bilateral practical cooperation thanks to their efforts in intensifying cultural and people-to-people exchanges in recent three years.By the end of this August, a satellite television project aided by China has benefited nearly 2,000 villages in 9 African countries including Senegal, Guinea, Rwanda and Uganda.The project has installed two digital TV projection devices for public service areas and offered free digital TV set-top boxes for 20 households in each village.Dubbed “Access to Satellite TV for 10,000 African Villages,” the project covers a total of 10,112 villages in 25 African countries, said Guo Ziqi, Vice-Chairman of China’s StarTimes Group which implements the project.The project was now advancing smoothly, and would be completed by the end of this year, Guo added.“It is a great project. Thanks for choosing our village,” villager Abu Bakar from Senegal told People’s Daily, adding that he had never watched Chinese TV dramas before, and it is the Chinese project that made him learn about China and life of Chinese people.A Rwandan young man Shamir, who interpreted for Rwandan President Paul Kagame during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s state visit to his country this July, has become a hot figure in his country thanks to the increasingly strengthened China-Africa cultural cooperation.Shamir had a close bond with China in the past 10 years. As a Chinese Government Scholarship recipient, he studied at China’s Tianjin University and North China Electric Power University, and took part in a China-Africa cooperation project at Poly Solar Technologies (Beijing) Co., Ltd.His experiences of living and studying in China are unforgettable for him. Shamir still remembers the celebration of the Chinese New Year with his colleague’s family members in 2016 in Hebei province.He was impressed by the warmth of the Chinese family and lovingly called the colleague’s mother his “Chinese mom”. Today, he still keeps in contact with her through WeChat, a Chinese social application.Shamir told People’s Daily that he would contribute to Rwanda’s development with what he learnt in China.Over the past three years, Chinese government has provided over 30,000 government scholarships for African students, and Chinese universities and colleges also created favorable conditions for them to study in China. The students are contributing to a cemented China-Africa friendship as “civilian ambassadors”.In addition, a wide range of tourism facilitation measures on visas and transport have been introduced with the joint efforts by China and Africa.Many Chinese people travel to Africa to escape the heat this summer, according to a man surnamed Xiao engaged in African tourism business in Wuhan, Hubei province in the center of China. He disclosed that out-of-season travelling to African countries in the Southern Hemisphere had become a traveling choice for Chinese people.The number of Chinese tourists to Africa has seen a 50 percent growth since China Southern Airlines and Air China opened direct flights between Guangzhou and Nairobi, Beijing and Addis Ababa, and Beijing and Johannesburg in the second half of 2015.Tourists from the Chinese mainland to Africa only accounted for 3 percent of its total outbound tourists in 2008, but the rate rose to 10 percent in 2016, with the number of visitors climbing to 11.3 million, according to statistics by the World Tourism Organization.The 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) held on Sept. 3 and 4 will chart a new path to elevate China-Africa friendly cooperation to a new level.It will introduce various people-centered cooperative measures to deepen mutual understanding and affection between the two peoples, and enable the China-Africa friendship to be passed on from generation to generation.

                A digital broadcaster is forging links of friendship between China and people in countries across the continent. Li Zhihui and Cao Pengyuan report for Xinhua.Francis Tchiegue's busy Beijing life is becoming even busier due to what he calls his "mission".In addition to filming TV shows such as Francis Tells Tales and Francis' Tricks for Chinese at the headquarters of StarTimes in the city, Tchiegue also revises multilingual scripts and drafts.The Cameroon national has lived in China for more than a decade. In 2003, he won a scholarship to study for a PhD in Beijing as part of an exchange program sponsored by China and his home country.As a huge fan of Chinese culture, Tchiegue speaks Mandarin fluently and he has become a TV celebrity adored by Chinese audiences.Six months ago, he started to work full time as a host and consultant at StarTimes, one of the largest TV service providers in Africa."I came to China to see what I could do for media and cultural exchanges between China and Africa, and StarTimes has been dedicated to this kind of work for years and years. That is why I chose to work here," Tchiegue said. "It is my mission."In 2002, StarTimes set a goal that distinguished it from other television operators in Africa at the time: To provide affordable and excellent digital TV services for every African family.That goal has now taken root in the continent and won wide recognition from the public and various governments.StarTimes has also registered and set up subsidiaries to provide digital TV services for nearly 20 million users in more than 30 African countries, including Rwanda, Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and South Africa.As its name suggests, Star-Times is a rising star on the continent, presenting images of the world to households across Africa.The sight of a family gathered in front of the television enjoying time together is now increasingly common in African countries.

                    Filmmaker promotes cross-cultural understanding
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Somali academic and documentary filmmaker Hodan Osman Abdi is helping to shatter misconceived stereotypes by promoting cross-cultural understanding and appreciation between China and Africa.Her uncle was a longtime resident of Yiwu, an export hub in eastern China's Zhejiang province, and often shared stories about China's culture and history with Abdi when she was a child. Driven by curiosity, she came to China 12 years ago after graduating from high school to continue her education in Zhejiang.She studied business and education and earned a doctorate in media economics and management from Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, the provincial capital. Since 2016, she has been a researcher at Zhejiang Normal University's Institute of African Studies, teaching African film and television."About 10 years ago, when I first arrived, the Chinese generally associated Africa with disease, hunger and poverty," said Abdi, who is fluent in Chinese and English. "One time, my taxi driver asked where I was from. I said Somalia, and he said 'Oh, the land of the pirates'."To change sweeping misconceptions about African people, Abdi and her colleague, Zhang Yong, produced the first Chinese-Africa co-directed documentary film, Africans in Yiwu, last year.The film was selected as the opening movie for the Lusaka International Film Festival in Zambia last year, and it has been aired worldwide by China Central Television and across Africa by StarTimes.The six-part documentary features the intimate stories of 19 ordinary people from 15 African countries living in Yiwu, home to one of China's largest African communities rising from the ever-growing trade ties between China and Africa.There are more than 2,000 different languages in Africa, with 5,000 ethnic groups across more than 50 countries, each representing a distinctive culture."But we have accepted the fact that one image of one person can represent the entire country, or even the continent," Abdi said.She said the film's casting was intended to overcome the homogenized view of African people and "represent the diversity of what it means to be African".At the same time, it also aims to show that the African people have much in common with Chinese, with the same drives and dreams of improving their lives.This common aspiration was also reflected in the just-ended 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, which had the theme "Toward an Even Stronger Community with a Shared Future through Win-Win Cooperation".Since the forum's inception in 2000, China-Africa relations have developed rapidly, Abdi said, with the nature of the relationship shifting from China giving aid to investing in Africa's economy."Aid is good, but investment is better," she said, as it can enhance a country's infrastructure and financial institutions, leading to more jobs, improved living standards, and economic sustainability.For example, a few years ago, it cost around $900 to ship a container from one of China's ports to Djibouti, according to Abdi. Now, thanks to improved infrastructure, businesses can send goods much more cheaply all the way from China to the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa."It will cut a lot of the cost that is felt by the ordinary people buying these commodities for their everyday lives," she said.At the same time, it will increase the prosperity of industrial zones and businesses, which will in turn create better jobs for young Africans, Abdi said.Such visible and practical improvements to African people's lives will create a positive cycle of tighter relations between China and African countries, she said, leading to more cooperation.

                    Chinese pay TV vows to boost Sino-Rwanda cultural exchange
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Kigali, Sept. 12 – Chinese pay TV, StarTimes，plans to use its satellite TV service to boost Sino-Rwanda cultural exchange, officials said on Wednesday.Jess Jing, CEO of Star Africa media, said in Kigali that both nations can take advantage of digital technology to enhance people-to-people exchanges."We hope to use our satellite TV service, which has 100 percent coverage in Rwanda, to showcase and promote Sino-Rwandese cultural exchange," Jing said.StarTimes, which launched operations in Rwanda in 2008, has already completed a China-Africa digital TV project in Rwanda that hopes to connect 10,000 African villages to digital TV using Chinese government funding.In Rwanda, StarTimes has connected 300 villages or 6,000 households as well as 900 public institutions to digital TV as part of plans to bridge the continent's digital divide.The Chinese pay TV is also at the forefront of promoting Sino-Africa collaboration by airing Chinese dramas to local viewers with English subtitles."We are planning to further translate the Sino-dramas into local dialects so that more people can access high-quality programming from China," Jing added.Jing said that StarTimes hopes to enhance the Sino-Rwanda relationship in the field of cultural exchange so that it can match that in the area of trade, commerce and investments.Jing added that African and Chinese people have many similarities including a rich civilization.He urged Africans to protect and promote their rich culture by documenting it so that it is preserved for the region's future generation.He said that western culture is prevalent in Africa and so the continent needs to ensure that its heritage is preserved even in the context of globalization.StarTimes will soon begin to make African movies so that the continent can showcase its culture to the rest of the world.StarTimes also hopes to display African culture to Chinese viewers so that the Chinese can increase their understanding of Africa."It will also help to boost Chinese tourism into Rwanda," Jing added.He also called for joint projects between Chinese and African artists in the area of music and film making.StarTimes is also keen to empower African filmmakers tell their story to the rest of the world.The Chinese pay TV initially began using with Digital Terrestrial Transmission (DTT) but in 2014 converted to satellite TV.According to Jing, satellite has greater capacity to carry more channels and has a large coverage area."DTT covers 85 percent of Rwandan territory because Rwanda has so many hills but with satellite TV we have achieved 100 percent coverage," the CEO said.Currently, StarTimes is the largest pay TV service in Rwanda with over 200,000 customers.StarTimes has been able to penetrate the Rwandese market due to its strategy of high quality and affordable service which has packages for as little as $3 per month."Our aim is to enable even rural residents to access and enjoy world class TV services," Jing said.However, its service has been hindered in the remote areas that lack electricity.StarTimes will begin to rollout a program where residents without electricity will be given solar equipment to enable them access satellite TV and pay for the gear in easy installments.

                    Family devoted to Africa's success helped lay tracks for its development
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Grandfather, grandson share a vision that has benefited many on the continent Almost half a century ago, Li Yongzeng ("Li Senior"), now 80, was among tens of thousands of Chinese people who were working in Tanzania helping to build the 1,860-kilometer Tanzam Railway, or Tazara, linking landlocked Zambia to the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam. Now, his 25-year-old grandson Li Shangyi ("Li Junior") works in Malawi on the "Access to satellite TV for 10,000 African villages" project, part of China's aid to Africa to build the information highway as announced by President Xi Jinping at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation's Johannesburg Summit in 2015.  A teacher at Kuputu Primary School in Salima Town, Malawi, uses a projector provided by Li Shangyi's company, StarTimes. Photos Provided to China Daily Li Yongzeng (with arms raised) surveys the land with his Chinese and African colleagues for the Tanzam Railway. A cargo train runs on the Tanzam Railway shortly after the strategic project was completed in the 1970s.When grandfather and grandson talk about their experiences in Africa, both are proud that they are personally involved in the country's friendship with the African continent. They are among millions of ordinary Chinese and Africans who have been working together to promote the friendship forged by the two peoples through their common historical experience and in their struggles for national independence and liberation. In fact, since Egypt became the first African country to establish diplomatic ties with China in 1956, the past six decades have witnessed the traditional friendship between China and Africa flourish. The Tanzam Railway built with Chinese assistance is one of the landmarks of the China-Africa traditional friendship. "The four years that I worked with my colleagues to build the Tanzam Railway is an unforgettable period in my life," the Li senior says. His home has photos that he took in Tanzania when he worked on the railroad. Though the pictures, mostly black and white, and the pages of his work records have turned yellowish, he takes them out from time to time to recollect those days. Under each photo attached to an old photo album are a few words in neat handwriting recording the place and the time that the photo was taken. Looking at the "valuable assets" he has treasured for more than 40 years, Li Senior seems to revisit history. At the call of the Chinese government, he and his 100-plus colleagues left their homes in Tianjin in December 1970 and boarded the Yaohua passenger liner from Guangzhou in South China's Guangdong province to Dar es Salaam. "The 13 days and nights of traveling on the sea was a terrible time indeed," he recalls. Due to sea sickness, he vomited frequently. However, when the long, tiring voyage finally ended, he quickly dedicated himself to the work in Dar es Salaam. "At that time, we considered it as a sacred undertaking to assist the development of African countries of the Third World," he says. "Nobody would step back in the face of difficulties." The Tanzam Railway, also called the Freedom Railway, was financed and built with the help of China between 1970 and 1975. It was the largest single-item foreign aid project ever undertaken by China. Western countries as well as the United Nations and the World Bank had all declined to fund the project, deeming it financially unviable, while China at that time fulfilled its promise to help construct the railway. Running from Dar es Salaam to Zambia's Kapiri Mposhi, a major junction north of Lusaka, the railway is sometimes regarded as the greatest engineering effort of its kind since World War II. The railway took only five years to build and was finished ahead of schedule in 1975. Before construction began, 12 Chinese surveyors traveled for nine months on foot from Dar es Salaam to Mbeya in the Southern Highlands to choose and align the railway's path. Thereafter, about 25,000 Chinese were engaged in constructing the railway together with tens of thousands of Tanzanians. The rail line gave landlocked Zambia access to the ocean as an alternative to traditional export routes via rail lines to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), South Africa and Mozambique. Compared with his grandfather, Li Junior's Africa tour was much easier. His made his first trip to Africa in 2012, when he was 19, and was sent to Tanzania to study the Kiswahili language on an eight-month university exchange program. When he graduated from Communication University of China in 2015, he started working for the Beijing-based media company StarTimes and was soon sent to Tanzania to develop digital TV operations. Last year, he was transferred to Malawi to work as a project manager on the "Access to satellite TV for 10,000 African villages" project in the East African country. During his childhood, he was told the story of his grandfather in Tanzania, so he had knowledge about the African country, he says. "I felt naturally close to the people here when I started my work on the African continent." However, for Li Senior, life in Tanzania was not easy. Together with his colleagues, he had to overcome various difficulties during his four years working on the railroad. Construction camps were set up at every 60-km section of track, and workers were relocated as the work progressed. Workers had to brave rain, sun and wind to lay the track through some of Africa's most rugged landscape, he recalls. "Despite difficult conditions, we finished the railway in 1975 by upholding the spirit of 'self-reliance and arduous struggle' advocated by Chairman Mao," he says. The work involved moving 330,000 metric tons of steel rail and the construction of 320 bridges, 23 tunnels and 147 stations, according to the retired engineer. When the railway was finished in 1975, more than 160 people had sacrificed their lives, including 69 Chinese workers and experts. They are buried in a tomb in Dar es Salaam. The youngest was 24. Tanzam Railway, which was built with Chinese assistance and by the Chinese, Tanzanian and Zambian people together, is known to the world as the Freedom Railway that helped African people gain national independence and liberation, according to State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. It is also the Friendship Railway that represents the everlasting friendship between the Chinese and African people, Wang said at the launch ceremony for the book A Monument to China-Africa Friendship: Firsthand Account of the Building of Tazara, in July 2015. During his visit to Africa in 2013, President Xi talked about the Tanzam Railway in particular and made a special trip to the cemetery to honor the Chinese who sacrificed their lives for the building of the railway. Xi stressed the need to carry forward the "Tazara spirit" characterized by mutual respect and equality, tenacity and perseverance and selfless internationalism, and to build on past achievements and make sure that the China-Africa friendship and cooperation produced more fruitful results in line with the changing situation. Since the rail line opened, there has been industrial development along the line, including a hydroelectric power plant at Kidatu and a paper mill at Rufiji. Li senior says that when he saw the train carrying cargo on the railroad, he felt all of the efforts by him and his colleagues had paid off. Different from his grandfather's work, which involved an infrastructure project helping the African countries boost economic development and industrialization, the younger Li's work is providing information access to poverty-stricken villages on the African continent. His company aims to provide 500 villages in Malawi with satellite TV access, with a view to enriching the cultural life of local African people, he says. On Dec 4, 2015, Xi announced at the Johannesburg Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation 10 cooperation plans to build a China-Africa comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership. As part of a plan to strengthen China-Africa cultural and people-to-people exchanges, China will build five cultural centers in Africa and provide satellite TV reception to 10,000 African villages this year. Thanks to this program, people in Ngolomi 1 village in Salima town, Malawi, for the first time had a chance to watch World Cup soccer matches this year. When the village head sent him a message of thanks on July 16, Li Junior understood his work was not only of technical assistance, but was a people-to-people bond. The message said: "On behalf of all the people of Ngolomi 1, I would like to thank the Chinese government for supporting us and providing facilities for us to watch the World Cup. We do not take it for granted, we really thank you. I believe you will assist the Ngolomi 1 village in many ways. Lastly, we wish all the Chinese people to have a healthy and industrious life, wherever they are." Li Junior says, "I was touched by the message, though I talk with local people every day due to my work and they are very kind to me." The village head told Li that his village is a base for cotton production, but the yields were not stable, since villagers lacked agricultural technique. However, satellite TV can provide villagers with a chance to acquire farming techniques, Li quoted the village head as saying. Satellite TV actually brought profound changes to the village, Li adds. "Thanks to the satellite TV, they have a chance to see the outside world." In June, when Li junior visited Chenyama village in Salima, he was touched by a handwritten slogan on a wooden board put up on a big tree in the village, which read "Say yes to quality education." Li says he can feel the local people's aspirations to pursue better education to shake off poverty and change their destiny. When he arrived at the primary school of the village, he was astonished to find that a teacher was using the projector TV that his company donated to teach the students mathematics. "Every time I see the changes - a sense of gain for them - I feel my work is meaningful, since what I do can benefit others," Li says. What's more, villagers can watch Chinese TV programs to learn more about Chinese culture and Chinese people's lives, he adds. The program, which kicked off in August last year, is being piloted in more than 10,000 villages from 25 African countries, including Tanzania, Mozambique, Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda and Malawi. Li says people-to-people contact and communication are important to draw the hearts of different countries closer."A simple word, a smile, a hug can help build the bonds with African friends," he adds. To increase people-to-people exchanges, from 2015 to 2018, China provided Africa with 2,000 educational opportunities with diplomas or degrees. On top of this, 30,000 government scholarships and sponsored visits by 200 African scholars and study trips by 500 young Africans to China every year were arranged, and 1,000 media professionals from Africa were trained each year in China. Li junior says his grandfather's generation made great contributions to laying the foundation for the China-Africa friendship. "In the new era, we young people should contribute our own share to enabling the traditional friendship to pass on from one generation to another." caodesheng@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Africa Weekly 10/12/2018 page16)

                    Nation's TV project enlightens Nigeria
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                ABUJA－Kpaduma, an underdeveloped rural community at the edge of Abuja, Nigeria's capital, came alive on Jan 21 as its people turned out en masse in jubilation to welcome Chinese technicians and their local partners to launch a digital satellite television project.The rustic community is one of the 1,000 villages carefully selected to benefit from a China-aid program that works on providing 1,000 Nigerian villages with access to digital television. The program was launched on Jan 21 in Abuja.StarTimes, a Chinese firm which offers direct-to-home or DTH pay TV services, introduced its digital television or DTV service to Kpaduma, to flag off the enormous project across Nigeria.The project acts on one of the resolutions of the Johannesburg Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in 2015, in which the Chinese government pledged to provide satellite television for 10,000 African villages.Under the project, each of the 1,000 chosen villages in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, will receive two sets of solar-powered projector television systems and one set of solar 32-inch digital television integrated terminal system.Altogether, 20,000 households in rural Nigeria will benefit from the project. In each village, 20 recipient families with television will be provided with 20 sets of direct broadcast satellite terminal system free of charge.A projector television system will also be provided to each of the 1,000 villages, for viewers to publicly watch at least 21 satellite channels free of charge.For decades, residents of Kpaduma have only been familiar with analog TV, lacking the opportunity to watch some of the exciting satellite television channels enjoyed by people in the towns and cities across Nigeria.When the innovative project came to their community on Jan 21 with Chinese and Nigerian officials in attendance, ecstatic locals in Kpaduma thronged the village square.Yusuf Dio, the prince of Kpaduma and a beneficiary of the direct broadcast satellite terminal system, described the innovative project as "the talk of the town".The satellite television provides the opportunity for locals to watch digital television programs containing both local and international content.Every evening, up to 20 locals who had no television or lacked electricity gather at Dio's house to watch the digital television programs together with his family.Dio said he enjoyed watching football and news channels the most, while his wife and three children love channels with entertainment content."We are very happy to have this (digital television) in our household. It has brought so much joy and pleasure to my family," Dio said.As a pioneer digital terrestrial television provider in Nigeria, StarTimes has been able to disseminate digital terrestrial television in at least 80 cities across the West African country in nine years.With its simple-to-install decoders coupled with its low tariffs, StarTimes, in partnership with the Nigerian Television Authority, has brought DTV within the reach of many Nigerians since 2010.StarTimes offers some of its channels in three main Nigerian languages－Yoruba, Hausa, and Igbo, as well as a Chinese kung fu movie channel and Nollywood (Nigerian entertainment) channels, among others.Speaking at the flag-off ceremony for the project in Kpaduma, Nigeria's Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed said the implementation complements the efforts of the Nigerian government to "democratize access to information and entertainment through the Digital Switch-Over for television which has now been rolled out in several states and the Federal Capital Territory".The minister commended the Chinese government for the project which, he said, will undoubtedly strengthen the already cordial China-Nigeria relations.Mohammed urged StarTimes to expedite the installation of the television satellite system to cover the entire country, so that more people in the countryside will be more informed and entertained.

                    Kenyan students identifying opportunities in BRI
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has offered Kenyan university students opportunities to learn not only the Chinese language and culture, but also the country's development process, a senior University of Nairobi (UoN) official has said.Professor Isaac Mbeche, deputy vice chancellor, student affairs at UoN, praised BRI for giving young people the chance to acquire firsthand experience of development work that they can attempt to replicate in their home countries."For those of us who have visited China, we have witnessed the economic development in the country. I thus challenge our youth to take advantage of the opportunities provided by BRI and learn how China managed to develop from a poor country to a superpower, and replicate the same in our country," he said.Mbeche, who was speaking during the 18th Chinese bridge competition for foreign students at UoN's Confucius Institute, told young people to be open-minded about opportunities to visit China.He said the competition offers students a chance to study the Chinese language and culture, to meet and interact with their counterparts in China, as well as learn from each other.

                StarTimes Media, a Chinese pay TV company, is investing Ksh200 million ($1.9 million) toward the development of local content in Kenya to be aired via a self-produced channel, dubbed Rembo TV.The entertainment channel will focus mainly on reality television shows, targeting female audiences, with a language policy comprising of 60 percent Kiswahili, 30 percent English and 10 percent vernacular.Speaking during the launch event on Monday, Andy Wang, the chief executive officer of StarTimes Media Kenya, said they have already partnered with over 30 Kenyan content developers."We want to play a significant role in encouraging and empowering the development of local content in Kenya. This will be another of our unique selling points that subscribers will find at StarTimes," he said.Wang said the idea behind establishment of the channel, one of a kind in the East African country, was conceived after intensive research, planning, content analysis and development."Our core aim was to establish a platform that will strategically fill a gap existing in the Kenyan broadcasting sector, the lack of a channel dedicated to female audiences," he said.Rembo TV will be available across three eastern African countries, namely Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.Timothy Owase, the chief executive officer of the Kenya Film Commission, said the continued investments in local productions are an indicator of the growth experienced in the industry.He said the commission is aggressively working on positioning Kenyan productions to rival other competing industries specifically Tanzania and Nigeria."Rembo TV is a continuation of progressive efforts to not only grow viewership locally, but equally sustain the industry as a viable business opportunity for both content developers as well as artists," Owase said.Dr. Ezekiel Mutua, the chief executive officer of the Kenya Film Classification Board, said it's encouraging to see more broadcast players taking local content production seriously, noting that it's key in enabling Kenyans in creative arts to professionalize their talents."Television continues to be a strong medium through which information, entertainment and education is pushed across diverse audiences. I am therefore impressed to see the introduction of a channel specifically targeting female audiences," he said.Mutua said the board is committed to the development of arts and cultural information by creating, maintaining and updating appropriate resources while establishing strategic alliances, both local and international, toward the development, coordination, regulation and promotion of Kenyan heritage.He said the film industry is a critical sector that has great potential to not only economically empower Kenyans, but also equally advocate for a socially responsible society."It is my hope that with such partners as StarTimes Media, we will further responsibly tell our rich stories while promoting our culture through such strong platforms that are broadcasting across continents," he said.Francis Wangusi, director general of the Communication Authority of Kenya, said it's heartening that there are many platforms where the local artists can explore their creativity.Wangusi said currently Kenya has 83 free-to-air TV stations and 16 subscription stations, including five internet protocol TV channels."All these platforms are in need of content, hence an opportunity for our artists and young creative minds to express themselves and be judged by the public," he said.Wangusi lauded StarTimes for launching Rembo TV, noting that they have been challenging broadcasters to create a niche market where they can be identified.He called on StarTimes to develop children's content, which will make them grow into responsible citizens as well as promote the industry to another level."I would also want to see an educational channel where professors would give lectures. We would like to emphasize education for proper growth of the community. I also want to challenge StarTimes to set up a production studio in Kenya, to be able to turn out excellent professionals into the market," Wangusi said.
