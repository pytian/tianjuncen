                Chinese ace says late coach 'is always with me' after beating Barty at US OpenNEW YORK - Wang Qiang said the memory of her former coach Peter McNamara, the late Australian Davis Cup star and Wimbledon doubles champion, was helping drive her breakthrough run at the US Open.The Chinese 18th seed is enjoying her best Grand Slam showing in New York and qualified for the quarterfinals after a 6-2, 6-4 victory over reigning French Open champion Ashleigh Barty of Australia."I think I'm really focused on the court ... I really enjoyed the way I played and I'm so happy I won," Wang said after becoming the first woman from China to reach the last eight of the US Open since Peng Shuai made the semifinals in 2014."I think I did really well today. I was really mentally strong. Now I have to just keep going."It has been a challenging year for Wang, 27, following McNamara's death in July.The Aussie coach, a popular figure on the men's and women's tours, died of prostate cancer at the age of 64."He helped me a lot. It was really tough on me when he passed," Wang said. "I think he is always here with me."Wang worked with McNamara from mid-2015 until the start of this year, when the coach's deteriorating health made it more difficult to travel, ending a partnership that coincided with Wang cracking the top 20 last season."He told me how to play the matches. He took me to professional tennis ... he taught me everything," Wang said."He always believed in me. He told me I can become the top player."Barty, who beat Wang twice last year in their only prior meetings, was undone by 39 unforced errors at Louis Armstrong Stadium.Wang now faces Serena Williams, who is seeking a 24th career Grand Slam title to match Margaret Court's all-time record, for a spot in the last four.Wang was unsure if she would watch the match between Williams and 22nd seed Petra Martic, leaving that duty to her new coach, Thomas Drouet."I think that's my coach's homework," she said. "I just want to enjoy now and my coach will tell me how to play next."I need recover for my body and we will talk about my next match tomorrow."Williams, a six-time US Open winner, romped to a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Martic to set up the quarterfinal with Wang.

                    'Coward': Epstein accusers pour out their anger in court
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                NEW YORK — One by one, 16 women who say they were sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein poured out their anger Tuesday, lashing out at him as a coward and a manipulator, after a judge gave them the day in court they were denied when he killed himself behind bars."The fact I will never have a chance to face my predator in court eats away at my soul," said Jennifer Araoz, who has accused Epstein of raping her in his New York mansion when she was a 15-year-old aspiring actress."Even in death, Epstein is trying to hurt me. I had hoped to at last get an apology, but this evil man had no remorse or caring for what he did to anyone," she said.The hearing was convened by US District Judge Richard M. Berman, who presided over the case after federal prosecutors had Epstein arrested last month.The question before the judge was whether to throw out the indictment because of the defendant's death, a usually pro forma step undertaken without a hearing. But the judge offered Epstein's accusers an extraordinary opportunity to speak in court.In addition to the women who spoke — some publicly for the first time — statements from several others were read in court by their lawyers.They vented their fury over Epstein's alleged crimes and his suicide in his jail cell Aug. 10 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges involving dozens of teenage girls. Repeatedly, the women described themselves as survivors and said they hoped coming forward would help others."I was a victim, but I will not remain a victim and be silent for one more day," said actress Anouska De Georgiou, who said she was sexually abused by Epstein as a teenager. "Although I think it's tragic when anybody dies before their time, I'm extremely relieved that Jeffrey Epstein will not be in a position to hurt any more children or any more women."Courtney Wild, who has said she was sexually abused by Epstein in Florida at age 14, called him a "coward" who had "robbed myself and all the other victims of our day in court to confront him."Araoz said she felt let down by Epstein's jailers, too."They let this man kill himself and kill the chance for justice for so many others in the process," she said.Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who has said she was a 15-year-old working at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club when she was recruited to perform sex acts on Epstein, told the court: "My hopes were quickly dashed, and my dreams were stolen."Sarah Ransome, who said Epstein pressured her into sex when she was in her early 20s, pleaded with prosecutors to go after those who helped the financier in his pursuit of victims."Please, please finish what you started," she said.Among those under scrutiny: Epstein's girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who has been accused of recruiting young women for his sexual pleasure and taking part in the abuse. She has denied wrongdoing.In opening the session, the judge called the 66-year-old Epstein's suicide a "rather stunning turn of events." He defended his decision to let the women speak, saying public hearings "promote transparency."During the 2?-hour proceeding, the women sometimes clutched one another to lend support. Most remained composed, but several cried as they described falling into Epstein's web. His suicide left some of them angry, others sad. One said she was relieved that he was gone and could abuse no others.Some women described their shame and embarrassment, saying Epstein manipulated them, dangling his wealth and power and connection to celebrities and political figures, while seizing on their vulnerabilities.Several of the women chose to testify anonymously, including one who said she was 15 when she was flown to Epstein's New Mexico ranch. While molesting her, he was also "explaining to me how beneficial the experience was for me and how he was helping me grow," she said.She said that as he abused her, she could see framed pictures of him on a dresser, smiling with celebrities.Teala Davies, taking deep breaths to steady her voice, said she was 17 when she was victimized. She said she thought Epstein was the most powerful person she would ever meet."But the end is here, and here I stand, becoming more powerful than he will ever be," she said.A New York City coroner ruled that Epstein hanged himself . But one of Epstein's lawyers, Martin Weinberg, challenged that finding during Tuesday's hearing, saying "we are told by a very experienced forensic pathologist" that broken bones in his neck were more consistent with strangulation than with suicide."Find out what happened to our client," the lawyer told the judge.Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey, though, said the manner of Epstein's death was irrelevant to Tuesday's proceedings.The judge said he thought it was "fair game" for the defense to raise concerns, but took no immediate action on the request. Prosecutors noted that a grand jury is already investigating the death.Dr. Michael Baden, the pathologist hired by Epstein's representatives to observe the autopsy, told The Associated Press Tuesday he is awaiting the report from the medical examiner's office before offering his opinion on the cause of death.Comey said the dismissal of an indictment against Epstein "in no way lessens the government's resolve to stand up for the victims"At his death, Epstein was being held without bail, accused of abusing girls in the early 2000s at his mansions in New York and Palm Beach, Florida.In the wake of his suicide, the warden of the federal jail and the acting director of the Bureau of Prisons were removed, and two guards who were supposed to be watching Epstein were placed on leave.Epstein's lawyers contended he could not be prosecuted because he signed a non-prosecution deal with federal authorities over a decade ago in Florida that resulted in a 13-month stint in jail on state prostitution-related charges. Federal prosecutors in New York said that deal did not prevent the new charges.AP

                Despite being overwhelmed by arguably the greatest female player in history, Chinese ace Wang Qiang grabbed the world's attention with her deep run at the US Open.Outsized and overpowered, Wang lasted just 44 minutes in a 6-1, 6-0 loss to 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams in their Wednesday (Beijing time) quarterfinal in New York.The result wasn't unexpected, as the American legend's ferocious combination of strength and skill proved too much for the 27-year-old Tianjin native, who was making her debut in a major quarterfinal.As Williams moves a step closer to her 24th major singles trophy, Wang, currently ranked No 18 in the world, has plenty to cheer about after earning 430 ranking points, $475,000 in prize money and, most importantly, the confidence to maintain her late-season surge in the tour's upcoming Asian Swing."I think I did a really good job in the two weeks ... the last match doesn't matter," Wang told a post-match media conference at 23,000-seat Arthur Ashe Stadium, the world's largest tennis venue."The takeaway from my two weeks here is very positive. I talked with my coach and we feel very positive about my future," she added.Asked what surprised her most about being across the net from Williams for the first time, Wang instantly replied: "Power".The way Williams hit ground-strokes from the baseline? Or the way she served?"Everything," Wang said with a smile.Williams, 37, grabbed the first five games in about 15 minutes. Then, after dropping one game, she collected the next 11 points to start a seven-game run en route to her 100th win at the US Open, dating to her debut as a teenager in 1998."It's the biggest court in the world and I felt a little bit tight throughout the match," said Wang, who now follows semifinalists Li Na (2013) and Peng Shuai (2014) as the third best performer from China at Flushing Meadows."Serena put a lot of pressure on me. She is really a great player with power that I cannot handle. I need to build my muscle and be more powerful, so I have to do more weight training."Wang is expected to rise to a career-high No 12 in next week's rankings and hopes to carry her momentum from the Open into a series of tournaments in China over the next two months."A good performance during the Asian stretch of the season last year helped me grow more confident. Hopefully I can do the same this year," she said.Wang's 21-6 record after last year's US Open included her second WTA title in Guangzhou, semifinal runs at premier events Wuhan and Beijing and a runner-up finish at the Zhuhai WTA Elite Trophy.The streak helped her crack the world's top 20 by the end of the year after being No 91 in May, and the 71-place ascent saw her stun eight top-20 opponents along the way."I was always impressed with the work ethic she has, the discipline she has, the respect she gave to her (former) coach," Wang's new coach, Thomas Drouet of France, told the US Open website."When I stopped coaching my previous player, I put her first on the list. I just have this discipline and this work ethic every day, and I felt she has this naturally. When I started with her we connected really well. It was natural."Drouet, known for guiding compatriot Marion Bartoli to the 2013 Wimbledon crown and Hungary's Timea Babos to the No 1 doubles ranking last year, began working with Wang after health issues forced her former coach Peter McNamara to quit in February.McNamara, a former Australian Davis Cup star and Wimbledon doubles champion, died of prostate cancer at 64 in July, and a grieving Wang saw her performance slip midway through the season.Having helped Wang overcome the emotional challenge to bounce back in New York, Drouet believes she has what it takes to make her name better known in the sport."I think she's the kind of player who has a capacity for analyzing. I think this is a big weapon," Drouet said."She can improve her power a bit, of course, but point by point, she makes her opponents tired. We have to add this in her game ... like Nadal is doing. He's not going to rush. He makes his opponents tired so he can finish them."

                Two kidnappers in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, were given sentences of death and life imprisonment on Monday for kidnapping and killing a 9-year-old boy in their neighborhood. The kidnappers plan to appeal, a local court said on Monday.The two men had all their personal property confiscated and were ordered to pay compensation of about 44,000 yuan ($6,170) to the victim's family, according to the verdict.On the night of May 2, 2018, a 9-year-old boy went missing from his apartment in downtown Xi'an. His family posted a missing notice in the neighborhood's online chat group. After search, the boy was found in a passageway near the roof of the building. He died after being sent to hospital.Not long before the boy went missing, at the end of April last year, defendants Ling Yuanjie and Zhao Yuhao had attempted to kidnap a girl in their neighborhood. Ling promised to give Zhao some of the ransom money to buy a mobile after the plan succeeded.On May 2, Ling decided to change the kidnap target to the 9-year-old boy, who lived in the same building as him. At 8 pm that night, he told Zhao his plan on the phone.Ling tore a sheet to cover his face and went alone to the boy's home on the 22nd floor. He took the boy to his home on the seventh floor and asked the boy to call his mother for ransom, but the boy did not call and attempted to escape by fleeing the apartment, the court said.After catching the boy, Ling pounced on him and pinned him down for several minutes until the boy stopped struggling. Ling concluded that the boy had suffocated and dumped his body in an empty space between the top floor and the roof, it said.To eliminate traces of crime, Ling removed the boy's clothing and called Zhao, telling him that the kidnapping was complete. He asked Zhao to help wipe fingerprints and remove other traces left in his home.Forensic investigation revealed that the victim died of suffocation as a result of his nose and mouth being covered, according to the court.The court said the two had kidnapped people to extort money and killed the kidnapped boy, and as a result they should be punished for the crime of kidnapping. The sentences were given according to the roles of the defendants in the crime, the facts and consequences of the crime, and the social harm.According to the criminal law, the sentence for kidnapping ranges from five years to life imprisonment. If the kidnap victim is killed or hurt intentionally, the kidnapper can be sentenced to death.Ling received the death penalty while Zhao was given life imprisonment.
