                Leading voices on China-US relations will gather in New York on Tuesday to discuss how both countries and the rest of the world have benefited from the two nations' economic and political ties and how they should work out current differences and cooperate in the future.Diplomats, business leaders, economists and other witnesses to the relationship will share their vision on the past and future of the 40-year relationship at Vision China, an event hosted by China Daily and Bank of China at Asia Society.The half-day event, "China-US Relations: 40 Years & Beyond", comes at a pivotal point in the relationship as a 14-month trade dispute has cast uncertainty on the relationship, which in the past 40 years has overcome countless challenges.Chinese Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai will deliver the keynote speech at the event. Cui, who has served as China's top envoy to the US for more than six years, has repeatedly stressed that cooperation is the only right option for both countries.Despite the two countries' differences and drastic changes over the past 40 years, the bilateral relationship will remain among the world's most important, whose sound development will continue to benefit all, Cui said at a reception on Capitol Hill celebrating the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations on June 18.Cui will be joined by a number of distinguished speakers, including Connie Sweeris, a player behind the ice-breaking "ping-pong diplomacy" of the 1970s; Kenneth Quinn, president of The World Food Prize Foundation and former US ambassador to Cambodia; Stephen Roach, senior fellow at the Yale University Jackson Institute of Global Affairs and former chief economist at Morgan Stanley and chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia; Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council and former US ambassador to Brunei, and Xu Chen, president and CEO of Bank of China USA, who is also chairman of China General Chamber of Commerce (CGCC)-USA.Maurice Greenberg, chairman and CEO of Starr Companies, will also address the audience on the topic. Chinese Consul General in New York Huang Ping will also attend the event.The event also will feature a panel discussion on Chinese companies' investment in the US, which has dropped significantly in the past two years.Participants will share their insights on business opportunities and challenges in today's environment. They will include Xiao Yuqiang, chairman of the US Management Committee of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China; Vivek K. Sarin, interim secretary of the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development; and Jeff Liu, president and CEO of Fuyao Group North America.The New York event will be the eighth Vision China since being launched in 2018.

                Purdue Pharma makes tentative deal to settle
            </a>
            <p>
                Purdue Pharma, maker of the opioid painkiller OxyContin, and the company's owners, the Sackler family, have reached a tentative agreement with 23 states and thousands of local governments to settle lawsuits stemming from the nationwide US drug epidemic.The proposed deal will cost the company and its billionaire owners, the Sackler family, between $10 billion and $12 billion, according to multiple reports. That includes $3 billion from the family's personal fortune, according to The Washington Post. The drug company and its owners faced about 2,500 lawsuits filed by nearly every state as well as cities, counties and Native American tribes charging that the company fueled the use of the addictive drug through aggressive and misleading advertising.Under terms of the proposed settlement, the Sacklers would give up their interest in the company and trustees would operate the company through a bankruptcy hearing.In addition to the $3 billion to be paid by the Sackler family in the next few years, it could add another $1.5 billion depending on the amount raised from the sale of Mundipharma, a company the family also owns that sells drugs outside the US.Purdue could file for bankruptcy this Sunday and will urge other states to join the settlement. But the deal could fall apart if a bankruptcy judge decides it doesn't have enough support from creditors, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said the deal covers about half the states that are suing the company.Purdue, based in Stamford, Connecticut, has denied that its marketing of OxyContin, launched in 1996, contributed to the opioid epidemic. However, the growing number of lawsuits has pressured the Sackler family, which has donated to museums and the arts worldwide, to reach an out-of-court settlement.The Sacklers are one of the richest families in the US, with an estimated net worth of $13 billion, according to Forbes magazine. The lawsuits allege the family put profit above health by aggressively marketing OxyContin, the brand name for oxycodone, knowing it could lead to addiction and death by overdose. Purdue Pharma had offered up to $12 billion to settle pending state and federal lawsuits.Between 1999 and 2017, about 702,000 people in the US died from drug overdoses, including 399,000 from of all types of opioids, including oxycodone, heroin and synthetics such as fentanyl.In 2017, 68 percent of the 70,000 people who died from a drug overdose, or 47,600, were killed by a prescription or illicit opioid, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported.OxyContin is a brand name for oxycodone, a prescription opioid pain reliever. First synthesized in 1916, the drug wasn't available in the US until 1939. OxyContin is a time-released formula of the drug and provides up to 12 hours of relief to patients who suffer chronic pain from surgery, cancer, injury or severe arthritis.Oxycodone creates a euphoric high, which can lead some users with a prescription to crave the drug and others to obtain it illegally. It is used in other pain medications, including Percocet, a mixture of oxycodone and acetaminophen. The latter drug is available without a prescription. Acetaminophen is an analgesic used to treat headaches or fever and used as an alternative to aspirin.The CDC said use of opioid painkillers in the US rose steadily starting in 2006 and peaked in 2012 at more than 255 million prescriptions — a rate of 81.3 per 100 persons. The overall rate of prescribing oxycodone declined from 2012 to 2017, the most recent year comprehensive data was collected, falling to a total of 191 million prescriptions, or 58.7 per 100 persons.Nevertheless, the federal agency estimated the cost of prescription opioid misuse at $78.5 billion a year, including the cost of healthcare, lost productivity, addiction treatment and law enforcement.Use of oxycodone varies by region. Prescription painkiller sales per person are about three times higher in Florida, which has the highest usage rate nationwide and a large population of retirees, than in Illinois, which has the lowest. More men than women die of overdoses from prescription painkillers, and middle-aged adults have the highest rate, although deaths occur among teenagers and young adults who illegally obtain the drug and use it recreationally without a prescription.The number of people abusing opioids is lower in rural areas, but the death rate is higher than in cities. The disparity in death rates appears to be a function of proximity to emergency care. Whites, Native Americans or Alaska Natives are more likely to overdose than other demographic groups, the CDC said.In 2017, states with the highest death rates due to drug overdoses included West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Kentucky. Washington DC also ranked high, the CDC reported.Other manufacturers of opioid drugs have already settled, including a state opioid trial in Oklahoma. But the tentative deal struck with Purdue Pharma is the first "global" settlement. It was negotiated by a team of lawyers handling the cases in federal court as well as lawyers for the states.Much of the total amount in the proposed settlement depends on the future sale of OxyContin, Purdue's signature drug at the center of the controversy. Some states have declined to join the proposed settlement because they question its valuation.New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts have not joined the tentative deal and have urged the family to sell the company immediately and stop making drugs for international markets."Connecticut has not agreed to any settlement," Willian Tong, the state's attorney general, said in a statement. "Our position remains firm and unchanged and nothing for us has changed today. I cannot predict whether Purdue will seek bankruptcy, but all I can say is we are ready to aggressively pursue this case wherever it goes — whether it is in the Connecticut courts or through bankruptcy."The company is separately negotiating with the US Justice Department to resolve criminal and civil probes, the Journal reported last week.The apparent deal comes six weeks before the start of the first trial before a federal judge in Cleveland, Ohio. The judge has recently ruled against the company in several pretrial motions.Several of the states that have named the Sacklers as defendants allege that the family has drained billions of dollars from the company since 2007, the year Purdue paid a $635 million fine to settle federal criminal and civil cases charging that it has improperly branded OxyContin.The New York attorney general has filed subpoenas in an attempt to find out where the family deposited its money, suggesting possible legal action to recover all or some of it.

                Opioid epidemic has the US in its grip

                Lawsuits allege wealthy family put profits before healthOn a bleak February day with slate-gray skies and temperatures below freezing, individuals, couples and groups, ranging in age from teenagers to retirees, gathered in New York at the Guggenheim Museum on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, opposite Central Park.They walked quietly, spreading to all floors of the museum before falling to the ground.They quickly covered the floors with white paper-mock drug prescriptions for"80 milligram pills of OxyContin" written by "Robert Sackler, MD" for "Solomon R. Guggenheim" (who established the museum) to be taken "24 times a day". Empty orange medicine bottles soon added to the clutter.The Sackler family made its fortune through the sale of OxyContin-a potent and legal opioid painkiller approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration-and has donated millions of dollars to museums.Purdue Pharma, owned by the Sackler family, faces more than 2,000 lawsuits, including actions from nearly all US states and many local governments, which allege the company falsely promoted OxyContin by downplaying the risk of addiction.

                Investment insights amid a trade standoff
            </a>
            <p>
                Kentucky needs and encourages foreign investment — especially from China, a state official said Tuesday at the Vision China event in New York.Kentucky has attracted $21 billion in foreign investment in the last three and a half years, including $2 billion from China and $200 million recently, said Vivek Sarin, interim secretary for the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development."The situation in Kentucky is one of great encouragement," Sarin said. "We hustled because business is a contact sport. You have to get out of the office."He made the comments during a panel discussion moderated by Ji Tao, president and editor-in-chief of China Daily USA. The event was held at the Asia Society and co-hosted by China Daily and the Bank of China.Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin led a delegation to China where state officials met investors and pitched Kentucky's eagerness for foreign investment.Sarin said the continuing US-China trade dispute has not affected discussions with China because business is conducted face-to-face, and politics isn't an issue."In Kentucky, we take more of a long-term view," he said. "We build personal relationships. Capital goes where capital is welcome. We make it clear that we want to do more business."Sarin said the Kentucky delegation split into two groups: politicians and business representatives. The politicians meet in one room, and the investors meet in another to keep the lines of communication open and uncomplicated.Xiao Yuqiang, vice-chairman of China General Chamber of Commerce-USA and chairman of the US management committee, said at the panel discussion that he is confident about the future because investment benefits both nations.The market demands efficiency at every level of production. This requires sound management practices and a deep reservoir of human capital, factors that abound in China, he said.Jeff Liu, another panelist who is a CGCC director and CEO of Fuyao Group North America, said Chinese companies operating in the US must understand cultural differences to get the most out their workers.Liu appeared in American Factory, a recently released movie about Fuyao Glass that took over an abandoned General Motors factory in Ohio to produce auto glass. The movie examines the cultural factors as blue-collar American workers adapt to high-tech management techniques.He said attracting young workers to manufacturing is difficult because the work is demanding, and technology jobs pay much better. Nevertheless, training can create engaging jobs that will attract younger workers who will thrive in an industry increasingly dependent on automation."It's hard to find young, talented people," Liu said. "It's not old-style manufacturing, and now involves a lot of automation. We need to work together because automobile production is a nonstop production line."The demands of the production line are unforgiving, and therefore everyone must give their best effort to meet the demands of auto companies, including GM and BMW, while maintaining worker morale. A lapse in either will delay deliveries and erode profits, he said.Liu said his operation is not directly affected by the continuing US-China trade dispute, and he's confident foreign investment will continue to fuel expansion."We work together - and that's a success," he said.
