                Sub-Saharan Africa's tourism shows great potential, report says
            </p>
            <p>
                CAPE TOWN - South Africa has emerged as one of the highest-ranked countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, according to the latest Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report. The report, which ranks 140 countries on their relative strengths in global tourism and travel, was released on the sideline of the World Economic Forum on Africa in Cape Town. Although Sub-Saharan Africa is the lowest-ranking travel-and-tourism region in this year's report - with all but three of the countries performing lower than the global average - the region is expected to have the second-highest growth rate in tourism over the next 10 years, the report says. This may bolster the region's attractiveness to international investment in travel and tourism, it predicts. The report says Africa also has huge potential for nature-based tourism thanks to its relatively underdeveloped but rich natural resources. Mauritius is the highest-ranking Sub-Saharan country, largely due to its good business environment, and hygiene and international-openness scores. South Africa is second, followed by Seychelles. Rwanda currently leads the region in safety and security, while Tanzania ranks first in terms of natural resources. When considered by sub-region, Southern Africa is the most competitive, especially outscoring other sub-regions in tourist-service infrastructure, prioritization of travel and tourism, and price competitiveness. East Africa comes in second and West Africa ranks third. The report also says that West Africa has seen the highest growth in travel-and-tourism competitiveness in the region. The index reveals the sector's resilience but warns of an approaching "tipping point", where such factors as less-expensive travel and fewer tourist barriers increase demand to unsustainable levels. The burden of over-tourism is already being felt by many travel hot spots, the report says. Xinhua (China Daily Global 09/18/2019 page15)

                Africa looks to China for tourism boost
            </a>
            <p>
                Upgraded offerings, nature attractions helping countries improve earningsTo view the animals he saw on TV as a child, Chen Bo visited Africa twice - in December last year and in May."I stayed there for 10 days during each of my visits," said Chen, 40. "I went to several places in Kenya, such as Masai Mara National Reserve, Meru National Park and Kenya National Park."He was amazed by the diversity of animals there and Africans' efforts to protect them."I don't have any problems when traveling there. People there are very hospitable," Chen said.Janet Kwamboka, a manager at a travel company in Nairobi, is buoyant about Africa's prospects of drawing more Chinese tourists in the near future.Unlike before, she said, Chinese tourists do not limit their preferences. "Besides visiting the famous Masai Mara National Reserve to view the wildebeest migration in July, their uptake on new offerings is high and brings them to Kenya all year round. This is a boost to the country's tourism sector."Kwamboka said Chinese visitors now want to see rare wildlife species such as the Grevy's zebra, Somali ostrich, reticulated giraffe, gerenuk, also known as the giraffe gazelle, and oryx."They request to stay in hotels with golf courses. In addition, Chinese tourists take a four-hour journey to visit tea farms to experience tea farming in Kenya," she said. Sporting activities such as mountain climbing, zip lining and river rafting are also popular choices.Kenya counted about 82,000 Chinese visitors in 2018, a 37.7 percent increase compared with the previous year, according to Kenyan government data. However, the East African country hopes to attract around 1 million Chinese tourists each year.Kenya is the third-largest tourism-driven economy in sub-Saharan Africa and contributed $7.9 billion, or about 8.8 percent, to the country's GDP. The tourism sector supported 1.1 million people last year.Other African countries also hope to improve on the relatively low number of Chinese visitors to the continent.While Europe received more than 12.4 million Chinese tourists in 2017, according to in-flight digital advertiser PXCom.media, Africa received only a fraction of the 130 million Chinese outbound tourists. The China Tourism Academy estimates that Africa had about 800,000 Chinese tourists in 2017.African countries with the largest number of Chinese tourists in 2017 were Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa, Mauritius and Zimbabwe, according to Dragon Trail, a China-based digital marketing agency.Observers and policymakers believe Chinese travelers can improve Africa's earnings.Najib Balala, Kenyan Cabinet secretary of tourism and wildlife, said: "For a long time we have been obsessed with traditional markets. Nevertheless, emerging markets, such as Asia and Eastern Europe, have numbers to reckon with. We need to upgrade our offerings to capture smart, well-traveled Chinese millennials. We need to up our game."Besides low competitiveness, the continent's tourism sector has been affected by instability, epidemics and security challenges.A 2018 report titled "Sovereigns - Africa, Closer Trade and Investment Ties With China" by ratings agency Moody's said 10 African countries - South Africa, Mauritius, Morocco, Egypt, Kenya, Namibia, Cape Verde, Botswana, Tunisia and Tanzania - are most likely to benefit from increased numbers of visitors from China. The view is backed by the 30 percent annual growth in the number of Chinese arrivals since 2012.In recent years, the number of Chinese visitors buying Africa tour packages has jumped, according to the Luxury Chinese Traveler 2018 Report.A report by China CYTS Tour Co said the number of Chinese travelers bound for Africa increased 40 percent per year in the past five years.Ctrip, an online travel agency based in Shanghai, said it saw a steady increase in travelers to Africa in the past three years.The increase in Chinese tourists going to Africa is due to improved Sino-African cooperation, according to Rajneesh Bhuee, an economist based in Kenya. She said Chinese have increasingly become aware of the continent's offerings, thanks to the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation."This is besides the high-level visits by both China's president and premier to the continent in the recent past. ... Notably, these events have not only put emphasis on political, economic and trade ties but people-to-people relationships, which have a direct impact on tourism."The China Outbound Tourism Research Institute expects about 180 million Chinese to travel abroad this year, compared with 149 million in 2018. It estimated that the figure will rise to 260 million by 2030.Africa can benefit from these numbers by prioritizing the Chinese market, observers said.In South Africa, the tourism industry is pursuing new strategies to further understand the needs of Chinese visitors. Industry analysts said Chinese tourism is vital to Africa's economic growth."It is important for tourism businesses in South Africa to realize the benefits of becoming China-ready," said Mansoor Mohamed, the Beijing-based head of the Asia-Pacific region for South African Tourism. "We are dissecting vital information on how to enter the lucrative Chinese outbound travel market."Early this year, South Africa announced that it had signed an agreement with China for 10-year multiple entry visas that will pave the way for an e-visa system.According to Moody's, an increasing number of Chinese tourists traveled to Mauritius, Morocco and Tunisia without a visa, while they got a visa on arrival in Egypt and Tanzania.Upgrading offerings is also seen as a way to increase the number of visitors to Africa."We can no longer sell outdated offerings to the Chinese millennial. Some businesses have already invested in upgrading their establishments. Language can no longer be the barrier if we are to inject more earnings into our economy," said Balala, the Kenyan Cabinet secretary.Kwamboka, the travel company manager in Nairobi, said the hospitality sector has been trying to provide authentic Chinese cuisine and employ Mandarin-speaking staff. It has also invested heavily in providing Mandarin-language signs in popular sites, she saidZhang Jie, director of Ctrip's theme-tour department, said that in-depth and ecology-related tour packages in Africa have been increasingly popular among Chinese travelers in the past few years."I've visited a travel service provider in Africa who offers field training courses and travel routes close to nature, such as picking leaves in forests and appreciating birds," she said. "The travelers followed their guides and some experts in nature research to primitive houses where no modern bathrooms are available, but the travelers were really happy to be one with nature."Zhang said about 200 Chinese tourists have participated in such programs so far. "Travelers in the program can get in very close touch with the nature of Africa. It's a very good choice for them to relieve pressure."Data from Lvmama, an online travel agency based in Shanghai, showed that its users' reservations for tour packages to Africa from April to June increased 43 percent year-on-year.Cai Hong contributed to this story.

                Kenyan center feted at World Travel Awards
            </a>
            <p>
                Nairobi has been named Africa's leading business travel destination, while the Kenyatta International Convention Center has been awarded Africa's leading meetings and conference destination at this year's 26th annual World Travel Awards.Nana Gecaga, the convention center's chief executive officer, said winning such a prestigious international award is a huge boost and motivation for Kenya's tourism sector."This award goes out to all of us in the meetings industry, who work tirelessly to ensure that we are at the top of our game. The awards truly attest to the fact that Nairobi and KICC offers the best MICE experience in the region," she said, referring to meetings, incentives travel, conferences and exhibitions.Gecaga, who spoke at the Africa and Indian Ocean Gala ceremony in Mauritius, where the awards were presented, expressed her gratitude to everyone who voted for Kenyan brands in the various categories.The convention center beat various nominees in the category, including the Cairo Convention Center in Egypt; Kigali Convention Center in Rwanda; Palais Des Congress Marrakech in Morocco; and the Sandton Convention Center, the Cape Town Convention Center and the Durban Convention Center, all in South Africa.This is the first time the Kenyatta International Convention Center has participated in the awards, and took the award from Durban, which has held it for the last nine years.The award is expected to spearhead Kenya's marketing campaigns' positioning the destination as attractive for meetings, incentives travel, conferences and exhibitions even as the country is embarking on increasing its conventions and conference facilities.The Kenyatta International Convention Center, which is mandated to market Kenya's conference tourism globally, has over the years worked greatly towards ensuring that Kenya retains its position as the most preferred destination for business events in Africa.Kenya recently raised its profile owing to the high-end international conferences it has hosted in the recent past, thereby making its bid to host more international conferences much easier.

                Chinese engineer helps improve lives in West Africa
            </a>
            <p>
                Yin Guohua, an engineer with China Jiangsu International, has been working in African countries for 15 years to help build infrastructure and improve local people's lives.He said that he has overcome many difficulties to do his job well in Africa, including language barriers, health problems and safety concerns.In some French-speaking West African countries, Yin and his colleagues, who could only speak English as a second language, hired engineers from Mauritius to be their translators and partners.Due to relationships formed in previous projects with the Mauritius engineers, who could speak both English and French, the projects in West Africa also went well.Sometimes Yin had to overcome his fear of rebels and tropical diseases to continue his work.In 2014, the company was building the first four-star hotel in Guinea when Ebola broke out in West Africa. While people from some countries left for safety concerns, Yin and his team decided to stay to finish their project."A hospital was located across the road from our construction site," he said. "We saw patients falling down in front of its gate and medical workers disinfecting the site and their bodies."Due to strict management, no one got the disease in Yin's team and they managed to finish their work on time.Yin also donated money to local workers, generators to villages and helped build schools."I always tell my colleagues that are new to Africa that they must respect local cultures and local people," said Yin. "We want to share our skills and techniques with local workers to help them better their lives."

                A band led by an aboriginal singer from Taiwan was on stage at the Blue Note Jazz Club in Beijing, and the leader attributes its sounds to the laid-back nature of the ethnic groups there.Matzka, a singer-songwriter born in Taiwan, performed in front of about 300 people at the Blue Note Jazz Club in Beijing recently. "I am from a small village in Taitung county. From an ethnic tribe called Paiwan. We love to party, to sing, and to dance. Tonight you are the people of my tribe. So, let's have a party," he says. The round-faced singer-songwriter, who sports shoulder-length dreadlocks, was at the first branch of New York's famous jazz club to perform his reggae fusion songs, along with his band, Mr WooHoo.The day before the show, Matzka signed contract with Universal Music at the same venue, accompanied by his band members: guitarist Sun Wennan, keyboardist Yan Peng, drummer Boodhoo Yan Jonathan and bassist Grenade Henry Frederic; the latter two members both from Mauritius.Matzka and his band plan to tour Shanghai, Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, Chengdu, Sichuan province and Guangzhou, Guangdong province, till September.The band will return to Beijing for a concert on Dec 28. This summer, the newly born reggae band made its debut on The Big Band, a reality show hosted by the iQiyi video platform. It won over the audiences with its reggae beats and improvised sounds.Matzka met his band members in Shanghai when they performed at the Shanghai Jazz Festival last September and soon they decided to play music together.

                Tibet hosts academic conference on Tibetan medicinal bathing
            </a>
            <p>
                More than 100 experts and scholars of Tibetan medicinal science gathered in Lhasa, capital of China's Southwest Tibet autonomous region, on Friday for an academic conference on Lum medicinal bathing of Sowa Rigpa.The two-day forum, hosted by the region's health commission and the Institute of Tibetan Medicine and Astrology, known as the Menteskhang locally, is the first of its kind in the region.An inherent component of ancient China, Lum medicinal bathing of Sowa Rigpa was named a regional and national intangible cultural heritage in 2018 and 2014, respectively.It was named a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity on Nov 28, 2018 at a convention in Port Louis, capital of Mauritius.Kalzang Yudron, director of the commission, said together with Indian Ayurveda medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, Tibetan healing science, with a history of thousands of years, is one of the world's four key traditional medicinal sciences.It has contributed greatly to human health, the harmonious development of society and the sustainable development of civilization, he said."It is a practice of better performing the commitments to UNESCO, and we will work hard to ensure the conservation and inheritance of the cultural heritage," said Kalzang Yudron."Conducting such as a conference is part of an effort to work on UNESCO's five-year preservation plan, and it will contribute to the standardization, talent training, and diagnosis behavior of Tibetan healing science."Lum medicinal bathing of Sowa Rigpa comprises knowledge and practices on life, health, and illness prevention and treatment, and it is the 40th Chinese heritage inscribed in the UNESCO list.It is widely practiced in the Chinese provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet autonomous region."Medicinal bathing is an ancient civilized way of life, which is not only used for hygienic reasons, but also its unique cultural connotations," wrote Liu Yinghua, associate research fellow at the Beijing Tibetan Hospital of China Tibetology Research Center, in one of her essays on Tibetan medicinal bathing."Tibetan medicinal bathing has a profound relationship with religious rituals, social customs, sports, entertainment, and health treatment," she said in the essay.

                Chinese aid helps put African nations on track
            </a>
            <p>
                Rail line just one of numerous assistance projectsEditor's note: In Footprint, a series of stories recalling important examples of China interacting with the rest of the world, we follow the path the country has taken over the past seven decades.As the afternoon wore on, the crowd at the railway station in the Tanzanian port city of Dar es Salaam kept swelling. Loudspeakers mounted in the waiting room continued to announce new departure times.Asha Maimuna, a middle-aged passenger, noted wryly: "Our safe arrival is important, not really the departure time."She was traveling to Mbeya, a trip of 813 kilometers, to visit her parents. Some roads are impassable, she said, and journeys overland are prone to accidents."The Makuba Express train is a necessity for many of us, despite the long delays and sluggish speed," Maimuna said.The Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority, or TAZARA, has been a lifeline for landlocked Zambia, creating innumerable job opportunities for the two countries as the line snakes 1,860 km from Dar es Salaam to the copper town of Kapiri Mposhi in Zambia. It is one of China's efforts to aid developing countries.A white paper－The Right to Development: China's Philosophy, Practice and Contribution－which was released in December 2016, said China had provided some 400 billion yuan (about $56 billion) in development aid to 166 countries and international organizations over the past 60 years.It has trained more than 12 million personnel from developing countries and sent around 600,000 people to assist in the development in other nations. Of those, 700 have given their lives, the white paper said.Assistance from China has made a significant contribution to improving the lives of those in the recipient countries.For the past 43 years, Boniface Zimba has been taking the line operated by the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority to visit his family in rural Zambia.Sometimes, the 79-year-old runs into former workers from the authority, which he left 24 years ago. They always discuss how the China-built railway has boosted the economy and changed their lives."We were proud to build it," Zimba said. He left his mining job in 1970 to join 13,500 Chinese technical and engineering personnel and 38,000 Tanzanian and Zambian workers who helped establish the rail authority.Zimba said the steady job and good pay enabled him and his wife to start a family and provide their eight children with an education.The authority was funded by China and established between 1970 and 1975, with commercial operations starting in July 1976. It linked Kapiri Mposhi in Zambia to Dar es Salaam on the Tanzanian coast, providing freight and passenger services.Wang Luo, director of the Institute of International Development Cooperation, responsible to the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation at the Ministry of Commerce, said, "The railway has been an economic catalyst for eastern and southern African nations and a symbol of the friendship between China and Africa."Emmanuel Matambo, an analyst at the Center for Africa-China Studies at the University of Johannesburg in South Africa, said, "The Tanzania-Zambia railway line played a seminal role in demonstrating China's solidarity with anti-colonial and anti-apartheid agitation in Africa."He added that despite not functioning at its best, the line's ideological importance has been so influential that it has dispelled many arguments about China's alleged colonial or harmful designs on Africa."The railway authority was thus an altruistic contribution to Africa from a country that wants to be seen as a kindred spirit to the continent. It created the trust that China still enjoys in Africa today," Matambo said.

                State Bank of Mauritius and China UnionPay launch cards in Kenya
            </a>
            <p>
                China UnionPay and the State Bank of Mauritius (SBM) jointly launched debit and prepaid cards in Kenya's capital Nairobi on Thursday.According to Li Jichang, chairman of both SBM Group and the UnionPay Africa Regional Council, the introduction of UnionPay payment system deepens its relationship with SBM group and will now enable SBM clients to gain access to the UnionPay network. Accepted in 174 countries and regions with issuance in 55 countries and regions, it is the No. 1 payment solution in the world, ahead of VISA and Mastercard."In partnership with more than 2,000 institutions worldwide, our clients at SBM Kenya will now benefit from cross borders facilities as well as UnionPay's high quality and secured services," said Li.The SBM UnionPay cards can be used to pay for purchases or access cash at any UnionPay accepted shopping outlet or automatic teller machines (ATMs). They can also be used for e-commerce (online) shopping on secure websites on the internet. These outlets include restaurants, airlines, hotels, duty free shops at airports, retail shops, supermarkets, dry cleaners, movie theaters, pharmacies, petrol stations and medical facilities.Paying for goods and services using the SBM UnionPay cards at retail merchant POS is free. And with Quick Pass or NFC technology, SBM UnionPay cardholders will be able to make secure low value transactions without a PIN code, which is also called the "tap and pay" service.
