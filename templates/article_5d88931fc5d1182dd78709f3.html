                Vo Van Duong cares for trees in front of an S-House 2 built in his garden in Vietnam's southern Mekong Delta province of Long An. Hoang Dinh Nam / Agence France-PresseVo Van Duong's bamboo and coconut leaf house looks much like others deep in Vietnam's Mekong Delta. But unlike them, his seemingly simple abode is designed to withstand typhoons, flooding and earthquakes - and at a cost of less than $4,000 could herald a new wave of cheap, sustainable housing.The natural materials on its surface belie the high-tech internal structure of the farmer's new home, which uses steel struts and wall panels as a defense against the elements in this natural-disaster-prone region.

                Technology Special: Freescale Technology Forum opens in Shanghai
            </a>
            <p>
                 Freescale Senior Vice President and Chief Sales and Marketing officer Henri Richard at FTF. Five years ago, the inaugural Freescale Technology Forum (FTF) China debuted in Shanghai. Today the event again opens its doors in the city that is truly a global showcase as the host city of the World Expo. "Unleashing your imagination and powering your innovation is the essence of FTF", said Henri Richard, chief sales and marketing officer for Freescale Semiconductor. "A robust metropolis like Shanghai is an ideal location for it." More than 2,500 people have signed up for the event's exciting line-up of activities. In addition to Freescale executives, other compelling speakers at the general sessions include Hu Xuehao, principal expert at the China Electric Power Research Institute, and Hugh Herr, athlete, scientist, innovator and futurist. The Forum's interactive tech lab known as the "engineer's playground" will feature more than 80 product demonstrations. There will be also two high-profile panels that bring together industry experts to address the latest trends and dynamics about adoption of the smart grid and the auto infotainment market. A theme of connected intelligence for the connected generation resonates through the news and presentations. Announcements include increased efforts in technologies and innovations that define new digital lifestyles and a greener and safer world. *Support the China Ministry of Education to develop future engineers:  Freescale introduces a turnkey metering reference design built upon an advanced microcontroller customized for the electrical metering market.In 2005, Freescale was selected by the Ministry of Education to enter into a 5-year agreement to develop curriculum program, labs and organize the mainland's 1st university smart car design context. The goal was to provide students with hands-on opportunities to experience innovation and teamwork among China's top engineering students. Since then, tens and thousands of students from over 300 universities have taken part in the popular design contest using Freescale's auto solutions. At today's general session, officials from the ministry continue the successful collaboration with Freescale by entering another 5-year agreement on stage. *Enhanced experiences for online gamers: As the leader in communications processors, 70 percent of all Internet connections utilize a Freescale solution. Freescale has invited BigFoot Networks, the leading networking technology company behind the Killer line of gaming network cards, to showcase how it prioritizes application traffic over the network to ensure maximum gaming potential. The BigFoot network card uses Freescale's PowerQUICC II Pro to help reduce lag and ping in order to improve the online gaming experience. *Medical innovations take center stage: As an emerging leader in the medical industry, Freescale used the forum to showcase new medical innovations such as its Medical Kiosk, a portable, easy-to-use telemonitoring design that allows patients and physicians to run routine health screenings at home or remotely. The forum entitled Technology and the Human Spirit - Merging Body and Machine led by Hugh Herr is likely to provide inspiration for many. Hugh will share his story about losing his legs 28 years ago and how technology helps him design state-of-the-art prosthetics that allow him to go beyond human capabilities. *Freescale Consumer Electronic Fashion Show: Technology cannot ask for a better place to strut its stuff than Shanghai. There will be a catwalk where Shanghai's new models show how consumer electronics are entwined with their everyday lives. Participants can get a first glimpse of the E-800, the latest Havon e-reader based on Freescale's i.MX technology. Weighing only one-pound, it provides consumers an optimal digital reading experience and longer battery life. *Panelists discuss smart grid adoption: Echoing the theme of the World Expo, the Better City with Smart Grid- Better City with Smart Grid; Better Life with Smart Home to Drive Sustainability and Progress - panel will be moderated by John Chiang, president and managing director of the US Information Technology Office. He will be joined by Hu Xuehao, deputy chief of engineering at the China Electric Power Research Institute, Seung-Il Moon, professor with Seoul National University, Zhang Pei, director of Smart Grid from Accenture, and Bruno Baylac, Freescale's director of Marketing, Global Industrial Segment. *Panel on auto infotainment: Industry experts Yu Yang, deputy general manager of OnStar Shanghai, Li Wenjie, general manager of HangZhou System, Wang Zhigang, chairman of EMG Infotech Company, Ying Yilun, CEO of Pateo who is the architect of the Telematics system in Rower 350, Isaac Wang, senior analyst for China research at iSuppli, and Freescale will discuss how the future cars embodies green, connectivity and safety by providing drivers with the latest telematics features, connectivity and the OnStar safety promise to allow drivers peace of mind on the road.  Expanding on over 30 years of sensor history, Freescale has announced Xtrinsic sensing solutions for motion and touch applications.(China Daily 08/24/2010 page14)

                London Fashion Week runs last leg in relay
            </a>
            <p>
                A model has her hair styled before a reception on the eve of London Fashion Week September 13, 2012. The reception was for Livia Firth's Green Cut initiative to promote environmentally sustainable fashion.[Photo/Agencies]London fashion designers take up the baton for Britain on Friday, strutting the global stage in a capital city that has already captivated millions around the world with the Olympics, Queen Elizabeth's diamond jubilee and last year's royal wedding.Related Photos: The Queen's Diamond JubileeRelated Photos: Highlights of London Olympic closing ceremonyJust a few short weeks after a closing Olympic ceremony which put fashion at the heart of a glittering show celebrating the best of Britain in front of the world, buyers, journalists celebrities and models have begun to descend on London fresh from New York and on the way to collections in Milan and Paris."London is like the epicenter of the world for everything and I think it really showed in the closing ceremony of the Olympics how influential and important British fashion is," stylist and TV presenter Brix Smith-Start told Reuters.Leading UK designers Christopher Kane, Vivienne Westwood, Paul Smith and Burberry's Christopher Bailey will present their spring/summer 2013 collections to fashion buyers from home and abroad in a year of continued austerity across Europe."I always love the diverse representation of collections showcased in London. It is great to see leading favorites such as Christopher Kane, Erdem and Burberry Prorsum alongside emerging designers and I am looking forward to seeing Rag & Bone in the lineup this season," said Harrods Head of Womenswear Helen David.An estimated £100m ($158.9m) of orders are expected to be placed during London Fashion Week, according to the British Fashion Council.More than 80 designers are expected to show their latest collections in London, with cutting edge labels PPQ, Meadham Kirchoff, Louise Gray and Erdem touted as the hottest tickets."Meadham Kirchoff are just completely creative, you never know what they are going to do next, they stage some of the most theatrical, mesmerizing and moving shows. They're completely original, one-off, beyond. They're fabulous," Smith-Start said.The stylist, who runs luxury boutique Start London in East London, also names Richard Nicoll and Fashion East among her favorite shows to watch.SILKS, LACE AND GREAT GATSBYThe twice-a-year event runs from September 14 to September 18, for an expected audience of 5,000 buyers, journalists and celebrities.David expects to see a more pared down aesthetic with clean lines and subtle details for Spring/Summer 2013."Summer is always great for mood lifting colors, so it will be interesting to see which brights stand out," David said."I think we'll see more attention placed on beautiful woven materials, silks and lace. With the new (Great) Gatsby movie, now set to be released next summer, designers are sure to take inspiration from the delicate feminine theme," she added.New designers Vita Gottlieb, Teija Eilola and Haizhen Wang have been preparing their debut collections for their first showcase at London Fashion Week."I think they expect new ideas. A kind of vibrant creativity which London is so famous for and especially in the fashion industry, we do churn out the most fantastic designers in the world, I think," said Gottlieb.With the stakes so high, designers could be forgiven for playing it safe in order to survive the tough economic times. But London's burgeoning fashion scene is not one to shy away from a challenge."London is really where groundbreaking stuff happens and people take risks. You're constantly surprised," said blogger Emily Johnston, who runs the successful fashion news blog, Fashion Foie Gras."There's a real buzz as you leaving the building because everybody is talking about what they've just seen."

                Reducing mutual mistrust between US and Chinese militaries is the foundation for new type of relationship between major powersDuring his trip to the United States last week, General Fang Fenghui, chief of the General Staff of China's People's Liberation Army, visited a US military base in San Diego and the National Defense University in Washington and met his US counterpart Martin Dempsey at the Pentagon.The two sides had an in-depth exchange of views on a series of issues concerning bilateral relations and their military-to-military relationship and reached an important consensus on promoting more joint exercises in search and rescue, humanitarian aid and disaster relief and establishing a dialogue mechanism between the strategic planning departments of the two militaries.The trip, which represents the two powers' common aspiration to strengthen military trust and reduce misunderstanding and misjudgments, came amid efforts by Beijing and Washington to build a new model for the relationship between great powers, the US' insistence on pushing forward its Asia-Pacific rebalancing strategy and increasing tensions over the maritime disputes in East Asia.Since the end of the Cold War, the military relations between the two countries have experienced ups and downs. Although witnessing remarkable improvement since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, there are still many rifts stopping the two sides from having a positive relationship.The lack of military mutual trust highlights the mutual suspicion about the other's military strength and strategic intentions. Washington is caustic about the so-called lack of transparency of China's military spending, worried about China's development of new military equipment, uncertain about China's military strategic intention, and believes China is carrying out an "anti-access/area-denial" strategy, which poses a challenge to the US' military supremacy.The US still considers itself the global leader and is focusing on guarding against China's military rise in the Asia-Pacific region, which has inevitably led to speculation and misgivings about China's military capabilities. The lack of military mutual trust might lead the two countries to fall into the historical trap of conflict between a rising power and an established power. To prevent such a scenario, it is imperative that the two militaries improve their level of interaction and familiarity to mitigate suspicions and cultivate trust.Fang and his entourage's touring of the US aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan and littoral combat ship USS Coronado, both state-of-the-art naval vessels, shows the US' emphasis on bilateral military exchanges and its open attitude. The visit made progress on important issues and will push forward China-US military exchanges to new heights, and help realize the institutionalization and concretization of bilateral exchanges.Building confidence is conducive to the concrete implementation of the consensus reached by the two heads of state to build a new type of relationship between the two powers. The formation of a new military-to-military relationship sits at the heart of this.Many of the existing conflicts and contradictions between China and the US are related to their suspicions about each other's military strategy and forces. Military mutual trust needs to be strengthened to reduce the chance of any dangerous misunderstanding.

                Young animator finds new life planting trees
            </a>
            <p>
                Huang Yanhai, 29, is one of the young people who followed their parents in planting trees to help control water and soil loss in Sanzhou, Fujian province.Huang, a former professional animator who worked in cities such as Shanghai and Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province, returned to his hometown of Sanzhou in 2013 to help his father take care of the orchards.Huang Jinyang, his father, 61, is the first farmer in the town to plant waxberry and ornamental trees that help control water and soil loss, a problem that has long plagued the area.Having graduated from university in 2003, Huang Yanhai said he got used to the fast-paced life in big cities and was ready to strut his stuff as an animator."When I received a phone call from my father two years ago, he asked me to come back to help him with the orchard business. Initially I felt a bit reluctant, because I thought in that case I could not continue my animation dream.""Nothing is more important than sharing the burden and easing worries for my father," Huang said.A quick learner, Huang picked up farming skills such as tree-planting and tree-care techniques from his father soon after he returned to Sanzhou."It's nice to come back and see the hills that were barren in my childhood become verdant, as many villagers are dedicated to the forestation business to solve soil erosion," Huang said.Adding to Huang's joy is that several companies he worked for still ask him to create animated characters."After finishing the orchard work, I usually focus on the animation project at 7 pm and will spend five hours on it," Huang said.The part-time job could earn Huang 11,000 yuan ($1,790) per month, roughly equal to his monthly salary in Shanghai.The orchard generates more than 10,000 yuan of net income a year for Huang."In the future, I want to invest the money earned from the animation projects into making waxberry wine to expand my green business," Huang said.Joining those in Changting's younger generation who protect the environment is Lin Xinrong, who in 2012 quit his job as an accountant in Longyan, Fujian province, and returned to Sidu, where his father planted tea-oil trees and operated a pig farm.The 25-year-old, who had no experience living in a rural area, came to the town out of a sense of responsibility and obligation.His father, Lin Muhong, 66, started to plant tea-oil trees on barren hills in 2008 to fight the town's soil erosion. Now, more than 500 hectares of trees have been planted."I studied everything, such as applying fertilizer and removing grass," Lin said. He also needed to deal with emergencies such as getting a vet for a pig that had difficulties giving birth."My father is too old to handle all of this by himself. It is correct and necessary that I've come back," Lin said.Given it takes about a decade to gain profits from planting tea-oil trees, Lin was in no hurry to make a fortune."Some trees are growing as tall as me, and I'm sure they will bring me sweet fruits," Lin said.Wu Chenghuo, director of the county's forestry bureau, said young people are an important force for building a more beautiful Changting."They make the green business sustainable as many farmers have become old," Wu said.To encourage more young people to get in on the action, the bureau has been offering free tree seeds and technological guidance to youths who continue their fathers' projects, Wu said.Contact the writers at sunli@chinadaily.com.cn and humeidong@chinadaily.com.cn

                Working teams have been established to coordinate and implement potential action plans Action, inclusiveness and foresight are all stressed by China's current leadership in domestic governance, and those qualities are poised to influence next month's G20 summit in Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province, making it a milestone event for global growth, development and reform. China hopes to transform the G20 meeting from a case-by-case, solution-seeking summit into an institutional long-term mechanism for ongoing debate. On Monday, the Foreign Ministry for the first time revealed the detailed agenda for the upcoming summit, and also President Xi Jinping's busy schedule during the two-day event, when he will preside over more than 10 major activities. It will be the first time China has hosted the event, and Xi's to-do list is indicative of its significance. Since 2013, Xi has attended three G20 meetings - in the Russian city of St Petersburg, Brisbane in Australia and Antalya, Turkey - but the Hangzhou meeting will undoubtedly be the most important for him. Under the theme "Building an Innovative, Invigorated, Interconnected and Inclusive World Economy", the Hangzhou summit will focus on critical issues in global growth and developmental reform. Innovation, the new industrial revolution and the digital economy will appear on the agenda for the first time. More important, following a proposal by China, a number of special working teams have been established on these specific topics to supervise and coordinate the implementation of possible action plans and proposals. Since the G20 first met in Washington in 2008, leaders attending the summits have passed many proposals and adopted a number of action plans. Still, problems remain for the global economy. It takes time for some remedies, such as the reform of global governance, to take effect, but some previous prescriptions, although temporarily effective in boosting growth, have proved to be of little use in maintaining sustainable development. For example, leaders of a number of developed economies have constantly pledged to strengthen coordination in formulating and implementing macroeconomic and financial policies, and have also resisted growing calls for protectionism in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. However, sometimes the pledges have resulted in little concrete action. The globalization of the world economy means decisive growth factors are more concentrated in the developed economies, and development appears more exclusive than inclusive; about 12.5 percent of the global population still lives in poverty. To address these problems, China last month hosted the first G20 trade ministers' conference in Shanghai, and established a foundation for institutional platforms for meetings of trade ministers. China pushed the G20 to make global investment a guiding principle this year, which will evolve into the first multilateral investment regulation framework. Those efforts should facilitate global investment and trade. These endeavors, and others, will help to turn the G20 into a long-term mechanism for the solution of global issues. The G20 is by no means just a club of 20 world powers strutting their resolutions, but the premier global forum for action and solutions. liyang@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily 08/19/2016 page12)

                Western China's first unmanned bus in trial operations
            </a>
            <p>
                A 14-seater new energy, unmanned bus struts its way just outside the headquarters of Sichuan Bus Manufacturing Co., Ltd – the manufacturer of the vehicle – in suburban Chengdu.According to Zhang Jiaqi, chief engineer at Emei Bus Research Institute (part of the bus manufacturer), this driverless vehicle is the first of this scale in Sichuan Province and in China's entire western region."It's currently still in [the] testing stage. We first aim for the bus to operate within fixed routes, closed parks and scenic spots. In about two to three years, hopefully it can be fully applied to the city's public transport system," Zhang said.The unmanned bus is 5.9 meters long, 2.1 meters wide and 2.7 meters high. It has a test speed of 20 kilometers per hour.Zou Yingquan, associate professor of the Intelligent Research Team at Southwest Jiaotong University, said the most challenging part is the system's ability to cope with complex road conditions and emergencies."For example, breaking into pedestrians or animals coming from the side. The other challenge is when there is water on the road or obstacles such as well covers," added Zou, who is in charge of the intelligent control system of the unmanned bus.But Zou insists that this is more of an experiential journey for the public, which will encourage experts to discover and produce new driverless technologies in the process.When it comes to the driverless bus technology used, Zou cited China's Beidou system for accurate positioning – to the centimeter level. Meanwhile, he said the vehicle's brake and steering control system is independently developed.The unmanned bus is designed by the School of Architecture & Design of Southwest Jiaotong University.The school's R&D professor, Huang Tao, said the idea initially came about to develop transportation with sustainable development in the city."Public transport, new energy, automated intelligence. We hope these advantages will be reflected in our unmanned bus," Huang said.
