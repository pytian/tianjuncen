                President Xi's Europe visit opened a new chapter for China-EU cooperation President Xi Jinping's six-day visit to Italy, Monaco and France from March 21 to 26 was a diplomatic victory for China this year. China secured Italy's commitment to join the Belt and Road Initiative and reached consensus with key European countries on working together to promote a new global governance order based on multilateralism. The agreement and consensus took place against a backdrop of contentious domestic debate in the European Union on future China-EU relationship, and the United States' intensive lobbying against the Belt and Road Initiative and the use of Chinese equipment in 5G networks. The candid dialogues held during Xi's visits holds promise of a prosperous new phase in China-EU relations. The sentiment surrounding China's Belt and Road Initiative has turned sharply negative over the last 12 months with headlines about projects that haven't materialized, project loans that are not sustainable and charges that China is using the Belt and Road Initiative as a geopolitical tool. Italy's joining the Belt and Road Initiative is significant as it is the first G7 member to do so. To participate in the initiative amid the pressure being applied by the United States and some members of the EU takes both courage and careful evaluation of both the merits and risks of participation. The Italian government has clearly decided that the potential benefits outweigh the risks. The Italian commitment imparts much needed prestige and confidence in the Belt and Road Initiative and helps to fend off charges of lack of transparency, corruption and debt traps levied against the Belt and Road Initiative. It is a welcome development before the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in April in Beijing. The Italian participation has prompted German Chancellor Angela Merkel to praise the Belt and Road Initiative as a positive visualization of interaction, interrelation and interdependence among nations. She expressed hopes that European countries will take a more active role in the initiative, with the caveat that the Europeans are looking for reciprocity when they open their infrastructure market to China. Merkel's request for more transparency and a multilateral approach to the Belt and Road projects dovetails with the new direction that China is advocating in relation to tighter future collaborations between the EU and China on Belt and Road infrastructure related projects. One of the major problems facing such an ambitious endeavor as the Belt and Road Initiative is the absorption capacity of the recipient countries. However, the EU members are mostly developed countries, and they possess stronger institutions to effectively implement the infrastructure project investments into tangible economic gains quickly. This is an advantage that many developing countries do not possess. The long-term future of the Belt and Road Initiative rests on the successes of its projects so the more such projects are successfully completed, the greater Belt and Road Initiative's reputation will grow, helping it to open more doors in other countries along its route. The highlight of Xi's trip was the discussions he had with Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on the challenges to multilateralism on the last day of his visit. All the leaders stressed the need for cooperation between the EU and China to work together on issues ranging from World Trade Organization reform to countering climate change. They particularly stressed the need to renovate multilateralism while keeping their differences and suspicions in check. While acknowledging that the EU and China are competitors, Junker said that "competition among us is a good thing" revealing a new open-mindedness to China-EU relations. The announcements of both sides showed that they all understand this new relationship is expected to minimize future misunderstandings. The EU decision before the summit to shun the US call to ban Huawei products on its 5G deployment and instead demand scrutiny of 5G products on a nondiscriminatory basis was a welcome gesture to President Xi. And the stress laid on cooperation over differences was apparently a pushback by both China and the EU against US unilateralism. The friendly atmosphere of Xi's visit clearly indicated a preference by all for cooperation to resolve their differences and to encourage trade and investment reciprocity. The details over the implementation on what is agreed in President Xi's visit will be refined at the next EU-China Summit on April 9 in Brussels. Both the Italian participation in the Belt and Road Initiative and the consensus on multilateralism are long term projects that will take time to work out. But if they can be properly implemented, the March visit of Xi to Europe will be one of the most significant diplomatic events for China in 2019.

                    World embraces Xi's vision for development
                </p>

                President's concept is winning support across the globe. Cao Desheng reports.China has translated its commitment to advancing the building of a community with a shared future for mankind into concrete action since the concept was enshrined in the Constitution at last year's session of the National People's Congress, the nation's top legislature.One year on, the vision, representing the prospect of common development and progress, has gained wide international support and helped produce synergy among the international community to pursue a better future amid growing global challenges.Zhang Yesui, spokesman for the second session of the 13th National People's Congress, said on Monday at a news conference that 152 countries and international organizations have signed cooperation documents with China on the Belt and Road Initiative - an important platform for building a community with a shared future on the principle of extensive consultations and joint contributions for benefits shared by all.The trade volume between China and countries participating in the BRI has exceeded $5 trillion, total Chinese investment in those countries has surpassed $70 billion, and more than 200,000 jobs have been created, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.The China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank celebrated its third anniversary in December. The number of approved members has risen to 93; they come from nearly every continent and represent broad support for the multilateral financial institution.Over the past three years, the bank has approved $7 billion in financing for development projects in Asia and Africa, with the aim of promoting sustainable economic development through infrastructure investment.In November, China launched the first China International Import Expo in Shanghai as part of efforts to expand opening-up and help other countries benefit from the nation's rapid economic growth.The expo attracted more than 3,600 companies from around the world, and more than 400,000 domestic and foreign buyers attended. Deals for intended one-year purchases of goods and services worth a combined $57.83 billion were reached at the six-day event.In an interview with People's Daily, Antonio Guterres, UN secretary-general, said that the proposal to build a community with a shared future for mankind, pioneered by President Xi Jinping, is an important contribution to the world.Xi, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, proposed the concept in March 2013 during a speech at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. He elaborated on the vision in September 2015 at summits commemorating the 70th anniversary of the UN's founding.The vision sees countries forging partnerships in which they will treat each other as equals and engage in mutual consultations and understanding, and create a security architecture that features fairness, justice, joint contributions and shared benefits. In addition, they will promote open, innovative and inclusive development that benefits all, increase inter-civilization exchanges to enhance harmony, inclusiveness and respect of differences, and build an ecosystem that puts nature and green development first."These five aspects, taken together, constitute the overall approach to creating a community with a shared future for mankind, depict a bright future for the progress of international relations and represent a major innovation in the theory of major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics," wrote Wang Yi, State councilor and foreign minister, in an article posted on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.In January 2017, when Xi visited the UN Office in Geneva, he delivered a keynote speech titled "Work Together to Build a Community With a Shared Future for Mankind" that called for the building of an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity, and explained how countries can build a community with a shared future.Win-win cooperation The vision, together with the idea of building a new form of international relations featuring win-win cooperation, constitutes the main pillars of China's foreign policy.Zhou Li, vice-president of the Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament, said Xi's vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind aims to turn the aspirations of people across the world to live a better life into reality.Zhou is a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the country's top political advisory body, whose current meeting of more than 2,000 political advisers is an important event in the nation's political life.Qu Xing, China's former ambassador to Belgium and also a member of the CPPCC National Committee, said in an article that Xi's vision represents a global value that aims to address the common challenges facing humanity.This global value entails the perspectives of interrelated international power, shared interests, sustainable development and global governance, Qu said, adding this is especially important given recent profound changes in the international situation.The Munich Security Report, published ahead of the 55th Munich Security Conference held last month in Munich, Germany, said that when looking at the current state of international affairs, it is difficult to escape the feeling that the world is not just witnessing a series of small and large crises, but that there is a more fundamental problem."Indeed, we seem to be experiencing a reshuffling of core pieces of the international order," wrote Wolfgang Ischinger, the conference chairman, in the report's foreword. "We have to think about how we can preserve the core pieces of the international order."Xi has said on many occasions that the world is undergoing changes not seen for a century.The international order, based on rules established with the founding of the UN after World War II, is being challenged by rising unilateralism, isolationism and populism. Against such a backdrop, countries are looking for solutions to questions such as how to uphold the postwar international order with the aims and principles of the UN Charter at the core.They are also trying to find solutions to the question of how to promote democracy, rule of law and a proper balance in international relations, as well as how countries can work together for a better future amid growing economic globalization, multipolarization, cultural diversity and digitalization.Wherever they are, whatever beliefs they hold, and whether they like it or not, people from across the world live in a close-knit community with a shared future, Qu said.He cited the international cooperation to counter the 2008 financial crisis as an example, saying the countries' interdependence and cooperation led to the growing importance of the G20, which brings together the European Union and 19 of the world's leading economies.In a globalized world, isolationist moves or a beggar-thy-neighbor approach could lead to conflicts or even wars, bringing disastrous consequences for society, he added.Staunch promoter Xi is a staunch promoter of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and has advocated it on various important occasions at home and abroad in recent years.From the annual conference of the Boao Forum for Asia in April to the Qingdao Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in June, and the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in September to the first China International Import Expo in November, Xi availed himself of home-field diplomacy to promote the concept.He also used overseas trips such as the BRICS Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, and the G20 Summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to expound on the notion, and called on countries to work with China to promote the vision with peace and development at the core.In a keynote speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, in November, Xi said economic globalization is a sure way for human society to achieve development, and the multilateral trading system has created opportunities for all."In today's world, countries' interests are so closely intertwined, and the global supply chain, industrial chain and value chain are so closely connected. We are all links in the global chain of cooperation; increasingly, we are becoming one and the same community with shared interests and a shared future," he said.Therefore, facing trade frictions with the United States, China has adhered to seeking solutions through dialogue based on mutual respect, equality and good faith.Based on that principle, Xi reached an important consensus with his US counterpart Donald Trump during their meeting in Buenos Aires in December, which helped reduce tensions.Significant positive progress is also being made in subsequent trade talks as the two sides work on a final agreement on trade disputes.Analysts said Xi aims to develop a model of how a rising country can avoid confrontation with an established one, and that vision will show that different civilizations can enrich exchanges and coexist peacefully.Ji Zhiye, former president of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said Xi's vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind is rooted in the cultural gene of "great harmony" in the time-honored Chinese civilization.It continues and develops the concepts of peaceful coexistence, peaceful development and a harmonious world, said Ji, also a member of the CPPCC National Committee. He added that China and African nations are taking the lead in building an even stronger community with a shared future.The 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation was attended by 40 presidents, 10 prime ministers, one vice-president and the chairperson of the African Union Commission, setting a record for diplomatic events hosted by China.During the summit, Xi announced eight major initiatives to enhance cooperation with African nations, covering such fields as industrial promotion, infrastructure connectivity, trade facilitation and green development - a forward-looking arrangement considered as a road map for China and the continent to build an even stronger community with a shared future.As the world's second-largest economy, China's contribution to global growth reached 18.4 percent a year on average from 1979 to 2017.In 2017, the proportion accounted for 27.8 percent, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.At the annual conference of the Boao Forum for Asia, Xi announced a series of new measures to expand reform and opening-up, demonstrating China's willingness to work with the outside world.They included broadening market access, easing foreign equity restrictions, lowering automobile import tariffs and increasing imports.SolutionsIn an article published in the January issue of the magazine Contemporary World, Su Ge, former president of the China Institute of International Studies, wrote that China's diplomacy last year illustrated the country's firm resolve to deepen reform and opening-up, as well as its resolute determination to uphold globalization and make its contribution to global governance.He added that the country's diplomatic moves introduced the China solution, wisdom and impetus to the world's common development.In January, in a speech at the Hellenic National Defense College, Zhang Qiyue, ambassador to Greece, said that over the past year, China has actively participated in the reform of the global governance system to move economic globalization toward more open, inclusive, balanced and win-win results.Despite profound changes in the international landscape, the goal of China's foreign policy remains the promotion of peace and global development, said Zhang, a member of the CPPCC National Committee.China has also participated constructively in the resolution of hot topics such as the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, the Iranian nuclear issue and peace talks in the Middle East, she said, adding that the country remains the top contributor of peacekeeping forces among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.At a gathering in Beijing to commemorate the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, Xi again stressed that China remains committed to deepening reform and expanding opening-up, as well as advancing the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.That vision is being increasingly accepted worldwide. In February 2017, the phrase was for the first time incorporated into a UN resolution by the 55th UN Commission for Social Development.It has also been adopted by the UN Security Council, the Human Rights Council and the First Committee of the UN General Assembly, thus turning the Chinese concept into an international consensus.Yasuo Fukuda, former Japanese prime minister, was quoted by Xinhua News Agency as saying that it is a common ideal for mankind to build a world without conflict, one with equal development opportunities and with every person in it blessed with happiness.

                    Temple leads the way in recycling rubbish
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The Jade Buddha Temple in Shanghai has come into the public spotlight with sorted garbage bins illustrated in Chinese, English and Japanese.Juexing, abbot of the Jade Buddha Temple, called on Buddhist worshippers and tourists visiting the temple to engage in garbage sorting. "Garbage sorting is a good way to purify the environment. We are delighted to contribute to ecological progress," he said.Located in Putuo district, Shanghai, the Jade Buddha Temple is famous for its Myanmar Jade Buddha. Millions of people from home and abroad visit the temple each year. Earlier this month, sorted garbage bins for recyclable, dry and wet garbage were placed in the corridor connecting the Grand Hall and two other palaces, near the parking lot and the vegetarian restaurant of the temple.The temple's move came after the city published a set of regulations on household garbage sorting and recycling, which will take effect on July 1 this year. The city has started pilot programs in communities to color-code every garbage bin and garbage carrying vehicle by category.The temple was quick to take voluntary action to join the practice. "The new regulation has brought us opportunities to promote environmental protection among the believers," said Master Titing, who is in charge of garbage sorting at the temple.He said apart from garbage bins in public areas, the temple had arranged smaller categorized garbage bins in the monk dormitory."In 2017, when I went to Japan with Abbot Juexing for the first time, the abbot noticed that the Japanese sorted garbage in five to six categories and treated waste sorting as an effective way to protect the environment and recycle resources. He told me to take photos so that we could learn from them," Titing said.He said professionals were invited last week to train monks in the temple on garbage sorting.The temple also launched a program via the official WeChat account, using cartoon characters to guide readers on the temple's garbage sorting requirements.Ana Sousa, a tourist from Brazil, showed an interest in the new garbage bins. "I haven't noticed such kind of garbage bins on the streets in Shanghai. But I'm sure this is something that a Buddhist temple should have because I've heard Buddhists in China advocate good behavior," she said.Abbot Juexing, who is also vice-president of the Buddhist Association of China, said: "From the perspective of Buddhism, everything in the world is interrelated and interdependent. Human beings are part of nature. We must cherish natural resources and mustn't waste or pollute them."Xinhua (China Daily 04/01/2019 page7)

                    Xi's Europe trip opens new chapter
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The visit of President Xi Jinping to Italy, Monaco and France from March 21 to 26 was a significant diplomatic event for China this year. The country secured Italy's commitment to join the Belt and Road Initiative and reached consensus with key European countries on working together to promote multilateralism based on a new order of global governance.The latest dialogue holds promise for a new phase in the China-EU relationship.Italy's decision to join the BRI is unlikely to have been a haphazard one based on simple emotional or ideological factors. The Italian government clearly has understood the potential benefits of the initiative.The Italian commitment imparts more credibility to the BRI and is a welcome development before the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation later this month in Beijing.The Italian participation prompted German Chancellor Angela Merkel to praise the BRI as a positive realization of interaction, interrelation and interdependence among nations. She expressed hope for Europeans to take a more active role in the initiative, with the caveat that the Europeans are looking for reciprocity when they open their infrastructure market to China.Merkel's request for more transparency and a multilateral approach to initiative-linked projects dovetails with the new direction that China is advocating in relation to closer collaborations between the EU and China on BRI infrastructure-related projects. The EU countries are mostly developed countries, and they possess stronger institutions to implement the projects to turn the infrastructure investments into tangible economic gains. This is an advantage that many developing BRI participating countries may not possess.The long-term future of the initiative rests on the successes of its projects, so the more that such projects are successfully completed, the greater the BRI's reputation, helping it to open more doors in other countries along its routes.One of the highlights of President Xi's Europe trip was the flying in of Merkel and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to hold a four-party dialogue with French President Emmanuel Macron and the Chinese leader on the last day of his European visit. The meeting was billed by the French government as a "high-level meeting on the challenges of multilateralism". All the leaders stressed the need for cooperation between the EU and China to work together on issues ranging from reforms at the World Trade Organization to countering climate change. They particularly stressed the need to renovate multilateralism while keeping their differences and suspicions in check.Juncker commented that the EU and China can do great things together, but they should do so in a cooperative way while they are competitors at the same time. However, his statement that "com-petition among us is a good thing" reflects a new open-mindedness on the issue of future China-EU relations. The two sides are now committed to cooperating on issues of common interest and competing when their respective development interest is threatened. The pronouncements of both sides showed that they all understand this new relationship well and it will help to minimize future misunderstandings.The celebratory atmosphere of Xi's visit clearly indicated a preference by all for cooperation to resolve their differences and to encourage trade and investment reciprocity.The details on the implementation of what was agreed upon during Xi's visit will be refined in the next EU-China summit on April 9 in Brussels. Both the Italian participation in the BRI and the consensus on multilateralism are long-term undertakings that will take time to work out. If these can be properly implemented, the March visit of the Chinese to Europe will be one of the most significant diplomatic events for China in 2019.The author is a senior visiting research fellow at the Cambodia Institute for Cooperation and Peace.

                    Top think tank proposes model to improve research
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The Institutes of Science and Development, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASISD), one of China's top science think tanks, has published a new theory and methodology on Thursday to help think tanks conduct scientific, fact-based research and create innovative and constructive solutions.The new theory, called Data Information Intelligence Solution (DIIS), is a research model that examines the interrelation of research orientation, process and methodology -- the pillars of think tank research.The model also acts as a tool box that allows researchers to easily select the appropriate methods and direction for their work, ensuring the subsequent research is done factually and effectively, with a strong focus on solving problems.Think tanks are playing an increasingly important role in aiding government decision-making, and their performance is a key indicator of a country's governing capability, said Pan Jiaofeng, the president of the institutes and model's creator.Chinese think tanks first emerged in the 1980s, a latecomer compared to developed Western countries. Since 2013, China has significantly ramped up its support for building high-level think tanks, hoping to fulfill the nation's growing need of insightful and high-quality research to aid decision-making and evaluation, he said.However, systematic issues such as their purpose, research focus and methodology, as well as how to evaluate them are key challenges in think tank research and development, he added.To tackle these issues, Pan and his team spent the last two years exploring and combining basic theories and principles of think tank construction to find a logical system that can quantifiably clarify the role of think tanks and improve their research output."Research quality is the foundation of think tank construction," he said. "But the lack of research theories and methods is the most serious problem undermining research quality for think tanks both domestically and abroad."The DIIS model approaches this issue by breaking think tank research into three dimensions: research orientation, process and methodology, each containing smaller, interrelated components.When applied to an xyz-axis, the interrelation of these three dimensions can form a cube-like structure where researchers and administrators can intuitively identify their correlations and find the right tool or basis for the project.For instance, if researchers want to probe the meaning of a certain data set (process-axis) for a general analysis (methodology-axis), they can follow the axis on the cube and find analytic hierarchy process, patent mapping, and utility functions are suitable for the task.If administrators want to find the principles for creating a solution (process-axis) in an evidence-oriented project (orientation-axis), then they can find feasibility, reliability and rigorousness are the top priorities.A detailed guide and application of the DIIS model can be found in the book titled DIIS Theory and Methodology in Think Tanks by Pan Jiaofeng and his research team, and published by Science Press on June 27, 2019.
