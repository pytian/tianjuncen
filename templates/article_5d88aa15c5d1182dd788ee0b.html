                Nigeria has pulled out of the World Economic Forum going on in Cape Town, South Africa,  after a series of deadly attacks on foreigners, including Nigerians, in South African cities.Nigerian Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo was scheduled to address a panel on universal energy access on Thursday.The Nigerian government threatened to take action and the ministry of foreign affairs advised its citizens from venturing into "high risk" and "volatile areas" in South Africa.On Wednesday, South African companies MTN and Shoprite closed stores in Nigeria after retaliatory attacks on their businesses.As South African President Cyril Ramaphosa vowed to clamp down on the attacks, police reported that five people have been killed in South African cities while several businesses owned by foreigners have been looted and destroyed in three days of violence. About 50,000 people have been displaced, according to media reports.The violence was allegedly sparked after a taxi driver was shot by unknown people on the street on Monday.African Union Commission chairperson Moussa Faki has also condemned the attacks as several African countries cautioned their citizens against venturing into trouble zones until the situation was brought into control.The World Economic Forum on Africa officially kicked off on Wednesday. The three-day event is expected to attract more than 1,000 policy makers, entrepreneurs and experts to discuss the continent's economic growth.Event organizers said 10 heads of states were expected to attend. The theme of this year's gathering is "Shaping Inclusive Growth and Shared Futures in the Fourth Industrial Revolution."

                LAGOS -- A Chinese scientist, together with his Nigerian research partner, won Nigeria's most prestigious science award on Wednesday for their outstanding contribution to scientific and technological innovation, the award advisory board announced here.Wang Meihong and Mathew Aneke won this year's Nigeria Prize for Science worth $100,000 for their works on carbon capture, utilization, and biomass gasification and energy storage for power generation, the prize advisory board told a news conference.In its 15-year history, it is the first time that a non-Nigerian has been awarded the prize, which is sponsored by Nigeria LNG Limited.Akpoveta Susu, chairman of the advisory board, said that their works would address critical environmental issues, notably deforestation, carbon production, climate change and the resultant effects such as erosion, drought and desertification.He said their joint works "demonstrated innovative and holistic strategy to tackle climate change impacts and therefore merits the Nigeria Prize for Science Award 2019.""This year's award has highlighted the international nature of the award which involved a joint research between a Nigerian and a non-Nigerian, both collaborating on works which precipitate great potential for solutions to the global issue of climate change," he added."We congratulate Professor Wang and Dr. Aneke for a job well done. They have been consistent in their research efforts geared toward development of environment friendly and alternative power supply technologies," Susu told Xinhua.According to Susu, there will be an awarding ceremony in October in Nigeria.Wang is a professor of energy systems at the University of Sheffield in Britain. He is a chartered engineer and has published over 100 technical papers and industrial reports.Aneke, a graduate of Federal University of Technology in Nigeria, is a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Sheffield with expertise in process design and modelling, power system analysis, power generation, renewable energy and environmental protection.The Nigeria Prize for Science is an annual Nigerian science award since 2004 for excellence in science breakthroughs.

                GUANGZHOU - Chinese Basketball Association president Yao Ming said he would take all the responsibility for China's poor performance in the FIBA Basketball World Cup."Me!"Yao said immediately after he was asked by a reporter who will be the one responsible for China's performance.China lost to Nigeria 86-73 to finish second in Group N with two wins and three losses, failing to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics directly from the World Cup."It is me who disappoint the fans," Yao said."The fans had great expectation for China at the World Cup, but we could not make it," the 39-year-old added.Yao took charge of the Chinese Basketball Association in 2017. He carried out reforming measures on professional league and youth academy."This (World Cup) is a window for us to look out the world. The gap between China and the world leading basketball countries has been enlarged ."We have determination to keep our reform on, including professional league, youth academy and sports education," Yao said.

                    Yao vows to expand reforms
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                National team's disappointing World Cup effort reflects stagnating developmentIn the wake of China's dismal performance at the home World Cup, national hoops boss Yao Ming is vowing to deepen reforms to overhaul the nation's flawed basketball development.After leading China to an eighth-place finish at the 2008 Olympics, Yao, an eight-time NBA All-Star and now chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association, is coming to grips with the real possibility that China will almost certainly snap its long streak of Olympic qualification by not competing at next year's Tokyo Games.Overwhelmed 86-73 by a stronger and faster Nigeria in front of a raucous crowd in Guangzhou on Sunday, China finished its World Cup campaign with a 2-3 record, losing Asia's only available direct Olympic berth to Iran after its continental archrival finished 17 points higher in aggregate margin of wins.Having qualified for every Olympics since its debut at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, China now has only a theoretical chance of making the cut for Tokyo by going up against global heavyweights in a 24-team qualifying tournament next June, where tickets for each of the six-squad group winners will be up for grabs.Overseeing basketball in a country where Olympic success is a major factor in allocating financial support, Yao is nonetheless determined to not let the poor Cup campaign deny his efforts to reform the sport's lagging development.Asked after the loss to Nigeria who should shoulder responsibility for China's woes, a grim-faced Yao responded, "Me!", as some outraged fans called for head coach Li Nan to step down."It is me and my association that disappointed the fans," said Yao, who took over the CBA in early 2017 as the association's first leader promoted from outside government ranks."We have been forced to open our eyes to realize how far the world has gone in front of us in basketball development," he said."Discouraged by the results, we should never let the disappointment shake our faith in carrying on the efforts in professionalizing the league, improving youth and coach training programs while expanding school participation," said Yao, who retired from the Houston Rockets in 2011.
