                Japan to remove S. Korea from trade 'whitelist' as planned
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                TOKYO - Japan's Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko said on Tuesday that Japan will remove South Korea from a "whitelist" of nations entitled to simplified export control procedures as planned, a move certain to deepen the rift between the feuding neighbors."We will carry out (the plan)," Seko told a press conference, denying that the move is aimed to strike a blow on the South Korean economy."This is a domestic decision aimed at implementing the appropriate export controls. It's not meant to impact relations between Japan and South Korea," he added.The measure is set to take effect at midnight Tuesday, which has already been approved by the cabinet of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. It means South Korea will no longer enjoy minimum trade restrictions on sensitive goods including electronic components, and Japanese companies must receive case-by-case approval from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan before such goods can be exported.Earlier this month, Japan decided to remove South Korea from its "whitelist" of trusted trading partners, after tightening regulations last month on its export to South Korea of three materials vital to produce memory chips and display panels.South Korea has since taken Japan off of its own "whitelist" of trusted trade partners and announced tighter restrictions for importing coal ash and some waste recycling materials from Japan.Last week, South Korean government announced the decision to scrap the General Security of Military Information Agreement, or GSOMIA with Japan on exchanging classified military information.

                    Japan decides to revoke S. Korea's preferential trade status

                TOKYO - Japan on Friday decided to remove South Korea from a list of nations entitled to simplified export control procedures.The Cabinet of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe approved the plans to remove South Korea from its "white list" of countries, raising the stakes in a bitter diplomatic row between the two neighbors.The removal of South Korea from the list will take effect on Aug 28 following the necessary completion of domestic procedures, Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Hiroshige Seko said at a press conference.Seko maintained that the move by Tokyo was not aimed at restraining trade or supposed to damage bilateral ties between both countries, although observers have noted that bilateral relations have already sunk to new lows in recent times amid an ongoing labor dispute and Japan's previous tightening of export control regulations.Japan has already tightened regulations early last month on its exports to South Korea of three materials vital to make memory chips and display panels, which are mainstays of the South Korean economy, in a further escalation of souring ties between both parties.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, however, told a separate press briefing on the matter that Japan will deal with South Korea the same way it treats other countries in the region."We don't believe there would be any impact on global supply chains," Japan's top government spokesman said.Suga previously reiterated that Japan believes that it is an appropriate step from enforcing effective export controls to remove South Korea from the white list.Japan has a total of 27 countries on its whitelist, including the United States, Britain, Germany, Australia, New Zealand and Argentina, and whitelisted countries can, through simplified procedures, receive products exported from Japan that could be potentially be diverted for military use.South Korea has been on the list of nations entitled to simplified export control procedures since 2004, which cover a wide range of items, except for food, timber and other goods.In order to then export the products to countries not on the white list, the countries only need to obtain approval from Japan's trade ministry.The South Korean government had urged Japan not to proceed with its removal from the white list, which it estimates could have a negative bearing on more than 1,000 items in key industries spanning the auto and petrochemical sectors.Experts close to the matter said that the measures could adversely affect both South Korean manufacturers and Japanese exporters as their supply chains are closely connected.Japanese and South Korean foreign ministers failed to resolve differences between the two countries in a recent meeting in Bangkok, Thailand.

                SEOUL -- South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Friday that his government will resolutely take corresponding measures against Japan's export curbs, expressing deep regret over the "economic retaliation".Moon made the remarks during an emergency cabinet meeting, convened after Japan's removal of South Korea from its whitelist of trading partners to tighten regulations on its export to South Korea."(The removal) is a very reckless decision that rebuffs the diplomatic efforts to resolve the problem and further exacerbates the situation. I express profound regret," Moon said.Moon warned that the Japanese government will be entirely held accountable for what will unfold going forward, saying Tokyo was responsible for having made the situation worse by ignoring Seoul's efforts to diplomatically resolve the issue."The (South) Korean government will resolutely take corresponding measures in response to Japan's unjustifiable economic retaliatory measures," Moon said.The president said Seoul had countermeasures, with which to respond, noting that it will step up responses in a phased manner according to the measures taken by the Japanese government.

                SEOUL -- South Korean Minister of Economy and Finance Hong Nam-ki said Friday that the country will tighten export regulations on Japan in response to Japan's removal of South Korea from its whitelist of trusted trading partners.Hong, who also serves as the deputy prime minister for economic affairs, told a press briefing that South Korea will take actions to strengthen the export management towards Japan by "removing Japan from the whitelist."The minister said the government will speed up the process of taking Japan's export restriction to the World Trade Organization as Japan's action is in violation of the WTO rules.Japan's action will affect 1,194 strategic materials in trade between the two countries, but 159 items will be actually influenced when excluding items that are not used here, not made in Japan, or can be replaced with other items, Hong noted.He said the government will help local companies find alternative import sources, simplify the import process of alternative items and reduce tariff burden.The government will provide support for the development of parts and materials and the construction of factories to expand the production of the affected materials.

                    ROK president calls for cooperating with DPRK to create peace economy amid trade row with Japan
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                SEOUL - The Republic of Korea (ROK) President Moon Jae-in on Monday called for creating a peace-driven economy through cooperation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) during a meeting with his senior secretaries.The appeal was made after Japan's removal of the ROK last week from its whitelist of trusted trading partners that are given preferential treatment for export, according to the presidential Blue House."The recent incident reaffirmed our sense of the urgent need to create a peace-driven economy. Japan's economy holds advantages over the (South) Korean economy in terms of the size of its economy and the domestic market," Moon said."The realization of a peace economy through inter-Korean economic cooperation will allow us to immediately catch up with Japan's advantages," the president noted.Moon said his government will not languish in pessimism or give up on the peace economy because of fluctuations in the inter-Korean and the DPRK-US relations."When the two Koreas make concerted efforts with the confidence that peace economy will open up a unique future of opportunities for us, we will be able to achieve denuclearization and ensuing peace on the Korean Peninsula and bring about common prosperity upon this foundation," Moon noted.Criticizing Japan for its export restriction, Moon said Japan undermined the free trade order.Japan's export curbs came in protest against the ROK top court's rulings that ordered some of Japanese companies to compensate ROK's victims who were forced into hard labor without pay during the 1910-45 Japanese colonization of the Korean Peninsula.Moon vowed to turn the current situation into an opportunity to build a springboard for the ROK economy to reach a new level through innovative growth and the homegrown development of industrial parts and materials.

                    S. Korea removes Japan from whitelist of trusted export partners

            <p class="style-content">
                SEOUL - South Korea on Monday decided to remove Japan from its whitelist of trusted export partners after Tokyo's such removal earlier this month.South Korean Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Sung Yun-mo told a press briefing that Seoul's export control of strategic materials will be run to meet the basic principle of the international export control system.Sung said it will be hard to closely cooperate with a country, which violates the basic principle of the international export control system or continues to run the system inappropriately.Under the revised act on the export and import of strategic materials, Japan was dropped off South Korea's whitelist of trusted export partners that are given preferential export procedure for strategic materials.It came after Japan took South Korea off its whitelist earlier this month. Japan tightened regulations early last month on its export to South Korea of three materials crucial for manufacturing memory chips and displaying panels.The Seoul's revised act was slated to take effect next month after the collection of public opinion and the legislation office's deliberation on it for about 20 days.Sung noted that if the Japanese government calls for consultation during the deliberation period, the Seoul government would be ready to accept it at any time and any place.Japan permitted the shipment of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photoresist to South Korea last week, the first approval of a chip material export to South Korea since its tighter export control of such materials in early July.However, South Korea still saw uncertainties despite Japan's approval.Japan's export curbs came in protest against the South Korean top court's rulings that ordered some of Japanese companies, including the Nippon Steel and the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries among others, to compensate the South Korean victims who were forced into hard labor without pay during the colonization.The Korean Peninsula was colonized by Imperial Japan from 1910 to 1945.

                SEOUL -- South Korea's presidential Blue House said Thursday that it decided to scrap the military intelligence-sharing pact with Japan amid the trade spat between the two countries.Kim Hyun-chong, deputy director of the National Security Office (NSO) of the Blue House, told a press briefing that the government decided to end the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), saying it would notify the Japanese government of its decision through diplomatic channels.South Korea and Japan signed the GOSMIA in November 2016 to share military intelligence on nuclear and missile programs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).The GSOMIA had been automatically renewed each year in August. If either party wants to scrap the pact, the party will be required to notify the other of its intention 90 days ahead. This year's notification deadline falls on Aug 24.Kim said the Japanese government removed South Korea from its whitelist citing a security problem caused by the damaged trust between the two countries, noting that the removal caused a "grave change" in security cooperation between the two sides.The Blue House official said the government came to a conclusion that it does not serve national interests to keep exchanging sensitive military information with Japan.The decision was made amid the rising trade dispute between Seoul and Tokyo, caused by Japan's tightened control last month on its export to South Korea of three materials vital to produce memory chips and display panels, which are the mainstay of the South Korean export.Earlier this month, Japan dropped South Korea off its whitelist of trusted trading partners that are given preferential export procedure. In response, Seoul took Tokyo off its whitelist of trusted export partners.

                SEOUL -- Director general-level diplomats from South Korea and Japan held talks in Seoul Thursday amid the rising trade spat between the two countries.Kim Jung-han, director general of the Asian and Pacific affairs bureau at South Korea's foreign ministry, met in Seoul with his Japanese counterpart Kenji Kanasugi, who arrived here earlier in the day, to exchange opinion on issues of mutual concern, including the wartime forced labor, according to Seoul's foreign ministry.The South Korean diplomat delivered to his Japanese counterpart Seoul's strong regret and protest against Japan's enforcement of the decision to remove South Korea from the whitelist of trusted trading partners that are given preferential export procedure.Kim urged Tokyo to rapidly retract the export restrictions, which came after Japan tightened control last month over its export to South Korea of three materials vital to produce memory chips and display panels, the mainstay of the South Korean export.Kim said that South Korea and Japan should rapidly start "unconditional and sincere" dialogues between the trade authorities to resolve the issue.Regarding the alleged plan of Japan to discharge into the Pacific Ocean its nuclear polluted water from the 2011 Fukushima nuclear power plant meltdown, Kim told Kanasugi that Japan needs to offer South Korea more detailed information on how Japan would dispose of the contaminated water.Greenpeace, an environmental group, claimed that Japan recently pushed a plan to discharge into the Pacific Ocean more than one million tons of the high-level radioactive contaminated water from the Fukushima power plant.The South Korean diplomat delivered to his Japanese counterpart the grave concern of the South Korean people and the government about the discharge, the Seoul ministry said.
