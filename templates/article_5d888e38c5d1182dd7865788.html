                    South Africa's natural appeal
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The country's tourism authorities are working to enhance its allure among Chinese travelers, Xu Lin reports. South Africa is taking action to appeal to more Chinese to answer the call of the wild. South African Tourism, the country's official tourism-marketing agency, recently staged its annual travel-trade road show with the theme, "Wild, authentic South Africa", in Beijing, Shanghai and Shaanxi province's capital, Xi'an. It announced new strategies to draw more Chinese visitors at the events. "Discovering a wild, authentic South Africa is not just about the animals but also about discovering yourself and bringing out the wild in you," Mansoor Mohamed, who's in charge of the agency's Asia-Pacific operations, said at the Beijing event. "Connecting with the wild gives you a sense of inner expansion, perspective and life meaning, allowing you to challenge your preconceptions and reinvent yourself through a wild, authentic lifestyle." Tourist arrivals from China to South Africa exceeded 97,000 last year. The number of arrivals this January was 22 percent higher than in January 2018. Tourism revenue generated by Chinese visitors increased nearly 70 percent last year compared with 2017.That's largely because their average stays increased to 10 days, and more are seeking premium experiences. Mohamed says that South Africa is also a leader among responsible-tourism destinations. "We've won many awards for conservation and responsible tourism," he says. "Our aim is that our children, grandchildren and their offspring will be able to enjoy the beauty of South Africa in the future, as well." He says many Chinese visitors are concerned about environmental protection and community development. "South Africa is doing well in its environmental protection efforts for tourism. That's why we are able to see such a wide variety of wildlife there," says Zhou Wei. The 33-year-old office worker from Beijing traveled to South Africa with his wife and 5-year-old daughter for two weeks in February during this year's Spring Festival. "The country's natural scenery and wildlife are perfect for parents and children to explore and spend some quality time together," he says. They saw an elephant fall prey to lions and learned about "the law of the jungle". They also enjoyed beaches, oceans and city views of Cape Town, and visited a local vineyard. The family of three joined a small, high-end safari trip and stayed overnight in a national park to have an encounter with nature. A local tour guide sought out the wild animals that they wanted to see and taught them how to identify different types of plants. At Boulders Beach near Cape Town, Zhou was moved to see tens of thousands of penguins hatch their eggs under the heat of the sun. "It's just like parenthood for humans - we'll happily do anything for our children," he says. Since a colony of African penguins settled there in 1982, increasing numbers of penguins have flocked to the location where they're placed under the protection of the authorities. "It's easier for Chinese people to travel to South Africa than before, as the visa policy and air connectivity have improved over the years," Mohamed says. South Africa has visa centers in 11 cities across China, such as Zhejiang province's capital, Hangzhou, Hubei province's capital, Wuhan, and Sichuan province's capital, Chengdu. Authorities are working to reduce processing times. They are planning to increase the centers' human resources this year. Chinese travelers can also choose from 33 routes to South Africa operated by 12 airlines. Air China launched nonstop flights between Beijing and Johannesburg three times a week in 2015.In January, it extended this route by adding Guangdong province's Shenzhen as a stopover. In September, South African Airways will launch a new route between Guangdong's capital, Guangzhou, and Johannesburg to make the country more accessible for visitors departing from southern China. South African Tourism is striving to strengthen partnerships with tourism-industry players, better publicize travel products and attend more tourism-related events, such as seminars, workshops and road shows. It's also working to enhance cooperation with various brands, engage travelers through more online and offline activities and platforms, and boost integrated-marketing collaboration. This year, South African Tourism has expanded its marketing partnerships from China's online travel agencies and agents to brands not directly associated with travel, such as the question-and-answer website, Zhihu. It's placing special focus on drawing young travelers. Chinese actor Huang Bo, who won a Golden Horse Award for best actor, became South Africa's tourism-image ambassador in China in March. South Africa is also continuing its China Ready Workshop for its tourism operators. It provides instruction in such areas as Chinese language and cuisine. Mohamed says tourism businesses can join other trainings online and offline in a growing number of provinces. "We're also pushing (Chinese) toward tailored itineraries and experiences," he says. "Chinese travelers are moving away from the traditional group-tour products toward small-group and family tours. And they prefer the personalized travel experiences."

                    'Extremely dangerous' Hurricane Dorian worries Florida
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                MIAMI - Hurricane Dorian churned toward Florida with increasingly powerful winds and drenching rains on Friday, wreaking havoc on people's Labor Day weekend plans in one of America's biggest vacation destinations.The Miami-based National Hurricane Center said in a statement at 830pm EDT (0030 GMT) on Friday that Dorian had strengthened into an "extremely dangerous" category 4 hurricane, packing maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h).In the Bahamas, evacuations were underway, two days before Dorian is expected to bring a life-threatening storm surge of as much as 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.5 meters) to the northwest of the islands, the NHC said.On Florida's east coast, where Dorian's winds are expected to begin hitting on Monday morning, items ranging from bottled water to plywood were being bought as quickly as they could be restocked. There were reports some gas stations had run out of fuel."They're buying everything and anything that applies to a hurricane, flashlights, batteries, generators," said Amber Hunter, 30, assistant manager at Cape Canaveral's ACE Handiman hardware store.The hurricane has the potential to put millions of people at risk along with big vacation parks such as Walt Disney World, the NASA launchpads along the Space Coast, and even President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach.In its longer earlier bulletin at 8 pm EST (0000 GMT), the NHC said: "Additional strengthening is forecast, and Dorian is anticipated to remain an extremely dangerous hurricane while it moves near the northwestern Bahamas and approaches the Florida peninsula into early next week."

                    Smart systems key to averting conflict over water
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Technology is a crucial aspect of improving the availability and accessibility of clean water around the world.Many of us start our day by reaching for a glass of water, a ritual said to flush out toxins. Others, even before the crack of dawn, are already waiting－desperately－for a pail of water, a daily ration to satisfy basic needs.Water is at once bountiful and scarce. Primary school has ingrained in us that our planet is about 70 percent water, and that through its cycle, water is eternally recurring. This makes it difficult for most of us to believe that water is now scarce and that a growing number of people are faced with the reality of zero water.Cape Town, South Africa, narrowly avoided this a year ago, and in Chennai, on India's southeastern coast, four of the city's main reservoirs are almost completely dry.In Asia's developing countries, water utilities face three major issues: First, they have to manage diminishing resources and infrastructure that is largely spread out, often dilapidated and not well located and identified. Second, they are working with low operational capacities, with a low incentive to perform. And third, they face a general lack of access to operational data and indicators for monitoring progress.Whereas rapid urbanization and climate change－two key drivers of water insecurity－are harder to control, water utilities are more manageable. The key is to transform these operators into modern and efficient organizations, valuing the people behind them and putting smart systems in place.In recent years, the development of more affordable sensors, connected devices, and communication channels has revolutionized the quantity of technical data, essentially collecting information on water flows, pressure and quality. Integrating this data from different sources on a platform has improved the management of infrastructure, energy and manpower.According to a 2016 report by Global Water Intelligence, an international water industry publisher and events organizer, the market for control and monitoring solutions in the water sector worldwide is expected to reach $30.1 billion in 2021, with the Asia-Pacific region having the biggest market share at $10.3 billion.Smart systems could be key to averting conflict over water. For smart systems to be successful, the focus needs to be placed on infrastructure, operations and institutions.Infrastructure determines the performance of water systems, especially how the infrastructure is developed and maintained. More-developed utilities have a comprehensive approach to locating, identifying, qualifying and managing infrastructure assets.In Asia, though, this is often not the case. Most utilities in the region need a systematic way to make decisions about repairing, rehabilitating or replacing aging assets, and to develop an effective strategy for long-term funding.Singapore－with its Public Utilities Board, the national water agency－has gone from a backwater island to a self-sustaining, highly advanced, water-resilient country.In the area of operations, a good approach is to begin with the end in mind. These heavy infrastructure projects should fully consider operations, maintenance aspects and capacity building from the design stage, since this sets the foundation for the sustainability of the infrastructure and the efficiency of the service provided.Transforming water utilities requires not only improved infrastructure and operations, but also strong institutions that support and monitor the utility, both at operation and regulation levels.Recent examples of cities facing water shortages show how this monitoring is important to ensure that utilities have necessary water resources and infrastructure to satisfy customer demand in the short and long term.Three focus areas－infrastructure, operations and institutions－together made more formidable by smart systems, build a solid base from which we can help to ensure water supply and equitable access.This gives us a chance to avoid potential water crisis and conflict. At the end of the day, what we want is water for all.The author is senior water utility specialist with the Asian Development Bank. The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.
