                A behind-the-scenes look at how a panda and a red lantern won the hearts of 2022 Games organizersA cute panda "from the future" and a traditional red lantern signifying China's past were unveiled as the respective mascots for the Beijing Olympics and Paralympics on Tuesday, ratcheting up anticipation for the 2022 Winter Games.Just over a year since submissions were first invited for the project, panda Bing Dwen Dwen and red lantern Shuey Rhon Rhon were revealed as the winners at Beijing's Shougang Ice Hockey Arena.The 2022 organizing committee is confident the pair will resonate with the world."Today is an important step on Beijing's historic journey as the first city in Olympic history to host both summer and winter editions of the Games," said International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach."The mascot will be a wonderful ambassador for both China and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games."International Paralympic Committee (IPC) president Andrew Parsons said the mascot "is a message of the future to the future generation of Chinese people who will be inspired by the amazing faith of the Paralympic athletes".Added Gao Tian, vice-director of the culture and ceremonies department of the organizing committee: "The two mascots are a combination of inheritance and innovation, culture and technology, as well as the Olympic Games and daily life."Back to the futureBing Dwen Dwen is described as a panda wearing an icy shell that is stylized as a sports helmet. The outfit is similar to a spacesuit, so the panda can be imagined as a winter sports athlete from the future. The ice shell also allows for the addition of new elements.Many details of the design reference signature elements of the 2022 Games.A series of colored floating lines around its head resemble tracks on an ice rink, similar to Games venue the National Speed Skating Oval, aka the "Ice Ribbon". The rings are also a nod to the implementation of ultra-fast 5G technology and are meant to empower the panda.Bing means "ice" in Chinese, which is a symbol of purity and toughness, in line with the spirit of the Olympics. Dwen suggests health and ingenuity, with the repetition of the word giving it a more informal, friendly feel. Altogether, Bing Dwen Dwen is a representation of physical strength, mental toughness and the spirit of the Olympics.Paralympic mascot Shuey Rhon Rhon is equally intricate in its meaning. It resembles an iconic Chinese red lantern commonly seen on doors and streets during Chinese New Year, which in 2022 falls three days before the Olympic Games opening ceremony. Red lanterns symbolize happiness, harvest and affluence, while the crown-like ruyi is a symbol of sovereignty in Chinese culture.Shuey Rhon Rhon's head is adorned with paper cuttings of pigeons, a common motif in Chinese culture. Their arrangement forms the shape of the Temple of Heaven, one of Beijing's most famous landmarks. The blush on the mascot's cheeks adds a festive feel, with the color red associated with good luck.Billed as the first-ever luminous Olympic mascot, Shuey Rhon Rhon is intended to convey a message of lighting up people's dreams and symbolizes friendship, courage and persistence. It is also a representation of the unbending will and fighting spirit of the Paralympic athletes.Shuey means "snow" in Chinese, while Rhon Rhon are two different Chinese characters with the same pronunciation, meaning inclusiveness and integration respectively. The name symbolizes harmony and exchanges between different cultures, and building a community with a shared future."The mascots draw inspiration from China's rich culture, at the same time reflecting the Chinese philosophy of communicating with the world and reaching out to the future," explained review panel member Zhang Yiwu, a professor at the Department of Chinese Language and Literature of Peking University.Tough decisionThe 2022 organizing committee launched a global appeal for mascot design proposals on Aug 8 last year, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics.Elementary and high school students across China were encouraged to create their own mascots for the Winter Games. Nearly 15 million students from 45,000 schools were involved, with their designs used as barometers of what appeals to kids."When we visited schools in northern China, we could tell they were familiar with winter sports and had a great passion for them. When we visited southern cities, students came with curiosity and listened attentively. The contrast left a deep impression on me, but all of them were happily involved in the designs," recalled Piao Xuedong, the organizing committee's marketing director.When the two-month submission period closed on Oct 31, a total of 5,816 designs were spread over 100 desks in a room inside the Beijing 2022 headquarters at Shougang Industrial Park.Submissions were received from all over the world－35 countries and regions in total－while the designers ranged in age from 3 to 75. Among the more commonly used ideas were indigenous deers, pandas and tigers, and cultural symbols such as dragon dancing and the Great Wall.According to the organizing committee, the number of design proposals was nearly three times that of the 2008 Games."There was a lot of diversity, with everyone from little children to professionals submitting proposals. It's interesting to see the different directions people have taken," said panel member Alexis Georgacopoulos, director of the University of Art and Design in Lausanne, Switzerland, where the IOC is based.The 18-person review panel was comprised of experts from fields including graphic design, animation, children's literature and marketing, and after two days of evaluation whittled the submissions down to 100 possibles on Jan 7. The next day, the panel compiled a shortlist of 10 designs.The panel was guided by an online survey that sought to discover the public's preference for features such as color and personality of the mascots."A great number of the designs were quite creative, and that really amazed me," said panel member Lin Cunzhen, who designed the emblems for Beijing 2022.

                China dominates Japan 3-0 for fifth consecutive win at FIVB Women's World Cup
            </a>
            <p>
                YOKOHAMA, Japan - With five of its starting players scoring double-digits, China easily defeated host nation Japan 3-0 in a sold-out Yokohama arena here on Thursday at the FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup to sit firmly on top as the round-robin tournament went halfway.China demonstrated clear dominance on the net, outperforming Japan in blocks 14-2 with Gong Xiangyu contributing six alone. Zhang Changning had a game-high 19 points in China's 25-17, 25-10, 25-17 victory, their fifth consecutive win at the competition. Zhu Ting and Yuan Xinyue added 14 and 13 respectively. Risa Shinnabe had a team-high eight points.Japan had an aggressive start leading by 7-4. Captain Zhu and Zhang took turns to challenge Japan's tenacious defense while Yan Ni contributed solid blocks to help China turn the table to 18-12 and forced Japan into a timeout and soon a second as Gong Xiangyu's spike and block nailed two more points for China to lead 20-12. Sarina Koga won three points in a row for the Asian Championship winner after the timeout, yet was unable to close the gap as China claimed the first set 25-17.The defending champions had a commanding 8-0 run to surge ahead 9-2 and headed into the second technical time out 16-7 with Gong, Yan, and Yuan putting up a "Great Wall" in front of the net to silence the Japanese attackers. The game later turned into a service show by Zhang, as her five aces spurred China's 7-0 run en route to comfortably taking a 25-10 win.Japan regained form in the second set with Mayu Ishikawa, who was sent on late in the second set, carrying the team forward together with their top scorer Yuki Ishii. However, a more balanced China maintained the lead from 2-2. Japan saved two match points but Yuan's spike killed the game 25-17.The two teams will have a two-day break before moving to Sapporo on Sunday when China plays Brazil while Japan hosts the United States.

                Design week puts Chinese creativity on show
            </a>
            <p>
                Icons of the founding of the People's Republic of China a major highlight The Beijing Design Week 2019 is showcasing China's top creativity and innovation across a vast palette of art, industry, history and culture as it runs from Sept 5 to Oct 7. The design week has been held every autumn in the capital since 2009, except in 2010, and has become a leading international platform for Chinese design. A major highlight of this year's event is the Exhibition of National Image Design at the Beginning of the Founding of the People's Republic of China.  Guests unveil this year's classic design award at the opening ceremony of the 2019 Beijing Design Week in early September. Wang Zhuangfei / China Daily Left: A craft expert shows his skills at an exhibition during the ongoing Beijing Fashion Week. Right: Visitors show interest in metal designs on display. Photos Provided to China DailyIt reflects the importance of design in the early years after the foundation of the PRC, said Wang Yudong, general manager of Beijing Design Week Co. The exhibition, held throughout the 2019 design week, showcases designs of the country's flag, emblems and anthem and tells the stories behind the archives, design drawings and file photos. The event coincides with celebrations of the PRC's 70th anniversary. Mexico City is the guest city being featured at this year's design week. It is helping Chinese people to learn more about Mexico City as a design destination, organizers said. At the award ceremony for the Beijing Design Awards held on Sept 5, a Mexican-made pottery design called The Sinkhole was honored with the traditional craft design award. The blackened pottery mimics the land formation of a sinkhole hanging from a wooden frame, and according to the organizers, combines practical and artistic elements. Mexico City is hosting an exhibition called Design Beyond Borders at the China Millennium Monument from Sept 5 to 16, showcasing the city's original design concepts from the perspectives of craft innovation, space design and culture. Isaac Landeros, curator of the exhibition, is a Mexican architect and designer who has lived in Beijing since 2012. He said at a forum during the week that design is a powerful language, and it is necessary to use diverse modes of design to integrate culture from different countries. The guest city title each year is an official means of communication between the Beijing government and foreign cities in innovation and design fields, organizers said, adding that it is important for the event to display the world's latest design concepts and traditional design essence of different ethnic groups. Previous guest cities include London, Milan, Amsterdam, Dubai, Seoul and Berlin. This year's classic design award, the top gong of the Beijing Design Awards, was given to the Shenzhou V manned spacecraft. The spacecraft features automatic defect diagnosis and escape systems, and is especially designed with solar wings on the orbital module, which enables the module to keep track and carry out spatial experiments while unmanned. The design has greatly extended the spacecraft's working life for spatial experiments and applications, increasing its comprehensive functions, the design week's organizers said. Other activities of the design week include the Beijing Design Expo that took place from Sept 12 to 16. It showcased the development of design craft over the past seven decades and its influence on social development at different times. Public artworks were also exhibited alongside communication and trade among influential Asian architects, designers, real estate developers, retailers and buyers. Fashion Beijing has hosted events such as runway shows and an online fashion design contest, which promoted clothing brands and discussions on China's creative design, the organizers said. Beijing Gehua Cultural Development Group has been among organizers of the Beijing Design Week for several years. Li Danyang, general manager of the company, said when the design week was held for the first time in 2009, there was no consensus on the importance of design, including its significance in promoting development and industrial upgrading. Li said in the past decade social progress has been made with Chinese and international design. Beijing boasts a strong design ambience and vitality, according to the organizers. The city is home to 119 design schools with more than 30,000 students. More than 250,000 people work in the design sector, one of the city's pillar industries. Beijing has more than 30 areas featuring cultural creativity such as the 798 Art Zone and 751 D��Park. Noted works of design in the city include the National Centre for the Performing Arts designed by French Paul Andreu and Galaxy SOHO designed by Zaha Hadid. songmengxing@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily 09/20/2019 page19)

                Exhibition honoring PRC foundation brings pride
            </a>
            <p>
                The Exhibition of National Image Design at the Beginning of the Founding of the People's Republic of China has made this year's Beijing Design Week special and impressive, said organizers of the exhibition. The exhibition, which debuted at the China Millennium Monument in early September, features sorted national image designs and has released many historical materials that had never been officially open to the public, organizers said. The exhibition, which will run until Oct 7, comprises three parts of national images, architecture and designs closely related to people's lives. The first part displays 18 cases involving designs of the national flag, national emblem, renminbi, commemorative stamps, medals and Hongqi cars.  A painting depicting the founding ceremony of the People's Republic of China attracts attention of visitors at the exhibition. Photos by Wang Zhuangfei / China DailyAmong them is the story of the national emblem design. Due to unsuccessful open collection, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference entrusted the task to two teams - the construction department at Tsinghua University led by renowned architects Liang Sicheng and his wife Lin Huiyin and the applied fine arts department at the Central Academy of Fine Arts, represented by noted artists such as Zhang Ding. Zhang proposed the Tian'anmen Gate theme in June 1950 while Liang and Lin suggested the five-star theme in September 1949. A cog, ears of rice and wheat, and ribbons happened to coincide in initial designs by the two teams. Mao Zedong, founder of the PRC, announced in September 1950 that the national emblem would be made up of the national flag, Tian'anmen Gate, a cog, and ears of rice and wheat. Different early designs of the emblem are displayed at the exhibition, complete with an explanation of the designs and related file photos. The architecture section mainly showcases spatial planning of Tian'anmen Square and architectural design of the Monument to the People's Heroes and the Great Hall of the People. Exhibits include hand-sketched designs, construction drawings, old photos and other historical records reflecting designers' thoughts. The last section presents Chinese-branded products made between 1949 and 1966, including trucks, sedans, bicycles, televisions, sewing machines, radios and cameras, as well as their external views, models and related photos. "We see our national flag and emblem every day, but we are not very clear how they were created," said Wang Yudong, general manager at Beijing Design Week Co. The exhibition even shows the day-to-day work of the designers to showcase intense preparations in early years of the PRC, Wang added. He said the PRC was founded on the ruins of war and rebuilt people's life totally relying on national industry, ranging from automobiles and bicycles to sewing machines and watches. For the exhibition, designs of the China-made products and some objects have been shipped from across the country to Beijing. "The exhibition showcases the difficult process of founding the PRC and we, from the design field, are very proud that designers made important contributions during the period," Wang said. The exhibition is co-hosted by the design week's organizing committee and the Academy of Arts and Design at Tsinghua University. The academy's predecessor is the Central Academy of Arts and Design, which was set up in 1956, the first higher education institution featuring design after the foundation of the PRC. Many teachers, students and alumni from the academy were involved in related design of national images since its establishment. Jia Yanliang, a graduate of the academy, designed the Hongqi CA770 sedan and Beijing's BK651 bus in the 1960s. Jia provided his design drawings of Hongqi sedans to the exhibition.
