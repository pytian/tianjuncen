            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Over 600 objects being exhibited, including looted, smuggled piecesAs 1.4 billion people prepare to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China, long-lost relics are on display to help honor the country's ongoing revitalization.A major exhibition opened on Tuesday at Beijing's National Museum of China to highlight the wide range of Chinese cultural relics that have been returned from overseas since 1949.The 600-odd objects range from treasures from the imperial collection of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) plundered from Beijing by invading Anglo-French Forces in 1860 and the Eight-Nation Alliance Forces in 1900, to relics stolen and smuggled from tombs over the years.They are on loan from 18 museums and institutions nationwide and cover a wide time span.Many familiar artifacts are on display, including Chinese zodiac animal-head sculptures looted in 1860 from a fountain in the royal resort Yuanmingyuan in Beijing; Shang Dynasty (c.16th century-11th century BC) bronze ware Min fanglei, a large wine container smuggled overseas in the 1920s shortly after being unearthed in Hunan province; and Tang Dynasty (618-907) Buddha images taken from Longmen Grottoes in Henan province in the 1930s."When our country was inflicted with social havoc, many precious treasures were taken overseas," said Wang Chunfa, director of the National Museum of China. "This exhibition not only helps people better understand abundant historical information related to these artifacts, but also how they were returned home."Collections from the National Museum of China contributed about two-thirds of the relics on display.Much effort has been taken to repatriate lost cultural relics since the earliest years of New China. According to the National Cultural Heritage Administration, more than 150,000 Chinese relics have been returned in 300 separate cases since 1949.The most recent repatriation occurred in August when eight Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC) bronze objects were returned from Japan.According to Guan Qiang, deputy director of the cultural heritage administration, cross-border judicial and law-enforcement cooperation have played key roles in the repatriation. For example, in 1998, more than 3,000 smuggled Chinese cultural relics were returned by British police. It is to date the largest collection of lost cultural relics repatriated to China in one shipment.In 2001, one half of a pair of stone statues stolen from a Tang Dynasty general's tomb in Hebei province was returned to China following a verdict by a New York court. Upon hearing the news, a United States collector soon donated the other half to China.Guan said the case set an example for Sino-US cooperation in the fight against cultural relic-related crimes. This led to 22 pieces being returned from the US in 2015 and about 360 artifacts making their journeys home in February. In a similar manner, 796 items lost to Italy arrived in Beijing in March."Negotiations and diplomatic channels are also frequently used," Guan said."Personal donations also make a great contribution."One of the aforementioned Buddha images from Longmen was donated back to China by the National Gallery of Canada in 2001. British authorities approved the return of a bronze bell to Tianjin in 2005. The bell was taken from a military fortress in 1900 and displayed in a park in Portsmouth for over a century.Such repatriation cases have become more frequent in recent years and they are important references for similar cases in other countries. But Guan said that future work in this area will be "no easier"."For each case, we have to make a tailored plan because the reasons the items got lost differ and may involve complex historical issues," he said.A 1970s-era UNESCO convention preventing the illicit import and export of cultural property is currently a legal guideline for returning relics to rightful owners, but Guan said the convention is more of an international commitment than compulsory law.As a complement, China has signed intergovernmental agreements with 22 countries, including the US, Italy and Switzerland.The exhibition will run through late November, but some exhibits-like paper-based artwork-will only be displayed for a month due to the relative fragility of the items.

                Olympic Forest Park offers range of activities, abundant wildlife The most crowded place in Beijing on a typical weekend morning is not the Sanyuanli Market or the Sanlitun shopping area, but a park near the North Fifth Ring Road. Entering through the south gate, a group of people are warming up for exercises, chatting about their fitness levels, while teams of runners pass nearby, sweating heavily. A vacant area just 12 years ago, Olympic Forest Park was built ahead of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics as a leisure area for athletes and coaches away from intense competition in National Stadium, also known as the Bird's Nest. After the Olympics, the park quickly became a highly popular public recreation facility, providing a variety of ways for people to relax. According to the Olympic Park Management Committee, the number of visitors has remained at some 12 million annually for five years, and at peak times the park hosts about 50,000 people per day. The busiest times during weekends are mornings, when runners complete up to five laps before lunch, while bird watchers are busy with their cameras in the wetland areas. Fan Zhenhe, who runs barefoot and has jogged in the park twice a week for four years, said he usually leaves the venue before 11 am to visit a restaurant or coffee shop, which the park lacks. He started running barefoot in 2016, encouraged by the park's smooth plastic running track. "I read an article back then that said barefoot running and walking helps accelerate blood circulation, which is good for health," he said. "The park's environment also made me want to get closer to nature; another reason I decided to run barefoot." As Fan spoke, a large group of blind people, led by volunteers with a pulling rope, shouted slogans and marched along a pathway. Even a sudden jolt failed to slow their pace. Fan also acts as a volunteer to such groups, training with fellow members twice a week, on Wednesday and Saturday mornings. Next to the crowded running track, several trails lead to the central area of the park, where the Olympic Lake is located. Some visitors who perform tai chi often head to these trails and grasslands to find quiet areas, usually alongside streams and lakes. Olympic legacies Hu Jie, the park's chief designer and vice-president of the Beijing Tsinghua Tongheng Urban Planning and Design Institute, said he used the work of Laozi, the sixth-century BC philosopher known for writing the masterpiece Tao Te Ching, in drafting the park's design. "The ideology that man follows the Earth and the Earth follows heaven blended perfectly with the park's natural environment," he said. "I thought that to attain sustainability and environmental balance, the design should find a way to involve both human activities and animal behavior." Many plans were submitted to the Beijing Municipal Government and the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad, or BOCOG, with hundreds of them rejected. Hu said government officials put forward a specific request for the design that the capital's central axis should end within the park area. From the south, the 7.8-kilometer central axis runs north, passing through Tian'anmen Square and the Forbidden City before ending in the north of the city. What is now the Second Ring Road used to form a complete imperial city wall system which, along with major roads, provided protection. "As the city expanded into the surrounding areas, forming a northern border became an urgent problem to solve," Hu said. He proposed an end to the central axis by using Chinese-style parks at Yangshan hill, an artificial site in the southern part of Olympic Forest Park. This 60-meter-high hill was finally selected. Ecological effect Covering 608 hectares, the park is home to 208 different wild animal species, including the yellow-bellied weasel and hedgehogs, along with numerous types of birds. Tourists visit the venue throughout the year. According to the Olympic Park Management Committee, protecting the ecosystem is the top priority, and the park is designed to act as Beijing's "green lung" - an area for leisure and entertainment that meets the increasing demand from local residents for green space. When the park was completed in June 2008, the proportion of forest area in Beijing rose to 67 percent and carbon sequestration - a process by which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and held in solid or liquid form - reached 4,763 metric tons per year. The park releases 5,208 tons of oxygen annually, according to the management committee. As dusk falls at the park, young men play basketball on outdoor courts, retirees dance in large groups and families use the walkways to exercise. Lovers often sit along the trails, listening to guitar players. Since 2014, Zhang Yu, 40, an illustrator at a nature and geographical magazine in Beijing for young readers, has spent more than 100 nights in the park during summer and autumn, searching with a flashlight for signs of hedgehogs. He even considered bringing a tent to the park late at night to ensure he had sufficient time to track the creatures. According to Zhang, untended land in the park provides the perfect habitat for hedgehogs, and they usually rest and sleep on the edges of grassy areas. Wang Zhou, 60, from Beijing, who has been a keen bird watcher since 1996, said, "We are lucky to have Olympic Forest Park as one of the areas to observe birds' behavior." Wang, who worked in finance before retiring, said she used to watch birds to ease the pressure of work. "Every time I saw the birds, especially some new species that suddenly appeared, I felt a sense of satisfaction and my spirits quickly rose," she said. Wang has also watched birds at other parks in Beijing, such as the Old Summer Palace and the Temple of Heaven. "Compared with other places, Olympic Forest Park has bushy shrubs and untrimmed plants, providing a better environment for wildlife," she said. Wang said that when it opened to the public in 2008, the park had relatively few species of birds, as the natural landscape had not been "recognized" by migratory species and they rarely visited the site to rest and nest. However, with the growth of plants and the expansion of the park, the environment, including grasslands, hills and forests, gradually became richer, and the park turned out to be an ideal habitat for birds. Sewage recycled He Weijia, general manager of Zhongda Yihe, the company responsible for the park's water system, said the venue's design features an integrated system that retains rainwater in its lakes for recycling after filtration. "Thousands of tons of city sewage have also been recycled, and small sewage treatment stations can be seen everywhere in the park," he said. An artificial sewage treatment wetland covering more than 20,000 square meters in the park has proved beneficial to the environment, he added. Maintaining such a large area of parkland is not easy. Wang Chun, former director of the Olympic Park Management Committee, has said in media interviews that even though there has been no entry fee since the park opened, the government subsidizes each visitor to the tune of 11 yuan ($1.56) to cover maintenance costs. The Chaoyang district government, along with the Beijing Municipal Government, provide about 200 million yuan a year to maintain the park through sanitation services, cleaning the lakes and other areas, and providing lights in public areas. "The overall Olympic Forest Park maintenance cost is not lower than that for Tian'anmen Square every year," Wang said. Hu, the chief designer, said the park, which is reputed to be Asia's largest urban green landscape, has attracted the nation's attention, and the Beijing Municipal Government spared no efforts in building the venue, investing 2.2 billion yuan in 2005. However, he said the Olympic organizing committee had paid less attention to the park after the 2008 Summer Games, adding that cafes and restaurants in the draft design had not been included when the venue was being built. Commercial operation of the park has also not been realized, and there are only a few places where runners and walkers can buy bottled water at the venue, he added. In addition, all major activities held in the park must be reported to the local police station. "I hope the park will explore new maintenance methods and make full use of its current resources, as an important part of building Beijing into a world-class city," Hu said. "Just like Central Park in New York City in the United States, Olympic Forest Park will become a mustgo place for Beijingers in the future." xinwen@chinadaily.com.cn  A bird's-eye view of Olympic Forest Park in Beijing.Ma Wenxiao/for China Daily(China Daily Global 08/20/2019 page1)

                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The history of the milu, or Pere David's deer, is one of the world's most dramatic species-survival stories.Habitat destruction decimated the wild population in China.Some believed eating its meat enhanced longevity or even endowed immortality. The deer lingering in the imperial hunting grounds died out around 1900.But, in 1865, French missionary Pere David brought some to Europe, where they ended up in zoos.The 11th Duke of Bedford later gathered 18 on his estate, establishing the lone remaining herd.There were fears during World War II that a single bomb would take out the whole species.A Slovak-born American zoologist reintroduced about three-dozen of the animals to China in 1985, with the blessing of the duke's successor.They were taken to the former imperial hunting grounds, which now are the Nanhaizi Milu Park in Beijing's Daxing district, where visitors can encounter the strange and scarce deer.The species' Chinese name, sibuxiang, translates as the "four unalikes".That's because it's said to share physical characteristics of the four animals it mythically contains－the neck of camel or horse, hooves of an ox, tail of a donkey and antlers of a buck.Biologically, Pere David's deer in fact belongs to the moose, muntjac, deer, roe deer and reindeer family of ruminants.So, the ancient Chinese and contemporary international taxonomies agree the animal shares a peculiar mix of features seen in other species.Beijing's Daxing district proposed the milu as the mascot of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games last summer. The results will be announced in the second half of this year.

                    Young artisans keep the creative spirit of Suzhou alive
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Artisans in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, have enjoyed fame in China for thousands of years, and today a new generation is keeping the tradition alive, creating new works for modern times.The Suzhou Artisan Garden, which officially opened in November 2018, is the home station for 64 master artists. The exhibition space at the Phoenix Culture Industry Park in Suzhou's Wuzhong district showcases some of the finest creations by the celebrated Suzhou artisans.For over 1,000 years, people from Suzhou built imperial palaces decorated with pillars, windows and gardens with sculptures and paintings. They made furniture with mother-of-pearl, clothes with fine embroidery and jewelry with intricate designs."People from Suzhou and the nearby area seem to have a natural talent for aesthetics," says Cai Xiaming. The 51-year-old has worked with silk embroidery and fine tapestries for more than 30 years. She and Zhong Jinde, a 56-year-old carpenter, began as apprentices in local factories. It was a period when China began to open up to the world and small factories and workshops mushroomed in the suburban areas of the Yangtze River Delta.Cai used to work in a factory that made kimono belts for the Japanese market. Now, the exquisite craftsmanship of fine silk tapestries is used to reproduce classical Chinese paintings and haute couture fashion designs. Later this month, Cai will travel to France, where she'll make men's suits. "I was invited to showcase the craft at the fashion show," she says, proudly. Nowadays, the young generation of artisans choose the career for love instead of livelihood.So, Zhu Mengjia, for example, had to subsidize her crafts studio with a second job during an especially difficult period.The 26-year-old is one of the young artists featured at the center, who creates miniature sculptures from olive pits.The craft known as "peach pit carving" has existed in China for more than 600 years. Olive pits became more popular over time. On the tiny surfaces of fruit pits, artists create statues and portraits, flowers and birds, and even boats with passengers. The traditional craft was listed as an intangible cultural heritage of China in 2008.A famous essay by Wei Xueyi (1596-1625) vividly records a fine pit carving depicting a boat, with eight windows on the cabin and five people onboard, each striking different poses. Fine examples of these carved-pit boats can still be found in museums in China.

                Silk goddess, a sculpture revealed in 1987 in downtown Nanchong, Sichuan province, is a landmark and symbol of a city that has witnessed the rise and prosperity of China's silk industry. It is believed that 5,000 years ago, the ancestors of Nanchong people began to plant mulberry, raise silkworms and weave silk fabric along the Jialing River. In the Tang Dynasty (618-907), Huahong, a kind of fancy silk produced in Nanchong, was presented to the Japanese imperial family as a gift. It is now exhibited in Nara National Museum. After the foundation of the People's Republic of China, the silk industry entered a period of rapid growth. In the early years, 80 percent of Nanchong people worked in silk-related industries. The story of silk in Nanchong continues to modern times. The title "the source point of silk" was granted to the city by the China Silk Association in 2016. In the same year, the Nanchong city government put forward a development plan that named the silk and garment industry as one of the five pillar industries to drive economic development. Now the local government is sparing no effort to support the silk and garment industry's upgrades and transformation. A series of silk and garment industrial parks have been built to bolster the industry. More than 30 garment enterprises, including some companies from Shenzhen and Hong Kong, have settled down in the parks so far. Since 2011, the silk and sericulture industry in Nanchong has spent 1.35 billion yuan ($192 million) on technological transformation and product development. Advanced machines and equipment have been introduced from Italy and France. By developing fine processing products, such as clothing and bedding, the industrial structure is becoming optimized. Nanchong is also advancing the construction of scientific and research institutions. The planned institutions include a provincial silk school, a national technology research office for silk spinning and clothing, and five municipal technology centers. Official statistics show that the total area of mulberry fields in Nanchong is 41,333 hectares. In 2017, Nanchong's economic aggregate in silk ranked No 1 in central and western China. There were 72 silk and garment enterprises in the city, providing jobs for more than 30,000 people. Nanchong has formed a complete industrial chain consisting of raw material supply, sericulture, silk reeling, weaving, product research and development, garment processing and export trade, local officials said. Based on a robust industrial foundation and prominent industrial advantage, the goal to build Nanchong into a sericulture and silk tourism city was set in 2018. With financial support from the local government, several silk and garment enterprises began to develop silk culture and industrial tourism. Among such silk enterprises is Liuhe, which used to be the largest silk-reeling factory in Asia. Founded in 1912, Liuhe is the oldest silk enterprise in China and known as the "living fossil" of the Chinese silk industry. Guoshan Sericulture Agency, the predecessor of Liuhe, won the gold prize at the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition for its raw silk. In 2015, at the original site of the factory, Liuhe built a silk culture industrial park. The park combines tourism, culture, sericulture and industry. Visitors can learn about the whole technological process of silk production in the last century such as cocoon cooking and silk reeling. They can also have an interactive experience of operating silk-making equipment and purchase silk products. "Industrial tourism can not only promote our sales, but also enhance Liuhe's brand influence. More importantly, it helps promote Nanchong's silk culture and carry it forward," said Li Yongchun, director of the culture industry department of Liuhe. Through cooperation with travel agencies, more than 300,000 visits came to Liuhe in 2018. Liuhe's annual revenue from industrial tourism has reached 40 million yuan. Another silk tourism spot in Nanchong is the silk museum built by leading textile company Yigeer. With various exhibits and detailed explanation, the museum gives visitors a full picture ofNanchong's silk history and culture including the related tales and historical facts. Yinhe Carpet, a silk enterprise working on hand-woven carpets for nearly half a century, is also building an exhibition center. "The center will be divided into several areas including display, performance and shopping, which can give visitors a brand-new experience," said Yang Shufen, deputy general manager of Yinhe Carpet. To realize the goal, Nanchong will continue to combine its cultural promotion with industrial expansion. A number of planned scenic spots including an ecological mulberry field and the Dujing silk town will be built. Scholars and researchers will dig into the silk culture and history in the central and western regions, study documents and cultural relics, and build a number of high-level museums and pavilions. The local government also plans to hold festivals and make a TV series to improve the influence of Nanchong's silk culture. Gaoping district in Nanchong is a cradle for China's silk industry.  (China Daily 09/17/2019 page26)
