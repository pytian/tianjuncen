                            WASHINGTON - China's real effective exchange rate (REER) in 2018 is estimated to be at the same level as warranted by fundamentals and desirable policies, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reiterated on Friday in a newly released report.Mark Sobel, non-resident senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and US chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, told Xinhua that the Article IV report also notes that China's current account surplus is "small," around half of a percent of GDP, and "that estimates suggest China has not been intervening in the foreign exchange market."The external position in 2018 was assessed to be broadly in line with the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies," the IMF said, consistent with its earlier conclusion in its annual External Sector Report released in July

However, like many other G20 countries, over 70 percent of African countries have trade deficits with China, and this affects investment prospects for African countries. This can and should continue, but China should also focus on opening up markets for finished and value-added products, as a means to support Africa to innovate, attract investment and effective technology transfer

We believe that with the growing maturity of multinational corporations' operations onshore in China, foreign parent companies will be increasingly seeking to tap the domestic bond market as an important and highly cost-effective source of RMB funding to support their Chinese expansion needs.In 2018, China took several solid steps toward allowing even greater access for foreign financial institutions, which include relaxing the regulation on foreign ownership limits and accelerating the progress of creating a fairer arena for bank branch openings and debt fundraising

The incidents, along with the violent robbery of a German tourist two days earlier, prompted Barcelona's deputy mayor, Albert Batlle, to describe the situation as "a crime crisis". Britain's Sun newspaper said the city had 115,014 reported crimes between January and June, including murders, sex attacks, gang fights, and a spree of thefts on the metro transportation system

Let me get back to the baseline!' Maybe Svitolina, whose one upset of Williams in five previous matchups came at the 2016 Rio Olympics, was just a bit too passive, content to say way back and try to chase down everything sent her way
