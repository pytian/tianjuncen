                Luckin Coffee eyes Middle East, India
            </a>
            <p>
                Luckin Coffee Inc, a leading Chinese coffee chain, and Kuwait Food Company Americana K.S.C.C., the largest integrated food product company in the Middle East, announced plans on Monday to establish a joint venture to launch a new retail coffee business in the Middle East and India.The two sides signed a memorandum of understanding in Beijin, though Luckin didn't reveal the details of their collaboration. Luckin Coffee's Founder and CEO Qian Zhiya said this agreement represents Luckin Coffee's first step toward bringing its products from China to the world."We look forward to further expanding the freshly brewed coffee market internationally as we realize incredible growth opportunities available to us through our innovative business model," Qian said.Industry expert Zhu Danpeng said Luckin Coffee's pioneering technology and business model have changed the transaction structure and user experience of China's coffee industry.Zhu said it is about time for Luckin to expand its presence overseas to maximize profits after a public listing in May in the United States. "The move is part of Luckin's mid- and long-term strategy," Zhu said.Americana Group has a diverse set of holdings, spanning manufacturing, distribution and restaurant operations in Middle East and India.CEO Kesri Kapur said, "We at Americana believe this MoU will revolutionize the food and beverage retail industry in the Greater Middle East and India, regions that provide promising prospects for new retail growth and expansion."Founded in Kuwait in 1964, Americana was the first to introduce the concept of quick-service restaurants to the Middle East in the 60's.With its two divisions, the group operates 1,900 restaurants in 13 markets and 25 food production sites across the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Egypt, offering food products to consumers in over 20 markets within the MENA region and beyond.Founded in 2017 and headquartered in Xiamen, Luckin Coffee operates over 3,000 stores across 40 cities in China. The company plans to open more than 4,500 stores by the end of 2019, which would make it China's largest coffee chain.

                Abbas says Palestinians intend not to abide by deals signed with Israel
            </a>
            <p>
                RAMALLAH - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced on Thursday that the Palestinian leadership is intending not to abide by the peace agreements signed with Israel, in response to demolitions of dozens of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem on Monday.He said during a meeting for the Palestinian leadership held in Ramallah that a committee is to be formed to implement the made decision that was based on previous decisions related to defining the nature of the relationship with Israel.Three years ago, the Palestinian leadership establishments, the National and Central Councils, had decided to suspend its recognition of the state of Israel until the latter recognizes a Palestinian state on 1967 border, and stop security coordination with Israel.Abbas chaired earlier on Thursday a joint meeting for Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) executive committee and his Fatah Party to discuss the Israeli homes demolition in Jerusalem.The call for "the emergency meeting," according to the official news agency WAFA, was made after the Israeli authorities' demolition of 12 buildings, that comprises dozens of housing units in Sur Baher area, southeast of Jerusalem.On Monday, the Israeli authorities demolished 12 constructions that included 72 apartments in the neighborhood of Sur Baher southeast of Jerusalem."The decision not to abide by the agreements signed with Israel was made in light of the state of the Israeli occupation's demolitions of dozens of homes of our people in East Jerusalem the capital of our eternal state," said Abbas.He added that "hundreds of our people from Sur Baher became displaced, which is clear breaching to the international law and a clear breaching to the international resolutions and all the peace agreements signed between us.""We won't accept the dictates and imposition of the status quo on the ground by brutal force, specifically in Jerusalem and other places. All are sacred to the Palestinian land," said Abbas.He stressed that "all the actions of the occupying state in Jerusalem are illegal and false," adding "the American administration through its biased policy to Israel has encouraged the Israeli violations against our people.The Palestinians severed their political ties with the United States following President Donald Trump's declaration in December 2017 that Jerusalem is the capital of the state of Israel.Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Ishtaye said on Thursday that the division of the Palestinian territories into areas (A), (B) and (C) that had been agreed upon with Israel "was no longer in place because Israel did not respect the signed agreements."Also on Thursday, Islamic Hamas Movement slammed the United States for vetoing a resolution that condemned Israel in the UN Security Council for demolishing Palestinian homes southeast of Jerusalem.Israeli public radio reported earlier on Thursday that Washington thwarted Wednesday night efforts by Kuwait, Indonesia and South Africa to pass a resolution in the Security Council condemning Israel for the demolition of houses in Sur Baher, southeast of Jerusalem last Monday.

                China, Arab states' health ministers to publish health declaration
            </a>
            <p>
                Health ministers from China and Arab states will publish a joint declaration on health cooperation as the two sides look to further deepen cooperation during a health forum this week, a senior Kuwaiti diplomat said.The second meeting of the Chinese-Arab health forum will be held from Aug 16 to 18 in Beijing, and Kuwaiti Minister of Health Basel Al-Humoud Al-Sabah will be among delegates to the forum, said Kuwaiti Ambassador to China Sameeh Hayat.Those at the meeting also will discuss cooperation in several areas, including traditional medicine, hospital administration, health industries and improving the field of general health, he said.Meanwhile, Hayat noted that senior Kuwaiti and Chinese delegations have been exchanging official visits to boost cooperation on different levels.The historic visit of the Emir of Kuwait Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah to China in July 2018 had prominently developed Kuwaiti-Chinese cooperation and relations, he added.Kuwait will open a general consulate in Shanghai next month, a move that will enhance the diplomatic presence in China after consulates in Hong Kong and Quanzhou, as well as the embassy in Beijing, the diplomat said.

                Now stop piracy, on the high seas
            </a>
            <p>
                Need for the UN to take lead role, than leave it all on China, the UK and the US Piracy has been an intractable international problem for thousands of years. Indeed, 2,000 years ago as a young man, Julius Caesar was taken hostage by a gang of pirates. After his hefty ransom was paid, and he was released, he later tracked them down and executed them. The recent kidnapping of Chinese ship crews from two vessels, off Cameroon, reminds us that the problem remains. A couple of centuries ago, Britain's Royal Navy led the armed opposition to pirates on the high seas, eventually reducing that maritime threat to life and international trade to a negligible level. Ruthless methods were adopted. The Royal Navy sank as many pirate vessels as it could. Those (pirates) who made an illegal living by violently attacking merchant shipping were violently attacked. The navy even took the fight to the pirates on land, destroying village ports where they were based. Sadly, the scourge of piracy has continued off-and-on, and is today a very real threat to lives and cargoes, particularly in certain regions, such as off the coasts of Africa and Southern Arabia. It is not limited to those areas. It also continues to be a threat around the numerous islands of East Asian countries, such as Malaysia and the Philippines. Several warships from various national navies, including the Chinese, US and British sea powers, have been deployed in these dangerous areas in a bid to eliminate the pirates. But these areas are so large, the passage of commercial shipping so busy, and the pirate ships so numerous, that so far the scourge of piracy remains a dire threat. The European Union's first maritime force provides counter-piracy patrols in some of the areas most infested with pirates. This is of some help in addressing the problem, but those anti-piracy resources are stretched pretty thinly across vast oceans. More - much more needs to be done to wipe out piracy effectively. Sometimes a ship's cargo is simply stolen, or held to ransom. Sometimes the crew members are kidnapped and held to ransom against a threat to their lives, and sometimes both. Unfortunately, in some cases enormous ransom demands of the pirates are paid, thus solving one immediate problem but thereby encouraging more kidnappings from pirates in the future. The International Bureau's Piracy Reporting Centre records a growth in the number of pirate attacks, up from 180 incidents in 2017 to 201 last year. The United Nations' international enforcement efforts have always generated a mixed report-card. Some of their organizations, such as the World Health Organization, achieve much that is good. But when looking at certain other areas where strong UN action could be more effective, such as when combating the illegal narcotics trade, or limiting human trafficking, we can see clearly that the UN has not yet realized its full potential. Piracy puts civilian ships of all nations at risk, and makes being a sailor on a civilian vessel a dangerous occupation. Since all nations face the potential disruption of their imports and exports, including the vital sea transport of their food and energy resources (i.e. oil), they should come together to fight piracy through UN-arranged anti-piracy military measures. It is simply not good enough for countries to leave it to the few, such as to China, Britain and the US, to combat piracy by deploying their warships whilst most countries contribute nothing to the battle. The UN could take the lead in suppressing piracy. A UN-arranged, and UN-led naval task force, made up of warships provided on loan by many more UN countries, should be established. Scores, perhaps hundreds, of naval vessels, would have to be involved to provide more concentrated coverage to vast areas of sea that most badly need to be patrolled. And the rules of engagement should be extended, that pirate ships are blown out of the water on sight. There should be a UN set-up international court to try suspected pirates from anywhere, and impose the death penalty as a deterrent on those who are convicted. Online videos can be viewed of several foolhardy pirate vessels attempting to attack patrolling warships. Any warship under attack from pirates is likely to fire back, with vastly superior gunfire, to make short work of sinking the attacking pirate ships. The proposed UN-led naval task force should deploy warships in greater numbers, and with more wide-ranging patrols, and these should be tasked with shooting at pirate vessels as soon as they can be located. Civilian ships under pirate attack could whistle up a nearby UN warship, if these patrols are expanded widely enough, to come to their aid and rescue them from such attack - preferably by swiftly sinking the pirate ships. China receives a large proportion of its oil needs from the Gulf, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Oman etc. This vital fuel is carried by ship through the Straits of Hormuz; altogether 20 percent of the world's oil passes through that restricted area. Recently, there have been attacks upon passing oil tankers in this area: it remains a matter of debate whether such attacks are conducted by pirates or are state-sponsored operations from a nearby country. Again, having more international warships patrolling that area, to protect passing oil tankers, is something that a UN-led naval task force could provide. Oil-producing countries, such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, which depend on oil sales for a large part of their economy, should contribute more money to help provide this UN-led naval task force protection. And the old wartime skills of arranging convoys, escorted by warships, could be reintroduced, to make shipping safer for all concerned.

                Qatar 2022 World Cup logo reflects move to winter tournament
            </a>
            <p>
                Flashed on big screens and projected onto landmarks worldwide, the 2022 Qatar World Cup logo was revealed Tuesday with a design that reflects both the tournament's compact infrastructure and winter schedule.Using the colors of the Qatari flag, the white emblem is set against a maroon background and it finally provides an image for soccer's most controversial tournament beyond construction sites.It was inspired by the contours of the World Cup trophy with the unbroken loop depicting a figure of eight — the number of stadiums built for the World Cup in Qatar.FIFA said the design also draws "inspiration from a traditional woolen shawl," a winter garment reflecting the World Cup being played in November and December 2022 to avoid the fierce summer heat in June and July when the tournament is usually played.The reveal came at 2022 local time (8:22 pm) in Doha and the image was projected onto buildings in the Qatari capital, including the Al Zubarah Fort, and appeared at sites in Kuwait, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq.Among the international sites where the logo was displayed on Tuesday were the Arch of Peace in Milan, trains stations in Paris and Rio de Janeiro and Times Square in New York.Qatar won a FIFA vote in 2010 that has been dogged by controversy. A FIFA investigation found that some of Qatar's conduct "may not have met the standards" required while concluding there was no "evidence of any improper activity by the bid team".Working conditions and rights for migrant laborers building the stadiums in Qatar were also criticized, forcing standards to be raised.AP
