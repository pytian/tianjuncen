                Ambassador assures UK over Huawei
            </p>
            <p>
                Beijing's top diplomat in London says tech company is not involved in spyingChina's ambassador to the United Kingdom has provided assurances that Chinese telecommunications company Huawei has no "back doors" and will not pass any information to Beijing if it is involved in Britain's 5G networks.Liu Xiaoming made the comments in an interview with the BBC on Sunday, following reports that all four major UK operators are using Huawei kit in their 5G network infrastructure."I can promise that, a hundred percent," Liu said when host Andrew Marr asked him to assure the safety of Huawei to the British public during the show."Huawei is a good company, it's a leader on 5G, and I think that if you reject Huawei you would miss enormous opportunities," Liu said, adding that "they are here for win-win cooperation, they are not here to spy on people."Vodafone launched 5G in several British cities last week, and rival operator EE rolled out its 5G network in May. Both operators have maintained the use of Huawei in "non-core" parts of their network infrastructure. Huawei has also secured 5G contracts with mobile operators Three and O2, according to UK newspaper the Observer. Three's 5G launch is expected in August, with O2 following in the fall.The four operators, which together serve an estimated 87 percent of mobile users in the UK, are taking a risk by using Huawei equipment. The UK government is considering a full or partial restriction on Huawei kit following pressure from US President Donald Trump's administration, which claims Huawei participates in espionage on behalf of China.Washington has lobbied fellow members of the so-called Five Eyes intelligence-sharing community to shun Huawei. So far, both Australia and New Zealand have instructed domestic operators not to grant Huawei contracts, while the UK and Canada have not yet reached a determination.The UK will reveal its decision on Huawei in a pending telecommunications supply chain review. If a full ban is announced, UK operators will be forced to remove all existing Huawei hardware from their networks, something that will cost each company tens of millions of pounds and that will delay the rollout of 5G in the UK by up to two years, according to estimates from tech consultancy Assembly Research.As things stand, all four major operators plan to limit Huawei's involvement to "non-core" infrastructure, such as radio access networks. They will be hoping that, if the UK government introduces a ban, it will only relate to the most sensitive areas of British networks."If there is any restriction placed on the operators using Huawei, it's probably going to be restricting the use of it to the access network only, and not the core network," said Matthew Howett, principal analyst at Assembly Research. "Since no operator was planning on using it anyway in the core, then they might be pretty confident that it is going to go their way and they will be able to continue with things as planned."Mobile operators in the UK are keen to keep pace with the global rollout of 5G technology, which would be severely delayed without access to equipment from Huawei, the world's biggest supplier of network hardware."No operator is going to cancel their plans unless they are told explicitly to do so," said Howett. "The government has not told them to stop doing anything, so they are going to push ahead and continue until they are told otherwise."

                Europe in no hurry to join US-led boycott of Huawei Technologies
            </a>
            <p>
                With United States President Donald Trump agreeing to allow Huawei Technologies Co to resume purchase of some US components and software, the question of whether the United Kingdom will, or will not, join the boycott of the Chinese technology giant suddenly seems less important.Trump's declaration followed a six-week period in which US companies were barred from purchasing Huawei components and, despite Trump's words, Huawei will remain blacklisted until it is officially removed from the list. Even then, it will continue to be prevented from selling its products to US companies and to those in nations supporting the US-led boycott.London, until now, has refused to join the boycott, despite several months of pressure from Washington, which claims to have identified weaknesses in Huawei's kit that make it vulnerable to use by spies, a claim the company vehemently denies.But, despite the importance of the evolving situation, neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Hunt, the two men vying to become the UK's next prime minister, have overtly said whether they plan to join the US-led boycott.Theresa May's replacement will be named at the end of July, after the ruling Conservative Party's 160,000 members participate in a postal ballot. May had reportedly been leaning toward allowing Huawei to participate in noncore parts of the network but both Johnson and Hunt have hinted they may join the boycott.Johnson, the bookmakers' favorite to win the leadership race, said on June 28 that the nation should not let its relationship with Huawei jeopardize intelligence-sharing with its allies, including the US.Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador to the UK, said any British ban on Huawei would send a "negative message" to other Chinese companies considering investing in Britain.In a televised interview with the BBC, Liu said: "Will the UK still be a business-friendly environment for Chinese companies? It will send a very bad signal, not only on trade, but also on investment."Huawei, which employs 7,000 people in the UK, opened its first local office 16 years ago. Between 2013 and 2017, it invested or procured more than 2 billion pounds ($2.54 billion) in the UK, and, in 2018 it pledged to spend a further 3 billion pounds on British technology and services during a five-year period.A recent report commissioned by four of the UK's major mobile network companies - EE, O2, Three, and Vodafone - found that a ban on Huawei would delay the rollout of 5G technology in the UK by up to two years. The study, published by tech consultancy Assembly Research, said such a delay would cost the British economy between 4.5 billion pounds and 6.8 billion pounds.Margot James, the UK's minister for the digital and creative industries, supports Huawei's participation in the UK's 5G rollout, and said the government should act on the recommendations of the UK National Cyber Security Centre, which has found no evidence to support the US' claims.Huawei, meanwhile, is continuing to promote its products and services and will take its roadshow to the Goodwood Festival of Speed in Sussex, England, between July 4 and July 7.The UK government is expected to reveal its Huawei decision when it publishes a telecoms supply chain review in the coming weeks.Other EU nations are also considering their position but none has been quick to join the US-led boycott. The president of the German telecoms regulator said earlier this year that Huawei should not be excluded from the nation's 5G network. And the biggest Dutch carrier, KPN, has said it plans to use Huawei equipment. The European Union issued recommendations about 5G security in March in which it called on member states to review their networks by the end of June and report their findings to the EU Commission. As yet, no EU nation has joined the boycott of Huawei products.

                Vodafone stays with Huawei for 5G launch
            </a>
            <p>
                Chinese telecommunications company Huawei says it is "proud to be helping Vodafone" as the United Kingdom mobile operator launches its first 5G networks across several British cities this week. Vodafone confirmed it is continuing the use of Huawei equipment in noncore parts of its network infrastructure for the 5G rollout, even though Huawei equipment could be banned if the UK government were to join in United States-led restrictions on the Chinese company. On Tuesday, Vodafone launched 5G in Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and London. Twelve more cities will soon follow.

            <p>
                MADRID - China's technology giant Huawei on Friday opened in Madrid its largest flagship store outside China.The two-storey, 1,100-square-meter shop is located in Madrid city center, where the customers can experience Huawei's latest technologies, including 5G and artificial intelligence applications, and enjoy the products it has launched such as smartphones, tablets as well as personal computers, President of Huawei's Consumer Business Group for the Western European Region Walter Ji told Xinhua.More than 1,000 people came to the new flagship store on the opening day.On June 15, Vodafone Espana, in cooperation with Huawei, rolled out the first commercial 5G mobile services in Spain, making it one of the first European countries with the ultrafast mobile network in Europe.Vodafone announced that it's offering 5G roaming in four European countries -- Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy over the summer.On May 30, mobile network operator EE launched Britain's first 5G service, using Huawei equipment.Huawei is the world's leading company in 5G. The Chinese company said it has already won 50 5G contracts globally.

                Huawei says Hongmeng operating system not for smartphones, intends to continue with Android
            </a>
            <p>
                BRUSSELS -- Huawei board member and senior Vice President Catherine Chen said here on Thursday that the company's Hongmeng operating system is not for smartphones and the company intends to continue to use Google's Android operating system for its smartphones.The Hongmeng system has previously been widely reported in the media as a potential alternative to Android on smartphones, but Chen, when asked at a media roundtable in Brussels, was unequivocal that it is not designed for that.She said the recently-trademarked Hongmeng is for industrial use and actually has been in development long before the current discussions around finding an alternative to Android.Chen said while an operating system for smartphones usually contain dozens of millions of lines of codes, Hongmeng contains much fewer - in the quantity of hundreds of thousands - and therefore very secure. The Hongmeng system also has extreme low latency compared with a smartphone operating system, she added.Huawei, a worldwide leading vendor of equipments to telecommunications operators such as Vodafone, has also become in recent years an international powerhouse of consumer devices such as smartphones which run on the Android system. The China-headquartered company intends to continue using Android, she added.

                Network gear of Chinese company brings 5G services to London homes
            </a>
            <p>
                Londoners can now access ultrafast 5G broadband internet in their homes through routers made by Chinese telecommunications company Huawei, after a major network upgrade from mobile operator Three.Following the launch of Three's 5G home broadband in parts of the British capital, users can reap the benefits of the latest generation of network technology via the Huawei 5G CPE Pro Router.There is no need for a landline to operate the router-residents simply need to connect the device to a power source and insert a micro SIM card."Three's 5G is going to revolutionize the home broadband experience," said Dave Dyson, chief executive of Three. "No more paying for landline rental, no more waiting for engineers, and even a same-day delivery option. It really is the straightforward plug and play broadband that customers have been waiting for. The ease and immediacy of it all means home broadband using 5G is going to be key to the future of the connected home."The service is available in the London boroughs of Camden and Southwark. Hackney, Islington and Tower Hamlets will follow in the next few weeks.Vodafone and EE have also commenced 5G rollouts in the United Kingdom, and Britain's fourth major mobile operator, O2, will launch 5G upgrades from October.Three, Vodafone, and EE will use Huawei equipment in their radio access networks for 5G upgrades, even though Huawei kit could soon be banned from network infrastructure, if the UK government joins a US-led boycott of the Chinese company. O2 is working with Ericsson and Nokia as technology partners for its 5G rollout.The United States has pressured the UK to ban Huawei participation in 5G upgrades, due to what the US claims are security concerns. The UK government was expected to reach a determination on whether it would join the Huawei boycott last month but the Conservative Party leadership contest delayed the decision.On Friday, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei said he was confident that the UK would allow the continued use of his company's technology in network upgrades."I noticed the third day that (Johnson) was in office, he said the UK should roll out 5G as soon as possible," Ren told Sky News. "I think they won't say no to us as long as they go through those rigorous tests and look at it in a serious manner and I think if they do say no, it won't be to us."Upcoming releases of Huawei 5G smartphones by UK vendors have already been impacted by a US ruling that prevents Huawei devices from accessing updates on the Android operating system.
