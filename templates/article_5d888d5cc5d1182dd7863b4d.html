                Tanzania mourns 69 killed in tanker blast
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                MOROGORO, Tanzania - Tanzania was in mourning on Sunday, preparing to bury 69 people who perished when a crashed fuel tanker exploded as crowds rushed to siphon off leaking fuel. Tanzania's President John Magufuli declared a period of mourning through Monday following the blast near the town of Morogoro, west of Dar es Salaam. He will be represented at the funerals by Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa, an official statement said. "We're currently mourning the loss of 69 people, the last of whom died while being transferred by helicopter to the national hospital in Dar es Salaam," Majaliwa told residents in comments broadcast on Tanzanian television. The burials would start on Sunday afternoon, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Jenista Mhagama announced during the morning after relatives identified the dead. "The preparations for the burials have been completed. Individual graves have been dug and the coffins are ready," Mhagama said, adding that experts would be available to offer psychological counseling to the victims' relatives. DNA tests would be carried out on bodies that were no longer recognizable, Mhagama said, adding that families could take the remains of their loved ones and organize their own burials if they preferred. In the latest in a series of similar disasters in Africa, 39 seriously hurt patients had been taken to hospital in Dar es Salaam while 17 others were being treated in Morogoro, 200 kilometers west of the economic capital of Tanzania. Footage from the scene showed the truck engulfed in flames and huge clouds of black smoke, with charred bodies. The burnt-out remains of motorcycle taxis lay scattered on the ground among scorched trees. A video posted on social media showed dozens of people carrying yellow jerricans around the truck. "We arrived at the scene with two neighbors just after the truck was overturned. While some good Samaritans were trying to get the driver and the other two people out of the truck, others were jostling each other, equipped with jerricans, to collect petrol," teacher January Michael said. "At the same time, someone was trying to pull the battery out of the vehicle. We warned that the truck could explode at any moment but no one wanted to listen, so we went on our way, but we had barely turned on our heels when we heard the explosion." President Magufuli called on Saturday for people to stop the dangerous practice of stealing fuel in such a way, a common event in many poor parts of Africa. He issued a statement saying he was "very shocked" by the looting of fuel from damaged vehicles. "There are vehicles that carry dangerous fuel oil, as in this case in Morogoro, there are others that carry toxic chemicals or explosives, let's stop this practice, please," Magufuli said. Last month, 45 people were killed and more than 100 injured in central Nigeria when a fuel tanker crashed and then exploded as people tried to take the fuel. Among the deadliest such disasters, 292 people lost their lives in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo in July 2010, and in September 2015 at least 203 people died in the South Sudan town of Maridi.

A damaged tanker truck exploded in eastern Tanzania on Saturday as people were trying to siphon fuel out of it, killing 69, in one of the worst incidents of its kind in the East African country.Associated Press(China Daily Global 08/12/2019 page7)

                New guidelines target rogue recruitment agenciesMohsine el Baghdadi always wanted to be an English teacher in China, considering such a job to be ideal.A friend who taught English in China told the 27-year-old Moroccan that foreign teachers are in high demand, there are boundless opportunities and the jobs are well paid.Baghdadi's own experience confirmed this. Replies flooded in after he posted a message on Facebook, stating: "Hello from Morocco. I am an English-language teacher searching for a good job with a good salary in China."Many of the replies were job invitations from recruitment agencies, while others came from language institutes. For the most part, they told Baghdadi that applying for a job in China was straightforward. It was sufficient merely to submit a resume.The salary also was tempting. Baghdadi teaches English in Morocco, where he is paid $500 a month. However, those who approached him from China offered a monthly salary ranging from $1,500 to $2,500, with a bonus.But he said some of those who replied appeared too eager to hire foreign teachers, and Baghdadi said he was even given "illegal advice" about getting a job.The regulation on foreign experts' work permits states that overseas language teachers in China must obtain a work visa and be a native speaker with a bachelor's degree or higher, have at least two years of related teaching experience and no criminal record.This means that Baghdadi, who is not a native English speaker and does not have sufficient experience in teaching the language, may never have the chance to work in China as a teacher."But some agencies told me that they could help me apply for a Chinese business visa, and I could become a teacher in China, come what may," he said.Teaching English is a lucrative business in China, as the country's opening-up to the world means more people are looking to learn the "universal language". For foreigners, their nationality and even their skin tone can, at times, be their ticket to securing a teaching job.According to a report last year from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 300 million people in China were learning English. There were 50,000 English-language training institutions in the country and the training market was worth as much as 500 billion yuan ($72 billion), the report said.The high demand for English-language instruction had made finding a job for most foreigners, particularly those who are white, little more than a formality.According to a survey by Banyuetan, a Xinhua News Agency magazine, in 2017, there were more than 400,000 foreign teachers working in the education sector in China, but only one-third of them were employed legally.In recent years, the country has been rocked by a number of high-profile scandals resulting from a lack of vigilance in hiring foreign teachers. In some cases, people with questionable backgrounds have landed jobs.The latest such case occurred last month. On July 23, an English-language teacher from Colombia working at the Hong Huang Lan Kindergarten in Qingdao, Shandong province, was arrested for allegedly molesting a 4-year-old girl.Earlier in July, 16 foreigners were detained in Xuzhou, Jiangsu province, for allegedly taking drugs. According to Xuzhou police, seven of them work for an education company, and the remaining nine are students.Media reports later said a number of foreign teachers from the EF Education center in Xuzhou had been detained by police for allegedly taking drugs. According to the company's website, EF is an international education company based in Sweden, and has centers in many Chinese cities.In April 2013, media reports said that Neil Robinson, from the United Kingdom, had taught at the Beijing World Youth Academy, an international school, for nearly four years while being wanted for questioning by British police in connection with child sex offences.Such cases have aroused widespread concern among parents and students, with many of them calling for the qualifications of foreign teachers at English-learning organizations to be subject to nationwide inspection.On some online expatriate forums, topics such as "How to become an English teacher in China without a work permit", or "nonnative speakers can also teach in China" are popular. They offer tips for those who want to work in the country without the required documentation or experience.One of the items stated, "Although a Chinese work visa is the only visa that it is technically legal to teach with, there is also the possibility that they might offer you an alternative one instead, such as a student visa or a business visa."These are easier and less costly to obtain, which is why this option is sometimes preferred by schools. Additionally, these visas may also be issued if you don't meet the requirements for a work visa (i.e. you don't have a bachelor's degree). While these alternative visas are not technically legal for work, they will permit you to remain in China for an extended period of time, making it easy to find work as a teacher."Alan Coleman, an Australian who is a qualified teacher in Beijing, said many people are teaching because the jobs are well-paid and relatively easy. "It is the fault of the schools, as they employ people who shouldn't be teaching," he added.Most teachers are not qualified. For example, they have not been certified by an internationally recognized English-language teaching and testing program, but still land jobs due to the high demand for native English speakers, Coleman said.Under the law, only foreigners with teaching qualifications or a TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) certificate or TESL (Teaching English as a Second Language) certificate, are allowed to teach in China.Huang Minjiao, who works for a startup English-language teaching institution in Dongguan city, Guangdong province, said, "The truth is, parents seldom ask an agency to look at a teacher's credentials, but want to see if the teacher 'looks like a native English speaker'."Some families in China spend a considerable amount on foreign English-language teachers for their children, but sometimes parents mistakenly think any foreigner－regardless of the level of their skill in the language－can provide quality education in English," Huang said.Coleman added: "Even if someone is a native speaker, I don't believe that they can necessarily become an English-language teacher. Teaching a language is not easy. It's very difficult and you need to work hard to be able to do a good job."With more than 10 years' teaching experience in Portugal, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, Coleman found his job in Beijing through a recruitment agency.A report in China Education Daily said the contracts of the majority of foreign English-language teachers at Chinese schools are still handled by for-profit, third-party recruitment agencies, rather than the schools directly.Eager to make money, many such agencies place applicants' appearance ahead of their teaching qualifications. For them, hiring English-language teachers simply means recruiting foreigners, no matter where they come from. They often hire from countries such as France, Germany or Cuba, and then pressure the recruits to lie to schools about their backgrounds.A Ukrainian student who studied in China wrote on her blog that when she was looking for a job in the country, one agency wanted her to "disguise" her identity and state that she came from the UK. A member of staff told her: "You're blonde and pale-skinned. Anyway, students can't tell which country you're from."According to some media reports, these agencies also offer contracts to foreigners who do not qualify for work visas, and instruct potential teachers to lie on their visa applications to avoid disclosing their work plans. They also fake documents to employ teachers on tourist or business visas rather than the legally required work visas.He Chugang, general manager for the South China region at Amber Education, an overseas study consultancy, said, "Chinese parents remain enthusiastic about English-language acquisition, as 'monotonous' public education cannot satisfy their diverse demands."He said this has led to cases of unqualified, unmotivated and sometimes even non-English-speaking foreigners tutoring Chinese children.He Shu, an associate professor at Peking University who teaches English as a foreign language, said Chinese parents often think that foreigners can introduce their children to Western cultures and improve their English."However, some parents are not educated or experienced enough to tell the difference between a professional teacher and a foreigner who lacks many teaching skills," she said."Also, some non-English-speaking parents believe in the stereotype that every foreigner is supposed to speak English. This phenomenon is not only commonplace in big cities, where overseas tutors are in high demand amid an overwhelming number of foreigners, but English-language tutors are also being sought in smaller provincial towns."However, the situation is expected to change soon. On July 15, the Ministry of Education, together with five other central authorities, issued new guidelines on after-school training to specify the qualifications, requirements and supervision needed for such services.The guideline states that educational institutions must publicly display the personal details of any foreign teachers they employ, including their names, photographs, teaching qualifications and previous academic and professional experience.Institutions should rectify any "problems" before the end of June next year, or could face punishment ranging from a fine to being suspended or closed, the guideline added.

                    ACTION TAKEN OVER ILLEGALLY HIRED ENGLISH TEACHERS

                New guidelines target rogue recruitment agencies Mohsine el Baghdadi always wanted to be an English teacher in China, considering such a job to be ideal. A friend who taught English in China told the 27-year-old Moroccan that foreign teachers are in high demand, there are boundless opportunities and the jobs are well paid. Baghdadi's own experience confirmed this. Replies flooded in after he posted a message on Facebook, saying: "Hello from Morocco. I am an English-language teacher searching for a good job with a good salary in China." Many of the replies were job invitations from recruitment agencies, while others came from language institutes. For the most part, they told Baghdadi that applying for a job in China was straightforward. It was sufficient merely to submit a resume. The salary also was tempting. Baghdadi teaches English in Morocco, where he is paid $500 a month. However, those who approached him from China offered a monthly salary ranging from $1,500 to $2,500, with a bonus. But he said some of those who replied appeared too eager to hire foreign teachers, and Baghdadi said he was even given "illegal advice" about getting a job. The regulation on foreign experts' work permits states that overseas language teachers in China must obtain a work visa and be a native speaker with a bachelor's degree or higher, and have at least two years of related teaching experience and no criminal record. This means that Baghdadi, who is not a native English speaker and does not have sufficient experience in teaching the language, may never have the chance to work in China as a teacher. "But some agencies told me that they could help me apply for a Chinese business visa, and I could become a teacher in China, come what may," he said. Teaching English is a lucrative business in China, as the country's opening-up to the world means more people are looking to learn the "universal language". For foreigners, their nationality and even their skin tone can, at times, be their ticket to securing a teaching job. According to a report last year from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 300 million people in China were learning English. There were 50,000 English-language training institutions in the country and the training market was worth as much as 500 billion yuan ($72 billion), the report said. The high demand for English-language instruction had made finding a job for most foreigners, particularly those who are white, little more than a formality. According to a survey by Banyuetan, a Xinhua News Agency magazine, in 2017, there were more than 400,000 foreign teachers working in the education sector in China, but only one-third of them were employed legally. In recent years, the country has been rocked by a number of high-profile scandals resulting from a lack of vigilance in hiring foreign teachers. In some cases, people with questionable backgrounds have landed jobs. The latest such case occurred last month. On July 23, an English-language teacher from Colombia working at the Hong Huang Lan Kindergarten in Qingdao, Shandong province, was arrested for allegedly molesting a 4-year-old girl. Earlier in July, 16 foreigners were detained in Xuzhou, Jiangsu province, for allegedly taking drugs. According to Xuzhou police, seven of them work for an education company, and the remaining nine are students. Media reports later said a number of foreign teachers from the EF Education center in Xuzhou had been detained by police for allegedly taking drugs. According to the company's website, EF is an international education company based in Sweden, and has centers in many Chinese cities. In April 2013, media reports said that Neil Robinson, from the United Kingdom, had taught at the Beijing World Youth Academy, an international school, for nearly four years while being wanted for questioning by British police in connection with child sex offences. Such cases have aroused widespread concern among parents and students, with many of them calling for the qualifications of foreign teachers at English-learning organizations to be subject to nationwide inspection. On some online expatriate forums, topics such as "How to become an English teacher in China without a work permit", or "nonnative speakers can also teach in China" are popular. They offer tips for those who want to work in the country without the required documentation or experience. One of the items stated, "Although a Chinese work visa is the only visa that it is technically legal to teach with, there is also the possibility that they might offer you an alternative one instead, such as a student visa or a business visa. "These are easier and less costly to obtain, which is why this option is sometimes preferred by schools. Additionally, these visas may also be issued if you don't meet the requirements for a work visa (i.e. you don't have a bachelor's degree). While these alternative visas are not technically legal for work, they will permit you to remain in China for an extended period of time, making it easy to find work as a teacher." Alan Coleman, an Australian who is a qualified teacher in Beijing, said many people are teaching because the jobs are well-paid and relatively easy.

For example, they have not been certified by an internationally recognized English-language teaching and testing program, but still land jobs due to the high demand for native English speakers, Coleman said. Under the law, only foreigners with teaching qualifications or a TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) certificate or TESL (Teaching English as a Second Language) certificate, are allowed to teach in China.

He said this has led to cases of unqualified, unmotivated and sometimes even non-English-speaking foreigners tutoring Chinese children. He Shu, an associate professor at Peking University who teaches English as a foreign language, said Chinese parents often think that foreigners can introduce their children to Western cultures and improve their English. "However, some parents are not educated or experienced enough to tell the difference between a professional teacher and a foreigner who lacks many teaching skills," she said. "Also, some non-English-speaking parents believe in the stereotype that every foreigner is supposed to speak English.

                    Kenya's envoy visits South Sudan for peace deal

            <p class="style-content">
                Kenya's special envoy to South Sudan Kalonzo Musyoka is in the east-central African country to follow up on implementation of the September 2018 peace agreement.Musyoka held a discussion with South Sudan's President Salva Kiir and other senior government officials on Thursday upon arrival to the country's capital Juba, on the progress of implementation of the peace deal.South Sudan's presidency said in a statement that the consultative meeting between Musyoka and the stakeholders as well as signatories to the revitalized peace agreement is meant to ensure the formation of a transitional government of national unity by Nov 12.Musyoka's visit to South Sudan comes three days after the body monitoring South Sudan's ceasefire, the Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring Mechanism, expressed fears over the slow implementation of the peace deal.Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 13th technical committee meeting of cease-fire monitoring body in Juba on Monday, Abiche Ageno, chairman of the monitoring mechanism, said even though much had been achieved in the last three months as the moves toward peace gather momentum, a great deal of work still needs to be done.Ageno said they had assessed 33 cantonment sites out of which two were found unsuitable due to lack of water or a suitable location. The sites are used for screening, training and integrating of troops and rebels into one force.He said despite the challenges posed by the rainy season, a number of civilian buildings had been vacated by the South Sudan Army and the National Security Service.He said out of the 83 buildings identified by the cease-fire monitoring body as being occupied, 47 have been vacated.President Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar signed a peace deal on September 2018 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to officially end the conflict.National armyThe agreement, referred to as the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan, and endorsed by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, gave the parties eight months to unify a national army and resolve internal boundaries.On May 3, the warring parties agreed to extend the pre-transitional period for six months to address outstanding issues such as security arrangements, including screening of forces, determining the number of states and demarcation of boundaries.A nationwide cease-fire between the signatories has been holding since the signing of the agreement, even though fighting has been ongoing between the government and smaller groups clustered in South Sudan's Equatoria region who remain outside the peace deal, according to the International Crisis Group.Africa's youngest nation descended into civil war in December 2013, after President Kiir claimed that Machar was plotting a coup. This led to removal of Machar as vice-president, leading to the eruption of violence between presidential guard soldiers from the two largest ethnic groups in South Sudan.Soldiers from the Dinka ethnic group allied with Kiir while those from the Nuer ethnic group supported Machar. The violence spread to various parts of the country.The conflict has so far claimed over 50,000 lives and internally displaced about 4 million people, with 2.3 million fleeing to neighboring countries as refugees and asylum-seekers.

                Chinese personnel offer help in conflict zones Shen Yun watched her patient's heart rate drop significantly, from 60 beats per minute to 30 and even lower. Then, an oximeter - an instrument used to measure oxygen saturation in the blood - showed that the reading was 0, indicating that the patient's heart had stopped. "We've lost her," one of the nurses said. For a short while, Shen was too astonished to speak. The pregnant woman was her first patient at Abs Hospital in northwestern Yemen. "We've lost her?" a doubtful Shen asked a few seconds later. As a highly experienced obstetrician and gynecologist, Shen knew that the patient had pregnancy-induced hypertension, a condition that can put the life of mother and child at risk. In Beijing, where Shen, 46, usually works, equipment such as cardiograms, monitors and ventilators is available to support surgery. But in Yemen, where medical supplies are limited and the security situation dangerous, births that teeter between life and death are commonplace. Shen quickly decided that the woman needed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR. After working on the patient for 20 minutes, her heart started to beat on its own again. Another weak heartbeat was detected, showing that the baby was also still alive. An anesthetist quickly carried the woman to the operating theater. Shen said it took her less than 30 seconds to rush to her office and change into surgical attire. The next sound she heard was the baby boy crying after a Caesarean section. After four hours' surgery, the mother also emerged from danger. Shen worked at the Yemeni hospital from November 2017 to the following January. She was one of the volunteer doctors from the international medical and humanitarian aid organization Medecins Sans Frontieres, or Doctors Without Borders. When Shen arrived at the hospital, she was the only expatriate obstetrician and gynecologist there. On average, she received 800 to 900 patients a month, performing two to three cesarean sections a day. Most of Shen's patients in Yemen were pregnant women who were critically ill. In China, the maternal mortality rate is about 19.6 per 100,000. However, in Yemen, where the health system is in a chronic state, the rate is 385 per 100,000. "In most Chinese cities, hospital facilities today are constantly improving and upgrading, but in Yemen it's a totally different story," Shen said. She described Abs Hospital as resembling a "countryside clinic", with floors made of sand and stones. With limited room and beds, it was not unusual to see two patients sharing a bed, and sometimes a mat was used in place of a bed. Years of armed conflict in Yemen have led to numerous deaths and injuries. According to UN estimates, more than 22 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in the country. Supplies disrupted The Doctors Without Borders' aid program at Abs Hospital began in July 2015. That year, a coalition led by Saudi Arabia launched a military campaign against the Houthi rebels in Yemen, and the local medical system was paralyzed due to the increasing casualties and malnutrition resulting from the violence. Health facilities were hit by bombs, grenades and artillery fire from the warring parties, with services devastated, medical supplies disrupted and staff members forced to flee. MSF was trying to transform the local medical center at Abs Hospital into a general hospital. But within a month, aid was suspended after an airstrike hit the facility, killing 19 people, including a worker from the organization, which resumed its work in November 2015. "We wouldn't be sacrificing our money and vacations and risking our lives to save others in these dangerous places if we didn't believe in the values that Doctors Without Borders promotes," Shen said. Since it was established in 1971, the organization's mission has been to provide impartial medical relief to victims of war, disease and natural or man-made disasters, irrespective of gender, race, religion, creed or political convictions. Its teams work in some of the most difficult and dangerous places in the world. According to the organization's annual report last year, about one-third of the humanitarian medical assistance it provided was for communities caught in armed conflict. During Shen's two-month stay in Yemen, she often heard the sound of helicopters flying over the hospital. According to the Yemen Data Project, an independent monitoring group, there were 16,749 air raids in Yemen from 2015 to last year, an average of 15 a day. When Shen arrived in 2017, Doctors Without Borders opened 13 cholera treatment centers in Yemen, receiving 100,000 patients. Last year, one of the centers was bombed in airstrikes. Li Xuefeng, an anesthetist from Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, recently returned from Mosul, Iraq, his fourth assignment with Doctors Without Borders, where he provided medical care to people displaced by conflict. "As a doctor working on the frontline of conflicts, there are always many people on hand to ensure our safety," Li said. Since joining the organization in 2015, Li has carried out missions in Pakistan, South Sudan, Syria and Iraq. Similar to his work at a public hospital in Urumqi, where he needs to punch in his arrival and departure times, working on the frontline also requires him to report his working hours, not to his boss, but to a logistics manager. "Each program has at least one safety manager to deal with such work," Li said, adding that while they are working, doctors send messages to the managers to keep them abreast of their location. In addition, a "safety room" is set up for every program. "A safety room is usually built with thick bricks as protection against stray bullets. When there is a dangerous situation, all staff members enter the room and lock the door. With plenty of water, food and medical supplies inside, the organization's workers can temporarily escape from the situation outside," Li said. Although Li has been trained many times to face emergency situations, he considers himself lucky never to have had to use a safety room. But for his patients, every day is a challenge. He recalled a patient in Mosul in her thirties - around his age - with several bullet wounds to her arms and legs who needed to stay in hospital for a series of complicated surgeries. "I cannot imagine how much pain she has suffered and will suffer. The surgeries are painful. She lost her family in the conflict, including her husband, her husband's parents, and two children, one of them only 2 years old, the other 10. As the only survivor of her family, she is facing an uncertain future." To have more free time to take part in the work of Doctors Without Borders, Li resigned from the public hospital he worked for. "My next stop is Gaza, where there may be people who need me," he said. Wei Baozhu, communications officer for Doctors Without Borders in China, said, "A growing number of medical professionals in China are offering their services to aid those most in need." There are more than 40 aid workers with the organization on the Chinese mainland, and over 100 in total in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Twenty years ago, when Doctors Without Borders was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its contribution to humanitarian aid, China was on the organization's "target list". Quake support Doctors Without Borders has worked in China since 1988, initially to provide emergency assistance to people affected by natural disasters. In the decade that followed, it responded to more than 20 cases of flooding, earthquakes, snowstorms and typhoons nationwide - bringing help to tens of millions of people. In the mid-1990s, China's disaster response, management and emergency preparedness capacity, as well as the availability and quality of relief supplies, improved significantly. The organization was able to focus on the treatment of medical and infectious diseases in remote areas of the country. In 2003, it helped control the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, in Hebei province and started to give free comprehensive care and treatment to HIV-positive patients in Xiangfan, Hubei province, and Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, in partnership with Chinese health authorities. These two projects have since been handed over to the two local governments. In 2008, after the devastating earthquake in Wenchuan, Sichuan province, Doctors Without Borders provided emergency relief and psychological support to the victims. Since 2014, it has not carried out rescue projects in China. Wei said, "China's contribution to global health has largely improved in recent years, This can not only be seen in the government's continuous medical aid to regions such as Africa; more and more civilian forces and individuals are also actively engaged in international humanitarian aid." In 2007, the organization established an office on the Chinese mainland in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province. In 2004, during the Indian Ocean tsunami, its office in Hong Kong received many calls from people on the mainland, Wei said. "These people offered help and asked how they could join our organization. We felt it was time to expand our work on the mainland," Wei said. The first mainland staff member to join the organization's mission abroad was Pan Yuan, a logistics employee from Yunnan province. Pan acted as an interpreter for the organization's doctors and other employees when it responded to flooding in Hunan province in 1998. Pan was able to work for Doctors Without Borders as he can speak English, but this has proved to be a hurdle for other applicants. According to the organization's website, applicants should have at least two years' relevant professional experience and the ability to speak English or French fluently, including medical terminology. Zhang Meiwen, an epidemiologist who works for the organization's program in Cambodia, thinks the multinational environment it provides is a bonus for its workers. "The best thing about working for an international humanitarian aid agency is that background or nationality become less important," Zhang said. "Just like our mission, we treat patients impartially; thus doctors and staff members with different cultural backgrounds are also treated in this way in the organization, as we all come together with the same goal of saving lives." Zhang used to work in Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, on an HIV/AIDS program, where she found the true meaning of "without borders". During the day, she and her colleagues from different countries treated HIV/AIDS patients, regardless of whether they were sex workers, drug addicts or prison inmates. After work, the international team treated each other as family, with different colleagues always preparing dinner during weekends. "It's been almost two years since I returned from Kinshasa, but I still remember we practiced boxing every Tuesday night. We always came off duty from the hospital early and gathered in our dormitory's yard. Our boxing instructor, who was a big guy, was a driver for the emergency rescue program. Every time we trained, our muscles were sore until the following Tuesday," Zhang said. "Medical ethics, independence, impartiality and neutrality," are the principles that define the mission of Doctors Without Borders, but it is hard to put those principles into practice. Wei, the communications officer, said the organization is able to gain access to conflict-stricken areas in remote parts of the world by convincing various authorities that it is neutral and can guarantee the safety of its workers. This process can be frustrating, as the organization's workers always have to tell people - regardless of whether they are extremist or local forces - that they are neutral. There are also risks, as the doctors are unarmed. Despite this, Wei said the negotiating process is "inevitable", as it is what keeps them safe. To ensure that it operates independently, the organization collects funding largely from individuals donating small amounts. Last year, more than 6.3 million individual donors, private companies and foundations provided 95 percent of the �1.54 billion ($1.71 billion) the organization raised. "Operating independently is the quality that every member of our organization cherishes. Neutrality is the best tool to ensure our colleagues' and patients' safety. In every hospital established or supported by Doctors Without Borders, there is a large and clear sign saying that no weapons are allowed on the premises. "If a wounded soldier carrying a gun wants to enter one of our hospitals, he must leave his weapon outside. Soldiers who enter our hospitals are treated like any other patients. Whether they return to fight again, we have no right to judge. As a medical humanitarian organization, we try our best to treat the patients most in need," Wei said. panmengqi@chinadaily.com.cn   A group of migrants is transferred to the MV Aquarius off the Libyan coast on May 12 last year.

For a short while, Shen was too astonished to speak. The pregnant woman was her first patient at Abs Hospital in northwestern Yemen."We've lost her?" a doubtful Shen asked a few seconds later. As a highly experienced obstetrician and gynecologist, Shen knew that the patient had pregnancy-induced hypertension, a condition that can put the life of mother and child at risk.In Beijing, where Shen, 46, usually works, equipment such as cardiograms, monitors and ventilators is available to support surgery. But in Yemen, where medical supplies are limited and the security situation dangerous, births that teeter between life and death are commonplace.Shen quickly decided that the woman needed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR. After working on the patient for 20 minutes, her heart started to beat on its own again. Another weak heartbeat was detected, showing that the baby was also still alive.An anesthetist quickly carried the woman to the operating theater.Shen said it took her less than 30 seconds to rush to her office and change into surgical attire. The next sound she heard was the baby boy crying after a Caesarean section. After four hours' surgery, the mother also emerged from danger.Shen worked at the Yemeni hospital from November 2017 to the following January. She was one of the volunteer doctors from the international medical and humanitarian aid organization Medecins Sans Frontieres, or Doctors Without Borders.When Shen arrived at the hospital, she was the only expatriate obstetrician and gynecologist there. On average, she received 800 to 900 patients a month, performing two to three cesarean sections a day.Most of Shen's patients in Yemen were pregnant women who were critically ill. In China, the maternal mortality rate is about 19.6 per 100,000. However, in Yemen, where the health system is in a chronic state, the rate is 385 per 100,000."In most Chinese cities, hospital facilities today are constantly improving and upgrading, but in Yemen it's a totally different story," Shen said.She described Abs Hospital as resembling a "countryside clinic", with floors made of sand and stones. With limited room and beds, it was not unusual to see two patients sharing a bed, and sometimes a mat was used in place of a bed.Years of armed conflict in Yemen have led to numerous deaths and injuries. According to UN estimates, more than 22 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in the country.

                Medardo Sanchez, an agriculture expert from El Salvador, traveled with 10 of his compatriots for nearly 50 hours to reach Hainan Island on July 15-the longest journey of his life.The contingent had come to find solutions for agricultural problems in their homeland."As a tropical country, it is a shame we have to import many lichees every year because of the low yield of local fruit trees. To our dismay, some only grow flowers and bear no fruit," said Sanchez, an adviser to El Salvador's Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry.The 25-day training course on production technology of tropical fruits for developing countries held in Hainan, China's only subtropical province, made his long journey worthwhile."I believe with the new skills learned in Hainan, lichee trees in my country will be able to bear more fruit and the output of pitaya (dragon fruit) is likely to grow 10 times from the current yield," Sanchez said at the closing ceremony on Aug 9 in Haikou, the capital of the province.Judy Ngina, an agriculture expert from Kenya, said the course, which included lectures and practical classes from academics from the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Science at Hainan University was enlightening. Subjects covered included tropical crop cultivation, propagation, fertilization, pest management and processing of tropical fruits, she said."We will take home a wealth of deeper knowledge on planting, harvesting and post-harvesting technology of tropical fruits and cannot wait to put it into practice," she said.The training course involved 28 participants from seven developing countries: El Salvador, Ghana, Kenya, the Philippines, South Africa, South Sudan and Uganda.Over the past 15 years, with support from the central and Hainan governments, CATAS has organized more than 100 training courses for 4,000 participants from 95 countries.The academy was established in 1958 and has played a major role in developing China's tropical agriculture industry, said Liu Guodao, vice-president of CATAS.
