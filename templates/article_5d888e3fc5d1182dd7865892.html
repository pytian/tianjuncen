                Sino-Russian partnership gets verve to improve world order: China Daily editorial
            </p>
            <p>
                To the China-Russia partnership, the 24th regular meeting between their heads of government, which concluded in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Wednesday, gave a shot in the arm. There is no better way for the two sides to secure international support as both have come under increasing external pressure to change their diplomatic maneuvering on the global stage.The joint communiqué Beijing and Moscow issued proves the claim that the Sino-Russian partnership, now officially described as comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era, has reached a historical high. Not least because the document literally instills the idea of comprehensive strategic partnership into all aspects of bilateral relations, showcasing the two sides' shared commitment to formulating a new kind of Sino-Russian partnership in global governance.Emphatically, it reiterates the importance of securing mutual support. With both under pressure of externally imposed economic hardships, Beijing and Moscow are laying unprecedented emphasis on tapping the full potential of bilateral collaboration. And given their highly complementary economic structures as well as economic conditions, they do have room for such endeavors.The document they issued on Wednesday vows to raise bilateral trade, which surpassed $100 billion in 2018, to $200 billion by 2024 through trade facilitation. Besides promises of dovetailing their respective key development strategies, the Beijing-proposed Belt and Road Initiative and Moscow's Eurasian Economic Union, they have pledged to make joint efforts to address current issues, from collaboration on soy production to avoiding risks of sanctions from the West.While making their partnership true to its comprehensive nature, China and Russia have made it clear in the joint communiqué that their cooperation is not limited to bilateral affairs. Despite being a little less specific when it comes to such issues, the document does indicate the clear orientation of the two countries to work more closely together in the international arena. As responsible major countries, it says, China and Russia share the obligation for improving global governance and safeguarding international justice.That Beijing and Moscow have vowed to deepen cooperation on such multilateral international platforms as the United Nations, World Trade Organization, Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS reflects the seriousness with which they intend to work to build a world order that is fairer and more representative of nations.Since the current pattern of Sino-Russian interaction is the outcome of de facto Western isolation, it should come as no surprise if the two are found acting more in unison against rising protectionism and unilateralism that have cast a shadow over the world.

                UN nuclear watchdog starts general conference amid mounting Iran tension
            </a>
            <p>
                 VIENNA - The International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) 63rd General Conference opened here on Monday amid heightened tensions over the Iran nuclear deal.Many of the IAEA's 171 member states are represented at the meeting from Monday to Friday. The application of the IAEA's safeguards in the Middle East and in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as issues related to radiation safety and ways of strengthening the agency's technical cooperation activities are on the agenda.Discussing the crisis over Iran nuclear deal, IAEA Acting Director General Cornel Feruta told the conference: "A week ago I visited Tehran for talks with senior Iranian officials ... I continue to emphasize the importance of full and timely cooperation by Iran in the implementation of its Safeguards Agreement and additional protocol.""The agency continues to verify the non-diversion of nuclear material declared by Iran under its Safeguards Agreement," said the acting IAEA chief, noting that "Evaluations regarding the absence of the undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran continue."Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), condemned the "economic terrorism" pursued by the US administration and called on the international community to assume joint responsibility for saving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)."The violation of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution (2231) and the imposition of unilateral unlawful sanctions, as well as the application of extra-territorial national laws to other countries by the United States, certainly endangers international peace and security," he said."If the international community fails to save the JCPOA promptly, multilateralism will lose its effectiveness, and any further peaceful resolution of global conflicts will be challenged, which will subsequently serve the malign interests of warmongers," he said.While Iran said that the steps to downgrade its nuclear commitments aim to "provide a new window for diplomacy to preserve the deal," the US called it a nuclear blackmail."Iran continues to use its nuclear program to extort the international community and threaten regional security," according to a message from US President Donald Trump shared with the conference by US Energy Secretary Rick Perry.The European Union (EU), on the other hand, noted Iran's "stated intentions" to remain within the JCPOA and urged the country to reverse its steps and return to full JCPOA compliance, according to Petri Peltonen, Finland's under-secretary of state at the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment."The EU deeply regrets the withdrawal of the United States from the JCPOA and the reimposed sanctions, and calls upon all countries to refrain from taking actions that impede the implementation of the JCPOA," said Peltonen.The EU is deeply concerned that Iran has exceeded the JCPOA stockpile limit of enriched uranium, and is particularly concerned about the development reported by the IAEA regarding Iran's expansion of its centrifuge R&D activities, according to Peltonen.He stressed that the full implementation of the nuclear deal by Iran is and remains essential.Perry echoed US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's accusation that Iran was responsible for launching the recent drone attacks on two Aramco oil facilities in the east of Saudi Arabia, which caused major damages and halved Saudi oil output.Iran's Foreign Ministry on Monday rejected the US claims that Iran was behind the drone attacks, saying "such claims are baseless and are condemned."The United Nations' atomic watchdog confirmed earlier last week that advanced centrifuges had been installed at an Iranian nuclear plant in breach of limitations set by the 2015 nuclear deal with major powers.In reaction to the unilateral withdrawal by the US from the JCPOA and its sanctions on Tehran, and in response to Europe's "inactivity" to save Iran's interests under the deal, Iran decided in May this year to scale back its obligations under the JCPOA to build stockpiles of nuclear fuel and enrich low-grade uranium to a higher level of purity.It also decided to start up advanced centrifuges to boost the country's stockpile of enriched uranium.

                China releases application guide for Antarctic travel
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - China's Ministry of Natural Resources has recently released an application guide for tourist activities at the Great Wall station in Antarctica.Enterprises that have travel plans to the Antarctic research station can submit applications to the ministry on working days from Sept. 15 to 30 every year, the ministry said on its website.The Great Wall station, built in 1985, is China's first research base on the continent. It is located near a nature reserve where groups of penguins and seals are often seen.The research station is the most popular destination for domestic tourists. With only 30 staff, it receives more than 2,000 Chinese visitors each summer and is faced with increasing pressure to perform its regular tasks and maintain its safety and environment.China is a consultative member of the Antarctic Treaty. In order to fulfill the obligations of the international conventions, all applying enterprises must strengthen education on environmental protection for visitors, and comply with the protection requirements of the Antarctic environment, wild animals and plants, the ministry said.China is now ranked second as a tourist source for Antarctica after the United States.
