                LOS ANGELES - Medieval fantasy Game of Thrones scored a record 32 Emmy nominations on Tuesday, but the contenders for the highest honors in television were dominated by newcomers, many of them women, and shows about political and social justice.The 2019 lineup for the Emmys represented the widest array of first-time nominees in eight years, the Television Academy said, with nine new shows contending for the top prizes of best drama and best comedy series.They included female-driven BBC America thriller Killing Eve, which also won nods for stars Jodie Comer and Sandra Oh; dark comedy Fleabag, from Amazon.com's Amazon Studios, which got 11 nominations including for its British creator and star, Phoebe Waller-Bridge; and surreal Netflix time-loop comedy Russian Doll, written by its star, Natasha Lyonne.Laura Linney, a best actress nominee for her role in Netflix drug smuggling drama Ozark, said she was "thrilled that I somehow ended up in this group of kick-ass women, who all raise the bar over and over again."In a crowded landscape of top-quality shows, A-list stars Julia Roberts and George Clooney were seen as the biggest snubs on Tuesday, failing to get nominations in their high-profile returns to the small screen in Homecoming and Catch-22 respectively.The Big Bang Theory, which ended its run in May as the most-watched comedy on US television, was shut out of the major categories.HBO got a leading 137 nominations, an Emmy record.The Emmy awards will be handed out at a ceremony in Los Angeles on Sept 22.

                    Ukraine marks 33rd anniversary of Chernobyl disaster

                KIEV -- Ukraine on Friday marked the 33rd anniversary of the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (NPP), when a combination of human errors and negligence caused one of the worst nuclear disasters in human history.On April 26, 1986, a series of explosions ripped through the No 4 reactor at the Chernobyl NPP, some 110 km north of Kiev, spreading radiation across Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and other European countries.Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said that the whole world still remembers the tragedy 33 years after the disaster."We are remembering," Poroshenko tweeted.Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman paid tribute to people involved in clean-up works at the Chernobyl plant and around it after the disaster."You have managed to localize the accident and save hundreds of thousands of lives. We cherish the memory of the deceased heroes and wish good health to those alive," Groysman wrote on Facebook.Meanwhile, Oleksandr Turchynov, secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, said that humanity should learn Chernobyl lessons."The pain of Chernobyl must unite the efforts of the whole world in order to prevent a repeat of a terrible catastrophe," Turchynov said in a statement.

                    Russia to make its own 'Chernobyl', after US version scores high
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Russian state TV is working on a series based on the worst nuclear accident in history, Chernobyl, which claims it will show "what really happened back then".Different from the version made by the United States' HBO, which recently ended and jumped to the highest-ever spot on IMDb's all-time TV rankings, the NTV series will claim that the Central Intelligence Agency was involved in the disaster.Aleksey Muradov, director of the NTV drama, said his version of show "proposes an alternative view on the tragedy in Pripyat", and will show "what really happened back then"."There is a theory that Americans infiltrated the Chernobyl nuclear power plant … Many historians do not rule out the possibility that on the day of the explosion, an agent of the enemy's intelligence services was working at the station," he said in an interview with Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.The Chernobyl nuclear disaster occurred on April 26, 1986 at the No 4 nuclear reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Soviet Ukraine, then a part of the Soviet Union.The explosion is controversially believed to have caused thousands of casualties. The Chernobyl accident is considered the most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history, both in terms of cost and casualties.At least 31 people were killed in the immediate aftermath, and the effects continue to be felt to this day. Authorities say it only will be safe for humans to live in Chernobyl again in 24,000 years.The Chernobyl accident and the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan are the only two nuclear energy accidents classified as "level-7 major accidents", the maximum classification on the International Nuclear Event Scale.The miniseries, titled Chernobyl by HBO and Sky, was well received by Russian audiences. The show highlights how Soviet-era Ukrainian authorities reacted very callously when the explosion released radioactive material across Belarus, Russia and Ukraine."I think this is a very high-quality product in terms of television series, there's nothing to find fault with," Susanna Alperina, film and television critic for Rossiiskaya Gazeta daily, said in an interview with AFP.But Russian media described the series as "propaganda" that exaggerated how non-reactive the authority was and the long time they took to officially acknowledge the accident and evacuate the area.According to the Times, the NTV's production will be anchored in the premise that a CIA operative was at Chernobyl conducting sabotage. The series follows a group of KGB officials working to track down the infiltrator.

                    Ukraine to turn Chernobyl disaster zone into tourist site
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Time has come to change image, says presidentOne of the most infamous place names in Europe is about to become an unlikely tourist destination after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree to transform the area around the site of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster into a visitor attraction.A fire and explosion at the site in what was then part of the Soviet Union in April 1986 saw a huge cloud of radioactive smoke shroud the surrounding area and contaminate an estimated 50,000 square kilometers of land.In the immediate aftermath 31 people died but an accurate assessment of the lasting health and pollution impact on areas of land across Europe remains incalculable, although the World Health Organisation estimates that the incident could be linked to as many as 9,000 deaths."Chernobyl has been a negative part of Ukraine's brand," said Zelensky, as he announced plans for improved mobile phone reception and new walking trails to encourage visitors. "The time has come to change this."The newly elected president made the announcement at the inauguration ceremony of a new metal dome which has been built over the remains of the reactor, 275-meter wide and 108-meter tall and costing $1.7 billion, to prevent further radioactive pollution escaping from the site.The fact that 45 countries contributed financially to the project, as well as the European Union and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, reflects the full international impact of what happened at the site.The name Chernobyl has been thrust back into the spotlight recently because of the success of a television drama series based on events at the site in 1986, which the deputy director of the plant, Alexander Kovalenko, told journalists "more or less reflected the drama of the situation. But in real life it was much worse".This publicity has resulted in an increase in visitors to what was already a popular destination for adventurous tourists, despite the high contamination levels, but now the government has chosen to formally embrace it and redevelop it."We will create a green corridor for tourists," Zelensky went on. "Chernobyl is a unique place on the planet where nature (has been) reborn after a huge man-made disaster. We have to show this place to the world: to scientists, ecologists, historians (and) tourists."The aftermath of the explosion saw more than 110,000 people moved from their homes in a 30 km-radius around the site, with residential neighborhoods abandoned as a ghost town, left to nature and the local animal community, which has given scientists an unexpected opportunity for wildlife monitoring.  One surprise caught on camera was the first sighting of brown bears in the area in a century.

                    Chernobyl TV series sparks tours
                </p>
            </a>

                IGNALINA, Lithuania－Walking along the top of Lithuania's decommissioned nuclear reactor, which was a set for HBO's critically acclaimed Chernobyl TV series, tourist Vytas Miknaitis says he's not "afraid at all"."They know what they're doing," the retired computer engineer from Chicago says, referring to organizers of the three-hour tour of the Ignalina power station in eastern Lithuania.Similar in design to the Chernobyl reactor nearly 450 kilometers away, Ignalina provided the backdrop for the show's outdoor scenes, shot last year.The state's only nuclear power plant built in Soviet times was open to the public even before the Chernobyl drama first aired in May but has since seen a steady uptick in visitors on the heels of the show's success.Tourists don white overalls, walk on top of the reactor and tour the various work stations, including a command post built to resemble the one in the series.They can even pretend to be the protagonists pushing the various buttons.Ignalina plant spokeswoman Natalija Survila-Glebova said that the series had attracted a new stream of visitors, mostly Lithuanians but also foreign tourists from countries like Poland, Latvia and the United Kingdom.Last month, there were 900 visitors, she said, adding that tours were "almost completely booked through the end of the year". Due to the ongoing dismantling work, tours are only open to adults.The Soviet Union's Chernobyl plant, in what is now Ukraine, was the scene of the world's worst nuclear disaster, when one of its reactors exploded in 1986 during testing.It polluted a big part of Europe, with the area immediately around the power plant the worst affected by radioactive emissions.In recent years, the abandoned site has become a "dark tourism" destination, even before the eponymous US TV drama that has picked up 19 Emmy nominations.Lithuania, like Ukraine, is a former Soviet republic. It began decommissioning Ignalina in December 2009.The European Union made its closure a condition of the small country's 2004 admission to the bloc because the plant had two reactors that were the same model as those at Chernobyl.Chernobyl tours have also sprung up in other parts of Lithuania where the series was filmed, including the capital, Vilnius.Visitor Vytautas Kastanauskas, who works in tourism, marveled at how the producers were able to recast parts of the picturesque city as a Soviet-era industrial outpost."The atmosphere of the time and the nature of the relationships between people, everything was recreated perfectly in the series," said the 47-year-old, who experienced Soviet times.The northern Fabijoniskes neighborhood was transformed into Pripyat, a city of nearly 50,000 people near Chernobyl that was abandoned after the disaster.The makers of Chernobyl used the drab, gray district, with row upon row of Soviet-era housing blocks, as the location to shoot Pripyat's mass evacuation.One young Lithuanian has even refurbished his grandparents' Fabijoniskes apartment in the Soviet style and opened it up to visitors and Airbnb stays.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE

                SYDNEY - One of the world's largest rare earth producers Lynas has confirmed on Thursday that the Malaysian government has renewed its operating licence, but the decision has created deep divisions within Malaysia.With a mine site in Mount Weld, the Western Australian company ships ore to its facility in Malaysia for processing. However a by-product of this enrichment process is "low-level radioactive waste.""I don't understand why Lynas, an Australian company, does this to Malaysia," chemical engineer Moses Lim told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation at a recent protest in Kuantan where hundreds gathered to oppose the licence extension."(The radioactivity) will be passed through our children and our children's children. We may be gone, but our grandchildren will curse us," he said.Rare earth is a vital component in everything from aerospace technologies, advanced military applications, batteries, metal alloys, magnets, lighting, solar grids, telecommunications and smartphone devices.With the issue becoming increasingly toxic among many Malaysians, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad attempted to reassure locals about the risks associated with the waste product."It's not Chernobyl. This isn't going to be dangerous," he said recently.As part of the new extension deal, Lynas will now have six months to permanently dispose of around 580,000 tons of radio-active waste which is currently being stockpiled in its Kuantan plant.But a suitable location in Malaysia is yet to be determined.

                    More visitors heading to Chernobyl, despite the risks

                Nuclear disaster site popular 'dark tourism' areaAfter Li Yimeng took a one-day trip to Chernobyl in Ukraine, she washed her shoes five times, scrubbing away any radiation that may have been on the soles.She also washed her clothes and backpack after visiting the area, scene of the Chernobyl disaster－the world's biggest nuclear power plant accident－which occurred on April 26, 1986.Since the abandoned area was opened to tourists in 2011, there has been an increasing number of visitors. But radiation risks remain."The sudden fear I experienced after the trip was purely psychological, but I didn't feel ill," said Li, a photographer from Beijing, who traveled to Ukraine in October.When the disaster happened, parts of the then Soviet Union, including Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, were exposed to substantial amounts of radiation, with aftereffects in the following years including increased cases of thyroid cancer. The Soviet Union broke up in 1991, five years after the meltdown.Tourists can book a guided one-day tour of the area through travel agencies in Kiev, capital of Ukraine.Local travel agencies claim that as radioactivity levels fall over time, and with cleanup operations being staged at Chernobyl, short visits along designated routes are safe, but tourists must follow safety regulations.Some travel agencies state on their websites that the total amount of radiation a person is exposed to during a 10-hour trip to the area is several times lower than the level experienced during a transatlantic flight.However, the potential risk is still there, as the dangerous nuclear waste is sealed in a "tomb".Immediately after the meltdown in 1986, a massive steel and concrete structure, known as "the sarcophagus", was hastily constructed to cover the damaged nuclear reactor number 4 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. The installation was completed at the end of November that year.By the end of 2016, Ukraine and other countries worked together to establish a giant shield to replace the sarcophagus to prevent further leaks of radioactivity. The shield is designed to secure the site for the next 100 years, and tourists can take photos of the area from a distance.Chernobyl is one of the most popular areas for "dark tourism", which refers to traveling to places associated with death and tragedy.After the hit TV miniseries Chernobyl aired on HBO in May, increasing numbers of tourists have been keen to visit the disaster area.According to the Chicago Tribune, the Ukrainian government reported that nearly 72,000 visitors traveled to Chernobyl last year, up from 50,000 in 2017.In July, the Ukrainian government said it would make Chernobyl an official tourist site, with plans to improve infrastructure, checkpoints, routes, waterways and radiation monitoring.
