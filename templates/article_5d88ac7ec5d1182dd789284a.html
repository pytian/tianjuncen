                If there's a list of places that matter most in global agricultural development, Hunan province in Central China will be positioned high. At the age of 89, Yuan Longping, known as the father of hybrid rice, is still tilling at a hybrid rice research center in Changsha, capital of the province. Almost half a century has passed since he developed the first strain of hybrid rice in 1970. Yuan said he saw people die of hunger when he was young, and that has made him dedicate himself to increasing food production and helping combat starvation. Thanks to the hard work of his team, hybrid rice now has a yield of up to 18 metric tons per hectare. And they came up with a new high-yield strain of rice that can grow in saltwater paddies in 2018. Their experiment of planting saltwater-tolerant rice in desert areas of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates proved to be a success, with one type of rice yielding more than 7.5 tons per hectare, Xinhua reported. The saltwater-tolerant rice is designed to grow in tidal flats or other areas with heavy salt content. It was the world's first successful case of planting rice in a tropical desert area, standing as China's contribution to improve the capability of people in desert areas to be self-sufficient in staple foods. By the end of 2018, farmers in more than 40 countries have planted more than 7 million hectares of hybrid rice. Hunan province is offering a hand to train agricultural professionals from around the world. One of them is a Cameroonian postgraduate student at Hunan Agricultural University. Preferring to go by his Chinese name Chu Ke, which literally means Hunan plants, the 25-year old student said his biggest wish is to learn more about agriculture in the province and be a modern farmer back in Africa. Hunan is one of the most productive crop planters in China. Its annual crop yields have stood at more than 30 billion kilograms for five years in a row. The province's deep-rooted history of rice cultivation can be traced back more than 10,000 years, evidenced by relics unearthed in 1993 and 1995 at an archeological site in Daoxian county. Nowadays, the province ranks among the top producers of rice, pork and aquatic products in the country and boasts high-level agricultural mechanization. In a 2018 article, Du Jiahao, Party secretary of Hunan, said the province has made new major achievements in agricultural and rural development over the past few years. Government data show that rural residents' average disposable income in Hunan increased 8.9 percent to more than 14,090 yuan ($1,970) in 2018 from a year earlier, and the proportion of poor people to the province's total population fell to 1.49 percent at the end of 2018 from 13.43 percent in 2012. Looking forward, Du said: "Hunan will make further efforts to upgrade agriculture in a comprehensive way, push for new progress in rural areas and help farmers seek all-round development."

                Editor's note: This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.On Sept 16, 2002, the first International Rice Congress kicked off in Beijing, attracting more than 1,000 scientists and officials worldwide to discuss issues concerning the development of the rice industry, as seen in this item from China Daily.Dubbed the "Olympics of Rice Science", it has been held every four years. The fifth congress was held in Singapore last year.China has become a world leader in hybrid rice, which can yield 15-20 percent more than unmodified rice.Developed by Chinese scientists led by Yuan Longping, who is known as "the father of hybrid rice", China was the first country to successfully produce hybrid rice for temperate climates in the 1970s.In 1979, techniques for making hybrid rice were introduced into the United States, the first case of intellectual property rights transfer in the China's modern history.The crop is now grown in more than 30 countries and regions, with the total area under cultivation surpassing 7 million hectares.By 2003, half of China's rice production was hybrid strains.Yuan set world records in hybrid rice yield - in 1999, 2005, 2011 and 2017.Covering 16 million hectares, or about 53 percent of China's rice acreage, rice output has grown from 6 metric tons per hectare in the 1970s to 15 metric tons now.The new variety has made a solid contribution to helping feed the Chinese people - who account for 21 percent of the global population, while the country has only 7 percent of the world's arable land.Yuan, now 90, continues his research. At Qingdao's Saline-Alkali Tolerant Rice Research and Development Center in Shandong province, which he leads, a successful experiment has been carried out in planting rice in the Dubai desert.It is the first time that rice has been grown in a desert, and is seen as a major contribution to food self-sufficiency, global food security and improving the environment of desert regions.Yuan said one of his dreams is to transform about 667,000 hectares of saline-alkaline land and produce at least 30 million metric tons of rice every year enough to feed an additional 80 million people.
