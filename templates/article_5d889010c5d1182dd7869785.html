                AVIC International launches ATC season five
            </p>
            <p>
                The AVIC International, a Chinese diversified business group in partnership with the Kenyan Ministry of Education, on Thursday launched the fifth season of Africa Tech Challenge (ATC) aimed at empowering the youth in technical training institutions with practical skills.The challenge will cover five African countries, namely Cote D'Ivoire, Kenya, Gabon, Ghana and Zambia and it will award a manufacturing contract worth $100,000 to the top two teams.Additionally, the three most outstanding participants will be awarded with Scholarships to study in China so as to specialize in their skills and gain more knowledge and technical expertise.AVIC International will empower the participants by providing technical training in CNC Lathe Machining techniques and Mechatronics Engineering for a period of 45 days at the Technical University of Kenya and Kenya Technical Trainers College respectively. In line with Kenya's Big Four Agenda, the challenge supports the nation's goal of ensuring that the East African country has readily available skilled labor to steer the manufacturing sector forward.Hosted under the Kenya's Ministry of Education, ATC is working with various educational institutions in Africa to increase and develop professional skills. This initiative will train 27 teams that will see at least 108 young men and women across the continent get specialized expertise.According to Jin Yetao, Director of the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), AVIC International Holding Corporation in Kenya, the company has successfully held four ATC professional skills contests through a specialized process, where they train youth on current and future required skills."Our aim is to promote development of professional skills education in Africa, adapt to international standards, and connect with the world's highest-level of professional skills," he said.Jin said ATC's strategy is informed by Kenya's Vision 2030 goal of transforming the nation into an industrializing economy."Training is at the core of the challenge and we kick off with training 27 teams, out of which 23 will come from technical training institutions in various parts of Kenya. The remaining four teams will come from technical institutions from Ghana, Zambia, Cote d'Ivoire and Gabon, making this challenge truly an African contest," he said.Jin said the partnership with Ministry of Education has enabled them to successfully carry out ATC and train the youth in the past seasons which is in line with the government's plan to empower the tertiary institutions and increase access to TVET."Through improving the technical education sector we have been upgrading the practical skills of students pursuing technical courses in Kenya to meet the needs of the country in its growth and industrialization. Kenya and Africa as a whole presents a very great opportunity for us to exploit the potential of the youth and we are always happy to be part of this journey," he said.Dr. Kevit Desai, Principal Secretary from the Ministry of Education's State Department of TVET said the ministry is committed to ensuring provision of the right skills and competencies for national development."We are proud to partner with ATC as it supports the ministry in offering young people an opportunity to get equipped with relevant and quality skills to meet the needs of the labour market," he said.Dr. Desai said ATC responds to the need for youth empowerment in efforts to drive the industrial revolution in the continent."ATC also provides support as a TVET partner to the Ministry of Education so as to create sustainability and longevity in this project," he said.The challenge has had four successful seasons since its inception in June 2014. It is a youth empowerment program that seeks to equip the youth with technical skills, in the form of a training then a competition whereby all ATC participants receive certificates to show participation plus outline the skills gained during training which allows them to easily access internship or attachment and job opportunities.Lynette Mwende, Public Policy, Advocacy and Strategy at AVIC International Project Engineering Company Limited said ATC is a dream come true not only for the ministry of education but also for Avic International."ATC has been a fulfilled dream and a great milestone, we see great vision from the talents that we continue to nurture in ATC. Through the program, I have seen young African advance their skills and take their career to the next level," she says.Mwende said AVIC is committed to working with the youth and imparting them with skills so that they can empower others.Contact the writer at edithmutethya@chinadaily.com.cn.

                Jin Yetao Scholarship for vocational training launches in Kenya
            </a>
            <p>
                In honor of Jin Yetao, a Chinese national who died in the March 10 crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, the Kenya-China Economic and Trade Association on Monday announced the launch of a scholarship in his name to support vocational and technical training development in Kenya.Jin was an employee of Aviation Industry Corporation of China, a trade association member. He devoted his entire career to vocational and technical training development in Kenya and the Greater East African region."The Jin Yetao Scholarship is a special scholarship bestowed by the trade association, dedicated to college students in vocational and technical universities. As we deeply regret the untimely loss of an excellent Chinese citizen who dedicated his professional career to the development of Africa, the impact and legacy he has left behind through his work is immense. Through this scholarship we wish to continue that legacy," Li Changgui, the trade association's chairman, said."It is our sincere hope that the scholarship in his honor will encourage generations to come to follow in his footsteps to promote vocational and technical skills in the Kenyan workforce, which is of paramount importance to the Big Four Agenda and overall development of Kenya," added Li, who is also general manager of the China Road and Bridge Corporation in Kenya.According to Li Chen, the trade association's secretary, the scholarship commenced with an initial Ksh1.5 million ($15,000) to benefit 15 Kenyan students. The first batch scholarships will be awarded in September. Universities that have expressed willingness to participate in the program include Kenya Technical Trainers College and Kiambu Institute of Science and Technology.Li indicated only students in their last two years of study are eligible to apply and she hopes more higher vocational institutes in Kenya will be involved in the program.Born in 1986, Jin joined AVIC International immediately after graduating with a bachelor's degree in 2011. He was in charge of the company's overseas vocational and technical training programs, traveling to more than 30 countries in 2018 alone. He was on a training program mission when he boarded the ill-fated flight from Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, to Kenya's capital, Nairobi, which ended in a horrific crash that claimed the lives of all 157 passengers and crew.In remembrance of their beloved colleague, AVIC International staffers expressed deep sorrow for Jin's sudden demise."He was very young, passionate and dedicated. He had loved and valued the work he was doing. He was a shining star from China who had made great contributions to vocational training, medical insurance and infrastructure development in Kenya. It is fair to say he was an excellent ambassador of the Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to expand cooperation between China and Africa. We will remember him forever," said Su Tianshu, the chief representative of AVIC International Kenya.Kevit Desai, the principal secretary of the State Department for Vocational and Technical Training in Kenya, expressed appreciation of the Jin Yetao Scholarship."As the government aims to deliver the Big Four Agenda and as we continue to promote Kenya's regional and global competitiveness, we understand how important vocational and technical skills are. They are the foundation in which all industries will prosper and lead to the creation of meaningful jobs that will have a huge impact on the Kenyan economy," Desai said.He also expressed his condolences to the victims and families of the plane crash."We are saddened by the devastation that the air crash has caused so many families, but we must inherit the victims' will and continue what they started. In that sense, the scholarship is very timely and has great significance," he added.Desai echoed comments by Guo Ce, the economic and commercial counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Kenya."We appreciate the kind gesture from the trade association to set up such a special scholarship. Jin is a representative of hundreds of Chinese expatriates working in many different sectors across Kenya. His story will encourage our Chinese compatriots and their Kenyan counterparts to work even harder and jointly promote our friendship to an even higher level," the diplomat said.The trade association is a non-governmental organization that comprises 97 members of Chinese companies. The association aims to explore business cooperation between China and Kenya to enhance cultural exchanges, while actively shouldering corporate social responsibilities to promote community cohesion.
