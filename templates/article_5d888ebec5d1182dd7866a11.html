                    Exercise to protect China
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China on Friday held a large-scale drill simulating the PLA protecting Chinese administration ships disturbed by foreign ships in the East China Sea. A helicopter tries to save a fisherman during a joint exercise by civilian maritime authorities and the People’s Liberation Army Navy in the East China Sea on Friday.[Zhang Lei / For China Daily]The drill comes amid a festering territorial dispute with Japan.When asked about the exercises, the Foreign Ministry said on Friday that Beijing is determined to protect its territory and called on Japan to return to negotiations.The exercise is likely a hard-line response from Beijing to a joint US-Japan drill targeting the Diaoyu Islands, experts and media have said.Friday's drill involved all the major Chinese maritime forces, from warships to maritime patrol and fishery administration ships.A fleet of 11 vessels and eight aircraft participated in the one-day drill. According to reports, the navy sent at least two missile destroyers as well as fighter planes and a hospital ship.It was based on the scenario of the navy sending warships and aircraft to protect Chinese law enforcement ships damaged in deliberate collisions by foreign ships in the East China Sea.The drill was announced by Xinhua News Agency late on Thursday.China has previously sent maritime surveillance ships and fisheries patrol vessels to waters near the islands as the territorial row escalated.On Tuesday, Japanese military aircraft spotted seven Chinese warships not far from the disputed islands. China said the ships were on a routine training mission. Xinhua said patrol vessels from the fishery administration and the marine surveillance agencies have recently been stalked and harassed by foreign vessels while carrying out missions.Hong Kong-based Wen Wei Po quoted a military critic as saying that the"high-profile notice" of Friday's drill is very rare as the PLA usually announces its exercises a few days after the actions finish.It is deliberately showing China's law enforcement capabilities in the East China Sea, it said.Xia Ziming, deputy head of the Directorate of Operations of the East China Sea Fleet headquarters, told China National Radio that this is the first time for the navy, maritime surveillance and fishery administration agencies to have a joint drill. “It is the largest one in recent years," Xia said.The Ministry of National Defense also posted reports high on its website, though it has yet to comment directly on the drill.When asked about the exercise, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei on Friday gave no direct answer, but said the Chinese government"is resolute and determined to safeguard national territorial sovereignty".Japan should be the one to take the responsibility for the escalating tensions, Hong said at a daily briefing.“We hope the Japanese side can squarely face the realities, correct mistakes and come back to the track of resolving the Diaoyu Islands dispute through negotiations," Hong said.Smooth coordination between military and civilian organs is the most prominent feature of this drill, Song Xiaojun, a military affairs commentator, told China Central Television. “China hopes to solve maritime disputes through peaceful negotiations, while such peaceful means is actually based on our administrative bodies' and navy's capabilities to handle security issues," he said.It's rare but important for the aircraft to join the"multi-dimension" drill as information sharing and coordination between vessels and aircraft should be improved, said Li Jie, a researcher from the Naval Military Studies Research Institute.“Various law enforcement forces have to properly work together as maritime rights can hardly be safeguarded solely by the navy now," he said.Feng Wei, an expert on Japanese studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, said the drill has sent a clear warning signal to Japan.But Japan's sense of crisis might also grow in the face of China's soaring naval strength, he noted.South Korea's Yonghap News Agency quoted an expert on foreign policies as saying that the drill is"obviously targeted at the US-Japan joint exercise" and exerting pressure on Japan.The Friday drill has come on the eve of a joint military drill between Washington and Tokyo scheduled to start on Nov 5, which will involve the simulated retaking of a remote island from foreign forces.This is the first time Japan and the US have had an"island retaking" drill on a Japanese offshore island. In another move, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda on Oct 14 reviewed a major exercise marking the 60th anniversary of Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force, and was quoted saying that Japan faces"severe" challenges to its security. Furthermore, Japan's Nippon Foundation on Friday announced it was abolishing an exchange program for field grade officers from the PLA and Japan's Self-Defense Forces that it started sponsoring in 2001. The decision was made after the Chinese side asked to delay this year's activities due to the tensions.Feng Wei from Fudan University said China-Japan military ties, which have been flagging in recent years, were further hampered by the cancellation.China's exercise also takes place after dozens of Japanese parliamentary members, including two Cabinet ministers, visited the Yasukuni Shrine that honors Japan's war dead, including 14 Class-A war criminals.Chinese media slammed the head of Japan's top opposition party Shinzo Abe for also going, calling his visit a provocation. Tensions sharply rose between Beijing and Tokyo after the Japanese government last month"nationalized" some of the Diaoyu Islands. The move took ties between the world's second- and third-largest economies to the chilliest moment in decades. Anti-Japan protests broke out across China and hurt sales of Japanese-made products.Contact the writer at lixiaokun@chinadaily.com.cnAFP and AP contributed to the story.

                    Beijing hopes to meet Tokyo 'halfway' in spat
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Beijing called on Tokyo on Wednesday to "create conditions" for improving strained relations, in response to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's proposal for a bilateral summit.China attaches importance to developing relations with Japan and hopes to meet Japan "halfway" to get ties back on track, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said on Wednesday.Following visits to China by a succession of prominent Japanese politicians, more tangible measures are expected from the Japanese government before the timing of a top leaders' meeting can be discussed, observers said.During an appearance on Japan's Nippon Television on Tuesday night, Abe said it is necessary to "re-establish the relationship, starting with a summit".Although he said high-level talks are needed for the problems the two countries are facing, the prime minister, known for his hawkish style, reiterated that the territorial issue is non-negotiable.Despite normalized ties for more than 40 years, political stability had not been ensured between the two neighbors since the impasse flared, and the heated fray has dragged economic ties into turbulence, said Jiang Ruiping, a Japanese studies expert and vice-president of China Foreign Affairs University."Both sides are expected to expand shared interests and exert positive energy into bilateral relations," Jiang said.Ties were strained after the Japanese government illegally "purchased" part of China's Diaoyu Islands in September, disregarding Beijing's strong protests.Without Tokyo's determination to face up to the problems, it is virtually impossible to make a breakthrough in restoring relations, Xinhua said in a commentary.The Japanese coast guard is considering deploying another 10 patrol vessels in the country's southwestern Okinawa prefecture over the Diaoyu Islands situation, Japan's Okinawa Times newspaper confirmed on Wednesday.Also on Wednesday, three China Marine Surveillance ships continued their regular patrols in the territorial waters surrounding the islands, China's State Oceanic Administration said."If the islands standoff continues for a long time in the future, both sides should reach a new consensus in crisis management to avoid tensions," said Zhang Tuosheng, a researcher at the China Foundation for International and Strategic Studies.Abe made the proposal to hold a leader summit on the same day that Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi on Tuesday met with Japanese guests, including former Japanese prime minister Tomiichi Murayama.Yang said that at "such a critical juncture" for China-Japan relations, both countries should properly handle tensions over the Diaoyu Islands on the basis of previous understandings and with a responsible attitude toward history.Murayama, who is now serving as honorary adviser to the Japan-China Friendship Association, arrived in China on Monday for a four-day visit, accompanied by association head Koichi Kato.His trip was the third wave this month after former prime minister Yukio Hatoyama and Natsuo Yamaguchi, leader of a junior party in the ruling coalition of Abe.Xinhua contributed to this story.Contact the writer at zhangyunbi@chinadaily.com.cn

                BEIJING -- China and South Korea on Thursday strongly condemned the visits of Japanese cabinet members, lawmakers and other politicians to the notorious Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which honors 14 Class-A war criminals in the World War II.According to Japanese media, the visitors included Internal Affairs and Communications Minister Yoshitaka Shindo, Chairman of the National Public Safety Commission and State Minister in charge of abduction issue Keiji Furuya, State Minister for administrative reforms and public servant system reforms Tomomi Inada, co-head of the Japan Restoration Party Shintaro Ishihara, Policy Chief of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Sanae Takaichi, Deputy Head of the Japan Restoration Party Takeo Hiranuma and Director of Youth Division of LDP Shinjirou Koizumi.At a press briefing in Beijing Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said that it is an open challenge to historical justice and human conscience that Japanese cabinet members visited the shrine which honors Class-A war criminals on the 68th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II, Hong said.And it severely hurts the feelings of people in victim countries in Asia, including China, he said."The attitudes of those in power in Japan toward historical issues, including those concerning the shrine, concern the political foundation of China-Japan relations," Hong said.In whatever forms and names the Japanese leaders visit the shrine, the nature is that they attempt to deny and glorify the militarism and history of aggression and challenge the results of World War II and the post-war international order. This will draw firm opposition and unanimous condemnation from China and other Asian countries, he said.In Seoul, South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho Tai-young said that it is "deplorable" that Japan's leading politicians and cabinet members visited the Yasukuni Shrine that glorifies the history of imperialistic aggression."It shows that they still turn a blind eye to the history," he said in a statement.Min Hyeon-ju, spokesperson for the ruling Saenuri Party (the New Frontier Party) said that the Japanese cabinet members' visit of the Yasukuni Shrine on the Liberation Day, which is of special significance to South Koreans, is a move in defiance of its lowest moral commitment to South Korea.Min said that as it has turned a deaf ear to the concerns and warnings from the international community and South Korea in particular, a question mark hangs over the future of Japan, a country that is moving closer to the path of its past militarism.A spokesperson for the major opposition Democratic Party said that as the international community and neighboring countries are increasingly concerned about Japan's right-wing shift, they have to condemn Abe's self-willed cabinet members who have been hell-bent on visiting the notorious shrine.Japan should be aware that the move will only inflict a second or a third hurt to its neighboring countries and peoples that suffered severely from Japan's war of aggression, said the spokesperson, who demanded that the Japanese government and politicians adopt a responsible and penitent attitude toward history.In an editorial published on Wednesday, the Hankyoreh Sinmun said: "This year, we greet the anniversary (of South Korean Independence Day) with the most militarist, right-wing administration in Japan since the Second World War."Criticizing Japan's moves to "amend the constitution to legalize the possession of a standing military," the leading South Korean paper said:"Japan hasn't made a clean break with its imperialist history, nor does (it) give any reason to believe it will do so."Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe renewed on Thursday at Nippon Budokan his pledge to contribute to world peace at a ceremony marking the 68th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II, but did not mention Japan's wartime aggression in Asia, neither did he "pledge not to fight a war." Observers say the speech is expected to enrage China and South Korea.Related stories:Japan's Abe sends offering to war shrineExperts warn of Japan's challenge to post-war orderChina urges Japan to reflect on historyJapan's PM rules out visit to Yasukuni ShrineJapan should follow peace, friendship treatyForum: What do you think of China-Japan relations?

                I never want scholarship winners to be pro-Japanese; I just want them to be people who know more about Japan, Yohei Sasakawa, chairman of the Nippon Foundation, said on Saturday.The philanthropic activist made the remark during an interview with China Daily after attending a ceremony to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Ryoichi Sasakawa Young Leaders Fellowship Fund's establishment in China in Peking University.When asked why he was setting up such a program, Sasakawa said narrowing the gap between the peak and the valley of Japan-China relationship has always been his motivation."Japan and China have been in contact with each other for over 2,000 years, and for most of the time they have had a good relationship," Sasakawa said. “But there always will be ups and downs in a relationship, and it is our responsibility to narrow that gap from the civil perspective.""I want to promote understanding and make people recognize their differences through this program," he added.In his speech at the ceremony, Sasakawa said the SYLFF was founded to help nurturing leaders who understand diverse and shared values, and shed light on emerging issues brought by the society."I hope they can look at issues from a broader perspective and address increasingly complex issues confronting contemporary society," Sasakawa said.Lin Jianhua, president of PKU, expressed his gratitude to Sasakawa for the foundation's long-term support toward Chinese students."The SYLFF has developed into a fellowship program for students at 69 universities in 44 countries," Lin said, "and over half of its scholarship winners are Chinese.""The SYLFF has made great contribution to promote students' international perspectives, to encourage them to take part in social activities and to facilitate cross-border communication," Lin said.Zhao Linshan, secretary-general of China Educsation Association for International Exchange, said he had three expectations concerning the future development of SYLFF in China."I hope that universities taking part in the SYLFF program have a high-level management team to standardize the procedure, I hope that relevant parties from China and Japan can work together to make the SYLFF program a renowned one with world influence, and I hope that students who accept scholarships to contribute more to China and to the world," Zhao said.Representatives from 10 Chinese universities that accepted SYLFF support also attended the Saturday's event.

                    A bridge of development links Japan and China
                </p>
            </a>

                The Nippon Foundation, of which I serve as chairman, and its affiliated organizations, began working with China in the early 1980s, initially on efforts to eliminate leprosy in the country. China had launched reform and opening-up a couple of years earlier and was embarking on a path of economic development. On the streets of major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, people wore monotone clothing of dark blue, gray or green, and walking down a street felt like being in a black-and-white television scene.Since then, we have worked with many people in various fields both in Japan and China, primarily in the areas of personnel exchanges and human resource development. We have implemented more than 500 projects involving exchanges between Japan and China, directly involving about 50,000 people in the two countries.The black-and-white scene gradually acquired color. And today, China outshines Japan as a country that produces some of the world's most colorful images. Our overarching goal has been that the people of both countries enjoy peace and prosperity, and as I have devoted myself to these exchange programs, I have been a witness to China's astounding growth and development, which are unparalleled in human history.Southern Tour helped China meet challengesWhen I visited China with my father, Ryoichi Sasakawa, in the 1980s, we met several times with Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's economic reforms and socialist modernization. I clearly remember Deng saying: "Reform and opening-up are the only path China can take to survive." I also remember when this program faced a period of difficulty, Deng, despite his advanced age, made his famous Southern Tour of cities in South China to shore up support for reform and opening-up.Yangmingism, a school of neo-Confucianism based on the teachings of Wang Yangming that had its origins in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), was brought to Japan by its followers who fled China after the fall of the dynasty, and had a major impact on Japanese society. Yangmingism espouses the doctrine of "unity of knowing and acting", meaning that knowledge and action are one and the same, and cannot be separated. Or, in other words, if one does not act, one does not have knowledge. I believe the Chinese are truly the world's greatest practitioners of the unity of knowing and acting.Around the world, there are many national government projects that are presented as a distillation of the wisdom of the country's top leaders, but there are few examples that match the knowledge and strength of action seen in the Chinese people's determination to implement individual projects. The Pudong Development Plan is one such example.From a mere plan to a real wonderWhen I visited China in 1990, the year the plan was proposed, a Shanghai government official showed me around Pudong and explained the plan, using a model of the project and pointing to fields as far as the eye could see. The first briefing on the Pudong Development Plan in Japan was held the same year, when a delegation of city officials from China's coastal regions, led by Huang Ju (who became mayor of Shanghai in 1991 and was elected as a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee in 2002) were invited to Japan.In 1991, when I accompanied Huang on a tour of the major construction project for the Kansai International Airport, he told me how impressed he was by the project. But the Pudong Development Plan went far beyond our imagination, and it was the Chinese who were able to follow through with that transformation. And 20 years later, that plan on paper became the wonder that is the Pudong New Area, which is admired around the world.The Nippon Foundation and its affiliated organizations have implemented a variety of programs to meet China's needs at various stages of reform and opening-up, reorienting our direction as necessary along the way.In the late 1980s, we first worked to initiate and expand reciprocal visits between Japan and China, and in the early 1990s we supported economic transformation, including sharing our experience with privatizing State-owned enterprises. We also conducted numerous programs that brought officials from the central government as well as specialists who would be carrying out regulatory reform in rural areas to Japan.Having worked together with the Chinese during 40 years of reform and opening-up, we admire China's abundant, high-quality human resources. I am convinced that human resources are the most important driving force supporting peace and development in China, Asia and the world, and the Nippon Foundation and our affiliated organizations have engaged in many joint projects with China, with a focus on human resource development.Nippon has trained many future leadersThe Sasakawa Medical Fellowship, in cooperation with China's National Health Commission, has awarded and trained more than 2,300 medical students in various fields, most of whom have gone on to become leaders in the field of healthcare and medicine, as academicians in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, or heads of hospitals or medical schools. A scholarship recipient also directed the emergency response to the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake.Another good example is the Ryoichi Sasakawa Young Leaders Fellowship Fund, a program that five major universities in China joined in 1992, and an additional five in 1994. This program provides scholarships for graduate students pursuing degrees in the humanities at 69 universities in 44 countries, and has provided scholarships to more than 16,000 students around the world, of whom about 8,000 are from these 10 Chinese universities.Many of these students are now heads of universities, senior corporate managers, key government officials and judges. In these positions, they have been active in supporting China's reform and opening-up, and will continue to contribute to the country's social development.We have also been engaged in human resource development in China in countless other ways, which include a human resource training program in international relations at Peking University that has been going on for more than 20 years, Japanese language training across China, the training of technicians in the field of high-speed rail transport, and the donation of a total of 4 million books and publications to more than 70 universities in China.Economic relationship highly complementaryJapan and China are geopolitically inseparable. Their economic relationship is already mutually complementary: the Japanese cannot go about their daily lives without food and other products from China, and the same is becoming true in China with regard to goods from Japan.I am convinced that the two countries will maintain a healthy relationship for the next 40 years and beyond through continued efforts by the people of both countries to know each other better as tourism and other forms of exchanges become more popular.Japan does have major problems, but this also means it has been dealing for some time with issues that China is now beginning to face, including environmental issues, a declining birthrate and aging population, and regional revitalization. As such, Japan's experience and expertise will help China address these issues.The author is chairman of the Nippon Foundation. The foundation has been engaged in human resource development in China in countless ways including in training technicians and future academics.
