                Johnson voices optimism on Brexit talks, but doubts cast on EU side
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was hopeful that progress could be made in Brexit talks on Monday with the European Union, even as outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warned that time is running out. Johnson had said that he would make clear he would reject any offer to delay Brexit beyond Oct 31. It is the first meeting between the pair since Johnson took office in July. The two leaders were joined at lunch by the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier. Johnson was scheduled to be accompanied by his new Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and Downing Street's Brexit representative David Frost. Juncker, who will finish his term as commission president on Oct 31, was expected to ask Johnson to spell out his ideas for replacing the Irish backstop negotiated by his predecessor. The backstop is the controversial policy in the existing withdrawal agreement - already rejected three times by members of Parliament - which would require the United Kingdom to follow the EU's customs rules to ensure no physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and EU member Republic of Ireland. Johnson had said there were "real signs of movement" in Berlin, Paris and Dublin on getting rid of the backstop, the persistent stumbling block to a Brexit agreement. "A huge amount of progress is being made," he told The Daily Mail newspaper. But The Guardian newspaper quoted EU officials involved in talks with Johnson's envoy, Frost, as saying that this upbeat account was not an accurate assessment of the situation. "No, in fact people are a bit dismayed," said one EU source, describing the mood. "I am not even going to call them negotiations - the last session on Friday did start touching on content - that's actually quite a step forward, ... but we still should have been there a long time ago and (an end result) is still quite far away." Reports have suggested Johnson is considering a plan to keep Northern Ireland more closely aligned to the EU after Brexit, as an alternative to the current backstop. A Downing Street source told the BBC that Johnson would make clear to Juncker that "he would not countenance any more delays" beyond Oct 31. "The PM will stress to Juncker that, while he wants to secure a deal, if no deal can be agreed by Oct 18, his policy is to leave without a deal on Oct 31 - and reject any delay offered by the EU." The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the issue of whether the United Kingdom has the legal right to leave the EU on Oct 31, come what may, could end up in court. Meanwhile, at their annual conference on Sunday, Britain's Liberal Democrats overwhelmingly approved the party's plan of going into any election with the promise to revoke Brexit without a referendum. The Liberal Democrats still support a second Brexit referendum with an option to vote to remain. They have said that they would promise to revoke Article 50 - the process of leaving the EU - if they win an absolute majority in a general election. jonathan@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily Global 09/17/2019 page7)

                    British PM comes face to face with EU leader, insists on Brexit deadline of Oct 31
                </p>

                LONDON - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ended a hectic day in Luxembourg Monday insisting Britain will leave the European Union on Oct. 31.Johnson held talks with President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker. He gave an interview to British reporters to explain his side of how the day had progressed.Johnson said there has been movement in talks in trying to find an alternative plan to the Irish backstop to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.He said: "We are now at the stage where we need to start accelerating the work and that was the agreement today with Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier (the EU's chief Brexit negotiator)."Yes there is a good chance of a deal, yes I can see the shape of it. Everybody can see roughly what could be done."Johnson said: "I will uphold the constitution. I will obey the law but we will come out on October 31st. We're going to come out on October 31st and it's vital that people understand that the UK will not extend. We won't go on remaining in the EU beyond October. What on earth is the point?"Ian Blackford, leader at Westminster of the Scottish National Party (SNP) was critical of Johnson's assessment, accusing him of being guilty of "dealing in fiction, not in facts".He said the meeting between Johnson and Juncker confirmed the British government has failed to bring forward a single proposal to "end the Brexit mess". "Boris Johnson must stop dealing in fiction and start addressing the facts," he added.On the events in Luxembourg, the EU said the aim of what was the first meeting between Juncker and Johnson was to take stock of the ongoing technical talks between the EU and Britain and to discuss the next steps.The statement added that Juncker recalled it is Britain's responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions that are compatible with the Brexit withdrawal agreement.Juncker underlined the commission's continued willingness and openness to examine whether such proposals meet the objectives of the backstop."Such proposals have not yet been made," the statement said.The statement added the European Council meeting on Oct. 17 will be an important milestone in the process, adding the 27 member states of the bloc remain united.Juncker is to address the European parliament on Wednesday morning in Strasbourg, the statement concluded.Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel went ahead with the media briefing, with the place prepared for Johnson left empty.Bettel said the only solution that protected the EU's single market and prevented a hard Irish border was the Brexit withdrawal agreement that has already been rejected three times by politicians in Britain's House of Commons.Johnson said he had cancelled attending the conference with Bettel because of concerns they would be "drowned" by protesters."I don't think it would have been fair to the Prime Minister of Luxembourg. I think there was clearly going to be a lot of noise," Johnson told British reporters.In London, Downing Street described the meeting with Juncker as constructive, saying the pair agreed contact between Britain and the European Commission would be stepped up in the coming days.Johnson's focus will switch Tuesday to the Supreme Court, Britain's highest legal chamber. A panel of judge will start to hear a case claiming that Johnson had been unlawful in the way he prorogued, or suspended, the British Parliament last week until Oct. 14.

                Lawsuits allege wealthy family put profits before healthOn a bleak February day with slate-gray skies and temperatures below freezing, individuals, couples and groups, ranging in age from teenagers to retirees, gathered in New York at the Guggenheim Museum on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, opposite Central Park.They walked quietly, spreading to all floors of the museum before falling to the ground.They quickly covered the floors with white paper-mock drug prescriptions for"80 milligram pills of OxyContin" written by "Robert Sackler, MD" for "Solomon R. Guggenheim" (who established the museum) to be taken "24 times a day". Empty orange medicine bottles soon added to the clutter.The Sackler family made its fortune through the sale of OxyContin-a potent and legal opioid painkiller approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration-and has donated millions of dollars to museums.Purdue Pharma, owned by the Sackler family, faces more than 2,000 lawsuits, including actions from nearly all US states and many local governments, which allege the company falsely promoted OxyContin by downplaying the risk of addiction.

                    U2's One named as perfect bedtime lullaby
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Irish rock band U2 is one of the most popular groups in the world, estimated to have sold more than 150 million albums worldwide during the course of a recording career spanning four decades and playing to sell-out crowds across the globe. But now they have earned an unlikely new honor after researchers judged one of their most popular songs to be the formulaic perfect lullaby.Children's bedding company Cuckooland teamed up with online music streaming platform Spotify, looking at 4,500 different songs that are regularly chosen for bedtime playlists, before selecting the track One, from U2's 1991 appropriately named release Achtung Baby, as the ideal soothing bedtime music.Analyzing popular choices on Spotify, the researchers calculated the average beats per minute, key and time signatures to close in on the ideal formula."The function of a lullaby is to soothe a baby and put them to sleep, so common features we would expect to see in lullabies would be, a slow (ish) tempo, relatively quiet dynamics, simple rhythm pattern-potentially one that imitates a rocking movement－a simple melody that's easier to memorize and easier to sing, predictability achieved by repetitive phrases and verses, and a high pitch due to the connotations that mothers/females usually sing lullabies," said Annaliese Grimaud from the school of music and science at Durham University in the UK.In contrast to many of U2's more upbeat tracks, One is a slower, more somber tune, which band singer Bono has described as being "a song about coming together, but it's not the old hippie idea of 'Let's all live together'.It is, in fact, the opposite. It's saying, We are one, but we're not the same."The lyrics of the chorus read "One life, You got to do what you should/One life, With each other, Sisters and my brothers/One life, But we're not the same, We get to carry each other, carry each other."It has been covered by many artists and released as a fundraising track for people affected by Aids, and the turbulent European political backdrop against which it was produced in the early 1990s have made it an anthem of hope in situations of strife and conflict.In an interview for Rolling Stone magazine, Bono said how it was recorded in Germany at the end of the Cold War, produced in Ireland and then performed "going around Europe when stuff was going on in Bosnia, sometimes 300 miles from where we were playing", all places of upheaval and conflict, which make it an unlikely choice for a lullaby.In the book U2 by U2, Bono told author Neil McCormick "It's a reminder that we have no choice…. Like it or not, the only way out of here is if I give you a leg up the wall and you pull me after you.There's something very unromantic about that."

                    British PM slammed in court battle over suspension of parliament
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                 LONDON - Prime Minister Boris Johnson came under a stinging attack Wednesday on the second day of a court case to decide if he had unlawfully suspended the British Parliament.Britain's highest court, the Supreme Court in London, is hearing two separate appeals linked to the way Johnson prorogued, or suspended parliament for five weeks.Hours after the British government's own lawyer in the case argued that legal cases from the past showed the suspension of parliament had been used by British governments to gain a legislative and political advantage.James Eadie, the barrister representing the British government argued that courts do not have the right to rule the suspension of parliament unlawful because Johnson was using a prerogative power that is not subject to an adjudication by the courts.Aidan O'Neill, representing Joanna Cherry, MP for the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP), used his closing speech to attack Johnson.Cherry and the other parliamentarians first took the case to the Scottish Court of Session, the highest court in Scotland which ruled that the suspension of the British Parliament by Johnson had been unlawful.In a reference to Johnson, he told 11 of the most senior judges in Britain: "Rather than allowing lies to triumph, listen to the angels of your better nature and rule that this prorogation is unlawful and an abuse of power which has been entrusted to the government."He said Johnson's government was showing itself unworthy of trust as it used the powers of its office in a manner that is corrosive of the constitution and destructive of the system of parliamentary representative democracy on which the polity of the UK is founded.O'Neill said it appeared the prime minister's actions in proroguing parliament has had the intent and effect of preventing parliament, impeding parliament, from holding the government politically to account at a time when the government is taking decisions which will have constitutional and irreversible impacts on the country.Legal and media commentators following the case described O'Neill's speech as the most passionate and outspoken of the four submissions heard so far by the court.The court will conclude the case Thursday, with a ruling to come later.Meanwhile Simon Byrne, the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland, said Wednesday his police officers could be killed if they had to patrol checkpoints along the border with the Irish Republic in the event of a hard Brexit.Byrne told the London-based Guardian newspaper he opposed officers having to patrol checkpoints on a physical border, adding his officers who were already under huge strain would be placed in danger policing any checkpoints.Byrne said: "People do not want a return to the images of 20-30 years ago, where history shows us that far more police officers and 20,000 soldiers could not protect the border, so I doubt we are going to do it now."He described how the 500-kilometer border was porous, with half a field in one country, and half in another.They want to carry on with the fact they can take the kids to school without going through checkpoints and all that sort of anxiety.He warned there could be "civil protest where people from the farming community, for example, block roads."We are also looking at the potential for protest in different forms, depending on which community sees Brexit in terms of winners and losers," added Byrne.
