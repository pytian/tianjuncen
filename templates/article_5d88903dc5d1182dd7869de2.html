            <p class="style-content">
                Since ancient times, letters have been one of the main ways for people to communicate information, exchange ideas and express sentiments.In addition to sending letters to important events, President Xi Jinping also wrote eight special letters to individuals in 2018, from youngsters to senior professors, from artists to private entrepreneurs. Who received Xi's letters and what are the stories behind them?1. A reply letter to members of the Junior Police Call, Hong Kong, Feb 14Xi said he hoped that the youth of Hong Kong could read and travel more, learn more about history and the national conditions, broaden their vision, and improve their knowledge and abilities, so that they could serve Hong Kong and the country with their actions, as the future of the motherland and Hong Kong counted on the younger generation.Xi met 22 members of the JPC during his visit on June 30, 2017, a day before the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China. Before the 2018 Spring Festival, they sent him their own handmade greeting card.

                    B&R to open new path for renewable energy in Africa
                </p>
            </a>

                Long before I arrived in China, President Xi had announced the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative. His first public statement on the initiative was in Kazakhstan, in a speech delivered at Nazarbayev University in 2013. Since then the initiative has gathered momentum, and at The Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in May 2017 President Xi reiterated China's commitment to this project by announcing 380 billion yuan in new lending for participating nations and 60 billion yuan in coming years to developing countries and international organizations that join the program. Estimates by consulting firm PwC predict that over the next 10 years China will invest about $1 trillion in the initiative.As an aspiring international law specialist, I came to China to study its language and culture, thereby enriching my knowledge of this important and ancient civilization. My path follows the footsteps of many Ethiopian leaders who have earned degrees from Peking University and other Chinese higher education institutions. Most notable among which is the current President of Ethiopia, President Mulatu Teshome Wirtu, who has two degrees from Peking University: a Bachelors of Philosophy and Political Economy and a PhD in International Law.Through a Masters of Laws at Peking University I aim to simultaneously cultivate my existing knowledge and appreciation of China and international law. Not long after my studies began and my exposure to the Belt and Road Initiative grew, I came to realize that it would re-shape Africa’s relationship with China, and vice versa.Witnessing the evolution of the BRI into an unparalleled trading network is one of the reasons why my interest in the Africa-China relationship has grown. Sometimes Africa-China and China-Africa are used interchangeably. In this article, the Africa-China paradigm is employed to present President Xi's One Belt One Road Initiative from an African lens. One element of the Pan-African ethos is its call for collaboration between African countries and the diaspora for the political, economic and social progress of the continent. It is a perfect fit for a win-win relationship with China under the B&R Initiative.Of the numerous projects under B&R is the revitalized Eastern African railway network. At the moment Kenya and Ethiopia have signed memorandums of understanding with Chinese companies for the construction of multiple railway lines. Of note are the Addis Ababa–Djibouti and the Nairobi–Mombasa lines. Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II was the first to envisage and construct a railway network from Addis Ababa to Djibouti, called the Ethio-Djibouti railways, between 1894 and1917 in collaboration with France. It ran successfully for over a century until it fell apart in the 2000s from lack of maintenance. Today a modified version of his vision was reborn as the Addis Ababa–Djibouti network, running virtually parallel to the old Ethio-Djibouti railways.As part of the B&R Initiative, in 2011 contracts were sought by and awarded to two Chinese companies by the Ethiopian Railway Corporation for the new Addis Ababa–Djibouti railway. Construction of the $3.4 billion project that will cut the journey time from 3 days to 12 hours is complete. Ethiopia plans to expand on this project and lay down a 5,000 km railway line connecting it to Kenya, Sudan and, South Sudan by 2020. This vision has the potential to link multiple trading hubs in Eastern Africa to Chinese ports, facilitating trade among them.Moving forward the countries could connect the railways with renewable energy links, potentially tapping into the hydropower from the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Regional integration of renewable energy links in East Africa will help secure the long-term future of the railway by securing a reliable energy source. Such an approach could realise President Xi’s vision to “develop global energy interconnection and achieve green and low-carbon development”.President Xi once cited the Chinese saying “Peaches and plums do not speak, but they are so attractive that a path is formed below the trees”. Four years into the Belt and Road Initiative, we have seen its fruits ripen and the paths under the trees lengthen. With a scale-up of renewable energy to power Eastern African railways, we could see the Belt and Road Initiative bear more fruit still.The author is Masters of Laws in Transnational Law from Peking University.

                    Ethiopian receives surprise response from major VIP

                Hannah Getachew, who took part in a forum for young people held earlier this year in China, shared on Thursday her excitement after President Xi Jinping replied to a letter that she had penned to him."Today, something big happened. And I mean big. President Xi read my letter - and replied!" Getachew said in an article posted on the website of Black Livity China, an organization in which she is a member.The Ethiopian was one of 73 participants from 51 countries at the Youth Forum on Creativity and Heritage Along the Silk Road, which was held in May."My enthusiasm for the expanding potential in the Africa and China space is what pushed me to write to President Xi. Emboldened by the young people I met at the forum and our shared passion for sustainable development, I put pen to paper," she said."Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine he would answer," Getachew said.In his reply on Tuesday, Xi called for young people to enhance cultural exchanges, actively take part in the joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative and support solidarity and cooperation between China and Africa.Together with other participants at the forum, Getachew shared her thoughts over China-Africa ties in the June missive, according to People's Daily.Getachew, who took postgraduate courses in transnational law at Peking University, told the paper she is hoping to land a job that involves services associated with the BRI.Pointing out that there is "great potential" for China-Africa cooperation, she said joint construction of the Belt and Road is a good demonstration of the efforts by China and Africa to set up common goals and work for win-win results.Put forward by Xi in 2013, the BRI has become an important platform on which countries, including those in Africa, share and explore opportunities for growth. Through cooperation with China, the continent has seen a number of infrastructure projects that have helped boost its integration.Among these projects is a railway linking Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa and Djibouti.Rebutting some accusations that China is practicing "neocolonialism" through its aid to Africa, Getachew said, "I would never agree that China is a colonist."When doing business with each other, Chinese and Africans negotiate equally and are ready to take their own responsibility, she said, adding that both sides cherish their trade partnership and pursue win-win cooperation.Getachew, who expressed her love for the natural beauty of China as well as the country's convenient online services for shopping and ordering meals, said she is very interested in learning more about China's successful experience during its 40 years of reform and opening-up."China is special, and not all countries can copy its path, of course. But there are a lot of things that we can learn from each other," she said.

She went to Changsha for the youth forum last year, and was captivated by the modern and traditional city with a long history and rich culture.
