                Trump joins India's Modi at Houston rally amid tensions in India-controlled Kashmir
            </p>
            <p>
                HOUSTON - US President Donald Trump on Sunday shared a stage with visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi here to address a large group of Indian-American community, as the situation remains intense over India-controlled Kashmir.Trump hailed the US-Indian ties while addressing the "Howdy, Modi!" rally in the NRG Stadium, which attracted approximately 50,000 people, mostly Indian Americans, to attend in a gesture of welcoming the Indian prime minister.Trump also revealed that the United States is working closely with India to enhance space cooperation.Outside the stadium, thousands of people were protesting against Modi over the alleged human rights violations in India-controlled Kashmir and other places targeting India's minorities, US media reported.Tensions remain high between India and Pakistan after the abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian constitution by India over India-controlled Kashmir in August. Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties, suspended trade relations and stopped train services with India as a reaction to India's decision.On Saturday, troops of India and Pakistan reportedly resorted to heavy fire and mortar shelling on the Line of Control, the de-facto border between the two countries in the disputed area.Modi is on a week-long trip to the United States, during which he will address the annual United Nations General Assembly and host a special event to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of India's Father of Nation Mahatma Gandhi.

                On parched fields, Venezuela's little-leaguers are dreaming big
            </a>
            <p>
                Kids battling poverty and even malnutrition to reach promised land of pro ranksWhile playing for Venezuela in baseball's Little League World Series in the United States last month, 12-year-old Adrian Salcedo wolfed down tacos and chicken, donned a virtual-reality headset to envision hitting homers in big-league ballparks, and marveled at the lush grass of the fields.Now back at his humble home in Maracaibo, a western city hit hard by Venezuela's protracted political and economic crisis, the boy's hopes center on his own version of the 'American Dream'."I want to make the big leagues and help my mother, so we can buy a house and get away from this," Salcedo said.Professional baseball, which is wildly popular in parts of Latin America and the Caribbean, has long been viewed as a path out of poverty. players from the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Cuba and Puerto Rico make up more than 20 percent of current big-league rosters, according to Major League Baseball.But Salcedo said his trip to the United States highlighted some of the extraordinary challenges he and his teammates face."The ballplayers over there are fat and they're not tired," Salcedo said, alluding to Venezuela's growing problems stemming from malnutrition and hunger.Kids from other countries he spoke to during the tournament in Williamsport, Pennsylvania - the world's biggest youth baseball event - were aware of the problems facing Venezuela, said Salcedo, a lanky and soft-spoken left fielder."They asked us how we put up with all this," he said, referring to Venezuela's increasing state of decay.Salcedo and 13 other players from Venezuela's Cacique Mara team qualified for the Little League World Series by winning a national championship and then a Latin America-wide tournament in Panama. They went on to beat Australia and Mexico before exiting the World Series with a loss to Curacao.On their return home late last month, the players were greeted by family members cheering and holding signs at the airport in Maracaibo, Venezuela's second-largest city.Once the bustling oil capital of the OPEC nation, the city now regularly goes more than eight hours a day without power under a rationing plan that affects everything from running water to internet connectivity.

                New NBA measures bid to curb tampering violations
            </a>
            <p>
                NBA team owners passed stricter measures to force compliance with player tampering and salary-cap rules on Friday after a wild offseason where several top stars changed clubs.The tougher regulations provide for fines of up to $10 million, voiding of contracts, forfeiting of NBA draft selections and suspensions of team executives who seek to attract players while they are under contract to another team."We need to ensure that we're creating a culture of compliance in this league and our teams want to know they're competing on a level playing field and frankly don't want to feel disadvantaged if they are adhering to our existing rules," NBA commissioner Adam Silver said."What we are really seeking again is a cultural change in the league, that all the partners in the league are essentially saying this is the kind of league we operate."The issue came to a head after stars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving joined the Brooklyn Nets shortly after becoming free agents - when the official negotiating period for free agents and clubs had barely begun.Other deals that were eventually consummated came to light before talks were even supposed to start.There was also concern about players talking with each other about possible moves, such as Kawhi Leonard wanting Paul George to join him on the Los Angeles Clippers while George had a contract with the Oklahoma City Thunder."The ultimate goal here is to ensure compliance and to ensure that there's that appropriate tension that exists at the team," Silver said. "So there is sort of a significant threat that if a team doesn't comply that there will be consequences."Among the ways the league will toughen the tampering rules is a random audit of communications for five NBA teams, with Silver having the power to confiscate communication devices under the new regulations."I'm not looking to take devices," he said. "We do have the power to take people's devices. That is not something, certainly in the first instance, we would be looking to do."I think that we can create the appropriate culture without, certainly on a random basis, people feeling that's necessary. We also have lots of other tools available to us."Fines, Silver said, have proven ineffective at deterring violations."There's a general sense in this league that among the tools we have to ensure compliance, fining authority unto itself may be one of the least effective tools," he said."So within the power that already has been vested in the league, there is the ability to impact competition directly by suspending executives, taking away draft picks and voiding contracts."While not vowing a foolproof system, Silver warned potential violators: "We believe through these tools, we're dramatically going to increase the likelihood that we're going to catch you."Some issues the league wants to examine, such as changing the dates for free agency, must be done in conjunction with the players' union.But moves such as George leaving the Thunder for the Clippers show how much influence the bigger stars can have on other players and, by extension, their teams.An individual player's ability to change the fortunes of a team "provides enormous leverage for that player", Silver said.Agence France-Presse
