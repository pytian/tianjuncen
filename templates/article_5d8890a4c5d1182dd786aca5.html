                Hurdles loom, however, as global economy faces key challenge of avoiding a recession With global stock markets ending last year in turmoil, the economic outlook for 2019 remains uncertain. Despite this backdrop, for China the year is one of the final steppingstones to becoming a "moderately prosperous society" by 2020 in time for the 100th anniversary the following year of the founding of the Communist Party of China. The challenge for the global economy, however, is to avoid a recession. There are fears that the often weak but nonetheless sustained recovery from the depths of the 2008 global financial crisis has now run its course and a correction is inevitable. There are a number of risks on the horizon, not the least of which is trade tension between the United States and China, that have yet to be resolved. There also are concerns about Europe, with the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union in March without agreeing to a deal, and also over whether Italian banks will create a systemic crisis for the euro. On a more positive note, this year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and the country will host the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in April. At the event, the Belt and Road Initiative, which has huge potential to drive economic growth, will take greater shape. The government made clear its economic agenda at the Central Economic Work Conference, attended by the country's leaders in Beijing in December. The agenda includes tax cuts as part of a more proactive fiscal policy; boosting advanced manufacturing; tackling so-called zombie enterprises; raising domestic consumption; rural revitalization; capital market reform; fostering a healthy property market; further opening-up the economy and allowing greater market access to foreign companies. Great attention will continue to be paid to China's growth performance this year. Growth was 6.5 percent in the third quarter of last year, in line with the target set in the Government Work Report in March. It needs to average about 6.3 percent this year and next to meet the target of doubling 2010 GDP by the end of 2020. Song Yu, chief China economist at Goldman Sachs in Beijing, said the government will want to carefully manage the economy to meet this target. "This will be of critical importance this year. The government will not tolerate a sharp slowdown in the economy, although there might be some flexibility for a growth target of less than 6.5 percent," he said. "One of the priorities also will be maintaining employment stability, especially making sure college graduates, migrant workers and former members of the armed forces get jobs." Edward Tse, founder and chairman of Gao Feng Advisory, a management consultancy, said stability will be key for the government. "The economy may slow a bit, but not a whole lot. The government has a number of levers it can pull to ensure stability," he said. "Part of the problem for China is that it is entwined in the global economy and at the center of global supply chains that might be affected by increased trade protectionism." Xiong Yuan, chief analyst at Guosheng Securities, a research company, also believes achieving overall stability will be the government's main aim, with growth of more than 6.2 percent likely. "China's economy will face a number of challenges, particularly from external factors, so stability will be the main priority," he said. Trump rumors Wang Qing, chief economist at Golden Credit Rating International in Beijing, predicted the government will set an annual growth target of 6 to 6.5 percent in its next work report in March. He said last month's Central Economic Work Conference pointed the way to major tax cuts of about 1.5 trillion yuan ($218 billion). "These tax cuts will encourage enterprises to invest more and, more important, encourage greater private investment and consumption," he said. How the global economy fares this year may hinge on what happens in the US. Some of the stock market turbulence at the end of last year arose from rumors that US President Donald Trump was about to fire Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell. Trump has been openly critical of the Fed's monetary tightening, with four interest rate rises announced last year. Some observers expect US growth, which hit 4.2 percent in the middle of last year, to slow this year as the boost delivered by Trump's tax cuts begins to wear off. Douglas McWilliams, deputy chairman and founder of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy in London, said the apparent row over interest rate policy is at odds with reality. "Whatever Trump's intervention, the Fed is not actually going to put up interest rates. If you analyze the situation, now is not the time to put them up," he said. If there is no reversal, the expansionary phase of the US economy will be the longest ever by July, according to records that were first kept in 1854. It would exceed the 120-month expansion between March 1991 and March 2001, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research in the US. George Magnus, an associate of the University of Oxford China Centre, said the "extreme longevity" of this upward swing in the business cycle is not sufficient in itself to predict an imminent recession, but it is becoming harder to sustain. "It is not just the US. Most of the Western world touched bottom in 2009. This long recovery needs continuous energizing to sustain it. It is like riding your bike into a wind uphill - you need to put in that extra effort in order not to stall. You don't need much of a shock to knock you off balance," he said. One of the risks that could affect the global economy is increasing protectionism and, in particular, the trade dispute between the US and China. There were signs of a more constructive relationship between the two countries as last year drew to a close. President Xi Jinping and Trump discussed trade in a telephone conversation on Dec 29. Both stressed the progress made in the trade talks while voicing hope for further results that can bring benefits to both sides and the world. Tse, at Gao Feng Advisory, is optimistic that the dispute will be resolved early this year. "There is something like a 50 percent possibility that it will be pretty well handled and the crux of the issue will be largely solved. Some of the underlying issues between China and the US will continue to be around for some time," he said. Zeng Kanghua, a public finance professor with the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing, said China's economy would remain "resilient" even without a resolution to the trade dispute. "The economy will still be able to expand at a reasonable rate above 6 percent, given that there are a number of strategic development opportunities. With a resolution, the growth outlook will be better and likely to be in line with last year's," he said. The other risk this year stems from Brexit and the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a negotiated deal on March 29, the date on which it is due to exit. Most commentators believe that while this could disrupt the UK economy and UK-EU trade, it is unlikely to destabilize the global economy. Magnus, author of Red Flags, a new book about the Chinese economy, said: "The good news is that we don't have to wait much longer now for some kind of resolution. The clock is ticking. Proper grown-up decisions will become unavoidable in the next few weeks." If there is a global recession this year, few observers expect it to be anything like the same scale as the global financial crisis a decade ago. Jing Ulrich, managing director and vice-chairman of JPMorgan Chase's Asia Pacific operations, said banks have learned their lesson from the devastation of 10 years ago. She said global banks have never been better positioned from a solvency and liquidity perspective going into the next potential recession, and the probability of a systemically important bank failing has declined. Ulrich said the Financial Stability Board, set up at the G20 summit in London in 2009 in the aftermath of the previous crisis to monitor the global financial system, has been particularly effective. "All of these new frameworks and institutions are here to stay, and will continue to be the guardians of global economic stability," she said. For many developing countries in particular, a major growth engine will continue to be China's Belt and Road Initiative, which according to JPMorgan Chase has the potential to boost global trade by $2.5 trillion over the longer term. Jiang Hao, a partner at management consultancy Roland Berger in Shanghai, said the initiative can relieve infrastructure bottlenecks that are barriers to economic development in many countries. "The BRI has a very positive impact on the economic development of those developing countries, which in turn will contribute to global economic growth and stability," he said. "It encourages more countries to participate in the global supply chain and improve each nation's domestic consumption, which allows all those countries to contribute to the prosperity of the global economy." David Morris, chair of the United Nations Asia Pacific Business Forum, said 2019 could be the year to build on the initiative's success. "It has been widely welcomed as a platform for building new capabilities across the developing world for trade. Lessons are being learned from the first five years and there are good opportunities for more multistakeholder partnerships to reduce investment risks, with greater transparency and openness to build trust," he said. Former Singaporean diplomat Kishore Mahbubani, author of Has The West Lost It?, agrees the initiative could be a game changer this year. "It is deploying significant material and human resources to help other countries build and develop their infrastructures. New roads and bridges, railways and electricity grids will emerge," he said. This year is also likely to pave the way for a number of technological advances. China is expected to roll out 5G, the next generation of wireless technology, next year, which could have major implications for advanced manufacturing and the internet of things. The country is expected to be the biggest market for 5G by 2025, according to the GSM Association, the mobile communication operators' trade body. Zeng, from the Central University of Finance and Economics, said,"5G will inject growth momentum in a wide range of fields, including the production and sales of new smartphones, development of new software, as well as new business and consumption models." Tse, also author of China's Disruptors, said that in addition to 5G, the country could be about to experience a new era of technological innovation. "China has a lot of advantages, from its entrepreneurship, government support for innovation and the availability of capital. We are going to see a lot of new players that will emerge and take on the established companies," he said. Whatever the various outcomes, 2019 will be an important year for China as it marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the PRC in October. Mahbubani, also professor in the practice of public policy at the National University of Singapore, said it will be a year for China to reflect on its past and future direction.

                          Xi calls for promoting multilateralism and bringing strategic partnership to higher level              President Xi Jinping and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, pledged to work together to uphold multilateralism and promote bilateral ties as they exchanged congratulations on the 55th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations on Sunday.                  In his message, Xi said exchanges and cooperation between the two nations have seen continuous expansion since they forged official ties, and have brought about tangible benefits to the two countries and peoples.                      Saying today's world is facing profound changes unseen in a century, and human development is facing opportunities as well as challenges, Xi said the two countries - both of which are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council - shoulder a special historic responsibility.                          Xi said he stands ready to work with Macron to carry on the traditional friendship, hold high the banner of multilateralism and bring the close and enduring Sino-French comprehensive strategic partnership to a higher level so as to make greater contributions to promoting world peace, stability and development.                              Macron said that given rising global uncertainties, France and China play an especially important role in safeguarding the rules-based multilateral international order that features mutual respect.                                  Saying he wants to promote stronger bilateral ties, Macron expressed willingness to work with Xi to enhance cooperation with China in such fields as nuclear energy, aviation, agriculture and trade, as well as strengthen collaboration on global issues such as climate change.                                      The two countries kicked off commemorations marking the 55th anniversary of diplomatic ties last week with ceremonies held in Paris and Beijing.                                          Rising unilateralism and uncertainties on the international stage will drive China and France to work much more closely in upholding multilateralism and improving global governance as well as maintaining international strategic balance, according to a report from the European Union and its members published on July 19.                                              The report, jointly published by the Center for China-EU Relations at Fudan University and the Shanghai Institute for European Studies, said the two sides should manage their differences in competitive fields to make a bigger pie that provides more benefits, and should also expand cooperation in upholding multilateralism through bilateral, regional and global platforms.                                                  State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who wrapped up visits to France and Italy on Saturday, told reporters that the China-France and China-Italy comprehensive strategic partnerships have been enhanced over time.                                                      Both France and Italy have clearly welcomed Chinese investment into their countries, promising not to adopt any restrictions on specific enterprises or to discriminate against particular companies, Wang said.                                                          He said Chinese companies will increasingly turn their eyes to countries that have earned their trust.                                                              caodesheng@chinadaily.com.cn                                                                  (China Daily 01/28/2019 page1)

                Your Excellency Director Yang Jiechi and Madame Le Aimei,Your Excellency former State Councilor Dai Bingguo,Your Excellencies ambassadors, members of the diplomatic corps,representatives of international organizations and spouses,Ladies and gentlemen,Friends,Good evening!It is my great pleasure to have you at this joyful occasion to celebrate the Chinese New Year. Let me first extend a warm welcome to all our guests from the diplomatic community, and say a big thank-you to our comrades from the various Chinese ministries, provinces and municipalities for your strong support to our country's foreign affairs.The past year saw continued profound shifts in the international landscape, and a further build-up of factors of instability and uncertainty. Amid a complicated international situation and great changes unseen in a century, we forged ahead under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and made new strides in China's foreign relations with a clear sense of purpose.During the past year, we established Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy as the fundamental guideline for conducting China's foreign affairs in the new era. We advocated the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind and, keeping in mind the common interests of all countries, provided Chinese perspectives and proposals on navigating the once-in-a-century changes in our world. The international community is looking to China with higher expectations. As China moves closer to the center of the global stage, it has a more distinct and prominent role to play.In 2018, China was an important force for stability. In the face of challenges to WTO rules and multilateralism in general, China stood up to safeguard its lawful rights and interests. At the same time, conscious of international expectations, we have been working with the United States to put our trade friction back on the track of dialogue and consultation, thus providing a positive outlook for the world. Growing at a high level, China's comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination with Russia has remained rock-solid and served as a source of strategic stability in the world. China enhanced communication and coordination with Europe and reached consensus on upholding the multilateral process and addressing various global challenges. China's relations with the rest of the world made steady progress, helping to make the world a more stable place.In 2018, China was a strong advocate for openness. At important occasions throughout the year, including the conference commemorating the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, the first China International Import Expo and the Boao Forum for Asia annual conference, President Xi Jinping conveyed a clear message to the world of China's unwavering commitment to further reform and opening-up, and announced important initiatives to open up the economy. Despite the rise of protectionism and headwinds against globalization, China stood firmly on the right side of history. With concrete actions, we demonstrated our sincerity and resolve to share development opportunities with the world and build an open world economy, playing our due role in safeguarding open and inclusive development of the world economy.In 2018, China was an important driver of cooperation. Last year was the fifth year since President Xi Jinping put forward the Belt and Road Initiative. Building on the outcomes so far, we sought higher-quality development of Belt and Road projects. With growing interest from the world, another 60-plus countries and international organizations signed Belt and Road cooperation agreements with China, bringing the total number of such documents to nearly 170. A number of major Belt and Road projects saw solid progress. At the same time, historic achievements were made in China's cooperation with other developing countries. At the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, which attracted unprecedented participation, over 100 new cooperation measures under eight major initiatives were unveiled, and China and Africa undertook to build an even stronger community with a shared future. China's cooperation with Arab, Latin American and Caribbean countries was also brought to new levels.In 2018, China was an important promoter of peace. Seizing the opportunity of a major turnaround on the Korean Peninsula, China encouraged the North and the South to improve their relations. We also supported the resumption of dialogue between the US and the DPRK to build mutual trust. China worked with like-minded parties to uphold and implement the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with the aim of maintaining peace and stability in the Middle East. Regarding the Rakhine situation, China proposed a three-phase approach and encouraged Myanmar and Bangladesh to reach a broad agreement on the return of displaced persons. The China-Afghanistan-Pakistan Foreign Ministers' Dialogue, set up on China's initiative, produced important common understanding on advancing the peace process in Afghanistan. China also played an active mediating role on the Syrian and Palestinian issues, meeting its due responsibility for promoting regional peace.In 2018, China was an important upholder of the international order. At international summits such as the G20, APEC and BRICS, President Xi Jinping took a clear stand against protectionism and unilateralism and called for a stronger commitment to the UN-centered international system and rules-based multilateralism, steering those summits to a series of pioneering, pace-setting and institutional outcomes. Calling for joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind, China sought to promote a more equitable and fair system of global governance. In a turbulent world, China emerged as a pillar of stability.In 2018, China was an important engine of development. Defying economic difficulties and downward pressure, China acted on the new development philosophy and achieved a medium-high GDP growth rate of 6.6 percent, hitting all economic targets for 2018. The Chinese economy now exceeds 90 trillion RMB yuan, with imports and exports totaling more than 30 trillion RMB yuan. It must be noted that consumer spending contributed as much as 76 percent to economic growth last year, which speaks volumes about the structural improvement and upgrading of the Chinese economy and sets the stage for sustainable, high-quality development. The figures I have just cited show that China continues to perform with full vigor its role as the most important engine of global growth, and it will maintain its irreplaceable role in the world economy.

                Editor's Note: The Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee held in November 2013 decided to comprehensively deepen the country's reform and opening-up. China Daily is interviewing top executives of well-known multinational companies for their views on the country's socioeconomic development during the past five years.What progress has China made in streamlining government functions to raise efficiency?We have both participated in and benefited from China's remarkable economic and financial development of the past few decades.This rapid development was achieved through consistent government efforts aimed at improving the business environment, which includes executing the reform of "delegating power, improving regulation and service", and implementing actions such as cutting red tape and leveling the playing field for foreign businesses.In addition, the market has also enjoyed the improved efficiency brought on by increased transparency and deepened reform and opening-up. For instance, the optimized and restructured financial regulatory system allows all players to benefit from a more transparent and integrated ecosystem in a constantly changing and complex financial environment.In 2018, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission harmonized regulations for foreign banks and Chinese banks, defining the path for foreign investment in domestic banks, licensing requirements and other operational matters.How has the ongoing supply-side reform changed the nation's economic growth and your company's business in China?Despite the slowdown, China's economic growth in 2018 still accounted for one-third of total global economic growth.Supply-side reform plays a critical role in China's journey to upgrade and optimize the structure of its national economic growth in the long term.This reform is reshaping the economy by accelerating the phaseout of uncompetitive enterprises, stimulating industrial upgrading and underpinning domestic economic growth, which is particularly important amid the current economic climate.BNP Paribas has a broad client base across industries that are critical to China's economic upgrading and transformation. As an international bank equipped with full onshore and offshore licenses and strong expertise in global financial markets, we are consistently adapting ourselves. This ensures that cross-region resources can benefit our clients and effectively support their expansionary strategies.Sustainable finance is one of the key driving forces in pushing forward the supply-side reform agenda. At BNP Paribas, we put sustainable finance at the heart of our business model, upholding the philosophy that banks have a crucial role in contributing to sustainable economic development.On a daily operating basis, we bring together individuals, businesses and investors to channel resources toward projects that address major social and environmental challenges.This philosophy is shared globally within the bank and is woven into the fabric of our China business. In 2018, BNP Paribas was named the World's Best Bank for Sustainable Finance.What's your comment on China's policy on foreign enterprises and foreign investment? How can the country further improve its business environment for foreign investors?Policy is pivotal in nurturing a business environment that best supports sustainable economic growth. The development of BNP Paribas in China was built on a growing, open environment.Our presence in China dates back to 1860, when we opened our first office in Shanghai. With nearly 500 staff currently based in China, BNP Paribas provides banking, financing and advisory services to local and overseas corporations and financial institutions, institutional investors and high-net-worth clients.At the same time, we have developed strong local partnerships, including a strategic cooperation with the Bank of Nanjing.The year 2018 saw China achieve total foreign trade of 30.51 trillion yuan ($4.62 trillion). Of that figure, exports represented 16.42 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 7.1 percent, while imports totaled 14.09 trillion yuan, an increase of 12.9 percent, according to data from the General Administration of Customs.This remarkable record exemplifies China's strong determination toward further deepening reform and opening-up for global enterprises and international investors, so they can enjoy the benefits of this booming market.In 2018, China took several solid steps toward allowing even greater access for foreign financial institutions, which include relaxing the regulation on foreign ownership limits and accelerating the progress of creating a fairer arena for bank branch openings and debt fundraising.Looking to the future, we are expecting an even more simplified process, achieved through innovation, to drive connection between China and global markets, bridging global investors with Chinese counterparts to explore more potential opportunities together.How has innovation changed China's economic development and your company's business in China?China has been taking great strides in innovation, and the efforts have been greatly beneficial.In 2018, China broke into the top line of the most innovative economies.It has been widely agreed that the next step is to see how we can effectively and efficiently implement those innovations to speed up growth and reshape the future economic landscape.In the financial industry, the buzz word is "digitalization". It sounds like a popular sauce－if you drizzle it on any food, it will taste better. However, at BNP Paribas, we embarked on a new journey of digital transformation together with our customers in China.The mindset of leveraging innovation to influence the business dynamic is pioneering here compared with other markets.For example, the transaction banking unit of BNP Paribas China introduced a fully digitalized platform called Multi-bank Solution. It allows our corporate clients to conduct their cash management on a multi-bank basis through a single interface. We are the first bank to introduce this kind of innovation to China.How do you appraise the financial risks facing China? What are your suggestions to solve them?It will be challenging for many businesses, given the macroeconomic environment in 2019. As President Xi Jinping said, the world today is undergoing unprecedented changes that have not been seen in the past 100 years.Among all the risks, we believe that the market should pay close attention to private enterprises, whose difficulties created economic and financial ripples throughout the market.The central government has launched many macroeconomic tools to solve the problem. Separately, on our side, China is on the front line of a digital era, leading the technology and innovation, with the largest population of mobile users. Information is everywhere. Being a banker in this fierce competition, we need to utilize information intelligently by tapping the offering in China.How will the further opening-up of China's financial sector affect your company's business?In 2018, we celebrated the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up. It is a remarkable economic miracle and financial achievement created by all.BNP Paribas is a committed China partner. The further opening-up is an important positive message for foreign banks that have deep commitments to this great market. The further opening-up will definitely drive more business opportunities to embark on both onshore and offshore markets.As a leading international bank, we aim to maximize the full potential by leveraging global resources, providing the best offerings for our Chinese and international clients, continuously deepening strategic cooperation, and advancing mutual development with leading local institutions in China.What business opportunities are you looking for regarding the Belt and Road Initiative and renminbi internationalization?We have various projects related to the Belt and Road Initiative, which cover sectors including infrastructure, healthcare, transportation and energy. We are supported by our industry expertise, wide access and strong partnerships within the ecosystem.The strengthened regional economic cooperation due to this initiative will push the agenda for RMB internationalization. Due to the expansion of RMB internationalization, we see more and more offshore entities using the yuan as a trading currency and for international settlements.More recently, we have obtained a license to underwrite Panda bonds for foreign issuers. We believe that with the growing maturity of multinational corporations' operations onshore in China, foreign parent companies will be increasingly seeking to tap the domestic bond market as an important and highly cost-effective source of RMB funding to support their Chinese expansion needs.We also see the opportunities lying in trade finance as the deepened opening-up will stimulate two-way transactions, as more local enterprises are seeking to go global and more international players are seeking to invest in China.CVName: CG LaiNationality: ChineseCareer:Feb 2019-present: CEO, BNP Paribas ChinaAug 2018-Feb 2019: Deputy CEO, BNP Paribas China2012-Sept 2018: Head of global markets for China, BNP Paribas2005-12: Head of fixed income for China, BNP Paribas; head of corporate group Asia (ex-Japan), fixed income, BNP Paribas1996-2005: Various positions at BNP Paribas1982-95: Various positions at Chase Manhattan Bank and American Express BankEducation: MBA from the University of WashingtonFamily: Married; two children
