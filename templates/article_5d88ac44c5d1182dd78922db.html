                "I'm calling from the IRS, you owe us thousands of dollars on your taxes. If you don't pay it now, the local police will come to your house and arrest you."Millions of people living in the US have received this type of robocall with someone pretending to be the Internal Revenue Service, as the deadline for filing US taxes — April 15 — looms."What happens is that these people will tell you, 'I'm from the IRS, and you owe us money, you have to pay it right away by debit card, bitcoin or by wire'," Claire Rosenzweig, president of the Better Business Bureau of New York, told China Daily."If they say they're from Social Security, they might say that your Social Security number has been involved with a crime. It's not true. The main thing to do when you get a call like that is to hang up," Rosenzweig said.Nearly 48 billion robocalls were made to US residents last year, according to a Federal Communications Commission report released in February, and nearly 50 percent of those calls were from scammers.The report also noted that the number of complaints about illegal robocalls has been increasing, jumping from 172,000 in 2015 to 232,000 in 2018.YouMail, a company that collects and analyzes calls through its robocalls blocking service, estimates that last month alone there were 5.23 billion robocalls made to the US phone numbers, the most ever in one month. Robocalls are also a global problem. Last year there were an estimated 85 billion calls globally — an increase of 325 percent from a year ago — with scams involving bank accounts, credit cards and extortion being the most common, according to a report by Hiya, a company that makes apps to thwart unwanted calls.The US Federal Trade Commission says the 35,000 victims of robocall scams in 2018 lost about $10 million. Among 1.4 billion fraud reports made last year, more than one-third involved impostor scams, and government scams cost the US nearly $488 million in total, according to the agency.Rosenzweig said the reason that people still fall for scam robocalls is because scammers are good at scaring people. "They depend on a person being so frightened that they're going to act right away by doing whatever the scammer wants them to do," she said."Immigrants can be easy targets of scammers because they are afraid of being arrested and getting a criminal record," Kathy Liu, a lawyer based in New York told China Daily. "Especially for those who are on their way to becoming a US citizen, they don't want to get any criminal record."Since December 2017, a robocall scheme targeting people with Chinese last names, in which the caller pretends to be from the Chinese embassy and demands money, has garnered more than 350 complaints and fleeced victims for $40 million, according to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center.US lawmakers have taken note of the surge in scam robocalls. Last week a Senate panel advanced legislation that would increase the fine on scam robocalls and give the federal government authority to fine offenders up to $10,000 per call.The Wall Street Journal recently reported that despite issuing fines of more than $208 million, the federal government has collected less than $7,000.

                    S. Korean president's approval rating inches down to 67.9%: poll

            <p class="style-content">
                SEOUL - South Korean President Moon Jae-in's approval rating inched down this week as some of conservative voters were affected by the extended detention of impeached President Park Geun-hye, a weekly poll showed Thursday.According to the Realmeter survey, support for Moon was 67.9 percent this week, down 0.6 percentage points from the previous week.The result was based on a poll of 1,547 voters conducted from Monday to Wednesday. It had 2.5 percentage points in margin of error with a 95 percent confidence level.A Seoul court decided last Friday to issue another arrest warrant for former President Park, who has been in custody and stood trial over corruption charges including bribery. With the warrant, Park could be detained as long as next April.The pollster said a part of conservative voters withdrew from their support for President Moon due to the extended detention. Park denounced the extension as a political retaliation.Moon's ruling Democratic Party kept a top post with 49.1 percent in support scores. It was followed by the main opposition Liberty Korea Party with 18.3 percent, which was down 0.6 percentage points from a week earlier.The centrist People's Party won 6.3 percent of support, while the minor conservative Righteous Party and the minor progressive Justice Party garnering 6.2 percent and 4.6 percent respectively.

                A string of Academy Awards is helping to put an Irish animation studio on the map. Xu Fan looks at how its films may be received by Chinese audiences.Irish director Nora Twomey believes her new animated movie may resonate with Chinese because of its similarities with the story of Hua Mulan, the brave daughter who disguises herself as a young man to take her father's place in the emperor's army.Indeed, her new film, The Breadwinner, which is set in Afghanistan, resembles the Chinese ballad first transcribed 1,500 years ago, she explains during the 14th China International Cartoon & Animation Festival in Zhejiang's provincial capital, Hangzhou.The animator-director shared some of the film's behind-the-scenes stories at the event.When it comes to animated movies, most Chinese people would expect their favorite flicks to hail from Hollywood or Japan.But thanks to glowing word-of-mouth reviews from a growing group of Chinese moviegoers, Irish animated films have steadily been gaining recognition for their culturally distinctive features in movies such as The Secret of Kells, Song of the Sea and The Breadwinner.While it might seem like a coincidence that all three of these films received a nomination for best animated feature at the Academy Awards in 2009, 2015 and 2018, respectively, it may come as no surprise that these movies were all produced by Cartoon Saloon, an animation studio based in Kilkenny, a town in southeastern Ireland.Twomey, who co-founded Cartoon Saloon with two friends in 1999, recalls the inspiration for The Breadwinner, which was adapted from the 2000 children's novel of the same name, and was originally penned by Canadian author Deborah Ellis."Ellis is an incredible woman. She's interested in the rights of children around the world. When I read her book, I was very inspired," recalls Twomey, during an interview on the sidelines of the event with China Daily.

                    US, Israel want White Helmets out of Syria to prevent exposure
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                As the Syrian Arab Army is intensifying its southern advance, the situation is heating up. Speaking to Sputnik, analysts explained what could be behind the controversial evacuation of the White Helmets from Syria to Jordan by the Israeli military at the request of Washington.Under the guise of the White Helmets evacuation, Western powers were apparently seeking to cover their tracks and pull their valuable assets out of Syria, says Ghassan Kadi, a political analyst of Syrian origin.The political analyst presumed that "given the 'good name' the Western media gave the White Helmets as the alleged defenders of the 'victims of the regime,' the name White Helmets is probably now been used as a cover for every important asset that the enemies of Syria want to help leave Syria under the guise of helping the 'heroes.'""And let us not forget that the white helmets themselves are not stitched on the heads of their bearer," he added. "Anyone can wear a white helmet and become a White Helmet, just like former terrorists which left Syria into Turkey and then entered the EU as refugees."On July 22, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that he had authorized the evacuation of White Helmets volunteers at the request of US President Donald Trump and other Western leaders. The organization, largely hailed in the West, has been repeatedly spotted engaging in false flag operations in terrorist-held regions in Syria."As a Syrian, I deplore the propaganda role assigned to these terrorists by their Israeli, Arab and Western handlers," Assad stressed.The political observer pointed out that Syria has had its own national branch of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent society since 1954.He stressed that Damascus had also established the institution of Civil Defense in 1953, which is "64 years before the so-called White Helmets suddenly appeared in order to fake chemical weapons attacks for the benefit of Western audiences and to garner pity for al-Nusra Front* terrorists with Western public opinion."According to Assad, the West's concerns over the evacuation of the NGO are quite understandable given previous reports about French, Belgian, German, Canadian, Israeli, British, Dutch and American operatives among rebels in Syria."The White Helmets evacuation by Israel was predictable as the group has been working together with Israel, the US and also various terrorist groups," Philip Giraldi, a former CIA case officer and US Army intelligence officer, emphasized. "They have never worked in areas where the Syrian [Arab] Army has had control and are little more than terrorist apologists.""They are afraid that the Syrian Army will arrest them on sight, with good reason as they are an affiliate of the terrorists," Giraldi underscored.For his part, Israeli political analyst and publicist Avigdor Eskin opined that Israel's actions at the request of the US, Canada and the EU had prevented a potential bloodshed by allowing the White Helmets to flee the theater of war.He cited previous cases, including the liberation of Aleppo, when Syrian rebels of various affiliations were allowed to leave embattled areas to pave the way for reconciliation.The Israeli analyst opined that all efforts aimed at preventing violence should be hailed, especially given the fact that the seven-year war has claimed the lives of more than 500,000 Syrians.According to Jordan's Foreign Ministry, 422 out of 800 White Helmets volunteers and their family members have been evacuated by the Israeli military.

                    Former Argentina president indicted on corruption charges
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                BUENOS AIRES, Sept 17  - Argentina's former president Cristina Fernandez was indicted on Monday on charges that her administration accepted bribes from construction companies in exchange for public works contracts, according to an indictment released by a federal judge.Argentina's Justice Department is seeking to determine whether Fernandez headed a broad corruption network that involved politicians and businessmen during her two terms as president from 2007-15.The corruption scandal erupted in August when a local newspaper published notebooks kept by a chauffer of Fernandez's former planning minister. The notebooks cataloged bags of cash allegedly delivered to government offices and the private residence of Fernandez and her late husband and former President Nestor Kirchner.A spokesperson for Fernandez did not immediately reply to a request for comment.As a senator, Fernandez enjoys immunity from arrest, although she is not immune from prosecution.Federal judge Claudio Bonadio, who is heading the investigation, asked that Fernandez be impeached, a move that is unlikely to garner the support necessary to pass a Senate vote."It is necessary to continue this investigation until we have completely clarified how these illegal payments were structured, at least in regards to the officials who were part of the former planning ministry and the entrepreneurs associated with them," the indictment said.The scandal has implicated dozens of former officials and business owners in the construction sector, shaking confidence in an industry already burdened by an ailing economy, government cuts to public works and crippling interest rates at 60 percent.Although Fernandez has already been indicted on other charges, she still enjoys broad popular support, and is widely expected to run for president again next year.Reuters

                    No federal charges for New York policeman in 2014 'I can't breathe' death
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                NEW YORK/WASHINGTON - The New York police officer who put Eric Garner in a fatal chokehold during an attempted 2014 arrest, fueling the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, will not face federal criminal charges, Brooklyn's top federal prosecutor said on Tuesday.Garner's death on a sidewalk during an arrest for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes, and his gasped final words "I can't breathe" caught on bystander video, played a key role in the rise of the movement decrying excessive use of force by police officers against black men and teens in the United States.Garner's family immediately blasted the decision clearing Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who put Garner in a prohibited chokehold, in a news conference as a betrayal.US Attorney Richard Donoghue confirmed the decision at a news conference."The death of Eric Garner was a tragedy," Donoghue said. "The job of the federal prosecutor, however, is not to let our emotions dictate our decisions."A lengthy Department of Justice review of the incident did not reach a conclusive determination as to whether Pantaleo willfully committed misconduct, an "essential element" necessary to bring federal charges, a senior department official told reporters at a briefing in Washington.US Attorney General Bill Barr made the ultimate call, siding with federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, who had not wanted to charge Pantaleo, over the department's civil rights division, which had wanted to bring charges, the official said.The official confirmed that no New York police officer – not just Pantaleo – will face any charges.MOTHER: 'TODAY WE CAN'T BREATHE'After meeting with federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, members of Garner's family held a news conference with civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton."The DOJ has failed us," said Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, adding that she wanted to see Pantaleo fired. "Five years ago, my son said 'I can't breathe' 11 times, and today we can't breathe because they let us down."A New York grand jury in 2014 declined to charge Pantaleo, who has been assigned to desk duty since Garner's death and faced a disciplinary trial in May at New York City Police Department headquarters.A departmental judge is due to make her recommendations to New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill, who will then ultimately decide whether to punish Pantaleo. He could lose vacation days or be fired.The NYPD said its disciplinary process on Pantaleo will not be affected by the federal prosecutors' decision.The Civilian Complaint Review Board, the city oversight agency that prosecuted the departmental trial against Pantaleo, called the Justice Department's long-delayed decision "an utter travesty.""Our last hope for justice in this case lies with the Police Commissioner," CCRB Chairman Fred Davie said in a statement. "CCRB prosecutors presented evidence at trial that showed - unequivocally - that Officer Pantaleo engaged in misconduct worthy of termination."UNION: NO 'SCAPEGOATING'New York's Police Benevolent Association union welcomed the news."Although Mr. Garner's death was an undeniable tragedy, Police Officer Pantaleo did not cause it," PBA President Patrick Lynch said in a statement. "Scapegoating a good and honorable officer, who was doing his job in the manner he was taught, will not heal the wounds this case has caused for our entire city."The New York City Chief Medical Examiner's office ruled that Garner's death was a homicide induced by "compression of neck (choke hold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police."Pantaleo's lawyers have argued he did not use a chokehold, but instead used an authorized "seatbelt" hold that slipped as Garner struggled, and that the officer did not cause Garner's death."It is always a tragedy when there is a loss of life," Stuart London, a lawyer for Pantaleo, said in a statement. "Officer Pantaleo is gratified that the Justice department took the time to carefully review the actual evidence in this case rather than the lies and inaccuracies which have followed this case from its inception."In 2015, New York City officials agreed to pay Garner's family an out-of-court settlement of $5.9 million to resolve a wrongful death lawsuit.The incident, and other high-profile police killings of black men and teens in cities including Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, set off a wave of nationwide protests in 2014 and 2015.Several Democratic contenders for the White House, including New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, condemned the decisions."Years ago, we put our faith in the federal government to act," de Blasio said in a statement. "We won't make that mistake again."Reuters

                    NYC officer in chokehold death of black man won't be charged

                NEW YORK - The New York City police officer who caused the chokehold death of an unarmed black man during an attempted arrest in 2014 will not face criminal charges, federal prosecutors said here on Tuesday.Richard Donoghue, US Attorney of the Eastern District of New York, said there was insufficient evidence that officer Daniel Pantaleo broke the law or violated the civil rights of Eric Garner, who was selling cigarettes illegally outside a convenience store in the borough of Staten Island before his death on July 17 five years ago."Even if we could prove that Officer Pantaleo's hold of Mr. Garner constituted unreasonable force, we would still have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Officer Pantaleo acted willfully in violation of the law," he said.The decision was made by US Attorney General William Barr, who sided with federal prosecutors in New York instead of civil rights prosecutors in Washington, media reports cited a senior Justice Department official as saying.After a grand jury ruled in 2014 not to indict Pantaleo, the case was raised to the Department of Justice (DOJ) and was ended one day before its five-year anniversary.A video clip of the incident shows Garner, who refused to be handcuffed by the police, crying out "I can't breathe" at least 11 times when the officer put him in a chokehold before he eventually lost consciousness.The widely-circulated video catalyzed a nationwide Black Lives Matter movement at a time when a number of African Americans died during their encounter with police."We all saw the same devastating video 5 years ago. Our eyes did not lie," New York Attorney General Letitia James said on Twitter after the announcement of the decision."We'll continue to fight to reform a criminal justice system that remains broken," she continued.Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, said at a press conference Tuesday that the DOJ "has failed us" and her family are "not going away.""That officer, Officer Pantaleo, and all the officers who was involved in my son's death that day, need to be off the force," said Carr."I stood quietly by for five years; I'm not being quiet anymore," she added.

                NEW YORK - A New York Police Department administrative judge on Friday recommended that Daniel Pantaleo, the white police officer who used a fatal chokehold on an unarmed black man during an arrest in 2014, be fired, a city oversight body said.Pantaleo had been on desk duty since he was seen in widely viewed cellphone videos using a banned chokehold on Eric Garner on a Staten Island sidewalk during an attempted arrest. Police believed Garner was selling loose, untaxed cigarettes.Rosemarie Maldonado, a deputy police commissioner who oversees disciplinary hearings, reached her verdict after overseeing Pantaleo's disciplinary trial earlier this year.Police Commissioner James O'Neill is expected to follow the recommendation, CNN reported.The police department said it would release a statement later on Friday.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had faced criticism and protests over continuing to employ Pantaleo as he campaigns to be the Democratic presidential candidate in next year's national election, with Garner's relatives and others long demanding that Pantaleo be fired.The mayor has said he regrets his decision to postpone disciplinary proceedings against Pantaleo for what would become several years while a US Justice Department civil rights investigation was ongoing.He reversed course last year, saying he would no longer wait for the Justice Department, and ordered the police department to begin the internal disciplinary trial. He said it would be unfair for him to weigh in on whether Pantaleo should be disciplined before the trial proceedings had concluded.During that trial, prosecutors from the city's Civilian Complaint Review Board, an oversight agency, argued that Pantaleo should be fired for using a banned chokehold. Pantaleo's lawyers argued that Garner himself, not the officer, was to blame for his death, and that Pantaleo followed his training and orders from senior police."The evidence the CCRB's prosecutors brought forth at trial was more than sufficient to prove that Pantaleo is unfit to serve," CCRB Chairman Fred Davie said in a statement."Commissioner O'Neill must uphold this verdict and dismiss Pantaleo from the Department, as was recommended by both the CCRB and the Deputy Commissioner of Trials."In July, the Justice Department announced it had closed its civil rights investigation without bringing any criminal charges, nearly five years after a grand jury in Staten Island declined to indict Pantaleo on state charges for Garner's death.Reuters

                    Secessionists of a feather flock together: China Daily editorial

                The chaos in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has provided Tsai Ing-wen, the separatist leader of Taiwan, and her Democratic Progressive Party with an excuse to slander the "one country, two systems", which the Chinese mainland practices in order to realize complete national reunification.The massive defeat Tsai and the DPP suffered in last year's local election shows what lies in store for them in the island's leadership election next year. Which explains her desperation to use the unrest in Hong Kong as a tool to garner voters' support on the island to win next year's polls. No wonder she and her party don't want the Hong Kong demonstrations to end.Tsai has chosen to be silent on the violence unleashed by the demonstrators in Hong Kong and instead has vowed to provide humanitarian aid for the rioters, hinting that they have been "unfairly" treated.By openly supporting the Hong Kong demonstrators, Tsai is adding fuel to the fire. She has also joined the United States, the island's most avid supporter, in fanning passions in the SAR.Playing the role of a US acolyte, the Tsai administration is trying to curry favor with the White House with the aim of strengthening its hand on the island and arrest its downward political slide.The fact that the unrest in Hong Kong has enough surplus value for Tsai to exploit is evident in Joshua Wong, a Hong Kong secessionist detained on Saturday for inciting violence and illegal assembly, flying to Taiwan on Tuesday for a two-day meeting with his "like-minded hosts".Not surprisingly, the invitation was extended by a foundation funded by DPP officials shortly after he was released on bail on the very day he was arrested.More than 10 Hong Kong separatists have been welcomed by Taiwan. But according to reports, they have complained about the poor living conditions there, and regretted their decision to visit Taiwan after seeing many of the protesters being released on bail so soon, and afraid of being stigmatized for their engagement with Taiwan.Neither the Taiwan nor the Hong Kong separatists take the other seriously as each side has an axe to grind. They only treat each other as an expedient card to play to make short-term gains. But both conceal their shared belief that Beijing is determined to defend the core national interests, and nothing can stop it from doing so.
