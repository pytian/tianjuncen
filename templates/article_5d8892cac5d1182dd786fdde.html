                Brazil's bread tickles consumers' taste buds in China
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                PAULO - Cheese bread, Brazil's favorite breakfast and snack food, is now available at Chinese cafeterias.Its import into China was made possible by the first-ever China International Import Expo held in Shanghai in November last year.In May, Brazil's leading cheese bread maker Forno de Minas shipped its first container of 10 tons of cheese bread to China, supplying cafeterias in Shanghai. Two months later, the bakery made a second shipment to China with 18 tons of cheese bread."We are proud to have arrived in China," Gabriela Cioba, manager of foreign trade at Forno de Minas, said.Forno de Minas is located in southeast Brazil's Minas Gerais state, home to the popular savory bun made with tapioca flour, eggs, vegetable oil, milk and shredded cheese."We want cheese bread to become a global product, just like Italy's pizza (that) began to go international and won over the world," said Cioba.Forno de Minas already exported cheese bread to 17 countries before it decided to enter the Chinese market in 2018 by participating in the CIIE.The event served as a springboard to open up opportunities in China for the ubiquitous food that energizes Brazilians throughout the day.Consumers' feedback and suggestions at the CIIE also pushed the company to adapt its products to local tastes."We formed a partnership with a Chinese importer at the CIIE to represent us. That's where we realized that the Chinese public likes less salty products than those sold in Brazil. So, when making cheese bread for China, we lowered the sodium by some 40 percent," said Cioba.Since 2009, China has been a leading trade partner for Brazil, and the two countries celebrate the 45th anniversary of diplomatic ties this year."Our initial focus is to work with cafeterias, bakeries and restaurants, sales channels called food service," said Cioba."We want (cheese bread) to be an accompaniment to coffee or tea" in China, she said.Such events as the CIIE are crucial to exporters, she said, adding her firm also expects to take part in the upcoming Global Food Marketplace fair in Shanghai in May 2020.Founded in 1990, the Brazilian company produces 1,700 tons of cheese bread a month, or 68 million buns.Cheese bread originated in the 18th century, when Brazil was a Portuguese colony. Bakers used tapioca as a substitute for flour and added cheese to the recipe.

                The flag of a major international skills event was handed over to Shanghai at the closing ceremony of the 45th WorldSkills Competition in Kazan, Russia, on Tuesday.Team China, with 16 gold medals, ranked No 1 in the medal tally among the 63 participating countries and regions in the event.Known as the Olympics of skills, WorldSkills is a global event in which participants compete in professional skills as well as exchanging their skills, experience and technological innovations.At the closing ceremony, a team from Shanghai gave the Russian audience a tremendous performance of Chinese culture and art. Then the competition's flag was handed from the Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, Tatyana Golikova, to Wang Yongqing, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.With the theme of "Master Skills, Change the World", Shanghai has now taken the job of hosting the next competition in 2021.Shanghai Mayor Ying Yong said he appreciated the support and help of the international community."Shanghai will maintain the connection with WorldSkills International and all its member countries. We will try our best to push the influence of WorldSkills to a higher level and keep encouraging more people to improve their lives by enhancing their professional skills," Ying said.Jos de Goey, newly elected president of WorldSkills International, said that Russia did a really good job in hosting the competition, and he is looking forward to the success of Shanghai in 2021.He said China had proposed organizing a museum on World-Skills."There has been, since the 1950s, when WorldSkills started, a great history that so far we haven't captured in the best possible way," he said.More than 1,300 competitors competed in 56 skill games this year.China led overall with 35 medals, 16 of them gold, and Russia took second place with 14 golds among its 22 medals.Twenty-year-old Chen Zifeng, of Guangzhou, Guangdong province, won a gold medal in the bricklaying project at the competition.He said he felt excited about his performance and the final result."I think it's my effort that brought this honor to me," he said.Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed confidence that the victories at the competitions will lead to big qualitative changes in the lives of young professionals."Those medals are not accidental. They have been earned with your talent, your labor, hard work and desire to prove that in any case there are such competencies that represent the highest level in a profession," Putin said.

                    Pragmatism will shape UK's China policy

                A United Kingdom out of the EU will need to maintain a friendly and stable bilateral relationship with China as one of the guarantees to safeguard its national interests and international status British diplomatic tradition and Boris Johnson's experience and character all hint at London exercising "principled pragmatism" in its China policy during his tenure as prime minister. That is to say, the United Kingdom will develop its ties with China based on whether it is in the UK's interests and adopt a rational and pragmatic attitude in such fields as economy, trade, science and technology. It may continue to denounce China ideologically, but in a moderate and tacit way, exercising restraint on issues such as Hong Kong, Tibet and the South China Sea. The reason the Johnson administration will be rational and pragmatic in its approach to China is Britain's keen international nose and deep foreign relations background. Among Western countries, the UK is well-known for its profound diplomatic tradition, broad global vision and mature political experience. Certainly, the predictions are useful for policy references on the conditions that this prime minister survives toughly conflicting British parliamentary politics. Historically, Britain has been keenly attuned to fundamental trends in international politics and has been able to preemptively adapt to them. Up to this day, British diplomacy still inherits the tradition of broad vision, flexibility and pragmatism. Once Britain identifies a situation, it quickly acts. In 2015, after the UK took the lead in joining the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, other Western countries responded one after another. In recent years, Britain has been more open to Chinese investment than any other Western country. The Economist once lamented: "Remarkably, there has been little discussion of such strategy change in Britain. This will change the country's role in the world. The British are shifting resources from Europe to China, from the political table to the trade table." Johnson has always attached great importance to Sino-UK ties, especially economic and trade ties. A journalist by training, Johnson saw China's potential earlier and more accurately than most Western politicians. Although he wrote in The Daily Telegraph in 2005 that "our children don't need to learn Mandarin and China won't dominate the world", he soon admitted that he had been wrong and began learning Chinese himself. He now even calls himself a "fan of China" in his tweets. When he was mayor of London, Johnson paid a friendly visit to China and emphasized his hope and support for strengthening Sino-UK trade cooperation. His tendency to accord great value to Sino-British economic and trade ties was evident in his attitude toward China when he was the British foreign secretary. During former prime minister Theresa May's visit to China in 2016, Johnson said he was committed to strengthening trade links with China and opening wider channels for UK service sector exports to China and Chinese investment in the UK. In Johnson's view, the growing number of Chinese citizens traveling to and studying in the UK provides a huge market for the country. Johnson has also played a positive role in promoting the steady development of China-UK relations since they entered the "golden era". For example, when China and the UK celebrated the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations in 2017, Johnson, as British foreign secretary, made a special video recording in which he not only reviewed achievements made since the establishment of diplomatic ties, but also expressed his expectation of a further strengthening bilateral relations. It's anybody's guess how things will pan out should the UK leave the European Union. As of Sept 5, the opposition Labour Party had won a go-ahead for a bill that would mean Britain asking the EU to extend its departure date. If the UK leaves the EU, the Johnson administration is likely to rely more heavily on the potential and growth rate of the Chinese market. And the Chinese market will become increasingly important to the UK if its trade deals with the United States, Japan and others end up biting the dust. Johnson is fully aware of this and is likely to continue Britain's positive attitude toward China's Belt and Road Initiative and related proposals. Moreover, when the UK is out of the EU, it will need to maintain a friendly and stable bilateral relationship with China as one of the guarantees to safeguard its national interests and international status. The new administration faces a litmus test with regard to Huawei's participation in the UK's 5G network construction. The US is seeking a full UK ban on Huawei. Given that the UK has allowed Huawei to participate partially in 5G network construction, any sudden reversal of that position, for whatever reason, will be interpreted as a sign of diplomatic weakness. Therefore, it is more likely that the new administration will maintain policy continuity on Huawei 5G. On the less optimistic side, it will be harder for the new administration to take a step forward on this and similar high-tech issues. In other words, the Johnson administration will not fully open the 5G market to Huawei. It will allow Huawei to build base stations and provide non-sensitive equipment such as antennas, but the core network used to store data will still be off-limits to Huawei. It remains to be seen how "principled" UK's pragmatism will be. The importance of this question lies in recognizing UK's bottom line when dealing with China. From the case of Huawei 5G to that of Hong Kong, the UK will of course carefully calibrate its policy and strategy so that they favor its national security and values. However, it is the very calibration that reminds us of the importance of "rules" in British minds. In the near future, as the UK leaves the EU and China further engages with Europe, what rules to play by and how China and the UK understand and approach the rules-based international system will be fundamental to bilateral ties.

                Arranging flowers is not a job exclusively for genteel ladies; it is also a field in which gifted males can display their talent.Lu Yiwei, a 19-year-old from Shanghai, proved his floristry skills by winning the gold medal at the 45th WorldSkills Competition in Kazan, Russia, last month."The stereotype is that floristry is a profession suitable for girls," he said. "But actually, it's not an easy job because it requires physical work, such as moving wood and large, heavy flowerpots-things that are used when creating works-which requires strength."Born in December 2000, Lu was accepted by the Shanghai Construction Engineering School-a key State vocational establishment-in 2017, a year after he graduated from junior high school at age 16."When I enrolled in the school, the first thing I learned was landscape architecture. Then my teacher told me that maybe I should study floristry because he felt I was gifted in that area," he said with a laugh.Lu said he was unsure about the suggestion because he knew nothing about the topic. "All I knew at the time was that my upperclassman (in the floristry major) had won the 44th WorldSkills Competition in Abu Dhabi in 2017."His trip to Kazan was exciting and stressful, but he treasures the memory."I didn't stand out during the World-Skills trials, which were held in March last year, as there were so many experienced and superior competitors," he said. "But I was always optimistic about my performances and results. I think my sanguine attitude brought me opportunities and the final honor."According to Lu, he was selected as one of 10 candidates in the national team for the floristry project in September last year after winning the knock-out stage at the end of March. That success gave him the opportunity to compete in the 45th World-Skills.He said he had an ever-present fear during the competition because the pressure grew as the event progressed.He added that the competitors were required to complete nine sections in 1,340 minutes during the four-day competition, including designing table fleurs, chaplets and cut-flower decorations."Because the competition was held in Russia, the works we designed had to include Russian elements. We were given all our assignments about 15 minutes before the competition started, which was highly demanding because we had to come up with design proposals for all the sections in such a short time," he said."It was also a test of the contestants' physical strength as you had to stand there doing the work for such a long time."The master flower-arranger was at a low ebb as he prepared for the competition."I had undergone several trials since the first city-level tryout in Shanghai in March last year. In fact, I got really good results during the trials, and I swelled with pride when I got the opportunity to represent the national team at the 45th WorldSkills," he said."However, almost two weeks before I was involved in the final training session in July, I was starved of ideas, which was terrible for a competitor whose project required new ideas, not just skills. I adapted to my new identity in time, thanks to my coaches who guided me with their patience and scientific training courses."Lu has not become complacent about his performance or winning the competition. Since returning from Russia, he has started a new life at the Shanghai Institute of Technology, again studying landscape architecture."Knowledge is of great importance from my perspective, even though I have the skills. If a person has the skills, but lacks knowledge, he won't be a qualified talent," he said."Many of my peers were pleased after winning medals at the competition, but they lost their drive. I won the world championship at the age of 19, but I know that it's not my final destination. I want to explore more new talents within myself."He said he plans to start his own floristry workshop after graduation. "There is a great shortage of top-notch floristry workshops in China due to a lack of world-class mentors. I hope I can start my workshop in the near future to help produce more talent in the field."
