                That the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government has canceled the annual National Day fireworks show on Oct 1 and Hong Kong Jockey Club called off Wednesday's Happy Valley race, both for security reasons, speaks volumes of the damage the violent demonstrations have caused to the city.Under the garb of democracy, signified by the masks they've worn to hide their identity, the insurrectionists have attacked police officers and stations, and tried to break into the Legislative Council building. It is absurd indeed that, despite claiming to fight for "democracy" and "righteousness", they are afraid of revealing their true identity.On Saturday, a middle-aged Hong Kong resident pulled the mask off a radical's face when the latter was showering a group of people singing China's national anthem with invectives. Instead of facing up to the situation, the radical punched the middle-aged man, cutting open his left brow ridge, covered his face with his arm and fled the scene.Immediately after being uploaded online, the video, recorded by a bystander, drew wide attention. And the violent protester was, ironically, identified as a 25-year-old civil servant working for Hong Kong customs, giving rise to a heated debate on whether the SAR should have a special law banning protesters from covering their faces with masks.Masks seem to have put the demonstrators above the law, simply because they cannot be identified. Which has seriously compromised the rule of law in Hong Kong.So it is good to hear Hong Kong Secretary of Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah saying the city's legislators are studying the feasibility of making such a law — which has been on their agenda for three years since the Mong Kok riots took place.In many countries and regions, such a law plays an important role in demarcating the legal and moral boundaries of demonstrators.There are enough reasons to believe such a law would be backed by public opinion, because it is already a consensus among the sane elements in the city that the rule of law must be safeguarded by putting an end to the violence in the city.Since too many radical protesters have been released on bail within hours of being detained under the current Hong Kong law, it is necessary and urgent to address the issue using legal means to remove their masks.Tough times call for tough measures.

                    Advancing political consultation to serve national rejuvenation: China Daily editorial

                The system of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference should be upheld, and its work of political consultation, democratic oversight, and participation in State affairs improved. This message for the CPPCC came from Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, on Friday, the eve of its 70th anniversary.The CPPCC, whose national committee is China's top political advisory body, is a bridge between the people and the government, and a reliable consultant for decision-makers at the highest level. Originating from the national united front against Japanese aggression under the leadership of the CPC in the 1930s, the CPPCC is today indispensable to China's national development.China's fast-paced economic development has only made the CPPCC more important. Take the 13th CPPCC National Committee for example. Its 2,158 members, experts from 34 major sections of society and classified into 10 special committees, carry out research in different fields, conduct in-depth studies, hold group discussions, and only then do they put forward proposals for public policies for the central government's consideration.At its annual meeting in March, the 13th CPPCC National Committee submitted a total of 5,113 proposals, of which 1,121 were accepted as advice and suggestions by the central government. And many of those have led to new policies or changes in policies.The CPPCC — which has local committees at county, city and provincial levels that function in a similar way to help local officials better serve the people — is not only a broad platform for multiparty cooperation, its original mission, but also helps build an inclusive atmosphere for consultative politics and institutional guarantee for people's democracy.Its institutional arrangement, which has developed with the changing times, ensures that all proposals are based on thorough research and analyzed to verify their feasibility before they are submitted to the government.The fact that the CPPCC is not averse to the idea of embracing new applications of information and communications technology shows its welcoming attitude toward modern technology and innovation. Which in turn has remarkably improved its efficiency, and made it more responsive to people's practical needs and governance problems.The CPPCC should not only maintain the momentum of its good work, increase its interaction with the people and carry out self-reform, but more importantly, as Xi said, improve its work of political consultation, democratic oversight, and participation in State affairs, particularly in fields that are directly related to the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, so as to make concerted efforts together with the CPC and the Chinese people to realize national rejuvenation.If the CPPCC succeeds in its tasks, it will better serve the people, which is its bounden duty.
