                G7 braces for summit in France
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                 Climate change, trade conflict, Iran, Brexit and Russia among topicsLeaders of the G7 countries will meet in Biarritz, France, on Aug 24-26, with an ambitious focus on tackling inequality and climate change. They will also discuss a wide range of other issues from the economy to foreign policy and security, such as relations with Iran and Russia.But experts believe that the sharp differences among the members - the United States, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy and Canada - will make their smiling group photos look less real.The European Union, which is also represented at G7, said in a news release that the summit will be an opportunity for the EU to defend the rules-based order and its organizations as the best approach for global governance.The EU and its key G7 members, Germany, France and the UK, are at odds with US President Donald Trump on a long list of issues such as multilateralism, climate change, trade and Iran.Outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker will miss the summit this weekend after a gallbladder surgery, the commission's deputy chief spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud said on Monday. It will leave EU's representation to the outgoing European Council President Donald Tusk.Jeffrey Sachs, an economics professor at Columbia University, said Europe must oppose Trump at the G7. In a column published by Project Syndicate on Monday, Sachs said Europe must confront Trump on Iran, trade and a whole host of issues."Europe's leaders would endanger European and global security by acceding to Trump's bluster and threats vis-a-vis Iran, Venezuela, China, and others," Sachs wrote.He said Trump is actively trying to break any country that refuses to bow to his demands. "The American people are not so arrogant and intemperate, but some of Trump's advisers surely are. National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for example, both epitomize a uniquely arrogant approach to the world, amplified by religious fundamentalism in the case of Pompeo," he wrote.The US and the EU are facing a possible trade war. They have already threatened tit-for-tat tariffs over airline subsidies. Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on French wines if France goes ahead with the digital taxation, targeting US tech giants such as Google and Facebook. Trump said on Aug 2 that additional tariffs on European cars are never off the table."By opposing Trump and defending the international rule of law, including rules-based international trade, Europeans and Americans together can strengthen world peace and transatlantic amity for generations to come," Sachs wrote.Besides the transatlantic tensions, Brexit will also be a major issue when new British Prime Minister Boris Johnson attends the G7 summit for the first time.On Monday, Johnson appealed to Tusk directly, asking that the EU consider a solution for the Irish border that doesn't involve the so-called Brexit backstop - a mechanism to avoid border checks between EU-member Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland. But EU leaders have repeatedly said that they will not reopen the withdrawal agreement reached with former British prime minister Theresa May.Trump's endorsing of Brexit and his attacks on EU as an entity have long upset EU leaders.Russia is also expected to be a key issue at the summit. On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron, the host of this year's G7 summit, met Russian President Vladimir Putin. Macron said there was a "real opportunity" for peace in Ukraine following the election of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia was kicked out of the G8 after its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and has been under US and EU economic sanctions ever since.Trump also does not see eye to eye with EU leaders on how to deal with Russia. Most EU leaders opposed Trump's termination of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty.Larry Elliot, an economics editor at The Guardian, lamented that the many differences among G7 leaders won't show up in the traditional group photo."But the smiles for the group photo will be fake," he wrote in a column.Euronews and Politico contributed to the reporting.

                    US officials say top US diplomat for Latin America resigns
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON — The Trump administration's top diplomat for Latin America has resigned amid internal disputes over immigration policy for the region, US officials said Wednesday.Two officials and a congressional aide said Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Kimberly Breier stepped down earlier this week, although they offered differing reasons for her departure. They say Breier cited personal reasons for her decision, but the two officials suggested it was prompted by differences over a recent migration accord with Guatemala. The congressional aide said Breier's departure was mainly driven by family responsibilities.The officials and the aide spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss personnel matters. The State Department had no immediate comment.The Washington Post, which first reported Breier's resignation, said she had clashed with the White House over the Guatemala accord that many human rights advocates oppose. In a tweet, President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka thanked Breier for her "friendship and great service" and she would miss working with her.Breier is the second senior State Department official to leave the administration this month. Last week, Kiron Skinner, the department's director of policy planning, was removed from her post following complaints about her management style, officials said.The Trump administration has struggled to fill numerous senior diplomatic positions and only recently were top diplomats for East Asia and the Pacific and the Middle East confirmed by the Senate. The posts of assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia and for Europe are occupied by officials on an acting basis.Breier, who specialized in Mexico, joined the Trump administration in October 2018, after a career in government and the private sector focused on Latin America. She had been praised for her insights and analysis of the region while serving on the National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration.However, her refusal to testify before Congress even once during her 10-month tenure had irritated several lawmakers.At a closed-door business meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee just two weeks ago, Florida Republican Marco Rubio and Indiana Republican Todd Young expressed frustration that neither she nor anyone from her bureau would agree to testify at two planned hearings on Central America and Colombia, according to two Senate staffers. The staffers spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the matter publicly.Breier was known to have an ongoing feud with Mauricio Claver-Carone, her Western Hemisphere counterpart at the National Security Council, the two staffers said. They said she also was marginalized from playing a role in policy toward Venezuela — with immigration and trade, the most-pressing foreign policy challenge in the region — after Trump named Elliott Abrams as special envoy to the crisis-wracked country.AP

                    Twitterplomacy is less about resolving issues than playing to a domestic audience
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Welcome to the era of Twitterplomacy, in which major international issues are addressed in 280 alphabet characters or less.President Donald Trump, with his daily online responses to matters of the day, is often regarded as a pioneer in the field. In reality, the trend toward global politicians communicating via virtual one-liners was well under way before he transformed it into a surrealist art form.In a recent Twitter posting, Trump praised President Xi Jinping as a great leader who had the respect of his people before proposing, in connection with events in Hong Kong: "Personal meeting?"Stumped for a response to this unconventional approach to what it regards as a domestic issue, Beijing wisely chose to ignore it.There is a place for one-on-one encounters between world leaders to resolve issues of mutual interest. They can sometimes break the deadlock that tied up diplomats and negotiators lower down the line.But top-level meetings, proposed on little more than a whim, have little chance of progress without the diplomatic spadework required to give them any chance of success.Trump's critics have warned of the perils of his transactional approach to international relations in which he believes leaders should sit down together like company CEOs and hammer out advantageous deals with little regard for their wider global obligations.Maybe they are missing the point. Perhaps the attraction of Twitterplomacy is less about resolving issues than in playing to a domestic audience or diverting attention from more pressing problems.As a communications technique employed by certain world leaders, it is not entirely new. Before the internet there was "megaphone diplomacy" that involved loud, frequently threatening and very public exchanges between global antagonists.China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi used the phrase in 2015 to describe a series of public interventions by US officials and politicians criticizing China's policy in the South China Sea.The one virtue of megaphone diplomacy is that, in principle, it requires reflection and forethought. Wisely deployed, it can be used to warn others of the consequences of unprovoked aggression.Instant messaging apps such as Twitter, however, tend to reinforce the spur-of-the-moment thoughts and prejudices that even world leaders can be tempted to share in an instant, only to repent at their leisure.The Christian Science Monitor newspaper in the US spotted the trend as early as 2011, when Twitter was just five years old. It listed the then octogenarian Fidel Castro of Cuba as one of its most active users, alongside Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and North Korea's Kim Jong-il.Barack Obama, Trump's more reflective predecessor, had seven million followers on the messaging service just two years into his presidency.Trump, after signing up at the start of his term, now has almost four times as many people – the US citizens and others – following his messaging feed. Postings range from the characteristically self-congratulatory to the tersely cryptic, such as "We are doing very well with China, and talking!" from Sunday.Outside the US, instant messaging appears to have become the vehicle of choice for British and European politicians embroiled in the UK's continuing Brexit crisis at a time when their parliaments are in recess.It can all be seen as part of a wider trend, at least in the West, for political leaders to talk directly to their citizens – often in imprecise and emotional tones – over the heads of other politicians and bureaucrats.Boris Johnson, the United Kingdom prime minister, recently boasted – via Twitter – that he had hosted the first "people's parliamentary questions" – via Facebook.The mid-August exercise in direct democracy involved voters having an opportunity to put questions directly to Johnson via Facebook, in the same way that MPs can question the prime minister face-to-face in Parliament on a weekly basis.Critics countered that the technique allowed Johnson and his aides to pick the questions they chose to answer, while denying the questioners any right of reply. Not quite direct democracy, in other words.For large numbers of ordinary people, online social media is a valuable resource. But it is not clear that it has done anything to enhance the level of international interchange.It gives populist politicians an additional means to appeal directly to their base, often by insulting perceived enemies both foreign and domestic. Such messages are spread, amplified and frequently exaggerated by their own followers.A number of US commentators have made the point that Trump appears to have reversed President Theodore Roosevelt's dictum that a US leader should "speak softly and carry a big stick". Under Trump, they say, the US speaks loudly and carries a small stick.In any event, world leaders should follow the simple rule of thumb that applies to anyone who uses messaging and sharing apps: think twice before you press "send".

                    China misses out on FIBA World Cup second round after Venezuela defeat
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                BEIJING -- Hosts China will not play in the round of 16 at the 2019 FIBA World Cup after losing 72-59 to Venezuela in its final Group E game here on Wednesday.The result saw Venezuela progress into the competition's next stage, while China will drop into the classification round."We made a lot of preparation. We played tight in offense at the very beginning. We let Venezuela grab 20 offensive rebounds, which is very hard for us," said China's head coach Li Nan.Before tip-off, the Chinese team knew only victory would do, but still they trailed 33-23 at the half-time buzzer. The hosts saw a glimmer of hope when Zhao Jiwei made two consecutive three-pointers during the last minute before the interval, but Venezuela soon answered with a pair from downtown.Offensively, China suffered from the same problem that had plagued their defeat against Poland. When confined in the paint, the team scored just one of seven three-pointer attempts in the first period.Venezuela's Dwight Lewis and Heissler Guillent took turns to attack the rim, and their team grabbed 14 rebounds in total in the first quarter alone, eight more than China managed.Fang Shuo stood out in the second half for China, but not enough. With a three and a jump shot, he led his team to trim the gap to five points with six minutes to go in the third quarter, the smallest deficit China had during the whole game.China couldn't find ways to deal with its disadvantage in long-range shooting and rebounds, and the Venezuelan shooters seemed comparatively unstoppable.Guillent put up a game-high 15 points, with three of his Venezuelan teammates scoring double digits. Fang Shuo scored 13 points in 22 minutes for China."They grabbed 21 more rebounds than us. We didn't do well on execution. It feels bad to lose the game. We'll try all our best and focus on the next game," Chinese guard Fang said, referring to the classification round of 17-32 to be played in Guangzhou.
