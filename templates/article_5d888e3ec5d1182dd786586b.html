                Former US ambassador urges China, US to work together

            <p class="style-content">
                CHICAGO - Former US Ambassador to China Max Baucus has urged China and the United States to work together for the benefit of both."We desperately need each other in so many ways," both economically and geopolitically，Baucus said in a recent interview with Xinhua. "There are areas that we can cooperate. Our future is more assured if we do a better job for our people.""There's distrust on both sides," which is a big issue between the two countries, Baucus said. "Both countries want to trade more or to invest more in their own countries and also with each other. And there is some competition in new industries of new technologies: the AI, big data and machine learning and so forth."To solve this, Baucus suggests the two countries sit down and talk. "It's very hard work. But it must be done."Serving as US ambassador from 2014 to 2017, Baucus knows China well. Though there's a big cultural difference, "Chinese people are just like American people. They have the same hopes and desires, the concerns.""Both people, both countries want food on the table, decent income, education for the kids, decent healthcare, clean air and clean water ... basically we all live their lives and pursue their dreams," he said."I love Chinese people," Baucus told Xinhua. "Chinese people are energetic. They are practical, pragmatic, like to get things done."Baucus enjoyed his job as the US ambassador to China very much. "The reward of working on the relationship between the United States and China is so important for the wellbeing of our kids and our grandkids.""I try to be an ambassador both ways ... I also wanted to build bridges to the United States in China. That was even more important for me," he said. Enditem

                ZHENGZHOU -- China's 11th Ethnic Games concluded in Zhengzhou, Henan province on Monday evening, with organizers conducting the official handover ceremony to delegates representing the next host Hainan province.Athletes representing each of 34 delegations attended the closing ceremony at the Zhengzhou Olympic Center."It's great honor to stand on the pitch again after retiring from athletics to become a coach," said Tan Yimou, who has already represented Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region four times at the Ethnic Games."There are always tight, nip-and-tuck games, but we are all brothers from the nation's different regions, which comes before anything else," Tan added. "I'm really looking forward to seeing everyone again next time."

                    Traditional oil and gas companies expected to enter market
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                With the fast growth in China's new energy vehicle industry, it is inevitable that traditional oil and gas companies will enter the charging market, industry experts said.An arm of Sinopec in Hainan province announced on Aug 13 it had built 40 charging piles in eight highway service stations and its 10 oil stations in urban areas of Haikou and Sanya cities.The charging piles, designed to be able to provide charging and parking services for 80 electric vehicles at the same time, are expected to meet fast charging demand from commercial EVs such as electric buses and online ride-hailing electric cars, as well as private EVs, the company said in a news release.It will later build integrated energy supply stations offering oil and gas refueling, EV recharging, and hydrogen refueling at suitable places across the province, starting in Haikou, the company said.Liu Yongdong, director of the center of standardization under the China Electricity Council, said it is natural for traditional energy companies to enter the new energy sector, as end terminal use of energy is relying less on oil and more on electricity generated from new energy sources."As the EV charging market matures with clear business models and increased profitability, it is highly possible that the top three Chinese oil and gas companies - PetroChina, Sinopec and CNOOC Ltd - will alter their oil and gas stations to include more charging piles," Liu said.So far, their attempts to tap the EV charging market have been limited, mainly due to lower profitability in the area compared to their traditional oil and gas services, Liu explained.Liu also said the three companies had the potential to be competitive operators in the charging market compared with existing service providers, because they have ample low-cost land resources, which could significantly reduce their charging pile operating costs, especially in downtown areas of cities and highway service stations.Qiu Kaijun, an industry observer and founder of Evobserver, an influential social media platform in the NEV industry, said traditional energy companies have noticed the promising future of the charging market, and it is only a matter of time before they invest more in the sector.The new energy branch of CNOOC is a shareholder in Potevio New Energy Co Ltd, one of the oldest and most successful players in China's charging market, he added.Liu said despite the competitive advantages traditional energy companies have, such as from funds and loans, they are less sensitive to subtle changes in the charging market than existing service providers.Besides, established players have a firm grip on their share of the market, and it is difficult for newcomers to shake it up, he said.

                    Austrian Sinologist lauds old wisdom as good for the world

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                VIENNA - A senior Austrian Sinologist believes that Chinese wisdom can contribute to the world's harmonious development and calls for solidarity in the face of the numerous problems facing the world. He also points out that young people are a great force in the cause. "China has thousands of years of history which includes miscellaneous schools of thought, such as Confucianism, Taoism and Mohism," says Richard Trappl, director of the Confucius Institute at the University of Vienna. "The rich wisdom and lessons found among them can make important contributions to the future of China and the whole world." Educational exchanges involving more Chinese students "coming out" and more international students "going in", he says, are contributing a lot in cultivating an international spirit among the younger generation, and a keener sense of global responsibility.

                    Boeing ups its forecast for China market
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Boeing Co has raised its forecast for China, saying that over the next 20 years, Chinese carriers will need 8,090 new airplanes, worth nearly $1.3 trillion based on list prices, to meet fast-growing airplane passenger traffic in the country, especially rapid rising demand from second-tier cities.China's air travel passenger traffic is expected to grow at 6 percent annually in the next 20 years, higher than Southeast Asia, Europe and North America, the US aircraft manufacturer announced in its latest forecast in Beijing on Tuesday."China is one of the world's most exciting and dynamic markets, it became our largest market last year," said Randy Tinseth, vice-president of commercial marketing at Boeing."An expanding middle-income group, significant investment in infrastructure, and advanced technologies that make airplanes more capable and efficient, continue to drive tremendous demand for air travel," he said.By 2023, another eight airports nationwide will finish construction, including the upcoming Beijing Daxing International Airport, and other new airports in Dalian, Qingdao, Xiamen and Chengdu.Chinese carriers have rapidly expanded their flight networks. In the past five years, the compounded annual growth rate of the flights that connect second-tier cities stood at 11.3 percent, much higher than the number of flights that connect major hubs and smaller cities, Boeing said.For long-haul international flights, the annual growth rate of flights in the past five years was 35 percent for second-tier cities. Now, Chinese mainland carriers operate 132 direct international flights, accounting for 65 percent of the global market."Many Chinese airlines would like to launch new flights to major hubs, but flight times available are quite tight and it is difficult to apply for flying rights. For example, Hainan Airlines launched a large number of international long-haul flights that connect major domestic cities and smaller overseas cities, or second-tier Chinese cities and major foreign cities in the past few years," said Lin Zhijie, a civil aviation industry analyst.In the next two decades, Boeing predicted China would need 5,960 new single-aisle airplanes, representing 74 percent of total global deliveries. Demand for wide-body airplanes is 1,780, which will triple the country's current fleet size. In addition, China will need a significant number of regional aircraft and cargo aircraft.Meanwhile, Tinseth said the B737 MAX, which has been grounded worldwide after two fatal crashes since March, is expected to resume flights in the early fourth quarter, but the final decision will depend on the US Federal Aviation Administration.

                    New research hospital to improve medical facilities in Hainan
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Construction of a research hospital, covering more than 70,000 square meters, will soon get started in the Boao Lecheng International Medical Tourism Pilot Zone by the end of the year as an effort to boost the pilot zone in South China's Hainan province, a senior official said on Tuesday.The remarks came one day after the introduction of an implementation plan to support the development of the Boao Lecheng International Medical Tourism Pilot Zone which was released by four government departments, including the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Health Commission.The implementation plan was an upgraded version of a guideline issued by the State Council in 2013 when it approved the establishment of the zone.This included a series of key policies such as allowing medical institutions in the zone to import and use badly needed drugs and medical equipment from overseas that are not yet approved by the top drug authority in China, Hainan Governor Shen Xiaoming said at a news briefing organized by the State Council Information Office on Monday in Beijing.Gu Gang, head of the administrative bureau of the pilot zone, said in the policy promotion conference on Tuesday that in the next stage, Boao Lecheng will take the lead in implementing the pilot free trade zone's policies, build a medical big data platform, offer the best auxiliary facilities for enterprises, and provide one-stop services for approving and registering projects in the pilot zone.Gu said the research hospital would collect real world evidence - clinical data from patients who had actually used the imported drugs and medical equipment introduced in the pilot zone. The collected RWE can be used for the registration process of imported drugs - already approved by its country of origin - in China.Yin Qiman, vice-president of Regulatory Affairs at Johnson& Johnson Medical China Ltd, said collecting RWE in the Boao Lecheng pilot zone is vitally important for both patients and pharmaceutical enterprises."Chinese patients are able to get access to the most advanced treatment simultaneously with patients from overseas. For enterprises, RWE can cut both the time and cost for clinical trials to a great extent, and accelerate the registration process of imported drugs and medical instruments," Yin said.She noted that for regulating institutions, the introduction of RWE expands the range and level of their supervision.Gu said that after six years of development, there are now 16 projects under construction in the pilot zone, and nine medical institutions are in the test phase or already operating there.The industrial outfits in the pilot zone cover fields such as cancer prevention, reproductive preparation, plastic surgery, anti-aging, stem cell research, health management and rehabilitation."We welcome all excellent projects to the pilot zone, and we are looking forward to seeing all kinds of advanced technologies and scientific innovations land here," said Han Yingwei, director of Hainan provincial health commission.The administrative bureau of the pilot zone said the round of investment promotion is open to international hospitals, international health management institutions, third-party testing institutions, medical colleges, national key laboratories, pension insurance companies, and medical tourism institutions among others.
