                UN rights chief appalled by conditions of migrants, refugees in detention in US
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                GENEVA -- UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said on Monday she was appalled by the conditions in which migrants and refugees, children and adults, are held in detention in the United States after crossing the southern border.She referred to a "disturbing report" by the US Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General on the conditions in migrant centers along the southern border and urged the authorities to find non-custodial alternatives for migrant and refugee children - and adults."As a pediatrician, but also as a mother and a former head of State, I am deeply shocked that children are forced to sleep on the floor in overcrowded facilities, without access to adequate healthcare or food, and with poor sanitation conditions," she said.She stressed in a statement here that children should never be held in immigration detention or separated from their families.The UN right chief stated that several UN human rights bodies have found that the detention of migrant children may constitute cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment that is prohibited by international law."Detaining a child even for short periods under good conditions can have a serious impact on their health and development - consider the damage being done every day by allowing this alarming situation to continue," Bachelet said.The High Commissioner said immigration detention is never in the best interests of a child."Any deprivation of liberty of adult migrants and refugees should be a measure of last resort," she said.If detention does take place, the High Commissioner emphasized it should be for the shortest period, with due process safeguards and in conditions that fully meet all relevant international human rights standards."States do have the sovereign prerogative to decide on the conditions of entry and stay of foreign nationals. But clearly, border management measures must comply with the State's human rights obligations and should not be based on narrow policies aimed only at detecting, detaining and expeditiously deporting irregular migrants," she added.In most cases, Bachelet noted, the migrants and refugees had embarked on perilous journeys with their children in search of protection and dignity and away from violence and hunger.The UN Human Rights Office's presences in Mexico and Central America also said they have documented numerous human rights violations and abuses against migrants and refugees in transit, including the excessive use of force, arbitrary deprivation of liberty, family separation, denial of access to services, refoulement, and arbitrary expulsions.

                CARACAS, Venezuela - Caracas and other parts of Venezuela on Monday were hit by a massive power cut that the government blamed on an "electromagnetic attack". The lights went out in most of Caracas at 4:41 pm while people in other parts of the country took to social media to report their own power outages. "The first indications received from the investigation ... point to the existence of an electromagnetic attack that sought to affect the hydroelectric generation system of Guayana," Venezuelan Communication Minister Jorge Rodriguez said in a statement on state television.

                    Venezuela calls Trump executive order 'new, serious attack'
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                CARACAS - Venezuela on Tuesday called a White House decision to freeze all Venezuelan state assets in the United States "a new and serious attack."The new sanction imposed by the Donald Trump administration is the latest in a series of "arbitrary measures of economic terrorism against the Venezuelan people," the Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement."Washington has issued another executive order that aims to formalize the criminal economic, financial and trade embargo already underway, which has caused severe harm to Venezuelan society in recent years," the ministry said."The ruling elite in the United States aim to grant legal status to the embargo of all assets and properties belonging to the Venezuelan state," the ministry added.Trump issued the executive order on Monday, announcing "all property and interests in property of the government of Venezuela that are in the United States... are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt with".Instead of supporting the ongoing conciliation process between Venezuela's ruling socialist party and far-right opposition, Washington hopes the financial pressure will generate enough discontent to topple the government of President Nicolas Maduro, said the ministry."Through its renewed interventionist measures, it is clear that the US government and its allies are betting on the failure of the political dialogue in Venezuela," the ministry said.The government pledged to continue to pursue talks with the opposition, regardless of the sanctions.Maduro "ratifies his call for unity" among all Venezuelan sectors "to confront this new phase of economic and political terrorism," said the ministry, adding the executive order is in "violation of the principles ... of the United Nations Charter".

                Venezuela's government will skip a round of Norway-brokered talks on Thursday and Friday to protest a new set of US sanctions against the country, the Venezuelan Information Ministry said on Wednesday.US President Donald Trump on Monday imposed a freeze on Venezuelan government assets in the United States and blocked US citizens from conducting business with Maduro's government.Maduro's government said its delegation was withdrawing from the round of talks in Barbados aimed at resolving Venezuela's political crisis with allies of opposition leader Juan Guaido."President Nicolas Maduro has decided not to send the Venezuelan delegation to this opportunity due to the severe and brutal aggression perpetrated continuously and insidiously by the Trump administration against Venezuela," said Jorge Rodriguez, head of the government delegation to the talks, in a statement published on Wednesday night."Venezuela is willing to review the mechanisms of this process such that its continuation is effective and in tune with the interests of the people," Venezuela's Information Ministry said in a statement.China on Thursday expressed resolute opposition to US gross interference in Venezuela's internal affairs, urging Washington to immediately stop the bullying behavior of wantonly suppressing another country."We have to point out that which political party rules a country is a domestic issue and should be decided by its people," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in an online statement.Her remarks came after Trump's sanctions on Monday. On Tuesday, US National Security Adviser John Bolton warned China and Russia not to support Maduro.Noting cooperation between China and Venezuela has been conducted with equality, mutual benefit, win-win results and market principles, Hua said the legitimate cooperation has delivered benefits to the two countries and peoples, and it enjoys no interference from others.On Wednesday, thousands of supporters of Maduro took to the streets in Venezuela's capital city of Caracas to protest against US sanctions.Carrying the national flag and holding anti-US slogans, demonstrators gathered at the city center to listen to government officials speak.The new sanctions imposed by the US administration is the latest in a series of "arbitrary measures of economic terrorism against the Venezuelan people", the Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Ministry said. It added that Washington wants to "formalize its criminal economic, financial and trade embargoes".Wednesday's rally was also a commemoration to mark the bicentennial of the historic Battle of Boyaca, which is considered the beginning of the independence of North of South America.During the rally at the National Pantheon in Caracas, Diosdado Cabello, vice-president of Maduro's United Socialist Party of Venezuela, condemned the sanctions, saying that the US move against Venezuela "makes us more united and deepens our love for the country"."The United States is absolutely mistaken," Cabello told the crowd.Zhou Jin in Beijing, Reuters and Xinhua contributed to this story.

                    Venezuela organizes anti-Trump signature drive
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                CARACAS - A nationwide anti-Trump signature drive took place in Venezuela over the weekend to protest the stepped-up US sanctions, a government source said on Sunday.Called "No more Trump," the drive kicked off on Saturday with the signatures of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, and continued on Sunday at central squares around the country, including the capital city of Caracas."We agreed that at every main square in our country ... there will be a signature drive," said Dario Vivas, vice president of events and mobilizations for the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela.The campaign serves to condemn the latest White House measures to further cut off the Venezuelan government's access to capital in a bid to oust Maduro from power.US President Donald Trump issued an executive order that freezes all Venezuelan state assets in the United States on Aug 5.Esteban Franco, a Caracas resident who signed the petition, said the campaign was to send the message that the US sanctions "are not doing harm to the president, but are harming our entire population.""I came to sign for the benefit of my country and against the measures they are implementing," said Franco.The government hopes to gather some 13 million signatures to back a manifesto it plans to present in September to the 74th session of General Assembly of the United Nations.
