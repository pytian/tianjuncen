                Fukushima nuclear plant out of space for radioactive water
            </p>
            <p>
                TOKYO — The utility company operating Fukushima's tsunami-devastated nuclear power plant said Friday it will run out of space to store massive amounts of contaminated water in three years, adding pressure on the government and the public to reach a consensus on what to do with it.Three reactors at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant suffered meltdowns in a massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northeastern Japan.Radioactive water has leaked from the damaged reactors and mixed with groundwater and rainwater at the plant. The water is treated but remains slightly radioactive and is stored in large tanks.The plant has accumulated more than 1 million tons of water in nearly 1,000 tanks. Its operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., says it plans to build more tanks but can accommodate only up to 1.37 million tons, which it will reach in the summer of 2022.What to do after that is a big question.Nearly 8 1/2 years since the accident, officials have yet to agree on what to do with the radioactive water. A government-commissioned panel has picked five alternatives, including the controlled release of the water into the Pacific Ocean, which nuclear experts, including members of the International Atomic Energy Agency, say is the only realistic option. Fishermen and residents, however, strongly oppose the proposal, saying the release would be suicide for Fukushima's fishing and agriculture.Experts say the tanks pose flooding and radiation risks and hamper decommissioning efforts at the plant. TEPCO and government officials plan to start removing the melted fuel in 2021, and want to free up part of the complex currently occupied with tanks to build safe storage facilities for melted debris and other contaminants that will come out.In addition to four other options including underground injection and vaporization, the panel on Friday added long-term storage as a sixth option to consider.Several members of the panel urged TEPCO to consider securing additional land to build more tanks in case a consensus cannot be reached relatively soon.TEPCO spokesman Junichi Matsumoto said contaminants from the decommissioning work should stay in the plant complex. He said long-term storage would gradually reduce the radiation because of its half-life, but would delay decommissioning work because the necessary facilities cannot be built until the tanks are removed.Matsumoto declined to specify the deadline for a decision on what to do with the water, but said he hopes to see the government lead public debate.Some experts, however, said the priority should be the feelings of the residents, not the progress of decommissioning."When we talk about Fukushima's reconstruction, the question is if we should prioritize the decommissioning at the expense of Fukushima people's lives," said Naoya Sekiya, a University of Tokyo professor of disaster social science. "The issue is not just about science."AP

                Fukushima 'ice wall' nearly done but doubts linger
            </a>
            <p>
                TOKYO - Fukushima's operator on Tuesday started freezing the last section of a $320 million ice wall designed to combat widespread water contamination at the site of the worst nuclear accident in a generation. Tokyo Electric Power began pumping coolant into the remaining 7 meters of its 1.5-kilometer underground wall, which encircles the four reactors along Japan's northeast coast. Underground pipes circulate the coolant and freeze soil around the buildings. The 30-meter deep wall is designed to block underground water from nearby mountains from flowing into the shattered complex and then seeping into the Pacific. It is reportedly expected to take more than two months until the wall is completely frozen. The huge utility has been building the barrier since March 2016 with the government picking up its 34.5 billion yen ($320 million) price tag. Even now, with the ice wall almost complete, about 140 tons of underground water flows into the plant daily, forcing the company to pump it out and store it in on-site tanks. "When the ice wall is completed, we estimate that the amount of underground water flowing into the complex will be less than 100 tons," a company spokesman said. But some experts have cast doubt on the ice wall, and the country's Nuclear Regulation Authority said it has not yet done an independent analysis. "We doubt the ice wall is going to be as effective as TEPCO claims it will be," said an NRA official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We're going to monitor its progress after it is finished to check the impact." In June, the NRA's acting chief Toyoshi Fuketa publicly accused TEPCO of lying about the wall's effectiveness. The same month, three former company executives went on trial, facing the only criminal charges laid in the accident. On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.0 undersea earthquake off Japan's northeastern coast sparked a massive tsunami that destroyed entire towns and villages along the Pacific shore, leaving nearly 18,500 people dead or missing. The huge flow of water overwhelmed cooling systems at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, about 220 km northeast of Tokyo, causing meltdowns in three reactors. Radiation spread over a wide area and forced tens of thousands of area residents to evacuate. Some may never be able to go home. Agence France-Presse (China Daily USA 08/23/2017 page10)

                Fukushima survivor submits evidence to UN over Japanese 'human rights abuses'
            </a>
            <p>
                GENEVA - A Japanese Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster survivor on Thursday submitted evidence of the "ongoing human rights abuses of Fukushima victims" to the UN Human Rights Council, a source with the Greenpeace Japan in Geneva said.Mitsuko Sonoda, the survivor, said she was forced to flee her home in order to protect her then 10-year-old son in the aftermath of the nuclear disaster in Fukushima on March 11, 2011. Since then, she and other mothers have been standing up to fight for themselves and their children."I want to tell the world we haven't had our human rights respected since the disaster. I don't want this to happen to anyone else in any other countries," said Mitsuko Sonoda."I know so many mothers who have been suffering and struggling as a result of the nuclear disaster, because the Japanese government and (the company) TEPCO won't admit to their responsibilities," she said.According to a statement released by the Greenpeace Japan in Geneva Thursday, despite residents' opposition and the fact that there are areas in Fukushima Prefecture that remain too contaminated for people to safely live, the Japanese government has moved forward with lifting evacuation orders and pushing for nuclear restarts.What's more, the statement said, evacuees from contaminated areas that were not under a mandatory evacuation order lost housing support in March of 2017, and in March 2018, former residents from those areas will lose what remains of their compensation."The Japanese Government's resettlement policies not only fail to meet obligations under multiple human rights treaties, but also clearly violate Japan's own domestic law regarding the treatment of people impacted by the nuclear disaster," said Kendra Ulrich, Senior Global Energy Campaigner for Greenpeace Japan."Although most Fukushima nuclear evacuees meet the criteria for consideration as Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), the Japanese government has refused to acknowledge them as such and ignored international frameworks for their protection," Ulrich added.The Fukushima disaster was the most significant nuclear incident since Russia's Chernobyl disaster on April 26, 1986.

                Fukushima told to compensate for suicide of 102-year-old
            </a>
            <p>
                TOKYO - A Japanese court on Tuesday ordered the operator of the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant to compensate relatives of a 102-year-old man who killed himself at the prospect of fleeing his home. The Fukushima District Court ordered Tokyo Electric Co to pay 15.2 million yen ($143,400) in damages to the family of Fumio Okubo, according to their attorney Yukio Yasuda. Okubo was the oldest resident of Iitate village, 40 kilometers from the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant on Japan's northeast coast, which sparked the world's worst atomic accident in a generation in 2011. He took his own life after the government ordered residents to flee in April 2011, a month after tsunami waves sent the plant's reactors into meltdown. "I lived a bit too long," he told his family soon after he learned of the government-ordered evacuation from a news report. The court acknowledged his suicide was linked to "strong stress" at the prospect that he would have to flee and his fear that he would be a burden to his family, the attorney said. "It is significant that the court recognised the eldest man in the village who would have lived out his final days in his homeland was hit by such a terrible tragedy," he said. The compensation ordered by the court was smaller than the 60 million yen the family had demanded, but they do not plan to appeal, he added. TEPCO said it would examine the latest ruling before it decides on its response The firm has already been told to pay damages over two other suicides involving former residents who killed themselves after fleeing their homes. Iitate was one of a number of areas the central government declared off-limits due to concerns at the effect of long-term exposure to radiation. The tsunami, triggered by a magnitude-9 earthquake on March 11, 2011, swamped the emergency power supplies at the Fukushima power plant, sending its reactors into meltdown as cooling systems failed. Many of the tens of thousands of people who evacuated their homes and farms are unlikely to return to their ancestral properties due to radiation dangers. While the quake and tsunami killed nearly 18,000 people, no one is officially recorded as having died as a direct result of the atomic catastrophe.

                Japanese pause to recall 'terrible' quake, tsunami
            </a>
            <p>
                As grieving families across Japan gathered on Monday to mark the eighth anniversary of the Great East Japan Earthquake, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the northeast coast and resulted in the world's second-worst nuclear disaster after Chernobyl, 15-year-old Toshiki Suzuki was among them.Together with the crowd in Ginza, Tokyo, one of the world's high-fashion centers, Suzuki pressed his hands firmly together and bowed his head for a moment of silence as a bell rang at 2:46 pm - the moment the offshore earthquake struck Japan on March 11, 2011, setting off a massive tsunami.Suzuki, who was living in Wakabayashi, Sendai in Miyagi prefecture at the time the earthquake occurred, does not remember his thoughts as he watched the first floor of his family house become flooded.But Suzuki does remember the sound of the tsunami warning siren and having to climb onto his grandfather's back on the way to the shelter, since he could not walk well in the mud."The disaster was terrible," Suzuki said. "But I think I am lucky to be here as a survivor."Japan's National Police Agency said that as of Friday, 15,897 people had been confirmed dead due to the disaster, with 2,533 others still missing.That takes the number of people who died because of the disaster to at least 22,131, including those who succumbed to health issues after evacuation, the police said.Meanwhile, a survey published by the nation's reconstruction agency in February showed that more than 51,000 people are still living elsewhere across the country as evacuees, and seven cities in Fukushima prefecture still have no-entry zones because of the nuclear leak.Not far from Ginza, at the National Theatre of Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, lawmakers and some of those who lost loved ones in the disaster held a national-commemoration ceremony."We can't help but feel sorrow when we think about the suffering of those who lost beloved family members, relatives and friends," Abe was quoted by Agence France-Presse as saying. "We will provide unbreaking support (for evacuees) to rebuild their lives and accelerate the reconstruction work."However, a 38-year-old woman who wanted to be identified only as Akiko said the government's efforts have not been sufficient."The government stopped my housing subsidy last year, and I am having a hard time to fight for a living with my children in Tokyo," Akiko said.Japan has urged people who fled the Fukushima nuclear disaster to return home after a decontamination program that involved removing radioactive topsoil and cleaning affected areas. However, a February poll conducted by the newspaper Asahi Shimbun found that 60 percent of Fukushima residents still felt anxious about radiation."The government is not convincing enough in proving the area is safe," Akiko said, "I am still worried but the government is not helping us."The tsunami triggered the melt-down of three reactors of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and the release of radioactive material. Decommissioning the plant could take up to 40 years and cost at least $192 billion.Just last month, Tokyo Electric Power Co, the plant operator, made the first contact with the melted fuel using a remote probe.TEPCO said it hopes to start removing debris from the reactors as early as 2021.Meanwhile, space is running out for storage of the coolant water, which is contaminated after being poured over the debris.

                TOKYO — The operator of the tsunami-wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant has begun removing fuel from a cooling pool at one of three reactors that melted down in the 2011 disaster, a milestone in the decades-long process to decommission the plant.Tokyo Electric Power Co. said Monday that workers started removing the first of 566 used and unused fuel units stored in the pool at Unit 3. The fuel units in the pool located high up in reactor buildings are intact despite the disaster, but the pools are not enclosed, so removing the units to safer ground is crucial to avoid disaster in case of another major quake.TEPCO says the removal at Unit 3 would take two years, followed by the two other reactors where about 1,000 fuel units remain in the storage pools.Removing fuel units from the cooling pools comes ahead of the real challenge of removing melted fuel from inside the reactors, but details of how that might be done are still largely unknown. Removing the fuel in the cooling pools was delayed five years by mishaps, high radiation and radioactive debris from an explosion that occurred at the time of the reactor meltdown, underscoring the difficulties that remain.Workers are remotely operating a crane built underneath a jelly roll-shaped roof cover to raise the fuel from a storage rack in the pool and place it into a protective cask. The whole process occurs underwater to prevent radiation leaks. Each cask will be filled with seven fuel units, then lifted from the pool and lowered to a truck that will transport the cask to a safer cooling pool elsewhere at the plant.The work is carried out remotely from a control room about 500 meters (yards) away because of still-high radiation levels inside the reactor building that houses the pool.About an hour after the work began Monday, the first fuel unit was safely stored inside the cask, TEPCO said.In 2014, TEPCO safely removed all 1,535 fuel units from the storage pool at a fourth reactor that was idle and had no fuel inside its core when the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami occurred.Robotic probes have photographed and detected traces of damaged nuclear fuel in the three reactors that had meltdowns, but the exact location and other details of the melted fuel are largely unknown. Removing fuel from the cooling pools will help free up space for the subsequent removal of the melted fuel, though details of how to gain access to it are yet to be decided.Experts say the melted fuel in the three reactors amounts to more than 800 tons.In February, a remote-controlled robot with tongs removed pebbles of nuclear debris from the Unit 2 reactor but was unable to remove larger chunks, indicating a robot would need to be developed that can break the chunks into smaller pieces. Toshiba Corp.'s energy systems unit, which developed the robot, said the findings were key to determining the proper equipment and technologies needed to remove the melted fuel, the most challenging part of the decommissioning expected to take decades.TEPCO and government officials plan to determine methods for removing the melted fuel from each of the three damaged reactors later this year so they can begin the process in 2021.AP

                Fuel rods removed from Japan Fukushima power plant
            </a>
            <p>
                TOKYO - The operator of Japan's crippled Fukushima power plant on Monday began removing atomic fuel from inside a building housing one of the reactors that melted down in 2011.The delicate operation represents the first time the Tokyo Electric Power Co, or TEPCO, has pulled out fuel rods from inside a highly contaminated building containing the melted-down reactor, and comes four years behind schedule.Due to high radiation levels, technicians used remote-controlled equipment to haul fuel from a "storage pool" inside the building.Operations were briefly suspended on Monday afternoon after a problem with the equipment removing the fuel, but resumed shortly afterward."We finally started this work. We will spend two years removing 566 units of fuel from reactor three," said Takahiro Kimoto, a TEPCO spokesman.TEPCO removed four units as planned on Monday, with workers continuing to remove debris that have fallen inside the pool and other areas, Kimoto told reporters."Factors such as removal of debris and various troubles have caused delays, which we realize have caused significant worries to people in the region and others," Kimoto said."Putting safety as our priority, we will carefully continue this work," he promised.Engineers have had to contend with clearing earthquake debris inside the building and an array of other technical challenges, said TEPCO spokeswoman Yuka Matsubara."We had to proceed carefully (to remove debris), and we needed to take measures as dust would waft up and increase radiation readings," she said.TEPCO engineers will not yet attempt to extract molten nuclear fuel that remains deep inside the mangled reactor. This is considered the most difficult part of the massive cleanup operation and is not expected to begin until 2021.Reconstruction plan In February, TEPCO sent a remote-controlled probe to pick up pebble-sized pieces of the melted fuel in a bid to find out whether the material could be moved.The next step in that painstaking process will be to remove some of the fuel as a sample, which is scheduled to happen by March 2020.The company also faces other difficult challenges, including working out how to dispose of large quantities of contaminated water stored in containers at the plant site.In the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986, reactors one, two and three at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant melted down after a deadly earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in 2011.The tsunami killed around 18,000 people and caused widespread devastation, and the nuclear meltdown forced the evacuation of areas near the plant.Reactors four through six were offline at the time of the disaster for inspections and did not suffer meltdowns, though reactor four was damaged by an explosion in the days after the tsunami.In December 2014, TEPCO finished removing all 1,535 units of nuclear fuel kept inside the storage pool at reactor four.Agence France-Presse

                Japan to suspend operations at nuclear plants if deadline for anti-terrorism measures missed
            </a>
            <p>
                TOKYO -- Japan's nuclear watchdog on Wednesday denied requests from power companies to extend deadlines for them to complete steps to install measures to protect against terrorism at their nuclear facilities.The Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) said it would suspend the operations at plants that have not fulfilled anti-terrorism measures instituted in 2013 under stricter operational guidelines after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear crisis.Under the guidelines, the operators of nuclear power plants are required to build facilities to safeguard against terrorist attacks, such as standby control rooms so that reactors can still be controlled remotely even in the event of a plane being flown into a plant.This is in order to prevent the recurrence of the massive amounts of radioactive material that was released into the air, ground and sea following Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) losing control of key cooling and backup functions at the Fukushima Daichi nuclear facility, leading to core meltdowns in reactors after the plant was hit by an earthquake-triggered tsunami.The ongoing crisis at the plant remains the worst nuclear crisis in the world since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.The operators, under the new post-Fukushima guidelines, were given within five years to make the counter terrorism upgrades after their reactors cleared safety inspections and were brought back online.But three power companies, Kyushu Electric, Kansai Electric and Shikoku Electric, said they need more time to implement the anti-terrorism changes at the five plants they collectively operate in western and southwestern Japan.Seven reactors at four of the plants have already cleared the preliminary safety inspections and have been brought back online.The power companies have said, however, that they will need between one and two-and-a-half years to complete the required upgrades, with the No. 1 reactor of the Sendai power plant in Kagoshima Prefecture facing the earliest suspension if the necessary work is not completed by March 2020.The NRA has said it will listen to the operators' opinions and evaluate alternative measures the utilities have or will be implementing in terms of defending against possible acts of terrorism.NRA Chairman Toyoshi Fuketa, however, has made it ardently clear that the agency will not allow nuclear facilities to stay online if they do not meet the anti-terrorist requirements stipulated in the guidelines implemented in 2013.

                Japan's Tepco may mothball reactors at world's biggest nuke plant
            </a>
            <p>
                TOKYO - Tokyo Electric Power said on Monday it may start to decommission at least one nuclear reactor at its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa power plant, the world's biggest nuclear plant by capacity, within five years of restarting two of the reactors at the site.Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) President Tomoaki Kobayakawa made the decommissioning comments in a statement outlining its response to a request for plans on the station's future by the government of the city of Kashiwazaki in Niigata prefecture, where the plant is located.In 2017, Tepco received initial regulatory approval from the Japanese government to restart the No 6 and No 7 reactors at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, each with a capacity of 1,356 megawatts (MW). The plant site has seven reactors with a total capacity of 8,212 MW, equal to 20 percent of Japan's nuclear capacity.The facility is Tepco's last remaining nuclear plant after it announced plans to shut its Fukushima Daini station, nearby the Fukushima Daichi station where a massive earthquake and tsunami caused the meltdown of three of the site's reactors in 2011.Kashiwazaki's Mayor Masahiro Sakurai demanded in 2017 that Tepco submit plans to shut at least one of the No 1 to No 5 reactors in return for approval of the restart of reactors No 6 and No 7, a city official told Reuters by phone on Monday. The Kashiwazaki Mayor will take about month to evaluate Tepco's plan, the official said.Tepco said on Friday that Kobayakawa would brief local officials on Monday about its answers to the city's request.Tepco may take steps to decommission more than one of the No 1 to No 5 reactors within 5 years after the restart of the No 6 and No 7 reactors if its is confident it can secure enough non-fossil fuel energy sources, according to the statement.A Tepco official said on Monday the company is targeting having renewable and nuclear power produce 44 percent of total generation by 2030.Tepco has been trying to convince local authorities near Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, who have sign-off rights on nuclear restarts, that it has overcome operational failings revealed at Fukushima.Reuters
