                Chinese firms lead e-payment drive in region
            </p>
            <p>
                Tech giants like JD, Alibaba help build cashless society in Southeast AsiaChinese financial technology companies are beefing up their presence in the digital payment sector of Southeast Asia to help build a cashless society, fueled by the rapidly growing demand for e-payment from people in the region.Central JD Fintech Holding, a joint venture owned by Chinese fintech company JD Digits and Central Group, Thailand's largest retailer, rolled out a financial services app to promote e-wallet services in Thailand.The e-wallet app Dolfin can support eKYC or electronic Know Your Customer technology for verifying user identities during the registration process. It features money transfers, payments and other digital wallet functions, JD Digits said in a statement.Online credit, digital wealth management, online insurance, digital marketing and other functions will be offered through the app. Nearly 3,000 offline retail outlets, including department stores, supermarkets, and the Family Mart convenience stores owned by the Central Group, will start to support Dolfin payment.Dolfin also supports JD Central, a Thai online retail platform jointly created by JD and Central Group. The app provides artificial intelligence and big data analytics precision marketing services to merchants so they can understand consumer behavior and preferences, helping reduce management costs and improve operational efficiency.Global consulting firm Ernst and Young said Thailand has the market and potential to become a fintech hub in Southeast Asia due to its large unbanked population which has high rates of mobile usage, internet penetration, and strong macroeconomic growth.JD Digits has accelerated its global expansion by going into overseas markets such as Thailand and Indonesia. It first entered the Thai market in 2017 in cooperation with Central Group to start a joint venture serving Thailand's fintech market.Other Chinese fintech companies have jumped onto the mobile payments bandwagon to tap the Southeast Asia market. Ant Financial Services Group, the company behind the popular payment app Alipay, acquired Singaporean payment service helloPay Group. It also invested in Ascend Money in Thailand and digital financial company Mynt in the Philippines.Tencent's WeChat Pay, another popular payments app, launched its e-wallet in Malaysia. It also offers e-payment services for Thai sellers."The demand for fintech services and technologies is very high in Southeast Asian countries. The number of Chinese tourists visiting these countries is also increasing and this has given a boost to the development of digital payments," said Wang Pengbo, an analyst at Beijing-based consultancy Analysys.He added compared with Europe and the United States, financial infrastructure is relatively inadequate in Southeast Asia, providing promising opportunities for Chinese companies.He noted China has now become a leading exporter of mobile payment technologies."China's mobile payment is leading the world in both market size and user numbers and Chinese mobile payment companies have stepped up efforts to expand their presence in overseas markets,"Wang said.

                AI drives evolution of China-ASEAN Free Trade Area
            </a>
            <p>
                NANNING - Attendees at the recent China-ASEAN AI Summit said artificial intelligence is a driving force to promote better development of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area. China has maintained its position as the largest trading partner of ASEAN for 10 consecutive years. And in the first half of 2019, ASEAN became China's second largest trading partner for the first time, with the bilateral trade volumes reaching $291.85 billion, a rise of 4.2 percent year-on-year. This robust trade has benefited from the wide application of AI technology. For example, the owner of a chain of outlets selling fresh melons in Zhengzhou, Central China's Henan province, can directly track the growth of its produce, the brand and dosage of the pesticides used in the orchards in Thailand, through the use of cameras installed there.

                China chamber heads calls for more Sino-US cooperation
            </a>
            <p>
                The United States and China must work together to advance mutual interests and, more importantly, to promote world stability and prosperity, Xu Chen, chairman of China General Chamber of Commerce-USA (CGCC), said Tuesday at the Vison China forum in New York.By working together and sharing "state social responsibilities", the world's two largest economies can promote growth in the context of a "community of shared future", he said at the event held at the Asia Society and co-hosted by China Daily and the CGCC.Xu disagreed with those who argue that China's growing economic strength poses a threat to the US and therefore should be contained."China's remarkable growth has offered great opportunities to the US, for China is now capable of sharing more ‘social responsibilities' on the world stage and has become a stronger partner for the US," he said. "Our two countries can take the world's challenges and risks and contribute more to global economic growth, political stability and social progress."Xu said China stood with the US during financial crises, benefiting both nations and the world.In 1997, the Thai baht fell sharply and financial markets in Japan and Hong Kong were threatened with collapse. The Japanese yen fell to about 150-to-1 against the US dollar and that threatened other economies in the region. Had the Chinese yuan depreciated as sharply as the yen, the global economy probably would have fallen into recession, he said."China withstood the pressure of depreciation and even narrowed the floating range of the yuan against the US dollar," Xu said. "China's move helped East Asian countries stabilize financially and avoided the spillover of a current crisis."The result, he said, was that the US and European economies escaped major fallout from the Asian crisis.In 2008, the collapse of the subprime mortgage market hammered the US economy and the Federal Reserve adopted Quantitative Easing to avoid a looming liquidity crisis, a problem China did not face, he explained."China had every reason not to echo America's easy monetary policy," Xu said. "At that crucial time, China worked in concert with the quantitative easing measures of the United States by adopting a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent and moderately easing monetary policy from the standpoint of maintaining a stable global economic ecosystem."Cooperation between the world's economic giants helped to stabilize the world's economy while "vicious competition" would have deepened the crisis and damaged both nations, he said.Citing a pertinent Chinese saying that "No eggs could stay intact under an overturned nest", Xu said no one would have benefited from confrontation rather than cooperation during past financial crises."If China and the US see each other as a threat and refuse to work with each other, to the degree as the extremist voices had wished, then whoever is the winner, the downfall of the global economy would be the ‘overturned nest' where no single country in the world would escape," he said.Xu concluded, "I believe that China will gladly work hand-in-hand with the US and jointly promote a more peaceful, stable and prosperous global economy."

                Thai PM floats idea of moving capital to prevent overcrowding
            </a>
            <p>
                BANGKOK - Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said on Wednesday that moving the capital is a possibility to prevent overcrowding.At a seminar entitled "Connecting Thailand with the World" in Bangkok, Prayut cited two possibilities in moving the capital."The first is to find a city that's neither too far nor too expensive to move to," said Prayut. "The second is to de-centralize the urban area to outer Bangkok to reduce crowding."Prayut said that the second approach could contribute to Bangkok preserving its key landmarks, while the government and business facilities could be relocated to the city's perimeter.The second approach would reduce the need for so many people to travel in and out of the city center, thus easing traffic jams, said Prayut.Moving the capital is just an idea and would require extensive research as to the economic and social impacts but it is a possibility under his administration, Prayut said."The Past governments were never able to pull this off, fearing it would cause irreparable conflict in society," Prayut said. "The first priority now is to establish mutual understanding among the people to ensure that the people and the government agree to similar issues."
