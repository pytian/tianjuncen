            <p class="style-content">
                During the China-Africa Water Forum held in July in Windhoek, Namibia, the Chinese ambassador to Namibia noted the importance to Africa of having a partnership in overcoming its persistent water shortages.Indeed, resolving the water crisis in Africa is part of the Beijing Action Plan (2019-21) under the umbrella of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.The plan outlines measures to build and develop a China-Africa Research Center for cooperation in scientific research and training of professionals in water-related disciplines geared toward treatment and production of clean and safe drinking water. The program aims at research and dissemination of knowledge in creation of artificial rainfall, desalination, rainwater purification, water recycling, and water-saving irrigation technologies, among others.The United Nations World Water Development Report 2019 estimates that more than 2 billion people worldwide lack access to safe and clean water. In 2010, the UN General Assembly resolved that inability to get safe and clean drinking water and sanitation is part of the growing body of human rights concerns, and therefore countries have an obligation to try to achieve "universal access to water and sanitation for all, without discrimination".Despite this resolution and adoption of the UN's 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, many countries have not met the objective of reducing the number of people living without adequate clean water and sanitation. In 2015, individuals living without clean and safe water stood at 2.1 billion, more than a half being in sub-Saharan Africa, where only 24 percent of the population have access to the vital resource. Similarly, UNICEF established that nearly 500 children die each day in sub-Saharan Africa due to lack of access to universal sanitation and clean water, and that West and Central Africa needed about $30 billion annually to meet the universal requirements for water.The water shortage has hit South Africa hard, especially Cape Town, where rationing was adopted to prevent the city from completely running out of water. Water rationing is common in numerous cities across Africa, including Nairobi, Kenya; Accra, Ghana; Bulawayo and Harare, Zimbabwe; and Mapu-to, Mozambique.To overcome water shortages, the African Development Bank projected that the continent will need $66 billion per year to build adequate dams, pipelines, pumping stations and purification plants.China offers an opportunity for an exchange of ideas that would help Africa overcome its water problem. For instance, in 2011, China had the capacity to desalinate about 600,000 metric tons of water per day and is projected to push the figure to about 3 million tons of desalinated water a day by 2020.In the Horn of Africa, China funded a cross-border water project between Ethiopia and Djibouti. The project involved the drilling of wells and reservoirs and the installation of pipeline.The importance of water as a resource is not limited to sanitation and drinking, since it is crucial to many activities, including agriculture, electric power production, transportation and mining.In Uganda, China International Water and Electricity Corp built a dam costing $568 million. The Isimba Hydropower Dam was launched in March and is expected to add 184 megawatts to the national grid. China is also financing Karuma Hydropower, a 600-MW dam costing $2 billion in northern Uganda.It is important that more African countries take the opportunity offered by China and create a cooperative environment through which ideas can be shared and implemented. The scope of cooperation should also focus on areas such as energy and food security, which require water as a key input.The author is a senior policy analyst at the Africa Policy Institute in Nairobi, Kenya.

                    AIIB expands membership to 100 in three years
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                LUXEMBOURG - The three-year-old Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) on Saturday further expanded its membership to 100 with the approval of the African newcomers of Benin, Djibouti and Rwanda.The decision was made unanimously by AIIB's Board of Governors at its fourth annual meeting held in Luxembourg.The three prospective non-regional members will officially join the AIIB once they complete the required domestic processes and deposit the first capital installment with the bank.In the meantime, the bank's meeting elected Chinese Finance Minister Liu Kun as chairman of the board.With its approved membership increasing to 100, and the volume of approved financing expanding to $8.5 billion, the AIIB has become an important member of multilateral development system, said Liu at the bank's annual meeting.The China-initiated multilateral financial institution began operation in January 2016 with 57 founding members, with an agenda focused on supporting sustainable development through infrastructure and other productive sectors in Asia and beyond.Lauding the progress the AIIB has made over the last three years, Liu said that the AIIB has been granted permanent observer status by the United Nations General Assembly, issued its first U.S.-dollar-denominated global bond, as well as developed a series of important strategies and policies."AIIB members collectively account for 78 percent of the world's population and 63 percent of global GDP. With the backing of all of our members, we are building a lean, clean, and green institution that can help to support their sustainable development,"said AIIB President Jin Liqun.On the bank's continuous enlargement, AIIB Vice President and Corporate Secretary Sir Danny Alexander commented, "That another 43 members have joined in the last three years is recognition that AIIB has established itself as part of the rules-based international system, with strong governance and high international standards."According to him, the widely-represented bank takes interest in expanding its business in Africa."We now have members on every continent, and we welcome the growing interest of African countries in AIIB. We look forward to working with Benin, Djibouti and Rwanda to support their development in the years to come," he said.Under the theme "Cooperation and Connectivity," the two-day annual AIIB meeting kicked off in Luxembourg on Friday for the first time outside Asia. It drew over 1,000 AIIB officials, representatives from members and partner institutions, business leaders and experts.The meeting this year highlighted stronger Asia-Europe cooperation and connectivity, digital connectivity, climate change, sustainable infrastructure and mobilizing finance for circular economy transitions.The bank's board of governors decided to hold its fifth annual meeting in Beijing on July 2-3, 2020.The AIIB has approved 46 projects worth $8.5 billion in 18 members, such as building highways and power plants.The remarkable results have testified to the bank's operational efficiency, according to Luxembourg's Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna. "We are glad we contributed from the beginning to the setting-up of AIIB, because this bank is a real success story," he told Xinhua.In particular, he expressed his belief that multilateralism is the only way to solve the worldwide issues like poverty and climate change, and the AIIB is an important instrument."If we do not embark on sustainable development, if we do not try to save countries with a low standard of living through sustainable investment, if we don't do these things well, climate change will make sure that the temperature would rise above two degrees and that our planet may basically not survive," Gramegna noted.

                    Newcomers take AIIB to milestone of 100 members

                3 African nations approved at annual meeting as bank chief aims for 'lean, clean and green'Jin Liqun, president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which reached 100 approved members over the weekend, wants the AIIB to become the bank that connects Asia to the world.The AIIB's Board of Governors approved the applications on Saturday of three African countries - Benin, Djibouti and Rwanda - at the bank's annual meeting in Luxembourg. This would bring the total number of AIIB members to 100, including 70 whose membership has already been ratified by their respective countries' parliaments."AIIB members collectively account for 78 percent of the world's population and 63 percent of global GDP. With the backing of all of our members, we are building a lean, clean and green institution that can help to support their sustainable development," Jin said.Chinese Finance Minister Liu Kun said at the meeting on Saturday that he hopes the AIIB will give play to its advantage as a multilateral development bank to link its strategy with the development blueprints of its members, the Belt and Road Initiative and the Connecting Europe and Asia Strategy of the European Union."China, an AIIB shareholder and the country that hosts the AIIB's head office, will continue to support the bank's development," Liu said.Liu suggested that the AIIB make an overall strategy to guide its further development, based on previous operation experiences, its own features, new trends of global growth and the diversified requirements of members.Uzziel Ndagijimana, Rwanda's minister of finance and economic planning, called the AIIB "a great bank"."We are happy to join as the 100th member. We are looking forward to not only having fruitful cooperation with the bank, but also with the member countries to promote infrastructure and promote trade and investment between Asia and Africa," he said on Saturday.The three new prospective nonregional members will officially join the AIIB once they complete the required domestic processes and deposit the first capital installment with the bank.At the annual meeting, the first held outside of Asia, Luxembourg Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna praised the AIIB as "arguably the most modern and international financial institution in the world"."The bank has emerged as the beacon of multilateralism while surpassing expectations of growth," he said. Luxembourg was the first European nation to join the AIIB.Gramegna said membership of European countries has been very beneficial for European and Asian countries alike. "Looking at the results of the past three and a half years, we can all be very pleased with what has been achieved, both in terms of financial operations and in terms of the quality of the work that has been done," he said.Since January 2016, the AIIB has provided $8.5 billion in loans to 45 projects in 18 member countries, many in renewable energy and green infrastructure. The AIIB has also received the highest credit ratings from the world's three biggest rating agencies - Standard &Poor's, Moody's and Fitch Group.Jin said the bank has a good working relationship with other multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. "We set the bar at the par with other multilateral development institutions and other institutions, so we can work together," he said, adding that "we are happy to see that we are recognized as such a bank".Jin said people should realize it takes time to help developing countries in their transition from high carbon to low carbon to zero carbon economies. "So it's really a very tough job. And we are doing our very best," he said in response to criticism that the AIIB was not doing enough.Next year's annual meeting will be held in Beijing, the AIIB's Board of Governors announced on Saturday. Finance Minister Liu was elected as chairman of the fifth Board of Governors.By the end of 2018, the AIIB's total investment had reached $7.5 billion, up from $4.196 billion a year earlier, according to the annual report released on the bank's website.Contact the writers at chenweihua@chinadaily.com.cn(China Daily Global 07/15/2019 page1)

                    Horn of Africa loses youths to war-torn Yemen
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Lack of economic opportunities has driven thousands of young adults from the Horn of Africa to war-torn Yemen, according to a recent study by the International Organization for Migration, or IOM.In the first five months of the year, nearly 200,000 people moved to the Arabian peninsula country, exposing them to deadly perils along migration routes across the Horn of Africa and the Red Sea.About 95 percent of the migrants tracked through IOM's Displacement Tracking Matrix in the region were Ethiopians, followed by Somalis, signaling that poverty and instability continue to be the major push and pull factors.Ethiopia has recorded the fastest economic growth in Africa, at an annual rate of nearly 10 percent for the last decade. But the trends also show that Ethiopians have yet to feel a trickle-down effect. Over the recent past, the government has embarked on large investments in infrastructure and manufacturing zones.Somalia does not have a stable government with the UN-backed transitional government fighting with al-Shabaab extremists for control.The upsurge in this migration over the so-called Eastern route will probably exceed 2018 and 2017 arrival numbers in Yemen. In 2018, an estimated 160,000 migrants crossed over to Yemen while only 100,000 migrants reached the Arab Peninsula in 2017. This trend recorded a 50 percent year-on-year rise, according to IOM, an intergovernmental organization related to the United Nations.Located at the cusp of two continents, Yemen historically has been an origin, transit and destination country for migrants."The majority of these migrants are adult males who are traveling for economic reasons. They seek better lives for themselves, work, security and new opportunities," said Asman Saeed from the Regional Data Hub located at the IOM Regional Office for East and Horn of Africa.In 2018, IOM referred to this route as the world's most "youthful" because an estimated 24 percent of the migrants were children. Moreover, from nearly 900,000 movements tracked last year, 28 percent were adult females with four percent were pregnant or lactating women.She further revealed that movement in the Eastern route exceeded migrant numbers crossing to Europe via the Mediterranean Sea from the Horn of Africa. Last year, only 107,216 arrivals were recorded in Italy.Smaller movements were captured along the Southern and Northern routes. The former, which is from the Horn of Africa to the south via east Africa, recorded an increase of 2 percent in movement. Many of these movements were short term, followed by tourism. Economic motives came a distant third trailed by forced movements.The Northern route, which is from the east and Horn of Africa to North Africa and then later by sea also recorded 2 percent of the total movement tracked by the tracking matrix. Last year saw a decrease of 65 percent compared to 2017.Migration along the Horn of Africa route, which refers to movements to and within that region, was mainly due to evacuation from Yemen and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Last year, an estimated 230,000 Ethiopians returned home, with 86 percent reporting that they were returning involuntarily, according to the IOM report.Recent IOM data is based on the assessment from 65 monitoring points in six countries including Somalia, Djibouti and Yemen. The IOM said irregular migration from the Horn of Africa to the Gulf countries has been steadily increasing over the past few years, with many crossing over with the support of smugglers.

                    HK firms seek opportunities in Kenya and Djibouti

                Riding on the Belt and Road Initiative, also known as the BRI, Hong Kong-based enterprises are keenly eyeing investment opportunities in both Kenya and Djibouti.Toward that end, a delegation of 12 people representing 10 Hong Kong-based enterprises visited Djibouti and Kenya on Aug 4-9, where they held forums with local enterprises, lobby groups and government representatives.The enterprises are looking at investing in banking, finance, manufacturing, real estate development, property development, construction, engineering services and projects, among other areas, generally through joint ventures and partnerships with local companies.Nicholas Kwan, director of research at the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, said they are interested in investing in infrastructure and transport logistics in Djibouti.He termed Kenya and Djibouti as key entry points into Africa. Djibouti is strategically located in East Africa and serves as the regional transportation and logistics hub for landlocked countries in the region.He said the delegation recognizes the importance of Kenya as a gateway to the rapidly developing East Africa region, with the country playing a significant role as a major logistics hub.Daniel Lam, the regional director of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council in the Middle East and Africa, said they are keen to explore opportunities presented by Kenya's economic success story, through the BRI.He said Hong Kong investors are in a position to provide some of the expertise and funding that can make Kenya's vision 2030 a reality."Kenya and Hong Kong are both important hubs for trade and commerce. Already, solid business ties exist between the two places," he said.Lam said Kenya can greatly capture the relevant opportunities of the Belt and Road Initiative through Hong Kong, which is well-placed to be the commercial platform for the initiative."Hong Kong is an important two-way investment and business hub in Asia. We are your prime gateway to Asia's regional markets, especially ASEAN countries and mainland China, which we are familiar with and have extensive experience working in," he said.In the first five months of 2019, Lam said exports from Hong Kong to Kenya grew by 120 percent to $103 million, while bilateral trade rose by 68 percent.

                Riding on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Hong Kong-based enterprises are keenly eyeing investment opportunities in both Kenya and Djibouti.A 12-member delegation representing 10 Hong Kong-based enterprises visited Djibouti and Kenya in August, where they held discussions with local enterprises, lobby groups and government representatives.The enterprises are looking to invest in banking, finance, manufacturing, real estate development, property development, construction, engineering services, and project investment among others, basically through joint ventures and partnerships with local companies.Nicholas Kwan, director of research at Hong Kong Trade Development Council, said they are interested in investing in infrastructure and transport logistics in Djibouti.He termed Kenya and Djibouti as key entry points into Africa.

He said Kenya has a deficit of 250,000 housing units annually."The low-cost housing agenda seeks to address the acute shortage by cutting construction costs through use of innovative technologies, reducing mortgage cost, and raising low-cost funds from private and public sectors for investment in large-scale housing construction," he explained.Ikiara said developers of 100 low cost residential units and above will enjoy 15 percent corporate tax.On universal healthcare coverage, opportunities lie in enhancing low cost private insurance coverage and schemes, private healthcare facilities and services, provision of medical commodities and equipment.This is in addition to digitization of healthcare and provision and implementation of alternative financing.Betty Maina, the principal secretary of the State Department of Investment and Industry, assured the Hong Kong investors that Kenya will continue to be an open economy with a business friendly environment.She said her ministry will strive to make the country the preferred investment destination and one of the most globally competitive trading nations in the world.

            <p class="style-content">
                Teshome Toga Chanaka, Ethiopian Ambassador to China, talked with China Daily recently about bilateral trade and cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative.The ambassador wanted to expand exports to China and believed Ethiopia's high-quality products would find a ready market here. Yet the greatest challenge is to increase output, which he believed China could help as well.Toga was particularly impressed by one project between the two sides under the Belt and Road Initiative: the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway. With the Chinese-built railway, export commodities can be transported to the port of neighboring Djibouti overnight, a drastic reduction of cargo transportation time. It used to take seven days.The investment of Chinese enterprises, especially in infrastructure construction and the manufacturing industry, has contributed to the overall development of Ethiopia. "They're contributing to our growth of the economy (and) they're benefiting our people on the ground," the ambassador said in the interview.He also talked about China's achievements in economic growth and its significant transformation in the past 40 years and expressed his appreciation of the hard work of the Chinese people.

                China will expand healthcare cooperation with the Arab world through more medical assistance, information sharing and joint research, the health minister said on Friday."We will continue to deliver medical aid teams to the Arab countries and provide technical training to improve local healthcare workers' capability," said Ma Xiaowei, minister of the National Health Commission in China. "The goal is to bring genuine benefits to people from both regions."To combat infectious diseases that constantly threaten global health, China and the Arab states will develop stronger partnerships in terms of disease monitoring and precaution, in order to facilitate the timely sharing of information during health emergencies, he added.Medical institutions and pharmaceutical companies from both regions are also encouraged to join hands to establish laboratories and evaluate innovative technologies, according to an initiative announced at the Second China-Arab States Health Cooperation Forum held in Beijing on Friday.The two sides are also mulling over a joint research institute dedicated to developing and manufacturing traditional medicines. Efforts will be made to streamline market approval procedures for such drugs in both regions, the initiative said.China has developed strong ties with the Arab countries in the healthcare sector in the past decades, yielding fruitful outcomes, according to health officials attending the forum.For instance, China launched a program in 2014 to provide free cataract surgeries for patients in some Arab countries, including Sudan, Morocco and Djibouti. More than 2,800 patients have received treatment and regained eyesight so far, Ma said.Fawziya Abikar Nur, minister of health and social services of Somalia, said the largest hospital in the country, which specializes in mother and child care, was built by China about 40 years ago and handed over to local authorities."The hospital was destroyed during the civil war and we are now working to restore the hospital to its previous standard," she said. "In the future, medical training from China will be an essential part of our rehabilitation work."Nasser Mohsen Baoom, minister of public health and population of Yemen, said the expertise of Chinese medical workers is trustworthy and of consistent high quality.In addition to conventional medical aid methods, such as sending medics and equipment, Baoom said he also sees great potential to tap into cooperation opportunities in the field of traditional Chinese medicine.
