                Pompeo 'optimistic' about Syria's Kurds
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                US secretary of state is confident allies and Turkey will protect their interestsABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates－Washington's top diplomat said on Saturday he was "optimistic" a way could be found to protect Syrian Kurds while allowing Turks to "defend their country from terrorists" following a US pullout from Syria."We are confident we can achieve an outcome that achieves both of those," US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told journalists in Abu Dhabi, following a phone call with his Turkish counterpart.The UAE is one of his stops in a regional tour aimed at reassuring allies after a shock December announcement by US President Donald Trump that US troops would be withdrawn from Syria.Pompeo's remarks follow tensions between the United States and Turkey over the fate of Washington's Syrian Kurdish allies in the fight against the Islamic State group.Turkey had reacted angrily to suggestions that Trump's plan to withdraw troops was conditional on the safety of the US-backed Kurdish fighters, seen by the Turkish government as terrorists.US-led operations against IS in Syria have been spearheaded on the ground by the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces.Ankara sees the backbone of that alliance, the Kurdish People's Protection Units (also known as YPG), as a terrorist group linked to the Kurdistan Worker's Party (also known as PKK) which has fought a decadeslong insurgency against the Turkish state.Pompeo said that Washington recognized "the Turkish people's right and (Turkish President Recep Tayyip) Erdogan's right to defend their country from terrorists".But, he added, "we also know that those fighting alongside us for all this time deserve to be protected as well". Pompeo said he had spoken to Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu."Many details (are) still to be worked out but I'm optimistic that we can achieve a good outcome," he said.Trump's announcement last month prompted the YPG to call on Syrian government troops to deploy alongside their own forces in the north to help counter a potential Turkish offensive.A spokesman for the US military said on Friday it had begun "the process of our deliberate withdrawal from Syria".But US defense officials quickly sought to clarify that while gear was being pulled out, "we are not withdrawing troops at this stage".Syria's conflict began in 2011 with anti-government demonstrations that were brutally crushed, sparking a complex war involving multiple foreign militias and jihadist groups, as well as regional and international powers including the US.The withdrawal announcement has also sparked concerns among Arab states and Israel that it could open the door to growing Iranian influence.Pompeo has pledged to "expel every last Iranian boot" from Syria, and on Saturday sought to downplay the impact of the US pullout on this goal."The fact that a couple of thousands of uniformed personnel in Syria will be withdrawing is a tactical change," he said."It doesn't materially alter our capacity to continue to perform the military actions that we need to perform."On Sunday, Pompeo arrived Qatar and signed several agreements with Qatari officials.He thanked Qatar for hosting US forces at Al-Udeid Air Base, home to the US military's Central Command forward headquarters.Qatar's Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said his country's relationship with the US "has enabled us to confront so many regional and international challenges".Washington is set to convene an international summit in Poland next month focusing on stability in the Middle East.AFP/AP

                    UAE looks forward to Xi's visit, closer cooperation
                </p>

                DUBAI -- Leaders and officials of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said their country welcomes Chinese President Xi Jinping's upcoming visit and sees it as an opportunity to enhance bilateral cooperation in all aspects.Xi is traveling to the UAE on Thursday for a state visit at the invitation of UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The visit will be the first by a Chinese head of state in 29 years.UAE Vice President and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum was quoted by UAE state news agency WAM as saying the "historic visit" will celebrate the strategic relationship between the two countries and establish a new phase of fruitful cooperation and promising future."We have a strong economic relationship with the People's Republic of China and close cultural and social ties," he said.The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, said the strategic relationship between the two countries has yielded fruitful economic, trade and cultural results, WAM reported.The UAE Minister of Economy, Sultan bin Saed Al-Mansouri, told WAM that the UAE and China enjoy high levels of dialogue and coordination."We believe that the growing levels of cooperation between the two countries will stimulate the growth of investment, trade and tourism, reflecting on promising prospects for further cooperation and mutual benefits in various strategic economic sectors," Al-Mansouri said.Sultan bin Ahmed Sultan Al-Jaber, UAE minister of state and chairman of the National Media Council, said the relationship between the UAE and China is a long-term strategic one in political, economic, cultural, social and many other areas.In a statement, Al-Jaber said: "The UAE-China relationship is rooted in the principles of mutual respect, constructive dialogue and meaningful cooperation to achieve their common interests in a variety of sectors."Al-Jaber said the strategic cooperation between the UAE and China aims to realize the interests of both countries."The leaderships of the UAE and China are committed to working towards security, peace, stability, growth, prosperity and progress for humanity as a whole," he said.The UAE is the first Gulf country to forge a strategic partnership with China. In recent years, bilateral cooperation has enjoyed comprehensive, result-oriented, efficient and rapid development.China has been the UAE's largest trading partner for several consecutive years while the UAE has become China's second largest trading partner and largest destination of exports in the Middle East and North Africa region.Chinese official statistics show that bilateral trade reached 41 billion U.S. dollars in 2017, a 1.06-percent increase from the previous year.

                    UAE and China, how comprehensive strategic relations are built
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The relationship binding the UAE and China is a copybook example of how comprehensive strategic relations between countries can be built. The Emirati leadership, through its insight and ability in developing a network of relationships, has been successful in realizing the country's strategic interests through cooperation with a pivotal state to the benefit of the people of the UAE.China and the UAEChinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to the UAE on July 19, 2018, is the culmination of a strategic relationship going back years. It was the first visit by an incumbent Chinese president to a Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) member state and President Xi’s first visit overseas since his reelection. It is a relationship built on political, economic, social, cultural and tourist cooperation based on solid grounds of trust and mutual respect. Most importantly, this relationship has directly fed the Emirati people's interests, based on positive action not just words.It all started with a telegram sent by Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan to the then-Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, informing him of the establishment of the United Arab Emirates. This paved the way for comprehensive strategic relations with China. The Chinese premier replied by telegram in which he formally recognized the UAE.Mutual relations were further strengthened when diplomatic ties between the two countries were established in November 1984. The UAE embassy in China was opened in Beijing in 1985, a Chinese consulate was opened in Dubai in 1988 and two UAE consulates were opened in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Former Chinese president Yang Shangkun's visit to the UAE in December 1989 was the first-ever to the UAE and was followed by Sheikh Zayed’s visit to China in May 1990.During his visit to China, the founding father of the UAE, Sheikh Zayed, presented a roadmap for the development of a long-term strategic relationship between the two countries. Taking such a step showed the UAE’s genius for leadership and the role an individual can play in making history. Sheikh Zayed soon realized that relations with the rising state of China had to rely on deepening contact in all fields not confined to the economy alone. Therefore he took the initiative to inaugurate the Sheikh Zayed Centre for Arabic Language and Arabic and Islamic Studies at the Beijing Foreign Studies University.Sheikh Zayed's vision for deeper public diplomacy relations with China was not understood by many at the beginning, yet today both the UAE and China are harvesting its fruits. Nearly 1,000 students have graduated from the Sheikh Zayed Centre, building a bridge between China and the Arab world. The same centre was re-inaugurated by Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed in 2012 following renovation.Moreover, the centre's establishment led to greater cultural and educational cooperation between the UAE and China, a cooperation considered unique in China's relations with Arab states. In return, a school for teaching the Chinese language was inaugurated in Abu Dhabi in 2010 and a Confucius Institute was inaugurated in Dubai University, being the first of its kind in the Gulf region. In addition, the Chinese language was taught in 11 schools, the fruit of which was the Emirati fluent Chinese-speaking students studying at Hamdan bin Zayed School in Abu Dhabi, who were present during the UAE-China week.Like all cultural diplomacy initiatives, building lasting cultural relationships takes years. China was the guest of honor at the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair and the UAE became a major destination for Chinese writers and intellectuals eager to better understand and open dialogue with the Arab world.In fact, the importance of cultural relations between the UAE and China in building comprehensive strategic ties between the two countries has been made clear during the UAE-China week in Manarat Al Saadiyat on July 17th –25th, coinciding with the Chinese president's visit to the UAE.Through the founding father's insight, the UAE has been transformed into a hub for Chinese-Arab cultural exchange. Several Chinese centers have been established in the UAE, thus serving not only as China's economic bridge to the Arab world, but as a cultural one as well.Exchange visits have also strengthened a unique political relationship, as manifested in the visits to China of Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid al Maktoum, the vice-president and ruler of Dubai in 2008, and Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al Nahyan, the Abu Dhabi crown prince and deputy chief of the Armed Forces, in 2002, 2012 and 2015. Highlighting the strength of Chinese-UAE relations, President Xi Jinping said, "the UAE is a friendly country and shares our dream and so the UAE has become a vital bridge between China and the Arab states."Economically, the relations between the UAE and China are unique. China is considered the UAE's largest economic partner with $53.3 billion annually in trade exchange, which increased by an additional $8 billion in two years, totaling $245 billion between 2011 and 2017. Between 2011 and 2017 35 mutual trade cooperation agreements were signed during 120 visits exchanged by officials from the two countries.Seventy percent of China’s exports to the Gulf, Africa and East Asia go through the UAE, being China's trade gateway to the Middle East and Africa. Nearly 300,000 Chinese citizens, 4000 Chinese companies, 300 trade agencies, 5,000 trademarks and 15 corporations are operating on the Emirati stock markets, and 817 Chinese investors are active on the Abu Dhabi and Dubai stock markets, with a turnover of UAE 900 million dirhams. This in addition to large Chinese investments in the UAE.In view of China’s new “Silk Road” initiative, such distinguished relations have prompted China to view the UAE as a strategic partner in an international project.The UAE has become a significant pivot in China's maritime "Silk Road" initiative, something that further strengthens the UAE's location and its unique position on the world map and brings greater economic and development gains to the Emirati people.In this initiative, the DP (Dubai Ports) World's London Gateway port is playing a key role in the last phase of the Silk Road railway and raising the capacity of Gabal Ali ports to 22 million containers. In addition, the UAE is partaking in the Chinese infrastructure of this major project.The UAE is also playing a major role in the construction of the Silk Road, which will consolidate its standing as an international centre for trade and investment for decades to come.In the area of tourism over a million Chinese tourists flock to the UAE every year aboard 75 flights every week. This number is likely to increase to 1.5 million when the entry visas to both countries are cancelled.Political and economic cooperation, the building of good personal relations over time and the development of tourism, education and the easing of visa restrictions, all pillars of successful political and cultural diplomacy, attest to the value and importance of the cornerstone established by the Founding Father all those years ago and developed with wisdom and insight by his successors.The article was first published on al-Ain news website.

                The UAE Embassy celebrated the festival this year with the theme "Meeting friends with Art: a glimpse of the UAE and Chinese Mid-autumn Festival"BEIJING - The United Arab Emirates Ambassador to the People’s Republic of China, H.E. Dr. Ali Al Dhaheri today welcomed guests to a celebration to mark the mid-autumn festival. Traditionally, at the time of the Mid-autumn festival, the moon is believed to be the brightest and biggest in the whole year. The festival represents the unity of the people, as well as celebrating the annual harvest. The Abu Dhabi Tourism Board partnered with the UAE Embassy to hold the event this year, in another sign of the city’s growing prominence as a major touristic and cultural hub in the UAE for Chinese visitors. This year, the UAE Embassy collaborated with the Chinese cultural organisation Rong Bao Zhai, to celebrate artistic and cultural connections between the UAE and China. The event, held at the Rong Bao Zhai premises in Beijing, showcased some of the best Emirati and Chinese contemporary art, with an exhibition of photography, celebrating the best that the two countries have to offer. The focus of the exhibition was on Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan in celebration of Year of Zayed 2018.After the opening remarks by the UAE Ambassador, guests were able to tour the exhibition, as well as view a video presentation, followed by a Chinese tea and mooncakes gathering, power point presentation about UAE and a demonstration of traditional Chinese painting. The UAE Embassy wanted to showcase the rich artistic traditions of both cultures, and to demonstrate the deep and meaningful partnership which the Emirati and Chinese people continue to enjoy. In his speech to welcome guests to the event, the UAE Ambassador to the People’s Republic of China said "There are many legends about the mid-autumn festival and its origins. To modern Chinese today however, it is not just the ancient stories but also the tradition of holding reunions with family and friends. People always gather, and of course share mooncakes, which represent the harvest moon. For centuries, both of our peoples have used lunar calendars, another example of the deep bond between our cultures. It is in that spirit of community that we welcome our guests here today, and celebrate our diverse cultures through the universal community and kinship of art."Originally named Song Zhu Zhai, (literally meaning "Pine and Bamboo Tree House") Rong Bong Zhai was founded in 1672 during the Qing Dynasty it was renamed Rong Bao Zhai, meaning "meeting friends with Art" in 1894. Over the past 60 years, Rong Bao Zhai has gradually transformed into a comprehensive cultural enterprise integrating calligraphy and painting, woodblock watermarking, binding and mounting, art collection, publishing, exhibition, education and training amongst several other aspects of artistic heritage.

                The Embassy of the United Arab Emirates to the People's Republic of China today celebrated the UAE's 47th National Day at an elegant ballroom event in the Wanda Vista Hotel in Beijing.A number of dignitaries and Chinese guests of honor attended, including Chen Xiaodong, assistant minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

                    Riyadh says two oil tankers attacked
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Teheran calls for probe; Pompeo to visit Brussels on Iran, shortening Russia tripSaudi Arabia said on Monday that two of its oil tankers were sabotaged off the coast of the United Arab Emirates in attacks that caused "significant damage" to the vessels, one of them as it was en route to pick up Saudi oil to take to the United States, The Associated Press reported.The announcement by the kingdom's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih came as the US issued a new warning to sailors and the UAE's regional allies condemned Sunday's incident that targeted at least four ships, including two Saudi tankers, off the port city of Fujairah.The statement came just hours after Iranian and Lebanese media outlets aired false reports of explosions at Fujairah's port, AP reported. Emirati officials have declined to elaborate on the nature of the sabotage or say who might have been responsible.The US has warned ships that "Iran or its proxies" could be targeting maritime traffic in the region, AP said. Washington is deploying an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf to counter alleged threats from Teheran.Shortly after the Saudi announcement, Iran's Foreign Ministry called for further clarification about what exactly happened with the vessels. The ministry' spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as saying there should be more information about the incident.Mousavi also warned against any "conspiracy orchestrated by ill-wishers" and "adventurism by foreigners" to undermine the maritime region's stability and security.Publicly available satellite images of the area taken Sunday showed no smoke or fire, AP reported.Tensions have risen since US President Donald Trump withdrew the country from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, restoring US sanctions that have pushed Iran's economy into crisis.Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was scheduled to pay an unannounced visit to Brussels on Monday to discuss "pressing matters" including Iran, media reported on Sunday, citing a US State Department official, Xinhua News Agency reported.According to media reports, Pompeo was expected to hold talks with officials from France, the United Kingdom and Germany－the three European signatories to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.Pompeo therefore would cancel his Monday visit to Moscow, media reported, adding Pompeo's Tuesday meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in the Russian Black Sea city of Sochi would not be impacted.Their discussions would touch on arms control issues and "a full range of global challenges" including the issues of Ukraine, Venezuela, Iran, Syria, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, a senior state department official said at a news conference on Friday.It would be the third time for Pompeo to abruptly change his scheduled visit because of the Iran issue recently.Earlier last week, Pompeo made an unannounced trip to Iraq by canceling his visit to Germany. He then scrapped his planned trip to Greenland reportedly due to the escalation of tensions with Iran.Over the recent weeks, Washington has ratcheted up pressure against Teheran with a series of sanctions, designations and military threats.In response, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday announced Teheran's withdrawal from complying with the restrictions posed by the Iran nuclear deal on the country's enriched uranium reserves and heavy water supplies.Rouhani also set a 60-day deadline for the remaining parties to the deal to fulfill their obligations, particularly in preserving Iran's interests in the areas of banking and oil.Jeremy Hunt, Britain's foreign minister, on Monday urged a period of calm ahead of talks between the European Union and Pompeo, saying Iran and the US could trigger a conflict by accident in an already unstable Gulf region, Reuters reported."We need to make sure that we don't end up putting Iran back on the path to re-nuclearization," Hunt said, calling for "a period of calm so that everyone understands what the other side is thinking".As Trump has sent an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the Gulf, Iran said the strategy amounts to "psychological warfare" and a senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander on Sunday said Iran would retaliate to any aggressive US moves, Reuters said.EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Monday that they would continue to support the nuclear pact because Iran continued to comply with inspections.The EU is trying to implement a new channel to allow Iran to sell its oil and circumvent newly-instated US sanctions, but setting it up is proving complex.Xinhua

                    Damaged tankers reach safe waters after attacks
                </p>

                DUBAI - Two damaged tankers arrived safely on Sunday at locations off the Emirati coast after they were rocked by explosions in Gulf waters on Thursday. The Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous was carrying highly flammable methanol through the Gulf of Oman on Thursday when it came under attack along with the Norwegian-operated Front Altair - the second assault in a month in the strategic shipping lane. Thursday's attacks took place southeast of the Strait of Hormuz, a vital corridor connecting the energy-rich states of the Middle East to the global market. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had been on an unprecedented visit to the Iranian capital in a bid to defuse tensions between the United States and the Islamic republic when the attacks took place. Washington immediately blamed Teheran for the attack, followed by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt also has concluded that responsibility "almost certainly" lies with Iran and warned on Saturday there was a "great risk" of escalation in the region. Teheran has denied being involved and accused the US of promoting an "Iranophobic" campaign against it. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Thursday dismissed the US claim as "baseless" and said Washington had "immediately jumped to make allegations against Iran - (without) a shred of factual or circumstantial evidence". US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday vowed the US would ensure the strait remains open, without detailing what options Washington is considering to protect shipping. "What you should assume is we are going to guarantee freedom of navigation throughout the strait," he said in a Fox News television interview. Earlier on Sunday, Iran's Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani said that Washington could have been behind the "suspicious" tanker attacks, the official news agency IRNA reported. The attacks "seem to complement the economic sanctions against Iran, considering that (the US) has not achieved any results from them", he told lawmakers. Russia on Sunday warned against making "baseless accusations" over the attacks. "Such incidents can undermine the foundations of the world economy," said Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov. Pope Francis on Sunday called for restraint and a lowering of tensions in the Middle East. "I invite everyone to use the instruments of diplomacy to resolve the complex problems of the conflicts in the Middle East," he said during a visit to a city in central Italy. "I renew a heartfelt appeal to the international community to make every possible effort to favor dialogue and peace," he said after saying a Mass for several thousand people. The Japanese ship's Singapore-based BSM Ship Management said in a statement on Sunday that it had "arrived safely at the designated anchorage" and that its crew were "safe and well". The other ship, the Front Altair, was under safe tow by tug boats toward an area off the coast of the eastern Emirati port of Fujairah. "First inspections are under way and no hot spots have been identified following the fire," while all crew members were in Dubai, the vessel's owners said on Sunday.

                    Crown prince visit sets UAE-China road map into action
                </p>

                The United Arab Emirates' state visit to China from July 21 to 23, kindly granted by President Xi Jinping to His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, crown prince of Abu Dhabi and deputy supreme commander of the UAE Armed Forces, along with a considerable UAE delegation of government and businesses, has advanced the relationship between our two countries in very real and practical ways.This proved to be a momentous visit, with many noteworthy achievements. What was agreed was summed up succinctly through an announcement echoed by both President Xi Jinping and His Highness: China and the UAE will work toward increasing the bilateral trade volume to $200 billion by 2030. The target here is more than a threefold increase, as trade is now estimated to be worth around $60 billion annually. So, we can see extremely ambitious plans, a testament to the deepening relationship between our two nations.In order to achieve a practical way of making strides toward this target, the Chinese and UAE delegations, led by President Xi Jinping and His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan respectively, signed 16 agreements and memorandums of understanding, with the aim of strengthening cooperation across a vast number of areas, including economy, trade, investment, technology, artificial intelligence, culture and education, as well as protecting the environment and achieving food security. We now have a substantial result in this respect, complementing the strong synergy from President Xi Jinping’s visit to the UAE last year, with 14 memorandums and the setting in motion of the comprehensive strategic partnership.Cross-border investments have increased in a significant way, and Chinese and UAE companies are working in tandem to share technology, capital and market access. Financial cooperation is also deepening, as demonstrated by the agreement for China Everbright Group to set up its MENA financial and investment hub in the Abu Dhabi Global Market.A bold vision was outlined, as President Xi Jinping and Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan sat down together and signed an agreement aligning common goals. This document included commitments to development, growth, prosperity and stability. Among other aspects, there was also an agreement to adhere to the principles of mutual interest, equality and understanding.Another series of milestones stemmed from the UAE-China Economic Forum, where 19 agreements and memorandums were signed by a broad range of sectors between numerous UAE and China businesses. This forum showed the level of sophistication achieved in the UAE-China relationship, as opportunities for joint action for investment were explored with a high-ranking ministerial delegation and business leaders from the respective nations. Such achievements are the result of decades of hard work, since the first visit of the late Sheikh Zayed in 1990, as the first leader to China from the Arab region.There was a fitting send-off toward the end of the visit, as a celebration was held marking the 35th anniversary of the establishment of friendship and bilateral relations between the United Arab Emirates and the People's Republic of China. A grand ceremony took place in Beijing, which was attended by His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, China's Vice-President Wang Qishan, the staff of the diplomatic mission and many high-level dignitaries, ministers, businesses and investors. There were even more agreements and memorandums achieved on the sidelines of this event, between a number of Emirati and Chinese businesses, five more to cap off an extremely fruitful trip to China.The celebration culminated with the unveiling by His Highness of a new building for the new UAE embassy to China in Beijing. A modern and forward-looking building, this provides a physical expression of the long-lasting vision for the UAE-China relationship. The new embassy is a symbol in itself, and a physical expression of a blueprint come to life, as the comprehensive strategic partnership outlined last year is in full swing, progressing and in action. Our relationship has now reached a higher level, with bilateral cooperation in full swing.The collective vision between our countries is bold. His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan emphasized, "The two sides are laying pillars for the next 100 years, beginning with steps to teach the Chinese language in more than 200 schools in the UAE.” The vision of His Highness is supported by a memorandum between the UAE Ministry of Education and the Confucius Institute headquarters of China, which will provide high-quality Chinese language instruction in UAE schools, ensuring clearer communication and understanding in a shared lingua franca for generations to come.His Highness concluded his visit stating that the two sides are creating a "road map" for a century of prosperity as he concluded a landmark three-day visit to Beijing.So, we can see, we are just a few steps along the road. This is a very Chinese long-term view to civilization. Our countries are looking forward to the future. Setting the sail in line with the prosperous winds is something the UAE and China both share, as forward-looking nations with a vision of a globalized world.The author is ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to China.
