                Shandong set to play bigger role in BRI with new ports group
            </p>
            <p>
                Shandong province will play a bigger role in the Belt and Road Initiative with the help of the newly consolidated Shandong Province Port Group, which will expand its operations into the country's inland areas, industry officials and insiders said.Launched on Tuesday in Qingdao, the company has integrated the major ports in the province, including Qingdao Port, Yantai Port, Rizhao Port and the Bohai Bay Port Group."By integrating port facilities and services, the coastal ports in Shandong province will enhance connections with more 'waterless ports' in inland provinces along the Silk Road Economic Belt," said Huo Gaoyuan, the new group's first chairman, adding that the new group will provide services for hinterland areas involved in the Eurasian Continental Bridge.Official statistics showed the cargo throughput at all coastal ports in Shandong province in 2018 amounted to 1.6 billion metric tons, ranking second in the country. With a cargo handling capacity exceeding 500 million tons last year, Qingdao Port was ranked among the Top 10 ports in China.Yantai Port and Rizhao Port, whose cargo handling capacity is over 400 million tons, also rank among the Top 10 ports in the country.Huo hoped the group would bolster the province's opening-up and become a world-class port conglomerate.The move of port resource integration was made by the Shandong provincial Party committee and the provincial government to maximize port resources and eliminate regional competition.Launched in March 2018, the Bohai Bay Port Group, which now is in charge of Binzhou Port, Dongying Port and Weifang Port, was the first step toward port integration in Shandong province.In early July, Qingdao Port announced a merger with neighboring Weihai Port. At the end of last month, the new port's leadership was announced and began working.Huo said the four ports in the new group will give full play to their distinct advantages and potential. In addition, Qingdao Port is also seeking opportunities brought by the demonstration area for economic and trade cooperation between China and members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.The demonstration area is expected to add momentum to cooperation between China and SCO economies. It has a multimodal transportation center connected to countries and regions involved in the BRI, with 10 domestic and eight international freight train services."The multimodal transportation center is directly linked with Qingdao Port by a railway line, which enables the port to better serve as a transportation hub connecting Japan, South Korea and SCO-related economies," said Jia Cunyu, a senior official of the demonstration area.Port asset integration at the provincial level has become a trend in China, with provinces including Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Liaoning establishing unified port groups or corporations in the past few years.China saw an overall growth in cargo throughput at ports in the first half of 2019, said official data released on July 28 and reported by Xinhua News Agency.Chinese cargo throughput at ports reached about 6.7 billion tons in the first six months, up by 4.5 percent compared with the same period of 2018, said a report released on the website of the National Development and Reform Commission.

                Aspiration for Asia
            </a>
            <p>
                China aims to establish a future-oriented open and cooperative regional mechanism The end of the Cold War eased tension in China's neighboring environment and heralded a new era of economic openness in the Asia-Pacific region, with China and its neighbors developing strong economic and trade relations. China has become the biggest economy in Asia but hardly the most powerful one. It has no overwhelming economic strength, nor does it have the power to provide security assurance to other Asian nations. Despite China's growing economic and military might, it is no challenge to the predominant position of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region, which is home to multiple players with different agendas. China should seek to establish a mechanism to boost regional cooperation and a platform to transcend bilateral relations in the region. Up to date, it has established not only national-level but also sub-regional dialogue and cooperation mechanisms. The cooperative frameworks it has signed with the sub-regional bodies go beyond the bilateral relations and encourage regional stability and new order in the neighboring areas. In Southeast Asia, to build friendly relations China has been working closely with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Even in 2013, at the height of the South China Sea crisis, China did not waiver in its commitment to building a community with a shared future with ASEAN or walk away from the negotiations on a code of conduct for the South China Sea. Instead, it proposed to upgrade the free-trade zones and signed a raft of treaties. China has a proven track record of respecting and cooperating with ASEAN, and China-ASEAN relations are a strategically crucial testing ground for building a new regional order and new neighborly relations. Yet it is Northeast Asia that matters most geopolitically for China. The region is still divided, haunted and traumatized by history. China and Japan lack political trust, while relations between China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are subject to the complicated nature of the Korean Peninsula denuclearization issue. China's plan to resolve the nuclear issue by holding Six-Party Talks frizzled out, due to the complicated relations among the six parties concerned and the daunting obstacle of the United States' hostility toward the DPRK. The failure of the talks has proved the arduousness of securing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and everlasting peace in the Northeast Asia, which requires more concerted efforts, more consensus, new strategies and stronger Chinese leadership. A China-Japan-ROK free trade agreement could be expected to make a breakthrough in the political predicaments among the three countries. Yet despite the ongoing talks it remains stranded by the chilly relations between China and Japan and between the Republic of Korea and Japan. Their economic cooperation loses momentum each time one of the pairs of relations sour. With the US administration pursuing its "America first" policy and launching an all-out trade war against China, defending cooperation and an open market in the Asia-Pacific has become paramount. China should remain committed to reform and opening-up. Meanwhile it should champion multilateralism and openness in East Asia. For instance, it should play its part in delivering a successful Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership before the end of 2019. The disintegration of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War altered China's relations with central Asian countries. Previously, there was only its bilateral relations with the former Soviet Union. Now China has established new relations and cemented mutual trust with Russia and its central Asian neighbors through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). This China-led organization has an increasing number of members and expanding functions, and it is expected to play a bigger role in regional security and economic cooperation. The importance of South Asia has also come to the fore in recent years. First, China needs to build a new relationship with an emerging India, a developing nation on the rise. Second, the Indian Ocean should be a channel of openness and cooperation. A stable, open, friendly and growing South Asia is in the best interests of China. Although South Asian nations normalized relations with China many decades ago, the level of closeness toward China varies from country to country. It is important for China to open a brand new chapter in dealing with South Asia, especially by mending fences with India. In 2006, China was granted observer status in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), a regional intergovernmental organization and geopolitical union of states in South Asia. Being a SAARC observer is only the beginning; China can push for a greater role in SAARC and a"1+8" framework. For China, the Asia-Pacific region is a geopolitical arena that has both economic and security connotations. Economically, it is the major market and source of foreign investment for China. In terms of security, a rising China is advised to exercise caution when dealing with the US, the established regional power. It is a region where China's economy and security are at stake. The US Indo-Pacific strategy is a natural extension of its rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific. And the Indo-Pacific strategies of the US and Japan bring South Asia, especially India on board. This is widely seen as a move to undercut China. However, China shows no interest in this game of choosing side and flexing muscles. At present, APEC is the primary platform for China to promote open market, and economic and technological cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. Called an economic organization it is tasked with some political agendas such as enabling regional dialogues and diplomatic exchanges. China endeavors to make full use of APEC to advance its economic and strategic ends. The author is a member of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
