                UnionPay opens up the world for tourists
            </p>
            <p>
                UnionPay, the national bank card payment processor, saw its overseas mobile transaction volume surge during the weeklong 2018 Spring Festival vacation, when millions of Chinese people celebrated the traditional festival abroad.Figures from UnionPay show that its volume of overseas mobile transactions completed via the UnionPay Mobile QuickPass — a form of near-field communication technology payment — and QR codes increased 150 percent year-on- year during the traditional Chinese New Year holiday from Feb 15 to 21. The number of mobile transactions was three times higher than in 2017.An increasing number of overseas businesses have started to offer UnionPay QR code payment services in a bid to cater to the changing demands of UnionPay cardholders.Leading up to the 2018 Chinese New Year, businesses in Nepal, Djibouti, Kenya and many other countries and regions launched UnionPay QR code payment services.The company has partnered with Kenya's largest banking service provider KCB Bank to expand its QR code payment service network. UnionPay QR code payment services are offered over the counter at Kenya Airways, South African Airways, chain store operator Naukumat and KFC. More than 2,500 businesses in the country are set to join UnionPay's QR code payment network by the end of 2018.In Nepal, popular outdoor products and equipment retailers, such as The North Face and Marmot, advertise their UnionPay facilities in clearly visible places to catch the attention of Chinese travelers. More than 1,000 local businesses will offer such services by the end of 2018.In Djibouti, the number of stores offering UnionPay's QR code payment service will reach about 500 at the end of March, according to the company.It said a great number of businesses in Indonesia, Cambodia and Mauritius will launch the service in the next few months, and it has already been launched in Singapore and Vietnam, as well as China's Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao.Apart from QR code payments, the UnionPay Mobile QuickPass was also popular among Chinese travelers during the Spring Festival holiday.UnionPay cardholders can make QuickPass payments in 18 countries and regions, including Singapore, Australia and Russia. Some stores in Japan and China's Hong Kong offered exclusive discounts to UnionPay QuickPass users.Although mobile payment is gaining popularity among Chinese travelers, traditional bank cardsremain the most highly favored payment tool.Overseas businesses have taken measures to offer more convenience for UnionPay cardholders over the past few years.Emporium Melbourne, a major shopping center in the Australian city, launched UnionPay card payment services before the 2018 Chinese New Year."Accepting UnionPay makes for simple and pleasant shopping experiences for Chinese tourists who visit during the Spring Festival holiday," said Kate Rooney, manager of Emporium Melbourne.Figures from UnionPay show that its services are available at over 23 million businesses and 1.64 million ATMs in 168 countries and regions. During this year's Spring Festival holiday, noted restaurants, hotels, stores and entertainment service providers in 22 popular overseas tourist destinations offered exclusive discounts of up to 30 percent for UnionPay cardholders.Supported by the expanding service network, Chinese travelers are becoming more active in using UnionPay cards in overseas markets.UnionPay cards were used in 127 countries and regions during this year's Spring Festival holiday period, increasing from 117 in 2017.The transaction volume in countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative increased significantly during the vacation, doubling in countries such as Turkey, Sri Lanka and Morocco, and increasing nearly 40 percent in some countries, including Russia and the United Arab Emirates.In addition to Chinese cardholders, UnionPay said it also strives to expand its client base in overseas markets. About 90 million UnionPay cards have been issued abroad, which allow foreign travelers to gain more convenience when they visit China.

                UnionPay expands online service in Mauritius
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - China UnionPay, the country's largest bank card services provider, said Friday that CUP bank cards can be accepted for online payments through the State Bank of Mauritius, further consolidating its presence in Africa.According to an agreement between CUP and SBM, Mauritius's second-largest bank, the acceptance of CUP bank cards will be extended to online merchant cross-border payments.The deal will also give the Chinese bank card issuer a better foothold in the burgeoning African continent.The Chinese and Mauritian banking institutions have already ensured that CUP cards are accepted at more than half of merchant stores and 40 percent of ATMs in Mauritius, according to CUP.The newly opened online payment service mainly covers merchants selling electronics products, and CUP said more merchants from the hospitality and tourism sector will be included in the future.CUP cards are currently accepted in 130 countries and regions worldwide.

                Intl hotels open up to UnionPay on rising tourism
            </a>
            <p>
                A growing number of major international hotel groups are now accepting China's UnionPay cards as they eye the country's booming luxury travel market.The latest to announce the move is Dusit International, one of Thailand's best-known hotel groups, which has just reported a 70 percent surge in Chinese guests during the first three quarters of last year, which has "reinforced its strategic focus on the Chinese market", it said.China's UnionPay joins hands with Thailand's Krung Thai Bank in card services on Jan 22 in Bangkok. The KTB UnionPay Debit Card marks the first step of UnionPay's expansion in Thailand.[Photo / Xinhua]Other leading international names to join Dusit in offering UnionPay service are Hong Kong-based Langham Hospitality Group, Australia's Crown Hotels, Canada-based international Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, One&Only The Palm in Dubai and the Beau-Rivage Palace of Switzerland.Last year, the famous London retail store Harrods announced Chinese customers could shop using UnionPay.Last month, QNB, the largest financial institution in Qatar and the Middle East and North Africa region, announced it planned to continue expanding its acceptance of UnionPay cards at all QNB points of sale, and ATMs across Qatar.Founded in Shanghai a decade ago by the central bank and the State Council, UnionPay now has 2.9 billion cards in circulation, 45 percent of the world's total bank cards, and is accepted in 136 countries, putting it neck and neck with giants Visa and MasterCard.Figures released last week by the Bankcard Consumer Confidence Index, or BCCI, showed that Chinese consumers continued to spend confidently in December.The BCCI, compiled by Xinhua and China UnionPay, increased for the third straight month, leading some analysts to predict UnionPay will surpass both Visa and MasterCard in 2013 to dominate the world bank card market.James Ramage, assistant vice-president of sales at Dusit International, said Chinese travelers now represent its highest potential visitor group, so accepting payments by UnionPay is sensible business.Dusit is also opening dedicated sales offices on the Chinese mainland and in Hong Kong, and will offer additional tailor-made services for guests, including Chinese-speaking staff, Chinese-language television channels, specially created meals, teas, newspapers and shopping outlets, he said.The most popular Dusit destinations for the Chinese guests are Bangkok, Phuket and Dubai."Dusit is confident in the opportunities provided by the robust Chinese market, especially in relation to properties slated to open in the coming months, such as Dusit Thani Abu Dhabi, in the first quarter of 2013," said Ramage.Meanwhile, the Langham Hospitality Group, named after the legendary Langham in London, has also launched a series of services, including settlement through UnionPay, aimed squarely at helping its growing number of Chinese guests.Already, its greeting information is written in simplified Chinese, and it has Mandarin-speaking employees to assist with translations and arrange transportation.It also provides a selection of Chinese television channels and Chinese-language newspapers as well as traditional Chinese food.The acceptance of UnionPay has already been spreading among other global hospitality groups.The award-winning Crown Hotels in Australia, currently sponsoring Chinese tennis star Li Na at the Australian Open, has confirmed it has begun accepting the card, as has the Canadian-based five-star brand Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, which already accepts the cards at 70 percent of its properties and has plans to accept them at all locations in the near future.leehannon@chinadaily.com.cnChina UnionPay's overseas expansionUnionPay subsidiary to beef up worldwide networksChina UnionPay extends payment service to PeruUnionPay expands online service in MauritiusUnionPay expands bank card co-op with NepalGovt near nod on UnionPay mobile payment standardChina UnionPay to expand bank card service in EuropeFind more in

The bank card was the result of the "Golden Card Project" promoted by Chinese leader Jiang Zemin in 1993. It was established under the approval of the State Council and the People's Bank of China. At its launch in March 2002 UnionPay was hailed as a historic achievement and a major breakthrough in the reform of China's banking. It is believed that as people's financial habits changed and information technology became popular, the country should have an interconnected bank card network to promote the development of the economy. By 2001 the initial targets for the "Golden Card Project" had already been achieved and 18 cities across China linked into a central card network with 383 million bank cards issued nationwide. In 2002 the People's Bank of China asked the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank of China and the China Construction Bank to introduce bank-card networks in 300 cities. UnionPay was born and introduced as a trial in 40 cities across China. It was seen as a significant milestone in China's banking industry following its entry into the World Trade Organization and successful bid for the 2008 Olympic Games a year earlier. At UnionPay's opening ceremony in 2002, Dai Xianglong, then governor of the People's Bank of China, spoke of the historic development for China and hinted at the international opportunities it presented. "In the past, we have gained support from international bankcard companies in the development of bank card businesses in China. The Chinese bank-card business boasts the most extensive market," he said. "From now on, we would like to cooperate more broadly and deeply with international bank card companies and large commercial banks so as to speed up bankcard business development in China." He closed the opening ceremony offering a maxim for the future of UnionPay: "One card, easy travel across the country." Just 10 years on, the "one card" can now be easily used while traveling to 141 countries. In June 2007 Egypt became the first country in Africa to have its ATMs and merchants accept UnionPay. In December 2008, FNB in South Africa agreed to the use of the card at points of sale across the country. UnionPay is now accepted in 40 countries and regions in Africa, with that number set to increase. Cardholders can use it to withdraw cash and buy products. South Africa, Mauritius and Egypt made up the bulk of transactions in 2011, according to figures released by UnionPay. A Euromonitor forecast for 2010-2015 predicted the annual growth of card numbers in this region would be 11.7 percent, among the fastest-growing regions in the world. UnionPay, which has about 400 domestic and overseas associate members, is actively targeting the market in Africa with the aim that all banks and payment institutions adopt the card into daily transactions for tourists and businesses. leehannon@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily 02/08/2013 page17)

[Photo/IC]BEIJING - China UnionPay, China's leading bankcard network operator, announced on Thursday that it has issued its first credit card in Africa, further enlarging its global footprint. UnionPay International, China UnionPay's international arm, jointly issued three types of credit card in partnership with Cim Finance from Mauritius, the Shanghai-based company said in a statement. The credit cards will be accepted in 140 countries and regions including China and Mauritius without a foreign transaction fee, said the company. China UnionPay started to issue debit cards in Africa in August, 2013.

                By partnering with Cim Group in Mauritius, UnionPay has set a milestone in expanding into the African market. Provided to China DailyCim group becomes first African organization to be offered unionpay service Cim Group, the Mauritius-based financial services organization, has become the first bank in Africa to offer credit cards backed by UnionPay, China's only domestic bank card organization. Officials says three levels of credit card are being offered to Cim customers - Classic, Gold and Business - to allow Mauritian visitors better payment options in China, but also business visitors from the east African island nation to have improved financial access into the fastest growing consumer market in the world. UnionPay has more than 4.3 billion cards in circulation and has expanded its network to 140 countries, issuing its own bank cards in more than 30. Its payment cards are already accepted in more than 40 countries and regions of Africa, including South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya. Given nearly half of the continent's population remains outside the banking system, possessing no bank cards, UnionPay thinks Africa offers huge potential for the organization. A statement from Cim Group says China is one of Mauritius' biggest trading partners and sources of development funds, and there has been a steady increase over the years of business relations and tourism between the two countries. The number of Chinese tourists going to the island has increased exponentially over the years, reaching 42,000 arrivals in 2013, it added. That growth is set to continue, as shown by the 93.4 percent increase of arrivals during the first quarter of 2014, in the wake of the opening of the new air link weekly between the city of Shenzhen in southern China and the island's Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam airport, it says. A growing number of African banks are enjoying the influence and potential of bilateral business and trade between China and Africa, and have requested collaboration with UnionPay to attract more clients. According to Larry Wang, chief business development officer of UnionPay International, the three new products are the first UnionPay credit cards issued by UnionPay in Africa, and have enriched the UnionPay card products in the local market. "Cardholders can use the cards in more than 140 countries and regions around the world, including Mauritius and China," he says. "In the Chinese mainland, the cards can be accepted by all ATMs and POS terminals and will be debited in Mauritius when used for purchases; in Mauritius and other countries and regions, the cards can be used for purchases in local currency, bringing local cardholders new payment choices and convenient and favorable card-using service. UnionPay International is accelerating the optimization of overseas UnionPay card products and its service system. As more Africans travel to China, too, on business and pleasure, having a UnionPay is useful for yuan-related business, such as automatic currency exchange. According to the rules of the newly released UnionPay cards in Africa, before leaving for China, customers can put US dollars into their account and the money can then be automatically converted into yuan at the current exchange rate, which greatly reduces the risk of carrying cash and exchange rate fluctuation." "With a strong record in China and the wider Asia region, we are well-positioned to facilitate the growth of business and consumption in Asia and the rest of the world." "As a relatively young player in the global payments industry, we are committed to the company's brand promise." UnionPay will continue to invest in human resources, business innovation and infrastructure enhancement, and partner closely with banks, merchants and cardholders, he says. With the increasing use of e-money worldwide, Wang says, plastic money still remains competitive. "E-money and plastic money are payment tools in different areas and with different interactive channels. From a global perspective, the plastic money industry has put in place a great ATM and POS network with relatively mature payment technology." "Therefore, plastic money is of greater advantage in terms of convenience in carrying and using and security in payment." Wang says credit cards can play a vital role in Africa in terms of reducing the cost of financial activities. "The development of credit cards has reduced the cost of transactions in economic life and the proportion of cash carried in hand, significantly increasing economic development," he says. "On the other hand, as a service medium, credit cards have formed a bond between banks, card organizations and cardholders, placing banks and card organizations in a better position to understand users' demands and provideing them with more considerate service, thus promoting economic activities," he says. Earlier this year UnionPay established a partnership with Raw Bank of the Democratic Republic of Congo to issue credit cards, which has proved highly effective and is now being used by growing numbers of customers for China-related business, and efforts continue now to increase its local customer base. The Cim Group statement says that the three new credit cards come with advantages over local products, such as no annual fee for the first year, up to 45 days interest-free credit and secure payments with chip and PIN technology. The gold and business cards come with free travel and purchase protection insurance. Entry level for many banking services is too high in some parts of Africa for most customers, which is against the principle of financial inclusiveness that many international financial organizations, including the World Bank, are demanding. So UnionPay in Africa says it is dedicated to improving financial inclusiveness with its products. Supported by a strong global risk control center at its headquarters in China, UnionPay's conditions of business are highly regulated. It carefully considers the backgrounds of any bank hoping to join its network. They must be able to offer efficient ATM, POS and Internet banking. Unlike other cards in Africa, which require only a signature when transactions are done, UnionPay insists on the use of a security number. lilianxing@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Africa Weekly 08/08/2014 page20)

                A UnionPay employee introduces new bank card services to a visitor at a show in Beijing. [Photo/Xinhua]68 million UnionPay cards have been issued in over 40 countries and regions by the end of November.15 million are newly issued this year. China's Hong Kong and Macau, Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, and the Belt and Road markets are all major issuing markets.From January to November this year, the number of transaction of overseas-issued UnionPay cards in the Chinese mainland grew by about 50 percent.China's outbound tourism has been developing rapidly for many years, and now, inbound tourism is picking up steam. According to the data released by China's National Tourism Administration, in the first six months of 2016, the number of inbound tourists reached 67.87 million, growing by 3.8 percent year-on-year; that is 8.84 million more than the outbound tourists. It is estimated that the number of inbound tourists in the second half of this year will mark a year-on-year growth of 4 percent or more."With more people visiting China, UnionPay is facing new opportunities and challenges," CEO of UnionPay International, Cai Jianbo, said. "We not only provide payment convenience to Chinese people to go abroad, but also endeavor to optimize inbound tourists' payment experiences to support the personnel exchanges between China and the rest of the world."UnionPay International has taken several measures. Firstly, to promote the large-scale issuance of UnionPay cards in markets outside the Chinese mainland. Secondly, to build special business circles in the Chinese mainland cities and to improve trade settlement services. Thirdly, to offer exclusive offers and value-added services for overseas-issued UnionPay cards.Thanks to UnionPay's extensive acceptance network in the Chinese mainland, more and more customers like to bring UnionPay cards when visiting China.

                UnionPay mobile payments on the upswing
            </a>
            <p>
                UnionPay, China's national bank card payment processor, has seen an increase in its overseas mobile payment transactions even though traditional bank cards remain the most popular payment tool among Chinese travelers.Figures from the Shanghai-headquartered company show that its volume of overseas mobile transactions completed via the UnionPay Mobile QuickPass — a near-field communication technology payment method — and QR codes increased 150 percent year-on-year during the Chinese New Year holiday period from Feb 15 to 21. The number of mobile transactions was three times higher than in 2017.Furthermore, an increasing number of overseas businesses have started to offer UnionPay QR code payment services. For example, merchants in countries such as Nepal, Djibouti and Kenya have introduced UnionPay QR code payment services in the led-up to the 2018 Chinese New Year.In Australia, Emporium Melbourne launched UnionPay card payment services in February. Over in Djibouti, the number of stores offering UnionPay's QR code payment service will reach about 500 by the end of March, according to the company.Many businesses in Indonesia, Cambodia and Mauritius will also launch the service over the next few months.UnionPay cardholders can currently make QuickPass payments in 18 countries and regions, including Singapore, Australia and Russia. Some stores in Japan and Hong Kong have also offered exclusive discounts to UnionPay QuickPass users."Accepting UnionPay makes for simple and pleasant shopping experiences for Chinese tourists who visit during the Spring Festival holiday," said Kate Rooney, manager of Emporium Melbourne.Figures from UnionPay show that its services are available at more than 23 million businesses and 1.64 million ATMs in 168 countries and regions.Growing disposable income and favorable visa policies have pushed the number of outbound Chinese travelers to new heights. Between 2012 and 2016, the number of Chinese outbound travelers soared 47 percent to 122 million from 83.2 million, according to the China National Tourism Administration.The United Nations World Tourism Organization also reported that Chinese travelers spent $261.1 billion in 2016, the most in the world and double that of the United States.As such, payment service providers are looking to capitalize on the boom by offering incentives to users. For example, tourists who use WeChat Pay, a Chinese mobile wallet that presently has about 800 million users, stand to enjoy cash rebates and discounts if their total expenditure crosses the $75 threshold."As mobile payment is increasingly welcomed by outbound tourists from the Chinese mainland, WeChat Pay plans to constantly invest in its cross-border business, with the aim of duplicating the domestic WeChat lifestyle overseas," said Grace Yin, WeChat Pay director for overseas operation.Alipay, the mobile payment leader in China and WeChat Pay's biggest rival, has also set its sights on seizing a larger share of the overseas market. Apart from making its payment services available in overseas scenic spots and shopping malls, Alipay's parent company Ant Financial has also invested or partnered with local financial technology firms to boost its footprint. Ant Financial's portfolio now includes India's Paytm, South Korea's Kakao Pay, Thailand's Ascend Money and Mynth from the Philippines.
