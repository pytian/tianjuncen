                Shanghai Symphony Orchestra concludes world tour
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                With the melodies of Chinese ballad Jasmine Blossom and British pop classic Hey Jude, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra concluded a successful debut concert at the BBC Proms on Sept 1. This appearance also marked the completion of the orchestra's 140th anniversary tour of the world.The Proms festival has been an annual celebration of classical music held during the summer. Founded in 1895, the concerts and events are now organized and broadcast by the BBC.The concert by the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra was among the highlights this year, as listed by Cultural Whisper, an art portal in the UK. According to David Pickard, director of the BBC Proms, the festival features more than 100 shows every year, but no more than 10 orchestras from overseas are invited."We chose the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra because we believe that it is a first class orchestra and is an outstanding representative of Chinese symphony music, even in the global music scene," he said.

                    UK brand takes the art route
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Tony Wang, who has been living in London since high school, says: "The weather is always the best topic to start a conversation with here, and complaining about wet shoes and a destroyed hairstyle can bring people closer."I spend most of my time thinking about two things: what to eat, except potato, and what to wear to handle another cold, windy, rainy day."As early as 1894, John Barbour had already noticed the trouble that came with volatile weather and also the need for waterproof clothing. So, he started by supplying oilskins to outdoor workers, such as fishermen and sailors.He soon opened his first store, named J. Barbour & Sons, in South Shields, a port on the River Tyne in the northeast of England.Now, 125 years later, Barbour is a family business that's been passed down five generations.The brand's most iconic product, the jacket with a rugged weatherproof waxed cotton shell, corduroy collar, corrosion-proof brass buttons and pockets for storage and drainage eyelets, has been improved over the decades, but it is still manufactured by hand.The brand has now reached over 40 countries, including China. And it gathered three Royal Warrants as manufacturers of waterproof and protective clothing: 1974 from the Duke of Edinburgh; 1982 from the Queen and in 1987 from the Prince of Wales.On the official website of Barbour, many people share their stories related to the brand.One of them is Laura Hiscox, who writes: "The slightly waxy feel and reassuring touch of a Barbour jacket has been in my memory since I was single digit in age ... I grew up wearing a wax jacket, learning how to ride and care for horses, walking with my parents in the countryside, being sure to have it at music festivals."When I was given a leaving gift from an estate I was working at they gave me vouchers to get a new Barbour, knowing mine was decades old. I went and modernized my jacket and got the one I still wear today."Nina Planck, who is the founder of the London Farmers Markets, claims that she never regrets the decision of purchasing a Barbour jacket.Writing about it, she goes: I went to an agricultural supply store asking for a waterproof jacket I could wear in all seasons that would resist scratchy things, like twigs and briars, and might be roomy enough to go over a woolly jumper on cold walks. It would have pockets and be comfortable and durable. I'll never forget the man in the shop telling me, 'I know just the thing,' in that confident cheery way of British country people, and when he brought it, it was indeed perfect."This year, the British brand Barbour marks its 125th anniversary. And besides improving the classic and professional jackets, Barbour has also been attracting more consumers with the artsy sense.For this, it has been collaborating with other brands and artists, including Engineered Garments, a fashion brand from Japan; and Alexa Chung, a British model and BBC presenter, who owns a namesake fashion brand.Most recently, Barbour made the paintings of Hayden Kays, a London-based artist, wearable.At the end of June, Kays was invited to celebrate the launch of the collaboration at Galeries Lafayette Shopping Mall in Shanghai.Kays brought two paintings this time, presenting the importance of love. One is named Look Into My Love, a colorful circle like a bull's-eye."This work is hypnotic, because I think love can make me go crazy. Love is great, and everyone loves love," he says.In the other work, Those Who Suffer Love, red and blue pigments are blended together like two pieces of a heart with a sentence written in between:" I will love you until the hot runs cold." Kays says that it's a love poem for his girlfriend.Barbour now uses these paintings on T-shirts. And the latter doesn't fill the whole blank canvas but only the left-hand side, taking the position of the left atrium like a broken heart.Born in 1985 in the United Kingdom, Kays was interested in drawing and creation from childhood. And he claims that life experience is where his inspiration comes from."I don't know if the exact moment and experience is going to be important ... It's just about connecting the dots and shaping them into an idea," Kays says.Kays says Barbour is an amazing partner, "the brand has got such a strong British identity and heritage, and at the same time, connects British brands and artists to Chinese consumers through collaboration.""I'm excited to see people wearing my artworks thousands of miles away from home," Kays says.Lyu Yi, the general sales manager of China Outfitters Holdings Limited Company, who's managing the development of Barbour in China, says: "Barbour is maintaining its British genes by combining its sense of fashion and art, to add extra artistic value to clothing."

                    Court rejects bid to block parliament suspension

            <p class="style-content">
                HELSINKI — The first legal challenge to prevent British Prime Minister Boris Johnson from suspending Parliament has failed in a Scottish court.The Court of Session in Edinburgh refused Friday to take legal action to prevent Johnson from suspending Parliament for several weeks during part of the period ahead of the Brexit deadline on Oct 31.The decision in Scotland's highest civil court is a setback for a cross-party group of legislators seeking to broaden the period for parliamentary debate in a bid to prevent a disorderly departure from the European Union by Britain.Two other legal cases are still in progress. One is in Northern Ireland and the other is in London. Former Prime Minister John Major is seeking to join the case in London to argue against suspension.Former British Prime Minister John Major says he will seek the court's permission to join a legal battle to prevent the government from suspending Parliament ahead of the Brexit deadline.Major said Friday he seeks legal permission to join a case already brought by activist Gina Miller that is designed to prevent Prime Minister Boris Johnson from suspending Parliament for a number of weeks.Major said: "If granted permission to intervene, I intend to seek to assist the court from the perspective of having served in Government as a minister and prime minister, and also in Parliament for many years as a Member of the House of Commons."Major is an outspoken critic of Brexit who had vowed to intervene legally if Johnson sought to prevent parliamentary debate on the issue.AP

                    Oldest evidence of animal mobility unearthed in Central China
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Scientists have found the fossilized tracks of a 550-million-year-old creature at an archaeological site in Hubei province in Central China in what is thought to be the earliest sign of animal mobility ever discovered.The tracks were made by an extinct millipede-like organism named Yilingia spiciformis, which translates as "spiky Yiling bug", which was named after a Chinese city near the discovery site.The fossils of the tracks and the creatures that made them were found in multiple layers of rock by Xiao Shuhai, a professor of geosciences from Virginia Tech College of Science in the United States, and by two researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which is also known as CAS."This discovery shows that segmented and mobile animals evolved by 550 million years ago," Xiao said. "Mobility made it possible for animals to make an unmistakable footprint on Earth, both literally and metaphorically. Those are the kind of features you find in a group of animals called bilaterians. This group includes us humans and most animals. Animals and particularly humans are movers and shakers on Earth. Their ability to shape the face of the planet is ultimately tied to the origin of animal motility."The study, which was published in the journal Nature, was jointly supported by CAS, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the US National Science Foundation, and the United Kingdom-based National Geographic Society.Xiao had earlier found what he believed were animal tracks at the same site several years ago. This latest find was accompanied by a fossil of the creature itself, providing the firmest evidence yet that the trails were produced by a life-form.Yilingia spiciformis was around 10 centimeters long and 6 millimeters wide. The creature had around 50 body segments, a left and right side, a back and belly, and a head and tail. The fossilized tracks were produced by the animal dragging its body along the muddy ocean floor.Bilaterians are animals that display symmetry on either side of their bodies and are capable of movement. Their emergence is considered one of the most notable events in early animal evolution.Scientists estimate that bilaterians arose in the Ediacaran Period, between 635 and 539 million years ago, but this claim was not corroborated with solid evidence from the fossil record, until Xiao and his team unearthed Yilingia spiciformis."This is a remarkable finding of highly significant fossils," said Rachel Wood, a geoscientist from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland who was not involved with the study. "We now have evidence that segmented animals were present and had gained an ability to move across the sea floor before the Cambrian (Period), and more notably we can tie the actual trace-maker to the trace. Such preservation is unusual and provides considerable insight into a major step in the evolution of animals."Xiao believes that the tracks might also display the first evidence of decision making by an animal. He said the animals appear to have been moving toward or away from something, suggesting they may have had a central nervous system."When and how animal locomotion evolved defines an important geological and evolutionary context of anthropogenic impact on the surface of the Earth," said Xiao.

                Recently, on my way back from London to Beijing Capital Airport, I thought back to my first flight on that route in 1994. Then I had wondered if there would be any culture shock, although I had previously visited Beijing in 1987 but by train. Certainly in those early days, China presented many complexities so different to everyday life back in Scotland. This time, as I surveyed the city from the air, it had indeed changed considerably over those 25 years. So much had been urbanized with increasingly high-rise buildings along with the ever-expanding tentacles of expressways. Capital Airport, of course, has transformed totally from its then small, single terminal building (today's T1).

"This is a remarkable finding of highly significant fossils," said Rachel Wood, a geoscientist from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland who was not involved with the study. "We now have evidence that segmented animals were present and had gained an ability to move across the sea floor before the Cambrian (Period), and more notably we can tie the actual trace-maker to the trace. Such preservation is unusual and provides considerable insight into a major step in the evolution of animals," Wood said in the Virginia Tech statement. Xiao believes the tracks might also display the first evidence of decision-making by an animal. He said the animals appear to have been moving toward or away from something, suggesting they may have had a central nervous system. "When and how animal locomotion evolved defines an important geological and evolutionary context of anthropogenic impact on the surface of the Earth," Xiao said. angus@mail.chinadailyuk.com  (China Daily Global 09/11/2019 page1)

                    UK work visas to be extended for foreign students
                </p>
            </a>

                The British government is to allow international students studying at United Kingdom universities to stay in the country for two years after graduating, to find work, under new Home Office proposals.The move reverses a decision made by Theresa May, as home secretary in 2012, which forced foreign students to leave the country within four months of completing their degree. That was blamed for a drop in international student enrolments.Under the new policy, there is no cap on visa numbers and graduates can apply for jobs regardless of their skills or the subject they studied. The government said part of the aim was to recruit talented graduates in disciplines such as maths, engineering and technology.The changes will apply to students who start courses in 2020/21 at undergraduate level or above. The Guardian reported that last year UK universities educated around 460,000 international students, excluding those from the European Union. It said the government aims to grow the number to 600,000 over the next 10 years.Foreign students in the UK have told China Daily the changes are welcome, but come too late for those who have started post-graduate studies."For me personally, I'm glad to hear about this policy, but unfortunately this will not apply to me as my masters program finishes in 2020," said Zhang Yishu, 23, an undergraduate at the London School of Economics from 2016 to 2019, and currently a masters student at the University of Oxford.Li Hailong, 23, was an undergraduate at the Royal Agricultural University from 2016 to 2019, and is now on a masters program at Edinburgh University."If I want to go back to China in the future, I can also have two more years of working experience in the UK after graduation, which will be helpful for my job application in China," Li said.On a less positive note, Guo Xuan, a recent graduate from King's College London, suggested that some Chinese students may find their English fluency did not meet the standard required for jobs in their specialist field."Even with the post-study work visa, some students still won't find a job in the UK," Guo said. However, (it means) students can enter the UK multiple times over the two years after their graduation. This option will certainly relieve the psychological pressure for candidates preparing for job interviews either in China or in the UK."Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, welcomed the announcement. "Evidence shows that international students bring significant positive social outcomes to the UK as well as 26 billion pounds ($32 billion) in economic contributions, but for too long the lack of post-study work opportunities in the UK has put us at a competitive disadvantage in attracting those students.However, Alp Mehmet, chairman of think tank Migration Watch UK, said the step would "likely lead to foreign graduates staying on to stack shelves, as happened before"."Our universities are attracting a record number of overseas students so there is no need to devalue a study visa by turning it into a backdoor route for working here."

                    Edinburgh Zoo set to come alive with lanterns
                </p>

                Edinburgh Zoo will glow once again this winter with hundreds of Chinese lanterns as the Giant Lanterns of China festival returns, "bigger and better" than before.The event, which is in its third year, will see massive Chinese lanterns fill parts of the 33-hectare zoo for 47 nights, between Nov 15 and Jan 26.The Edinburgh Reporter says the latest display at the 106-year-old zoo, called Giant Lanterns Lost Worlds, will feature more than 600 lanterns, which, it says, is a step up from last year's already-impressive 450 lanterns.The Scotsman newspaper said the display will chronicle 570 million years of wildlife, from the first microbes to the time of the dinosaurs.Lyndy Donaldson, events and experiences manager at Edinburgh Zoo, said: "Giant Lanterns Lost Worlds will offer visitors the opportunity to discover the amazing creatures that once lived on our planet, and help us raise awareness of the very real threat of extinction faced today by endangered species around the world."She said highlights will include a life-size Tyrannosaurus rex, a 33-meter volcano, and a 20-meter snake, as well as some new interactive elements."This year's event is bigger and better than ever, with over 600 stunning lanterns spread over a longer route … As Scotland's only Chinese lantern festival, it's a fantastic experience for all the family," she added.The hand-crafted lanterns, which were made in Sichuan province, have already arrived in Edinburgh after having been shipped more than 8,000 kilometers by train and boat.The province where the lanterns were made is dear to Edinburgh Zoo because it is the birthplace of the zoo's two giant pandas, Yuang Guang (which means sunshine) and Tian Tian (which means sweetie). The pair arrived in 2011 as part of a 10-year agreement on panda conservation signed by China and the UK.Last year's lantern festival featured creations that represented mythical creatures from both Scottish and Chinese folklore, including unicorns, the Monkey King, kelpies, and the Loch Ness monster.The massive display was made possible thanks to more than 200 Chinese artists, 50,000 meters of fabric, and 80,000 LED lights and features huge steel and silk constructions that visitors can discover by following a nighttime trail around the zoo.The first Giant Lanterns of China event in 2017 attracted more than 83,000 visitors and the event has grown each subsequent year.
