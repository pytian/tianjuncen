                Airbus pledges to enhance cooperation in China
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                European aircraft manufacturer Airbus SE said it is committed to speeding up and deepening its long-term cooperation with Chinese aviation industry players, with an upcoming production ramp-up of the A320 aircraft at its final assembly line in Tianjin.By the end of the year, Airbus will assemble six A320 aircraft a month in Tianjin, a 50 percent increase compared with its initial capacity. So far, the Tianjin facility, which has been in operation for more than a decade, has delivered more than 440 A320 aircraft, according to the company.The Tianjin A320 final assembly line, the third-largest single-aisle assembly line for Airbus after Toulouse in France and Hamburg in Germany, is on track to becoming the company's manufacturing center in Asia. It has delivered 16 A320 aircraft to non-Chinese airlines, and is in talks with more foreign carriers for more orders."Cooperating with China Mobile, the Tianjin center started to use 5G networks in late August. With 5G networks, we can connect video cameras, guided vehicles and vibration sensors with 5G mobile phones. We hope to better understand the advantages of the technology, and then apply it to our global factories," said George Xu, CEO of Airbus China.In addition, Airbus signed a cooperation agreement with Aviation Industry Corp of China Ltd to enhance its single-aisle aircraft (A319 and A320) fuselage equipping in Tianjin. The first delivery of a China-equipped single-aisle fuselage is scheduled in the second quarter of 2021. The agreement was signed during German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to China in early September."The agreement signifies that industrial cooperation between Airbus and China has expanded from the assembly of structural parts to more complicated fuselage systems. In the future, the production rate of the fuselage equipping will be in line with the Tianjin center, and reach a production rate of six aircraft a month," Xu said.Meanwhile, the completion and delivery center of A330 in Tianjin, the company's first wide-body completion and delivery center outside Europe, will soon shift its work to deliver A330neo and A350 in the next few years."More international suppliers have shown interest in expanding their business in China, and we are in talks with those suppliers. We would like to form a vertical integration supply chain in China, meaning we will purchase raw materials, do the parts assembly, then the aircraft assembly in China. We also hope to train and develop more local Chinese suppliers that are in line with global standards," said Francois Mery, chief operating officer of Airbus China.Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst, said: "Chinese aviation industry players are undertaking more important manufacturing work for global aircraft manufacturers, indicating their technologies and skills have been more recognized."Airbus now takes about 50 percent of the market share in China, compared with 9 percent in 1996.The Tianjin manufacturing center has helped the company significantly raise its market share against archrival Boeing Co of the United States.The total value of industrial cooperation between Airbus and Chinese aviation industry reached $900 million in 2018, and it is expected to hit $1 billion in 2020.

                    Legendary performer Yanni to play at Beijing Pop Festival
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                In 1997, Greek composer and performer, Yanni, was the first Western artist to perform at the historic Forbidden City in Beijing, which made him one of the most popular Western musicians among Chinese fans. Between 1997 and 2015, the Grammy-nominated musician launched five tours to China that have included visits to more cities, including Shanghai, Chengdu in Sichuan province and Guangzhou in Guangdong province. On Nov 9 and 10, Yanni will return to China with two performances at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing that will feature one of his most famous songs, Nightingale, which he wrote for China after that first concert in 1997.Yanni's performances will be part of the upcoming annual Beijing International Pop Music Festival, which will be held in the capital from October to November.Featuring live concerts, master classes and forums, the festival will gather together international acts including German piano duo Olha Chipak and Oleksiy Kushnir, Inner Mongolian rock band Hanggai, and Beijing-based folk band Xiaojuan and Residents From the Valley.Jiang Tao, general manager of Chia Tai Music Group, the organizer of the festival, notes that the event was first launched in 2015 with six indoor concerts held in the capital.From 2015 to 2018, the festival has hosted 35 groups from across the globe and has, so far, attracted a total audience of over 8 million both on the internet and at the festival's live venues."This year, we present the festival with the theme 'crossover'. We've confirmed four acts so far, but more will follow and will cover a diverse range of music genres," Jiang says in Beijing.The eponymous lead vocalist of the band Xiaojuan and Residents From the Valley, is known for her soothing voice and original folk sounds. Founded 10 years ago by Xiaojuan and her husband, guitarist Li Qiang, the band performs in Beijing every spring on the day of Guyu, which literally translates as "grain rain", one of the 24 traditional Chinese solar terms."This year, we perform during autumn and the theme of our show will be to use music to portray a man's entire life, from his childhood to his twilight years," says Xiaojuan, adding that, as well as the four members of the band, a contemporary dancer and an electronic musician will join the group for the performance.In 2018, about 24,000 indoor concerts were held around the country, an increase of more than 8.5 percent compared to the previous year, showcasing the booming market for live music performances, says Song Guanlin, deputy director of the China Association of Performing Arts.Song adds that Chinese audiences have embraced a variety of music styles ever since the country started to produce its own original pop material during the early 1980s."We will also bring international musicians to campuses to host master classes and forums, providing the next generation with the latest information about, and developments in, the world of pop music," Song says.
