                Donald Trump confirms death of al-Qaida heir Hamza bin Laden
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump on Saturday confirmed that Hamza bin Laden, the son and designated heir of al-Qaida founder Osama bin Laden, was killed in a counterterrorism operation in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. Citing intelligence officials, US media reported more than a month ago that the younger bin Laden had been killed sometime in the past two years in an operation that involved the United States. US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said last month that it was "his understanding" that Hamza bin Laden, who was thought to be about 30, was dead. But Trump had not publicly confirmed the news until Saturday - three days after the 18th anniversary of al-Qaida's 9/11 terror attacks in the US and a week after Trump's surprise announcement that a planned secret meeting with Taliban leaders at the Camp David presidential retreat had fallen through. "Hamza bin Laden, the high-ranking al-Qaida member and son of Osama bin Laden, was killed in a US counterterrorism operation in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region," Trump said in a brief statement issued by the White House. "The loss of Hamza bin Laden not only deprives al-Qaida of important leadership skills and the symbolic connection to his father, but undermines important operational activities of the group." The statement did not specify the timing of the operation, how the long-rumored death had been confirmed, or even specifically in which country it occurred. Hamza, the 15th of Osama bin Laden's 20 children and a son of his third wife, was "emerging as a leader in the al-Qaida franchise", the US State Department said in announcing a $1 million bounty on his head in February 2019. It said Hamza was married to a daughter of Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, a senior al-Qaida leader indicted by a US federal grand jury in 1998 for his role in the bombings that year of US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. Hamza had issued calls for attacks on the US and other countries, especially to avenge his father's killing by US forces in Pakistan in May 2011, the department said. That work helped him attract a new generation of followers to the extremist group that carried out the 9/11 attacks. Colin Clarke, an analyst with the Rand Corporation and the Soufan Center think tanks, said he was still skeptical the younger bin Laden had a major role "operationally". "But obviously he's got the DNA - the bin Laden name," he said. The al-Qaida organization has yet to confirm the US announcement. Agence France - presse (China Daily Global 09/16/2019 page6)

                    Weak supply chains hamper expansion of Chinese businesses in East Africa
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Chinese private investors in Kenya and Tanzania say poor supply linkages are the biggest hindrance to their businesses, discouraging them from upgrading their ventures into more sophisticated production activities, according to a new paper from the China Africa Research Initiative at the Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.The paper, Assessing Chinese Manufacturing Investments in East Africa: Drivers, Challenges and Opportunities, is based on information gathered from Chinese entrepreneurs in Kenya and Tanzania from 2016 to 2018.The local supply of spare parts for machinery was almost non-existent, they said. International shipping and customs clearance for imports from Asia or Europe, on the other hand, was costly and time consuming.Their assertions dent Africa's ambitions to revitalize the manufacturing sector. The Chinese entrepreneurs agreed with long-standing recommendations for innovative manufacturing policies and more industrial parks in the region.Some Chinese companies in Tanzania were contemplating transplanting supply chains from China, bringing in more upstream and downstream companies, the paper notes.Lack of a large pool of skilled labor was also cited as a problem by the Chinese employers. But, once African staff undergo in-house training, they are often difficult to retain, they said.The research found that uncertain government policies, especially likely during election periods, and implementation gaps have affected productivity and Chinese investment plans in both East African countries."In Kenya, the implementation of some large-scale projects, such as Wuyi's $100 million mega-supermarket for building materials, was delayed for several months," the paper said, adding that tighter government review procedures and complicated procedures such as tax enforcement in Tanzania had nudged Chinese investors to relocate to other African countries.Nevertheless, demand in the construction sector, burgeoning middle classes, attractive government policies and a relatively developed financial sector had been sufficient reasons for the Chinese companies to invest in the two East African countries.Furthermore, the private investors in the manufacturing and agricultural industries were driven by market considerations such as production costs and market proximity rather than government incentives of either China or a host country."Ownership is predominantly private, likely because investments in these industries require extensive knowledge of the local market and network, and many private entrepreneurs from China arrived overseas earlier than Chinese state-owned enterprises, with the only exception being among construction companies," according to the paper.Some of the Chinese investors were hopeful about the prospects for a continental free trade zone, which would be the largest in the world."The region, and indeed the continent is buoyant of the anticipated gains from China's Belt and Road Initiative," said George Nyongesa, a senior associate at Africa Policy Institute, a think tank based in Kenya.

                    China made true leap in past 70 years, says US scholar
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                HOUSTON - China has made a true leap in its economy and self-development in the past 70 years, a US scholar has said in a recent interview with Xinhua.The changes that have taken place in China are phenomenal and unprecedented in global history, said Jon R. Taylor, political science professor and department chair at the University of Texas at San Antonio."Lifting 700 million people out of poverty since reform and opening-up really is an impressive feature. This has had impacts globally in terms of economy and in terms of moving not just China, but the world to middle-class status, which is important because it leads to political and economic stability," he said.With the world's largest population, China has been boosting its economic development on one major theme: improving people's livelihoods. This has become a fundamental goal and a consistent priority in policy-making.According to figures released by the Chinese government, more than 700 million Chinese people have been lifted out of poverty over the past 40 years. The country's proportion of people living below the Chinese poverty line fell from 97.5 percent in 1978 to 3.1 percent among the rural population at the end of 2017."We can talk all day, and you can debate the numbers. But to lift that many people out of poverty in a relatively short period of time is phenomenal," he commented.Focusing his research on China for more than 20 years, Taylor pointed out that China has met most of its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).The MDGs, agreed by 189 UN member states in 2000, quantified eight targets, ranging from poverty eradication, women empowerment, child mortality reduction to combating AIDS and global partnership development, to address the needs of the world's poorest.By helping the international community to achieve the target of halving the poor population, China continued to grow its development strategy. Even though there can be modifications to national and local characteristics, the China Model is impressive and provides examples for others to follow, he said."If you are emphasizing rapid economic growth, starting with labor intensive manufacturing, the China Model has been copied and continues to be copied, from Bangladesh and Pakistan to Kenya, from Tanzania to the west coast of Africa," Taylor said.He also noted that China's growth and development is "unprecedented" in terms of increasing urbanization from around 10 percent in 1949 to over 50 percent today."Speaking of urbanization, we are talking about improving mortality rates both for individuals but also for children... about greater access to healthcare, to education, to transportation and infrastructure," he added.Beside economic development, China has also made great achievements in education and technology, said Taylor."The radical and rapid expansion of higher education is linked to science, technology, and development goals. When you have Chinese universities ranked in the top 50 worldwide for research, that tells you something where China is," he said."China is the leader in AI and smart technology. It is now a focus of the Chinese government for high-tech development and education," said Taylor."I can only imagine 20 years from now, how insane it is going to be in terms of the amount of people, the growth, and the development," he said.The professor recalled that when he went to China for the first time in 1996, there was not even a direct flight between Houston and Beijing. He had to make three airline connections from Oklahoma City to Beijing."Now it is a different Beijing, obviously much different," he said, adding that the new Daxing airport is opening in September, and Jingjinji mega region is being created.This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Witnessing the changes over the last four decades in China, Taylor believes although the country became more advanced, its people have never changed."It's still the same people. They are still wonderful, friendly, curious people," he added.

                    How the BRI is creating new-age entrepreneurs
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                We are in the midst of the third wave of globalization that focuses on technology creation, trade, and cooperation among developing countries, especially in Eurasia and Africa.New transport infrastructure, partly financed through the Belt and Road Initiative and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, provides the hardware of this globalization. But, people-to-people links are the crucial software.The first post-WWII globalization wave, 1945-1975, boosted trade and growth among Western developed countries. Developing countries were mostly suppliers of raw materials to the then industrialized countries.The second wave, which ran roughly from 1975 to 2010, saw the industrialization of developed countries, but most of their exports flowed to developed countries.In the third wave, we are seeing sustainable trade flows between countries in Asia and Africa, leading to fast development with much less dependence on demand from the high-income countries.April 2019 World Bank research by Maryla Maliszewska and Dominique van der Mensbrugghe estimated that total world GDP will rise more than 0.7 percent by 2030 as a result of increased trade facilitated by the BRI infrastructure.That may not sound like much, but it's a significant percentage of a huge number, so it amounts to as much as $1 trillion and will contribute to lifting 7.6 million people out of extreme poverty and 32 million from moderate poverty, according to the study.Half of this GDP gain will likely flow to BRI economies apart from China. In percentage terms, the largest return accrues to Pakistan with an increase of 10.5 percent in overall real income and the Kyrgyz Republic with 10.4 percent.East Asian economies will also see sizable gains: Thailand (8.2%), Malaysia (7.7%), Cambodia (5%) and Laos (3.1%). About 20 percent of the gain flows to China, which is estimated to see a GDP increase of 0.7 percent. Other big beneficiaries are East African countries (Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Kenya) and Eastern Europe, especially Poland.The new trade made possible by the BRI infrastructure is creating a new generation of entrepreneurs.At the Bishkek summit on June 13-14, the heads of state of the member countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization called for "the development of technology parks and business incubators in the SCO region for the purpose of improving the regional business climate and supporting youth startup projects, including the International Youth Business Incubator of SCO countries within the framework of the SCO Youth Council."I've had the opportunity to meet with lots of young foreigners, mostly students at universities in Beijing, who are working to build new companies in China or that connect their home countries to the Chinese economy. It's exhilarating to see the dynamism of these young entrepreneurs.I accompanied the students on a "walk around Haidian", Beijing's high-tech region, organized by the Zhongguancun Belt and Road Industrial Promotion Association and also met with entrepreneurs through the Global Foundation for Youth Entrepreneurship, which is affiliated with the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. I also attended a Model SCO, in which young people simulated a meeting of the SCO.Many young people are building their lives around these new business opportunities.For example, Svitlana Kutia, an MBA-student from Ukraine, has set up a company called Tech Pool CEE that connects tech companies in Central and Eastern Europe to Chinese tech companies. "Five or seven years ago we heard about Chinese copycats, but currently they are completely different. They have unique projects, unique devices, and actually unique companies. That are going global and succeeding so fast. Foreigners have to pay attention to this and think about how we can succeed in China," she said in an interview with China Daily. She notes that the business climate is safer than in her home country: "I believe the policies here are working better and because of this we can do our business."Abdul Hadi Hanan, from Pakistan, who is working on a master's degree in electrical engineering at Beijing Jiaotong University, said that the BRI is very good for countries that are still developing. For example, in Pakistan, China is investing in energy and infrastructure and is building a road, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, linking the two countries. "China is investing a lot on the education side and the infrastructure side and, after some time, there will be a lot of opportunities and jobs for the people. I think it is a great initiative. So, trade becomes easy."An MBA student from Mexico, who preferred not to be named, said: "I think what Zhongguancun and the Haidian government are doing is just amazing. They use facilities that they already have to build incubators and to link students who have entrepreneurial aspirations. It is not just money. They provide mentorship facilities and help meet regulations. This should be replicated not only in other cities in China, but also in our own countries."And, Saman Pouyanmehr, from Iran, founder and CEO of the GFYE and a recent graduate of the UIBE with a major in finance, said: "China is a unique country that offers unique opportunities and values to entrepreneurs for realizing their goals. I'm very happy that I'm in China at the same time that the Belt and Road Initiative is growing. China soon will be an influential country in the digital economy era through integration of Chinese and foreign talents, and also by introducing world-class startups. The biggest opportunities for entrepreneurs are here."Olim Alimov, from Tajikistan, who is the head of the Beijing office of the United Center for Business Cooperation under the SCO Business Council Secretariat and who also runs a consulting company and imports Russian caviar into China, said: "The Chinese government understands that small and medium-sized businesses are driving the economy now. They understand that they need to boost entrepreneurship to bring innovation. They do everything in order to make it happen for all the entrepreneurs and startups."We feel this support for international entrepreneurs in government policies. For example, in the last year, the tariffs and the taxes for many of the product lists, including the caviar, have dropped significantly. We pay now 40 percent less to bring in caviar than we did two years ago."There is a lot of government support toward building entrepreneurship parks. For example, right here in Zhongguancun, Innoway (an information exchange platform set up by the Beijing and Haidian governments) hosts many international companies. It is basically a one-stop shop. It is one window toward all the resources you can get for a startup. That is a huge, huge boost."However, there is still a long way to go to create a system of easy trade and cross-border entrepreneurship in Eurasia. Delegates to the Model SCO identified visa issues as a major barrier to young entrepreneurs. The Pakistani delegation proposed that an "SCOyouth card" be established to allow young students and entrepreneurs to travel and work throughout the region.The Russian delegation to the SCO said that a key obstacle to entrepreneurship across the region is "lack of easy information and harmonization between national bureaucracies."Other delegates said that key barriers include protectionism and competition from established monopolies.Alimov summed up the view of many young entrepreneurs: "The Belt and Road Initiative is a true vision of connectivity of the Eurasian land mass - not only through infrastructure but also through connectivity of the minds."

                    Sub-Saharan Africa's tourism shows great potential, report says
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                CAPE TOWN - South Africa has emerged as one of the highest-ranked countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, according to the latest Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report. The report, which ranks 140 countries on their relative strengths in global tourism and travel, was released on the sideline of the World Economic Forum on Africa in Cape Town. Although Sub-Saharan Africa is the lowest-ranking travel-and-tourism region in this year's report - with all but three of the countries performing lower than the global average - the region is expected to have the second-highest growth rate in tourism over the next 10 years, the report says. This may bolster the region's attractiveness to international investment in travel and tourism, it predicts. The report says Africa also has huge potential for nature-based tourism thanks to its relatively underdeveloped but rich natural resources. Mauritius is the highest-ranking Sub-Saharan country, largely due to its good business environment, and hygiene and international-openness scores. South Africa is second, followed by Seychelles. Rwanda currently leads the region in safety and security, while Tanzania ranks first in terms of natural resources. When considered by sub-region, Southern Africa is the most competitive, especially outscoring other sub-regions in tourist-service infrastructure, prioritization of travel and tourism, and price competitiveness. East Africa comes in second and West Africa ranks third. The report also says that West Africa has seen the highest growth in travel-and-tourism competitiveness in the region. The index reveals the sector's resilience but warns of an approaching "tipping point", where such factors as less-expensive travel and fewer tourist barriers increase demand to unsustainable levels. The burden of over-tourism is already being felt by many travel hot spots, the report says. Xinhua (China Daily Global 09/18/2019 page15)
