                Bilateral relations get impetus from strong economic partnershipsWhen Luo Qi first set foot on the African continent in 2012, he had no idea that he would spend the next seven years making his company one of the top three Chinese construction machinery exporters in Africa."Back in 2012, every time we sought to make a deal, we had to spend hours giving a detailed introduction of our company and the local team. Now that we have already made a name in Africa, we only need to tell about our equipment's quality and functions," said Luo Qi, the regional manager for southern Africa at Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology Co, a leading Chinese construction machinery maker.Over the past 10 years, Changsha, Hunan province-headquartered Zoomlion has taken part in several key projects in Africa, including the Algerian East-West Highway Project, Djama Grand Mosque Project, Algerian Capital Airport New Terminal Project and South Africa World Cup Stadium Project, providing strong support for African infrastructure construction.So far, the company has sold around 4,000 machines to various African countries, including Algeria, Tanzania, Kenya, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola and Cameroon. It has two subsidiaries in South Africa, offices in Algeria and West Africa, and spare parts warehouse in Algeria and Johannesburg, South Africa."In Africa, we have a localized service team of more than 50 members, providing local customers with one-stop services covering sales, service, technology, and financing," Luo said.China-made products and services have made a name for the high quality, competitive price and the better after-sales services, occupying an increasingly large market share in Africa, Luo said.The past decade has seen a marked advance in China-Africa economic and trade cooperation. Chinese firms, such as Zoomlion, have shown remarkable competence in sectors such as manufacturing, infrastructure and engineering, with benefit of tried-and-tested business models which bear similarities to the African marketplace.China has been the largest trading partner for Africa for 10 consecutive years. Last year, bilateral trade volume amounted to $204.2 billion, up 20 percent year-on-year, statistics from the Ministry of Commerce showed.By the end of 2018, more than 3,700 Chinese companies had been set up in Africa, with combined direct investment exceeding $46 billion. The turnover of the contracted engineering projects completed by Chinese companies reached $517.26 billion by 2018."With an integrated infrastructure industrial chain, advanced technologies, professional management and rich experiences, China has built a wide range of infrastructure projects that help benefit the livelihood of local people, create jobs and boost the local economic development," Chen Fei, vice-governor of Hunan province, said during the ongoing first China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo in Changsha, Hunan province.Li Yong, director general of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, said sustainable industrial development is important for Africa's economic development, and only with the combined efforts from various parties can Africa achieve the goals articulated in the key policy framework adopted by African leaders.Li said the organization is making progress together with efforts from partners like China, such as supporting the construction of four pilot industrial parks in countries like Ethiopia.Charles Kayonga, Rwanda's Ambassador to China, said his country has benefited from the China-Africa economic relationship. "China has helped us at the political, social and economic level. We have also benefited in infrastructure," Kayonga said.

                Belt and Road makes good progress in Arab world
            </a>
            <p>
                Through continuous efforts, both sides have made significant progress under the framework of the initiative The Belt and Road Initiative has been widely supported and welcomed by the Arab countries. At the eighth Ministerial Meeting of China-Arab States Cooperation Forum held in Beijing July 2018, China and Arab countries signed three important documents including the Beijing Declaration, the Action Plan for 2018-2020 and the Declaration of Action on China-Arab States Belt and Road Cooperation. Earlier, China signed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative with nine Arab countries - Saudi Arabia, the Republic of the Sudan, Iraq, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Lebanon, Egypt and Morocco. At the same time, cooperation documents on energy with five Arab countries including the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Egypt were signed as well. Further, seven Arab countries - the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and Egypt - have become founding members of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The Arab countries actively participated in the first Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing in May 2017. Through continuous efforts, both China and Arab countries have made significant progress in cooperation within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative. In the progress of key infrastructure projects, for example, China has collaborated with Algeria in the construction of the Algerian central port, with Egypt on the"10th of Ramadan" railway and main power grid transmission line, an Egyptian glass fiber production line and the Egyptian small satellite assembly test center. Besides, achievements have been made in areas such as the Abu Dhabi port in the United Arab Emirates, the expansion of the friendship port in Mauritania, and the Mohammed VI Bridge, China Reinforce Energy Cooperation in Morocco, the Road stadium in Qatar, the oil shale power station in Jordan, a power station project in Oman and the upper Atbara water conservancy project in Sudan. Financially, China has allocated $15 billion of special loans (loans for special purposes) to support industrialization in the Middle East, which consists mostly of Arab countries, and $10 billion in concessional loans (loans on favorable terms). China has also set up renminbi clearing centers in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and a joint investment fund totaling $20 billion with the two countries as well. With the efforts from both China and the Arab countries, the cooperation between them has made remarkable progress, for instance, the Sino-Egyptian Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone, the Sino-Arab Industrial Park in Oman, the Industrial Agglomeration Zone in Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates Capacity Cooperation Demonstration Park in China have been continuously promoted. China and Arab countries have also focused on strengthening dialogue and consultation, and wedding the Belt and Road Initiative in line with the development strategies and policies of the Arab countries based on their own situations. China and Arab countries strongly benefit from each other in economic and trade exchanges. Specifically, in recent years, the business environment of Arab countries has improved, and the governments have made great efforts to attract Chinese investors. Thus the Belt and Road cooperation between China and Arab countries is building a road of peace, prosperity, and opening-up for both China and the Arab world, which helps expand cooperation and serves the common interests of both sides. Arab countries are supportive of the rules of multilateral trading under the framework of the World Trade Organization to achieve the goal of realizing the sustainable development of all nations. However, there are still some issues in China-Arab economic and trade cooperation such as the unstable multinational political situation, economic policy, government efficiency as well as the legal and compliance rules in Middle East, which reduces the confidence of Chinese investors. Also, prominent financial risks make financing difficult. Al these instabilities hinder the progress and development of Chinese-funded enterprises in Arab countries. In this situation, the Chinese business community should strengthen cooperation with the Arab commercial sector to standardize and give guidance to business activities under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative. Chinese investors should promote dialogue with Arab countries on the basis of the existing industrial and commercial cooperation mechanism, with a focus on the security, taxation and employment restrictions for Chinese companies. Chinese companies should strengthen investigation and analysis of the market environment, and the political, legal, cultural and religious situation in Arab countries to improve the risk evaluation and risk control. To sum up, China and Arab countries should push forward the Belt and Road Initiative on the basis of their own situation and characteristics. And all sides must adhere to an inclusive approach toward cooperation and promote openness to achieve mutual benefits.

                Algerian interim president pledges to organize election within 3 months
            </a>
            <p>
                ALGIERS - Algerian interim President Abdelkader Bensalah on Tuesday said his top mission is working to overcome the current political crisis and pave way for the election of a new president as soon as possible.Algeria's state run and private media broadcasted the first speech of Bensalah to the nation as he hailed both the people and the security forces who behaved responsibly and professionally during the mass protest marches across the country since Feb 22 as no big violent acts have been reported so far.He also thanked the support of the military institution while "sticking to the Constitution as the only passage to overcome the current political crisis."He described the current situation as "crucial turning point in the history of Algeria," stressing that his top mission is "guaranteeing power transition to a democratically elected president within 3 months in free and fair election as stipulated by the Constitution.""An independent and free commission for preparing the presidential election will be established soon as it is should be composed of a group of independent personalities," he noted.The interim president further called for "working collectively with all parties to draw up adequate laws that frame this commission, and thus set up the cornerstone of a new Algeria."He concluded by calling Algerians to remain calm and serene ahead of choosing their new president.Bensalah is a senior official at the second ruling party of National Democratic Rally (RND) and Speaker of the Council of the Nation (upper house of parliament).He was named earlier on Tuesday interim president to run the transition era after the resignation of former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika last week.The appointment of Bensalah as interim president was proceeded through a joint session of the two houses of parliament amid the boycott of the opposition and independent members of parliament.Abdelkader Bensalah, 76, should assure the post of interim president for a period of 3 months ahead of electing a new president, in accordance to Article 102 of the Constitution.The two ruling parties of the National Liberation Front (FLN) and the RND control the majority of seats in both houses of parliament, which facilitated naming Bensalah interim president despite objection of the opposition parties.According to the constitution, the head of state (interim president) is not entitled to dismiss the government or dissolve the parliament, or even declaring a state of emergency, state of siege or war.When the session of naming Bensalah as interim president was taking place, Algerian students in the capital city of Algiers and several other provinces took to the streets as they chanted slogans calling Bensalah to quit.Activists on social media called for another massive march on Friday to reject the naming of Bensalah.Bouteflika resigned from presidency on April 2 after mass popular protests erupted across the country since Feb 22 demanding the departure of incumbent system.

                Doctor gains fulfillment through Algerian stint
            </a>
            <p>
                The gynecologist is positive that work abroad will help her get through bad daysAs a member of a Chinese medical team in Algeria, gynecologist Li Li completed 10,750 outpatient clinic services and 1,608 cesarean sections.Now that the 48-year-old has returned home after two years of hard work, she still feels delighted talking about her journey to the west. Unlike monk Sanzang's adventure in the Tang Dynasty (618-907) to seek the truth, Li's experience in Algeria was more about helping and caring.Before she went on her stint in Algeria, Li had never been abroad. She was born in the city of Xiangyang, Hubei province, and still lives and works there.Growing up in a family of teachers, Li was taught to be a helpful person and so after graduating from high school, she accepted an offer from a medical school without any hesitation.Li said she did not expect she would be able to use her specialized skills one day while she was a student studying medicine and that these skills could give her the ability to serve in a developing country in a way that many others could not.After graduation, the then-22-year-old was recruited to work at the Xiangyang Woman's and Children's Hospital and became a gynecologist. Over the next 20 years, Li worked assiduously for the hospital, but also had a lot of stress and pain at the same time. She raised her daughter on her own after her divorce."I raised my daughter alone, and that was probably the most difficult time of my life," Li said."Maintaining a balance between work and family requires tremendous energy and determination, but I had to keep going no matter what."My job is to bring hope to families welcoming new members, and I kept reminding myself that I could do the same for my family too."In 2014, Li's daughter was admitted into a local university, and that news was a great relief for her. From then on, Li decided to live a different life, so she turned her attention to a medical assistance program launched by the government half a century ago.It has been a long time since Chinese doctors started providing medical services to patients in Algeria. Since two years after Algeria's independence from France in 1962, China has been dispatching medical teams to the country to provide medical care for its people, and hospitals from Hubei province were the first to join the program.Some of Li's colleagues had been to Algeria before, and she was interested in working abroad after talking to them. For every doctor who had been there, it seemed that the two-year service had left unforgettable memories, and almost everyone told Li that she should take up the challenge."My willingness to go to Africa was more of a professional complex. A senior doctor whom I admire went to Algeria many years ago, and he shared a lot of fascinating experiences with me at a meeting. From then on, the idea of working and living abroad was like a seed sprouting in my heart," she said.

                Algerian former PM held in custody for suspected corruption: state TV
            </a>
            <p>
                ALGIERS -- The Algerian Supreme Court on Thursday held former Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal in custody over charges of corruption, state-run ENTV reported.The charges against Sellal include abuse of power, squandering public funds, and violation of public procurement procedures to provide unjustified advantages for businessmen, ENTV said.Sellal is the second former high ranking government official in custody after another former Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, during a wide-scale anti-corruption campaign in the North African nation since the fall of the regime of ousted President Abdelaziz Bouteflika in April.A total of 12 former senior government officials have been summoned for trial so far.Meanwhile, the general prosecutor at the Supreme Court requested the Algerian parliament to lift immunity of the senators Boudjemaa Talai and Amar Ghoul from prosecution.Local media said senators and former ministers Djamel Ould Abbes and Said Berkat had renounced their immunity.The current large-scale anti-corruption campaign in Algeria comes amid popular protests that denounce the poor governance and dirty money and demand the guilty be brought to justice.High ranking army officers and prominent politicians, including Said Bouteflika, brother of ousted President Bouteflika, the former intelligence chiefs Mohamed Mediene and Athmane Tartag, and the general secretary of the opposition Workers' Party Louisa Hanoune, have already been put behind bars.

"We are working with partners in China to develop industries and China is willing to offer support. China has also helped us to build hospitals... and there are other areas where we are benefiting.""The future is bright with China's continued support. China has offered the eight-initiative plan and backed its implementation with a commitment of $60 billion in investment," said Kayonga.The eight initiatives were unveiled at the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, which include areas such as industrial promotion, infrastructure, trade and green development.Contact the writers at liuyukun@chinadaily.com.cn(China Daily Global 07/02/2019 page3)

                Algeria ratifies BRI agreement with China

                Tianjin doctors to offer aid in Africa
            </a>

                Fifty-nine doctors left Tianjin for Africa where they will provide medical services in four major cities in the Republic of Congo and Gabon.After arriving on Thursday, they will assist in 16 departments including internal medical, surgery, gynecology, pediatrics and ophthalmology."The city's team has the longest history among the Chinese medical teams being sent to the continent," said Xia Yingyi, deputy director of the Cooperation and Exchange Division, Tianjin Municipal Health Commission.The doctors will provide aid to the two countries based on local circumstances and place emphasis on curing diseases, she noted.Tianjin's medical aid programs in Africa date to 1963, when two doctors were sent to Algeria.Zhu Limin, head of a former team sent to Gabon, said they tackled many unexpected challenges doing eye surgery in the country."One senior citizen was suffering from amaurosis, the most severe condition of cataracts, a condition that affects the transparency of the lenses," he said. "It is rarely seen in China."The team found support from top experts at Tianjin Medical Hospital."Via online video tutoring, my teacher took us through the operation step by step and finally helped the patient regain sight," he said.Du Jian, another doctor with the team, said they found an operating room in complete shambles during his visit in 2016."It was our team members who helped 'revitalize' the operating room," Du said.Shi Xuemin, 81, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and the first doctor from Tianjin who provided medical treatment such as acupuncture and moxibustion in Algeria, recalled that in 1963 Algerian people lined up for the Chinese traditional therapy."Some government officials, including the president, recovered, hitting the headlines in the local newspaper," he said.He expects traditional Chinese medicine and therapy to help address grassroots needs in Africa.To date, Tianjin has sent 1,296 doctors in 46 teams to Gabon and the Republic of Congo. A total of 8 million patients have been treated by Tianjin doctors.Up to 60,000 people have received operations, 13,000 have received emergency rescue services, and about 557,000 inpatients have been treated by Tianjin doctors, according to the commission.Tianjin has also set up four hospitals in Gabon and the Republic of Congo.Jacqueline Lydia Mikolo, health minister of the Republic of Congo, said Tianjin doctors and experts have greatly contributed to the training of local medical workers, and the China-Congo Friendship Hospital has the best medical facilities in the region."We expect the hospital will be bigger and stronger," she said.Denise Mekam'Ne Edzidzie Taty, former health minister of Gabon, appreciated the team's contributions and "in particular, its decision to provide assistance in the construction of its third hospital in Gabon in the near future".

                Algerian interim president calls for independent election authority
            </a>
            <p>
                ALGIERS - Algerian Interim President Abdelkader Bensalah on Sunday called for the creation of an independent election authority, as part of organizing the country's presidential elections.Bensalah was given a report containing proposals drawn up following consultations with political parties, representatives of civil society, national figures and representatives of a popular movement in the country, according to a statement by the presidency.The report also suggests reviewing the country's electoral law and to provide more guarantees for free and fair elections.In addition, the report advocates the departure of the current cabinet led by Prime Minister Nourredine Bedoui.The incumbent authority in Algeria is pushing for presidential elections as soon as possible to put an end to the political crisis that started in late February, when millions of Algerians took to the streets to demand the country's longtime leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika to resign.Bensalah took office after Bouteflika's resignation on April 2, and called for a presidential election on July 4, but the lack of candidates has prevented it.
