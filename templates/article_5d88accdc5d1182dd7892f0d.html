                Leipzig hold Bayern 1-1 to defend top spot in German Bundesliga
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                BERLIN - Leipzig defended the first place in the standings after Emil Forsberg's converted penalty neutralized Robert Lewandowski's opener to secure one point at the 4th round in Bundesliga on Saturday.Bayern Munich dominated the first half but were wasteful with their chances whereas Leipzig shocked the visitors with the 1-1 draw before the break against the run of the play.The defending champions grabbed a fairy tale start into the clash as Thomas Mueller's through ball sent Lewandowski, who had a lot of green ahead before beating onrushing Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi with three minutes played.Bayern controlled possession and pressed the hosts into the defence but yet they were unable to make the most of their chances as Lewandowski headed wide before Serge Gnabry failed to tap home Kingsley Coman's build-up work.Leipzig were unable to gain a foothold into the game but still they were able to restore parity out of the blue as Lucas Hernandez fouled Yussuf Poulsen inside the box. Forsberg stepped up and made no mistake to level the scores from the spot just before the break.The equalizer gave Julian Nagelsmann's men momentum and they started highly motivated into the second half. Hence, Nordi Mukiele's and Marcel Sabitzer's efforts forced Bayern custodian Manuel Neuer into action.Both sides traded attacks but both goalkeepers stood firm to keep the 1-1 draw as Neuer palmed away Timo Werner's efforts before Gulacsi tipped Niklas Sule header around the second post in the dying seconds of the game."We played a stunning first half but we should have scored more goals. Overall we played very well but one point is not enough. That is why we are disappointed," Bayern Munich's head coach Niko Kovac said."We didn't play well in the first half but we improved our performance in the second half. I think a share of the spoils is fair enough," said Leipzig's head coach Julian Nagelsmann.With the draw, Leipzig oust Dortmund from the top spot meanwhile the German record champions slipped to the 3rd place in the table.The following fixtures conclude the 4th round on Sunday: Hoffenheim host Freiburg and newly promoted Paderborn see Schalke.

                BERLIN — The six-year-old giant panda Meng Meng, sent by China to Germany in 2017 together with male panda Jiao Qing, gave birth to twin panda cubs, the first-ever panda cubs born in Germany, Zoo Berlin announced Monday morning.According to a press statement issued by Zoo Berlin, the first panda cub was born on 31 August at 6:54 pm (GMT 0454) following a gestation period of 147 days. Less than An hour later, the second cub was born. The cubs weigh 186 and 136 grams respectively, and seemed lively and alert. Their genders have yet to be determined."Meng Meng became a mom-twice! We are so happy, we are speechless," Zoo Berlin tweeted on Monday morning.The panda couple mated in April and later artificial insemination was also performed on Meng Meng to boost the likelihood of pregnancy, revealed by Zoo Berlin earlier in August.Immediately after giving birth, the new mother knew just what to do: she placed the tiny creature gently on her belly and began to warm it lovingly with her big paws and breath, and the soft fur of her cheeks, according to the press release."Even though these are the first offspring born to our young female panda, she is already doing a wonderful job as a mom. In the beginning, the cubs have to be fed roughly every two to three hours and are dependent on the body heat of their mother to keep warm," said Andreas Knieriem, director of Zoo Berlin.As pandas that give birth to twins usually only raise one of the cubs, Zoo Berlin has decided to actively support Meng Meng in the rearing process in close cooperation with Chinese experts from the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding."What fantastic news! The whole of Berlin is delighted about the new arrivals," Berlin's mayor Michael Mueller was quoted in the press statement as saying.Meng Meng and the cubs will be temporarily out of sight for visitors until further notice.

                Meng Meng, sent from China in 2017, is doing a 'wonderful job as a mom' at Zoo Berlin BERLIN - The 6-year-old giant panda Meng Meng, sent by China to Germany in 2017 together with male panda Jiao Qing, gave birth to twin panda cubs, the first-ever panda cubs born in Germany, Zoo Berlin announced on Monday morning. According to a statement issued by Zoo Berlin, the first panda cub was born on Aug 31 at 6:54 pm, following a gestation period of 147 days. Less than an hour later, the second cub was born. The cubs weigh 186 and 136 grams respectively, and seemed lively and alert. "Meng Meng became a mom - twice! We are so happy, we are speechless," Zoo Berlin tweeted on Monday morning.  Twin panda cubs born at Zoo Berlin at the end of August. XinhuaThe panda couple mated in April and later artificial insemination was also performed on Meng Meng to boost the likelihood of pregnancy, Zoo Berlin revealed earlier in August. Immediately after giving birth, the new mother knew just what to do. She placed the tiny creature gently on her belly and began to warm it with her big paws and breath, and the soft fur of her cheeks, according to the press release. "Even though these are the first offspring born to our young female panda, she is already doing a wonderful job as a mom. In the beginning, the cubs have to be fed roughly every two to three hours and are dependent on the body heat of their mother to keep warm," said Andreas Knieriem, director of Zoo Berlin. The team at the zoo, together with experts from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research as well as panda experts from China, have been monitoring the giant panda mother around the clock. The cubs were taking turns with their mother in a pattern of about two to three hours with her and were otherwise cared for in a warm incubator by the Chinese breeding experts. As pandas that give birth to twins usually only raise one of the cubs, Zoo Berlin has decided to support Meng Meng in the rearing process in close cooperation with Chinese experts from the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. In the past, breeding attempts with other giant pandas in Berlin had not been successful, making the twins born at the weekend a first. "What fantastic news! The whole of Berlin is delighted about the new arrivals," Berlin Mayor Michael Mueller was quoted in the press statement as saying. Mueller welcomed the fact that Berliners would "soon be able to visit the black and white twins", which was "inconceivable without highly professional work and a lot of passion". According to Knieriem, the German zoo director, only 1,864 adult pandas remain in their natural habitat. "Every single young animal thus contributes significantly to the conservation of the entire species," he said. Meng Meng and her cubs will be temporarily out of sight for visitors until further notice. The two adult panda bears were allowed to stay in Berlin for 15 years while the newborn cubs would also remain in Berlin for two to four years, said Knieriem. "Even in their natural habitat, young panda bears and mothers will eventually go their separate ways - pandas are loners," he said. "That would also be the time when the offspring would probably move to China." Xinhua (China Daily 09/07/2019 page14)
