                US betrays its disdain for sovereignty: China Daily editorial
            </p>
            <p>
                 In an obvious show of displeasure with the Solomon Islands leadership's decision to switch diplomatic ties from Taipei to Beijing, US Vice-President Mike Pence has reportedly canceled his planned meeting with the Pacific island country's prime minister on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York — or later in Washington.The cancellation of the meeting, originally planned to discuss development partnerships, is just one of the "consequences" the Solomon Islands has to face for the switch, a US official was quoted by Reuters as saying.To even suggest a country has to pay a price, no matter how heavy or small, for choosing a diplomatic partner is malfeasance. To actually punish a country for doing so is violation of its sovereignty. And the Solomon Islands is no puppet state, whose strings the United States can pull at will. As an independent, sovereign state, it has as much right as any other country, big or small, to decide what best serves its national interests and make its own diplomatic decisions.The fact that the 27 lawmakers of the island country voted in favor of the switch, with six abstaining, on Monday shows an overwhelming majority of the people in that country support the diplomatic move — after all, the lawmakers are the representatives of the people.So far, all except 16 countries in the world have established diplomatic relations with Beijing. In 1979, the US itself severed official ties with Taipei before establishing diplomatic relations with Beijing.What Pence has done is not the first irrational move by the US administration. Perhaps the US believes that, by shifting their diplomatic ties from Taipei to Beijing, the countries are jeopardizing US interests. Last year, it recalled its top diplomats from three Latin American countries — the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Panama — after they cut off official ties with Taipei and established formal diplomatic relations with Beijing.For those in Washington who still live in the Cold War era and believe China's diplomatic gain equals the US' loss need a wake-up call. Perched atop their ivory tower, the way such people have treated the countries that in recent years have established diplomatic ties with Beijing belies the US' claim that it favors bilateral relationships based on mutual respect, fairness and sovereignty as much as it exposes the US' hegemonic practices in international affairs.China is the world's second-largest economy. That is more than enough reason for any country to have diplomatic relations with it. It is surprising the US does not understand this simple fact.

                China praises Solomon Islands ending ties with Taiwan
            </a>
            <p>
                China's Taiwan affairs authority on Tuesday highly praised the Solomon Islands' decision to end diplomatic ties with Taiwan, saying that adhering to the one-China principle is the will of people and an irresistible trend.Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson of the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said that it is a right decision that will benefit the country and its people after the Solomon Islands established diplomatic relations with the Chinese mainland on Monday.Ma stressed that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of it. It is a basic fact and the general consensus of the international community.He condemned the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Taiwan's ruling party, which accused the mainland of "dollar diplomacy" and "political suppression"."It is a lie of self-deception that aims to divert attention. The DPP attempts to drive a wedge between the mainland and the rest of the world," he said.The mainland will never trade on the one-China principle, and it is clear to anyone with an international perspective and common sense, he added.Ma said the DPP is responsible for undermining the common political ground established by the 1992 Consensus and the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations.He urged the island to return to the 1992 Consensus, by saying that it is the only choice to safeguard the interests and well-being of compatriots in Taiwan and the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations.

                Beijing welcomes relationship with Solomon Islands after Taiwan split
            </a>
            <p>
                Beijing said on Tuesday that it is willing to work with the Solomon Islands to develop a relationship after the Pacific island nation decided to establish diplomatic ties with China."We believe that to establish and develop diplomatic relations with China, the world's second largest economy with 1.4 billion people and bright prospects, will bring the Solomon Islands unprecedented opportunities for development," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a news conference in Beijing.On Monday, lawmakers voted 27-0 in favor of the Solomon Islands government's decision to sever its "diplomatic ties" with Taiwan authorities and establish a diplomatic relationship with China.This once again "fully testifies to the fact that the one-China principle meets the shared aspiration of the people and constitutes an irresistible trend of the times," Hua said.When asked about the exact date to formally establish ties with the Solomon Islands, the spokeswoman cited a pair of old Chinese sayings: "When a melon is ripe, it falls off its stem; and when water flows, a channel is formed."The Solomon Islands was the sixth country to break official ties with Taiwan authorities and establish diplomatic ties with China since Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen became the island's leader in 2016.Hua also rebuked comments made by some people in Taiwan about "dollar diplomacy"."People who have been accustomed to 'dollar diplomacy' maybe cannot understand that neither principle nor trust can be bought with money," Hua said.In a statement released on Monday night, Hua said China highly commends and supports the decision that the Solomon Islands made "as a sovereign and independent country" to recognize the one-China principle.According to Hua, President Xi Jinping's meeting last year with leaders of Pacific island countries with diplomatic ties to China opened up a new chapter in their relationship.Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman of the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said the Solomon Islands made the right decision and that it will benefit the country and its people.He condemned the Democratic Progressive Party, the ruling party of Taiwan, who accused the mainland of "dollar diplomacy" and "political suppression"."It is a lie of self-deception that aims to divert attention. The DPP is attempting to drive a wedge between the mainland and the rest of the world," he said.Ma said the DPP is responsible for undermining the common political ground established by the 1992 Consensus and the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations.He urged the island to return to the consensus, saying that it is the only choice to safeguard the interests and well-being of compatriots in Taiwan and the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations.

                China, Solomon Islands establish diplomatic relations
            </a>
            <p>
                China and the Solomon Islands established diplomatic relations on Saturday, after the Pacific island country severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan.State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Minister of Foreign Affairs and External Trade of the Solomon Islands Jeremiah Manele signed the joint communique on the establishment of diplomatic ties in Beijing.According to the communique, the government of the Solomon Island recognizes that there is but one China in the world, the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing the whole of China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory.The government of the Solomon Islands commits not to have any official relations or exchanges with Taiwan, it said.The Solomon Islands was the sixth country to break ties with Taiwan and establish diplomatic ties with China since Tsai Ing-wen became the island's leader in 2016. 179 countries have formed diplomatic ties with China.On Friday, Kiribati cut "diplomatic ties" with Taiwan, leaving the island with official relations to 15 nations.Noting China has become the largest trade partner of the Solomon Islands, Wang told reporters after the signing that it is neither reasonable nor sustainable for the two countries not to have diplomatic relations.In a few days, China will be marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Wang noted that "as we mark this important occasion, China and the Solomon Islands established diplomatic relations, the timing brings a special significance and promises bright prospects in bilateral relations."China will never impose its willingness to others in foreign exchanges, nor will it pursue unilateral interests when cooperating with others, the cooperation between China and the Solomon Islands will be based on equality, openness, mutual benefits and inclusiveness, Wang said."China welcomes the Solomon Islands to join the big family of Cooperation between China and South Pacific islands nations", he added."China must and will eventually achieve national reunification," Wang said, adding that Taiwan was, is and will continue to be an inalienable part of China's territory, both de facto and de jure. This status will not and cannot be changed."Now there are only a handful of countries that have not established diplomatic relations with China," Wang said, adding that he believes more and more visionary people in these countries will speak up for justice in keeping with the trend of the times.Manele said that the decision to form ties with China is based on national interests, and conforms to the international law and is in compliance with United Nations resolution 2758, which stated that the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government of China.The establishment of diplomatic relations with China opens a dialogue for cooperation in all areas, he said.According to a statement made by prime minister of the Solomon Islands on Friday, the country's decision to break ties with Taiwan and form relations with China was made in a transparent manner.He said that formal recognition of the sovereignty of the Peoples Republic of China under the UN Resolution 2758 is supported by all UN countries except 16 underdeveloped nations, which raises questions over whose interests does this minority support of small nations serve to represent against the vast majority of the global democracy?The Solomon Islands cannot answer for other nations but to determine the most appropriate way forward for the good of the country and people, he said.The Solomon Islands will greatly benefit from the Belt and Road Initiative and will pump in a lot of infrastructure development that are directly linked to spur its economic development, he added.Su Xiaohui, an international strategy researcher at the China Institute of International Studies, said it is not unexpected that countries ditched ties with Taiwan in recent years as more of them would choose partner for cooperation on the basis of long-term development and benefits."As the international consensus and international law has laid the foundation, and China's development has brought opportunities, it has become an inevitable choice for these countries to independently and unconditionally establish diplomatic ties with China," she said.
