                Overseas Chinese in San Francisco South Bay celebrate 70th anniversary of PRC's founding
            </p>
            <p>
                SAN FRANCISCO - Nearly 500 overseas Chinese in the San Francisco South Bay area staged a grand celebration on Sunday to mark the forthcoming 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC).Chinese Consul General in San Francisco Wang Donghua said that over the past 70 years, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have embarked upon a socialist path based on Chinese characteristics, and made remarkable progress against great odds, propelling China to become the second largest economy in the world."China's development has become an important driver of the world's economic growth, contributing over 30 percent to the world's growth for many consecutive years," he said.This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the China-US diplomatic ties, and both countries have benefited enormously from each other's cooperation, said Wang."With our economic interdependence increasing and converged interests expanding, we need each other more than ever for greater development," he said.The senior Chinese diplomat hailed China's ties with California as a model relationship for China and other US states."China is now the No 1 trade partner and the No 1 source of international tourists and students for California," he noted.He said people from political and business circles in California have expressed their objection to the trade disputes initiated by Washington.Mark Green, former mayor of Union City, about 50 km southeast of San Francisco, told Xinhua that China has made great strides in technology, especially pertaining to its high-speed railway.He said the prospects between California and the Bay Area and China are going to be very strong in the future."The economic ties here are very deep and very broad. There are many industries, I think, in the Bay Area that enjoyed trading with China," said Green.

                Mayor Ed Lee biopic set to get festival screenings
            </a>
            <p>
                SAN FRANCISCO - A documentary film on Ed Lee, the first Chinese-American mayor of San Francisco, has been selected for a film festival and is scheduled for more screenings in the United States. The film Mayor Ed Lee is sponsored by the Chinese Historical Society of America, an organization dedicated to the preservation of the history and contributions of Chinese Americans in the United States. The hourlong documentary contains stories and reflections from Lee's family members, friends and colleagues. Lee, the son of working-class immigrants, was a San Francisco Chinatown lawyer, a champion of civil rights and equal opportunity, and the first Chinese American mayor of a major US city. The film has been selected for the San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival in May, Jane Chin, the interim executive director of CHSA, says. Besides the screening at the film festival, there are plans to show the film to donors and Lee's family in San Francisco and Seattle, Washington state, she says. Lee, who was born in Seattle to Chinese immigrant parents, graduated from law school at the University of California in Berkeley. And he then worked at the Asian Law Caucus for 13 years. Lee became San Francisco's mayor in 2011 and was re-elected in 2015. He died of a heart attack on Dec 12, 2017, at the age of 65. "While at the Asian Law Caucus, Ed worked on many key cases, including a rent strike by the Ping Yuen Housing Project tenants to demand better living conditions," says Chin. "Ed's work with these tenants led to victory, and he went on to continue to work to improve the quality of lives of those living in Chinatown." "As a mayor, his relations with China were very strong. So, whenever and wherever he visited China, he was welcomed, and he appreciated the gracious manner in which he and his traveling companions were received," says Chin. "Also, he was quick to return the hospitality whenever Chinese officials visited San Francisco." In June last year, when the CHSA launched the documentary film project, they had hoped to raise $50,000 at GoFund-Me.com, a popular crowdfunding platform based in the Bay Area, about 43 kilometers south of San Francisco. Through the organization, however, they raised nearly $103,000 from 117 donors in eight months. "The funds will be used to further enhance the film. And we are still interviewing key individuals who had a special relationship with Mayor Lee," says Chin. "Also, we intend to make the film available to schools so that students can learn about this remarkable man and this will entail editing the film to make it shorter to meet classroom time constraints," she says.

                Bridges across US in dire need of repair
            </a>
            <p>
                Lawmakers agree on the need to fix infrastructure, but not on how to pay for itCrumbling bridges in the United States are in dire need of repair, according to a report and the former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, but it could take 80 years to fix them.An analysis by the American Road and Transportation Builders Association of the recently released US Department of Transportation 2018 National Bridge Inventory database showed that 47,052 bridges－nearly 8 percent of the nation's 616,087 bridges－are "structurally deficient", which means the bridge needs repairs but is not unsafe for public travel.Of that total number, 1,800 are interstate bridges crossed 60 million times daily, according to the report.The number of structurally deficient bridges is actually down about 7,000 from last year's report, the association said.The Washington-based ARTBA is a non-partisan organization which advocates investment in transportation infrastructure, analyzes data from the Federal Highway Administration and releases an annual Deficient Bridge report.Bridges are regularly inspected for safety on a scale of zero to nine. Structurally deficient means that one of four key elements of the bridge is rated a four, which is poor, or below.Before, bridges could also be classified as structurally deficient if their overall structural evaluation was rated four or lower, or if they had insufficient waterway openings."The new definition does make a difference," ARTBA Chief Economist Alison Black said. "About 6,500 bridges that would've been structurally deficient are not under this (new) definition."The structurally deficient bridges provide 174 million crossings for travelers each day, and if placed end-to-end, they would stretch 1,957 kilometers, or nearly the distance between Miami and New York City, ARTBA said.The five states with the largest number of structurally deficient bridges are: Iowa (5,067), Pennsylvania (4,173), Oklahoma (3,234), Missouri (3,086) and Illinois (2,303), according to the ARTBA report.The five states with the most structurally deficient bridges as a percentage of their total bridge inventory, are: Rhode Island (23 percent), West Virginia (19.8 percent), Iowa (19.3 percent), South Dakota (16.7 percent) and Pennsylvania (16.5 percent).Notable structurally deficient bridges in 2018, according to the report, include New York's Brooklyn Bridge, the Memorial Bridge at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington connecting with Arlington, Virginia, and the San Mateo-Hayward bridge crossing San Francisco Bay, the longest bridge in California."It will take 80 years to repair bridges at present funding levels," Andy Herrmann, former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers and a bridge expert, told China Daily. "The average age of our bridges across the country is about 43 years old. When those bridges were designed, they probably had a 50-year design life."Fortunately, he said, the bridges are required by federal laws to be inspected at least twice a year."If they find something really bad, they can close the bridge,... do some emergency repairs or reduce the load limit on a bridge, ... to keep the traveling public safe."Most of the bridges in the country are not owned by the federal government, they're owned by states or counties and even private owners," said Herrmann."So those owners are the ones responsible for keeping the bridges in good repair and inspecting them, but the state departments of transportation get funding from the federal government, so getting those funds from Congress has a lot to do with how fast they can repair them."Over the past few years, there have been a series of bridge collapses in different states. In March 2018, a new 950-ton pedestrian bridge at Florida International University fell onto vehicles on a busy highway killing six people. A year earlier, part of Interstate 85 in Atlanta collapsed after a fire raged underneath an overpass. Authorities said no one was hurt or killed.A spokeswoman for the FHWA, an agency within the US Transportation department, told China Daily: "Bridge conditions in the United States have steadily improved over the years due to increased investment by bridge owners.""All states have a maintenance and preservation plan in place to ensure necessary repairs are addressed. Under the national bridge inspection program, necessary repairs or correction action must be taken, when needed, for the bridge to remain open," said the spokeswoman.$4.6 trillion neededThe ASCE estimates that $4.6 trillion is needed to repair the country's infrastructure, including four million miles of damaged roads and decaying bridges.Last month, US President Donald Trump unveiled his $4.7 trillion 2020 budget proposal and included a request for $1.5 trillion toward infrastructure by spending $200 billion in federal investment over 10 years.Elizabeth McNichol wrote in March for the Center on Budget and Priorities－a nonpartisan research and policy institute that analyzes federal budget priorities－that the budget would reduce "total federal funding for infrastructure in the long run" and that "the $1.5 trillion number simply assumes that state and local governments and the private sector will provide $1.3 trillion in support".In Congress, everyone agrees infrastructure needs fixing, but there is little agreement on how to pay for it.The federal gas tax has been 18.4 cents per gallon (3.79 liters) and 24.4 cents for diesel fuel since 1993. If Congress raised the tax by 25 cents to 43.4 cents per gallon, as advocated by the US Chamber of Commerce and the American Trucking Associations, it would raise approximately $291 billion over the next 10 years.From 2013-18, at least 28 states raised their own gas tax. But raising the federal tax to fix infrastructure brings with it facing voters in the 2020 election for Congress and the White House.Before Democrats took back the House in November, they vowed to work on a bipartisan bill to repair infrastructure.On the 2020 presidential campaign trail, Democrat Amy Klobuchar pledged $1 trillion to fix infrastructure, in part, by raising corporate taxes from 21 percent to 25 percent, if she wins the White House.It was the first policy proposal from the Minnesota senator following the launch of her campaign close to where a bridge on Interstate 35W collapsed into the Mississippi River in 2007, killing 13 people."A bridge just shouldn't fall down in the middle of America," Klobuchar said.

                Chinese hi-tech companies enjoy more opportunities by going global
            </a>
            <p>
                SAN FRANCISCO - Chinese hi-tech companies should be more proactive in going global to seek more opportunities overseas, the CEO of a Chinese hi-tech toy company, which will be listed on US stock market, said Sunday."While the Chinese domestic market becomes more competitive for businesses, visionary Chinese companies should turn their eyes to overseas markets and tap the potential to win foreign customers," said Sean Chen, CEO of China's Fujian Blue Hat Interactive Entertainment Technology Ltd (Blue Hat). The company is on a roadshow in the Bay Area this week before its forthcoming initial public offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq stock market."My company is the first Chinese toy manufacturer that exited from China's Third-Board Over-the-Counter (OTC) Market to seek IPO on Nasdaq," he told Xinhua.Blue Hat, which makes augmented-reality (AR)-powered interactive mobile games and accompanying toys, made a roadshow debut Saturday in Millbrae City, about 25 km South of San Francisco, California.The Chinese firm, which offers four primary AR game lines including AR Racer, AR Need a Spanking, AR 3D Magic Box and AR Picture Book, is going to be listed on Nasdaq under the symbol BHAT in the next few weeks."Although we had once considered being listed on Hong Kong after we withdrew from the Chinese OTC market, we finally decided to go public on Nasdaq," Chen said."The US market is the largest global market while Nasdaq is the most active and most-traded stock market in the world. That is why we came here," he explained.Chen said Blue Hat is not a traditional toy manufacturer; rather it is a company that applies AR technology to gaming and toys, and combines the hi-tech with educational products, which can facilitate kids with their learning that is boosted by technology."We have always stood for the joy of learning for pre-school kids, who can learn something meaningful via lively activities including games, and that is our value of delivering social responsibilities," Chen said."We attached great importance to creating positive content, which is key to the right games for kids so that they can benefit from learning without getting addicted to hi-tech-savvy games," said the Blue Hat CEO.Sophie Harrison, executive chairman of China-USA CEO Association (CUCA), one of the sponsors of Saturday's roadshow, said she is pleased to see Chinese hi-tech companies like Blue Hat to go public on Nasdaq."The hi-tech AR products created by Blue Hat including games and toys are most welcome on the market, and I hope Blue Hat will offer more opportunities for Silicon Valley investors," she said."The CUCA has been committed to helping more Chinese businesses come to the United States for fund-raising so that they can do business all over the world," Harrison said.Alan Nagy, mayor of Newark city in Alameda County, California, said Chinese companies going public on Nasdaq is wonderful for all because it creates more jobs."The IPO brings more revenues and more people working, just a lot of pluses about it," he said.He spoke highly of the company's idea of combining games with education. "The gaming is one thing, but if you introduce the educational aspect to it, I think that'll be a real winner because you know we need new tools to be able to teach our children.""We've got to change the paradigm of our educational system now. It's more than books alone, and I think they're finding that the children learn so much in different ways," he said.This offers them one more opportunity to learn in a way that's more comfortable for some children, he noted. "We need products like this in the educational field."

            </a>
            <p>
                ANCHORAGE, Alaska - US government biologists have launched a special investigation into the deaths of at least 70 gray whales washed ashore in recent months along the US West Coast, from California to Alaska, many of them emaciated, officials said on Friday.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) declared the whale die-off an "unusual mortality event," a designation that triggers greater scrutiny and allocation of more resources to determine the cause.So far this year, 37 dead gray whales have turned up in California waters, three in Oregon, 25 in Washington state and five in Alaska, say officials of NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service. Five more were found in British Columbia.The most recent dead whale in Alaska was spotted last week near Chignik Bay on the Alaska peninsula.Many have little body fat, leading experts to suspect the die-off is caused by declining food sources in the dramatically warming waters of the northern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea off Alaska.The gray whales summer there, consuming most of a year's worth of nourishment to pack on the blubber they need to carry them through the migration south to wintering grounds off Mexico and back north to feeding grounds off Alaska.Sea ice has been at or near record lows in the Bering and Chukchi, and water temperatures have been persistently much higher than normal, an apparent consequence of human-caused climate change, scientists say.The conditions the whales encountered last summer could be hurting the animals now as they make their annual migration north, said scientists assembled by NOAA for a teleconference on Friday."The Arctic is changing very, very quickly, and the whales are going to have to adjust to that," Sue Moore, a University of Washington oceanographer, told reporters.Lack of sea ice may be reducing supplies of the tiny crustaceans known as amphipods that are the gray whales' prime food source, Moore said."The sea ice has been changing very quickly over the last decade or so," she said.Another theory is that the number of whales has reached the limits of the environment's natural capacity to sustain further population growth, scientists said on the call.The current estimated population of eastern North Pacific gray whales is about 27,000, the highest recorded by the agency since it began gray whale surveys in 1967, said biologist David Weller."Keep in mind that carrying capacity is not a hard ceiling, but that it's a shifting threshold," said Weller, who is with the agency's Southwest Fisheries Science Center in San Diego." In some years or period of years the environment is capable of supporting more whales than in other years."The deaths could be caused by a combination of factors, as in other die-offs, the scientists said.Some whales have detoured into places like San Francisco Bay and Puget Sound, where they face a greater risk of ship strikes and other hazards, said John Calambokidis, a biologist and gray whale expert with the Cascadia Research Collective."We are seeing lots of live gray whales in unusual areas, some of them clearly emaciated, trying to feed," he said.More dead whales are expected to wash ashore during the northward migration, the scientists said. The total of dead whales documented probably represents a small fraction of those that have perished in the current episode, they said.The last major West Coast gray whale die-off, in 1999 and 2000, was believed to have been related to an ocean-warming El Nino event. It also triggered an unusual mortality event declaration.Reuters

                Two bay areas, one in US, one in China, stress cooperation
            </a>
            <p>
                Officials and business leaders in China and the US are urging continued cooperation at the subnational level despite the economic tensions between the two countries."We strongly support cooperation at the subnational level. We certainly understand that this is a particularly difficult environment in the US-China relationship," Myron Brilliant, executive vice-president of the US Chamber of Commerce, told the China (Guangdong) Investment Cooperation Conference in San Francisco on Friday.He said the relations will strengthen and improve when both sides continue to do business and invest in ties that must exist between the two nations."Since we began diplomatic relations, the economic growth has been to the benefit of both countries. I think we all agree this is a pivotal moment in the US-China relationship, which is simply too big to fail," said Brilliant.The conference, co-organized by Guangdong province and the US Chamber of Commerce, aimed to promote economic and trade ties between Guangdong and the San Francisco Bay Area. The Chinese provincial delegation, headed by Vice-Governor Ouyang Weimin, had participated in the 2019 China-California Business Forum in Los Angeles.Ouyang said the delegation has received positive feedback from meetings with state and local officials as well as business leaders. He said all he heard was the desire to deepen cooperation and partnership between Guangdong and California."Free trade is the mainstream value of modern society. Guangdong and California have a sister state/province relationship. Both two sides have made progress collaborating with each other in various areas. We set an example for economic and trade cooperation between the two nations," said Ouyang."More than 1,000 Guangdong enterprises have a presence in the US, covering wide areas. Many US companies are investing in Guangdong, particularly in biotech and elderly care," he added.During the conference, which attracted many members of the entrepreneurial and high-tech communities in the Bay Area, Ouyang also promoted the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, particularly relating to the technological innovation and advanced manufacturing industry.As a world-renowned innovation hub, the Bay Area is home to more than 20 globally-respected universities such as Stanford and UC Berkeley, as well as more than 700 research institutes, said Ouyang.He said the universities, research institutions and hi-tech enterprises in the region are welcome to cooperate with their counterparts in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to establish a high-end industrial innovation platform and commercialize their research results.Jim Wunderman, president and CEO of the Bay Area Council, said his organization has been working with China for over a decade to promote trade, business and cooperation.So far, the council has established four offices in China to support business opportunities for companies and entrepreneurs in both countries. It plans to set up another office in Guangzhou, according to Ouyang."In San Francisco, many people recognize and have deep ties into China. There are more than 2 million jobs tied to the economic relationship between China and the United States," said Brilliant. "I don't have to remind people how important it is to continue deepening these ties and partnerships."He said the two countries need to find a common ground in areas of natural synergy, such as agriculture, health, environmental and energy technologies."We need to keep our market open to your investment and trade. That's the bottom line," said Brilliant.

                Learning kung fu can help kick bad habits
            </a>
            <p>
                Learning martial arts can help children develop more meaningful habits by diminishing their addiction to modern electronic devices, Chinese kung fu star Bruce Leung Siu-lung said on Saturday."Practicing Chinese kung fu not only gives you the ability to learn the combat skills and techniques, but also keeps you healthier physically and mentally," says Leung, who appeared in many Hong Kong martial arts movies throughout the 1970s and 1980s.Leung, who was in the Bay Area to attend the Eagle Claw Cup International Wushu (Kung Fu) Invitational Tournament held in Union City, expressed concern about mobile phone addiction among young people. He says they spend too much time online, leaving them lost in real life."There are a lot of children who are spoiled by their parents and lack independence in real life, and there are some who struggle to face setbacks and even commit suicide," he says.Leung says he is happy to see many foreign people practicing kung fu in China, some of whom speak Chinese fluently."This indicates they are devoting their enthusiasm and energy to Chinese traditional culture."Chinese kung fu is more than just a set of skills and techniques. It is full of profound Chinese philosophy and core values, which focus on the spirit of love, kindness, tolerance, perseverance and strong will," says the 71-year-old, who had retired from acting in the late 1980s, but returned to the screen with Kung Fu Hustle in 2004.Leung says he is encouraged to see kung fu heritage becoming more popular in the United States, reflected by the large number of kung fu fans at the Union City tournament.More than 400 athletes competed in Saturday's event.Jennifer Dvorak, an employee with a tech company in San Francisco, says she has practiced kung fu for about two years at the Lily Lau Eagle Claw Kung Fu School in Millbrae, about 25 kilometers south of San Francisco."I got to sweat out all of the negative stuff and just train really hard. That's a good feeling," she says.Dvorak, who moved from North Dakota to San Francisco, says she finds traditional kung fu fascinating."It's interesting to learn about the values in the culture and the philosophy behind it and the history that is passed down from my master's father and seven more generations before that," she adds, referring to the family of grandmaster Lily Lau, an eighth generation grandmaster of Eagle Claw Chinese martial arts."Practicing kung fu is good for keeping you in shape and healthy," she says, noting that it is a good way to learn to "clear your mind"."To learn kung fu is also very empowering, especially as a woman. I feel like I would be able to defend myself if I were under attack," Dvorak explains.Michael Hammond, a visual art worker and part-time instructor at a kung fu school in Washington D.C., says he has practiced martial arts for more than 16 years and is inspired by Bruce Lee movies."Chinese kung fu is something you can practice for your whole life. It's very rewarding. I'm never bored and I'm always learning new things," he says.He also expresses worries that people nowadays have become less active and energetic as a result of modern life, something that kung fu can change."Modern conveniences make people a little bit more lazy," he says.
