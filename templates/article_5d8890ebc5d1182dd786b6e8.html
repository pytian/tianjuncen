                Comedian aims to win Chinese child fans with science book
            </p>
            <p>
                Performer O'Briain's guide to space translated for new audienceInternationally popular stand-up comedian Dara O'Briain is hoping to find a new audience in China after one of his science books written for children was translated.The 47-year-old Irishman, a household name in his homeland and the United Kingdom because of his frequent live performances and television appearances, is a huge science enthusiast, having studied mathematics and theoretical physics at University College Dublin before becoming a children's television presenter and comedy performer."The first I knew about this was when the published book was put in my hand, which was a wonderful surprise," he told China Daily."This translation is the cherry on the cake of what was already a hugely enjoyable project. There have been a few changes – my face has gone from the cover, replaced by a reflective visor, and they've changed the title. It was Beyond the Sky: You and the Universe but it's now Fly into Space? Are You Crazy, There's Nothing There, which is a joke from one of the first pages. I'd love to have a shelf of my book in different languages, so one in an entirely different alphabet is very exciting."O'Briain is famed for his fast-talking style and is an in-demand performer around the world, with live performances in places as far apart as New Zealand and Russia scheduled for this year.He has also performed in Hong Kong, Beijing, and, unforgettably, Shanghai."That audience was very mixed but there were about 10 locals in the front row who had obviously been told to come and see me because they were learning English," he said. "After about five minutes of listening to my accent and how fast I talk, they left because they couldn't understand a word!"O'Briain says he has been delighted by the reaction to his books in the UK and Ireland, and is keen to see how they go down in China."Comedy can be quite a cynical industry, but when I have people sending me photos of their children falling asleep with the book on their chest, or even in one case, a boy who went to school for World Book Day actually dressed up as the book itself – that's so sweet, that kind of feedback is wonderful."I must have read science books when I was a child, but I can't honestly remember which ones, only those from when I was a bit older, like A Brief History of Time, which were genuinely life-changing and made me want to study the subject. There certainly weren't any funny ones like mine."In addition to his profile as a comedian, O'Briain is also a regular co-presenter of science programs on television, including Robot Wars, the series that inspired the popular Chinese show Battle Bots."I like the science presentation but I'm aware of the gulf in knowledge between me and the real experts on the shows," he said. "It's nice to exercise a different part of my brain but creating a comedy routine is what really makes me feel good."One of the biggest thrills of O'Briain's career was to spend time with hero, Stephen Hawking, in 2014, for a documentary made by the BBC around the release of his biographical film, The Theory of Everything."When I first met him, I was so nervous I would talk for ages, not realizing that I needed to stop and give him time to compose his answer," O'Briain explained. "I felt awful when I saw how clumsy I looked, but a motor neurone disease charity said they were really glad we left that bit in the film, because that's exactly how everyone behaves at first. Working with him was a wonderful experience. He was a lovely man."

                Els excited to engage Chinese audience
            </a>
            <p>
                International Team captain Ernie Els is pumped at the prospect of Chinese fans fully backing his squad's quest for a long-awaited Presidents Cup triumph over the United States at Australia's Royal Melbourne Golf Club in December.In a media teleconference on Wednesday, the South African legend spoke of his great anticipation in the wake of Li Haotong, ranked 50th in the world, becoming the first golfer from the Chinese mainland to qualify for the International Team in the biennial competition.Mexico and Chinese Taipei will also be represented for the first time in the Dec 9-15 Presidents Cup through Abraham Ancer and C.T. Pan respectively, which Els believes is a sign of the game expanding its global footprint."I think it is so important for these players that come from China and Mexico ... this is just great stuff," enthused Els."I mean, can you imagine all the people that are going to be tuning in to the Presidents Cup. It's just a whole world that's going to be watching us for the first time."For what Mexico has done in golf, what China has done for golf throughout the years, with the PGA Tour going there and so forth, the growth of the game is just staggering.Australia's Adam Scott, Marc Leishman and Cameron Smith, Japan's Hideki Matsuyama and Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa round up the top eight automatic qualifiers for the International Team.Els will name four captain's picks in early November.The 49-year-old four-time major winner, a member of the International Team's lone victory in the series in 1998, said he's prepared to pick more rookies to fill his team's roster in his bid to defy a strong US Team led by world No 1 Brooks Koepka and captained by Tiger Woods."There's quite a diverse group still out there and we've got to get four of the best picks to complement the eight already qualified," said Els."As I've said before, it's the four sessions that we have to play team golf, and my aim will be to get the four players to complement the eight guys already qualified."I mean, there are many players...a lot of these guys are going to be playing big events in the next couple of weeks and months."You know, Kiradech Aphibarnrat (of Thailand) has kept his card very comfortably here in the US this year. So Kiradech has done very well."Kim Si-woo (South Korea) has had some injuries, but he's a tough player and can play himself back onto the team. Emiliano Grillo, Adam Hadwin, there's many other players."Els keeps emphasizing to his team that the Presidents Cup could be a life-changing experience－especially when the International Team has won the event only once previously."I really hit it right to them that this could be one of the biggest events of their lifetimes just because we are such a diverse team from around the world," he said."We have a huge following. We have players from Asia, from Mexico ... possibly from Canada. We have an audience of billions."The Presidents Cup is a unique event in that there is no purse or prize money. Players are not paid for their participation, but each competitor allocates an equal portion of the funds generated to charities of his choice.Since the event's inception, more than $49.1 million has been raised for charity from event proceeds, as well as contributions made on behalf of the Presidents Cup, including a record charitable donation of $10.7 million from the 2017 event.

                Vassalization of UK pending
            </a>
            <p>
                PM's push for a no-deal goes against will of Parliament and would put Britain in thrall to US It's apparent that since Boris Johnson became Prime Minister that a "no-deal" is very much his preferred option. Although the current Conservative Party leader assured party colleagues and the British public of his ambitions to leave the European Union in a friendly and mature manner during his leadership race, the message from No 10 on a "no-deal" Brexit has been a "do or die" promise to take the United Kingdom out of the EU by Oct 31. With both the UK and EU refusing to back down on the Northern Ireland backstop agreement, neither consumers, businesses nor public institutions can be assured that a "no deal" scenario has been ruled out, as Parliament decided. What a "no deal" means is that there will be no remaining agreements between Britain and the EU on how to manage customs, trade, travel or citizens' rights. It also means that the transition period - designed to give businesses and organizations additional time to respond to the changes - would no longer be the case. In more detail, a "no deal" outcome would create a situation where the UK would revert to WTO rules on trade, where it would have to face the EU's external tariffs. This state of affairs could result in a situation where the price of imported goods in British shops is much higher, warn UK retailers. Trading on WTO terms would also mean border checks for goods, which could cause bottlenecks at ports, such as Dover. In fact, the central challenge over "no-deal" continues to lie with the implications for logistics and supply chains across the Dover-Calais strait. Furthermore, "no deal" would also mean the UK service industry would lose its guaranteed access to the EU single market, which would affect banking, legal and entertainment sectors, among others. In fact, most economists and business groups believe "no deal" would lead to economic harm, and the Office for Budget Responsibility - which provides independent analysis of the UK's public finances - believes a no-deal Brexit would lead to a UK recession. According to a new study by University College London, a "no deal" Brexit would dramatically disrupt the free flow of data between Europe and Britain, leaving companies across the finance, hospitality, manufacturing and technology sectors facing "immense" extra costs. What is also worth mentioning is the fact that a "no deal" scenario poses a serious threat to the Union, bearing in mind that Scotland didn't vote for Brexit in the first place, and both Scotland and Northern Ireland feel their national interests are better served within the EU framework. Technically, in order to avoid a dangerous uncertainty associated with a "no deal" scenario, the UK government must pass a Brexit divorce plan into law, obtain another extension from the EU, or simply cancel Brexit. The fact is that a majority of MPs are against quitting the bloc without an agreement, and a cross-party group of politicians have reportedly started legal action aimed at preventing Prime Minister Boris Johnson from shutting down Parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit. In order to make this happen, MPs have to agree on the constructive action that would be needed to stop it. As a Clifford Chance briefing titled The UK Parliament can (probably) block a no-deal Brexit published on Aug 13 suggests: "If a majority to prevent no-deal emerged in Parliament, there appear to be mechanisms that would allow them to achieve that objective." Moreover, the briefing examines how the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 works, discusses how an alternative government may be formed following a vote of no confidence, and considers other ways Parliament could legislate to avoid a no-deal. Despite the blind optimism of Boris Johnson and his fellow hard Brexiteers on Britain's ability to become a self-sufficient and credible global player, "it's worth making the point that trade deals are about agreements with states. If the UK left without a deal, showing it was unable to have constructive conversations with close trading partners [the EU], it would not be a great incentive for third parties," says Simon Usherwood, a reader in politics at the University of Surrey. Just as Winston Churchill was eager to choose Franklin Roosevelt over Charles de Gaulle, Johnson seems to be playing on a similar populist sentiment, choosing the US leader's America over Europe. Nevertheless, as French President Emmanuel Macron rightly said: "Can the cost for Britain of a hard Brexit - because Britain will be the main victim - be offset by the United States of America? No. And even if it were a strategic choice it would be at the cost of a historic vassalization of Britain." The author is a founder and principal consultant at AK Consulting based in London.

                Strikes hit Irish beef exports to China
            </a>
            <p>
                Ongoing protests over meat prices in the Republic of Ireland have prevented officials from carrying out work intended to increase the nation's beef exports to China.A Chinese delegation of veterinary and customs inspectors was unable to enter the Kepak meat plant in Athleague in Western Ireland on Monday due to striking farmers picketing outside the facility.Irish farmers say they are not being paid enough for their cattle by meat processors and have held protests across the country since early August.The Chinese delegation was due to inspect the Kepak plant, and others in Ireland, in order to approve the sale of meat to China. The Irish government has confirmed that the delegation has completed some but not all of 12 scheduled inspections.A Kepak spokesman said the company has sought such approval for years, but the strikes have now put the process in jeopardy."This behavior today, by people who claim to represent the interests of farmers, is a massive own goal and the cost of the failure to get this site Chinese export approved will be primarily borne by west of Ireland farmers for many years," the spokesman told The Irish Times."Given the uncertainty around Brexit and the current weak meat market across Europe, China is one significant growth market that offers great potential for Irish beef and lamb."Ireland exports around 90 percent of its beef, and currently half of all beef exports go to the United Kingdom.Meat producers are concerned that this trade will be severely impacted if the UK leaves the European Union without a trade deal in place.Ireland is keen to bolster trading relationships with other markets in order to off set any Brexit-related disruption.In 2018, Ireland exported 2.8 million euro ($3.1 million) of beef to China. Ireland's minister for agriculture, Michael Creed, said the government was hoping to double that figure this year."When all of that is said and done and this issue is resolved, we will be looking for new markets for beef, and China is a very significant market with some 1.4 billion people, so it offers huge potential for Irish beef producers," Creed said on Monday.Twelve meat plants in Ireland have temporarily shut down operations due to the ongoing protests.Meat Industry Ireland, which represents the business interests of the beef and lamb processing sector in the country, said that the price of cattle has been impacted by low demand in the UK and strong supply elsewhere in Europe.But farmers argue that processors and retailers have undercut their profits to the point where current prices are below the cost of production.The Irish Farmers' Association, or IFA, has asked Creed to establish a commission on transparency in the supply chain."Farmers are entitled to know the truth about who is making what from their cattle in the beef supply chain," said Joe Healy, the IFA's president.
