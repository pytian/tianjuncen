                US Ohio governor proposes 'red flag' gun law following weekend mass shootings
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - Mike DeWine, the Republican governor of the midwest US state of Ohio, on Tuesday unveiled a series of gun control proposals including a "red flag" law which allows police and relatives to ask a judge to remove guns temporarily from individuals whom they fear will cause harm to themselves or others.The move came after two mass shootings which killed 31 people within 13 hours over the weekend in Texas and Ohio.Other proposals include background checks for most firearm purchases, more access to mental health treatment and harsher penalties for felons with guns and straw purchases, according to a USA Today report.No one thing will prevent gun violence in the country, but the changes together will save lives, DeWine said at a press conference on Tuesday."We must do something, and that is exactly what we are going to do," he said."If we do these things, it will matter. If we do these things, it will make us safer," DeWine said.Under the "red flag" law, the judge can grant what's called an "emergency risk protection order" on the requirement of police or relatives of concerned individuals.Seventeen states have enacted red flag laws. Of those, 12 were passed after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in February 2018, said the USA Today report.DeWine also proposed background checks on all gun sales, except sales between family members and a few other scenarios.Police haven't yet determined a motive for the Dayton shooter, identified as Connor Betts, a 24-year-old white male who killed nine and injured 27 on Sunday morning.On Saturday, a 21-year-old white male opened fire at throngs of shoppers in a Walmart, killing 22 and injuring more than 20 others.

                    Trump suggests tying background checks on gun buyers to immigration reform after mass shootings

                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump on Monday suggested tying enhanced background checks on gun purchases to immigration reform after two mass shootings within 13 hours shocked the country over the weekend."Republicans and Democrats must come together and get strong background checks, perhaps marrying this legislation with desperately needed immigration reform," Trump tweeted on Monday morning."We must have something good, if not GREAT, come out of these two tragic events!" said the president.On Saturday, a 21-year-old white male opened fire at throngs of shoppers in a Walmart, killing at least 20 and injuring 26 others in the border city of El Paso, Texas.The suspect, identified as Patrick Crusius and already taken into custody, is believed to have acted on anti-immigrant sentiment.Early on Sunday morning, in Dayton, Ohio, another gunman wearing a mask opened fire in a bar district, killing nine people and injuring 27 others.The suspect, who was killed at the scene less than a minute after he began the shooting spree, was later identified as Connor Betts, a 24-year-old white male.The latest episodes showed a growing trend of gun violence in the country, which is deadlocked on whether to place more stringent measures on gun ownership.Many point their fingers at the White House as they look for answers to the repeated violence, alleging controversial remarks made by the country's top leader have spurred hateful actions across the United States.In the wake of the shootings, Democrats renewed calls for the Republican-majority Senate to take up the universal background check bill that the Democrat-controlled House passed earlier this year.Republican lawmakers argued that enhanced background checks and a ban on assault-style weapons would not stop most mass shootings.It is unclear what "immigration reform" Trump is suggesting be tied to gun control legislation.

                    Trump condemns white supremacy in response to weekend mass shootings

                WASHINGTON -- US President Donald Trump said Monday the United States must condemn bigotry, racism and white supremacy in his first formal remarks from the White House, after two mass shootings killed 29 and wounded 53 within 13 hours over the weekend in Texas and Ohio.The nation was overcome with "shock" and "sorrow," said Trump, calling the shootings "barbaric slaughters" and "an assault upon our communities, an attack upon our nation and a crime against all of humanity.""In one voice, our nation must condemn bigotry, hatred and white supremacy," the president said. "These sinister ideologies must be defeated."However, Trump didn't mention any measures on gun control legislation, instead calling for stronger actions to address mental illness, violent video games and "the perils of the Internet and social media."On Saturday, a 21-year-old white male opened fire at shoppers at a Walmart in the border city of El Paso, Texas, leaving 20 dead and 26 injured.

                    FBI reviewing Ohio shooter's interest in violent ideology
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                DAYTON, Ohio — The gunman who killed nine people in Dayton, Ohio, had expressed a desire to commit a mass shooting and showed an interest in violent ideology, investigators said Tuesday as the FBI announced it is opening an investigation.Federal investigators will try to determine what ideologies influenced 24-year-old Connor Betts, who might have helped him or knew in advance of his plan, and why he chose the specific target of Dayton's Oregon entertainment district for the shooting early Sunday, said Special Agent Todd Wickerham, the head of the FBI's Cincinnati field office.Dayton Police Chief Richard Biehl said Betts had "violent ideations that include mass shootings and had expressed a desire to commit a mass shooting."Wickerham didn't say whether the FBI is looking at if the case could be treated as domestic terrorism, as the agency has done in the El Paso, Texas, mass shooting earlier in the weekend. He said Betts hadn't been on the FBI's radar. He declined to discuss what specific ideologies might be linked to Betts' actions but said there was no evidence so far that they were racially motivated.Meanwhile, public conversation around the shooting shifted Tuesday toward how to address people with mental health issues who might pose a threat of violence, as a woman who briefly dated the gunman recounted their bonding over struggles with mental illness and the governor called for more mental health support along with gun safety measures.Investigators haven't publicly offered a motive for why Betts, wearing a mask and body armor, opened fire with an AR-15 style gun outside a strip of nightclubs in Dayton early Sunday, killing his sister and eight others before officers fatally shot him less than 30 seconds into his rampage.A woman who said she briefly dated him earlier this year wrote in an online essay that Betts had "dark thoughts," including about wanting to hurt people. Adelia Johnson, 24, said they met in a college psychology class and bonded over dealing with mental illness, which she said allowed Betts to open up to her.Johnson said she was in treatment but that Betts "didn't want to seek help because of the stigma." He told her he thought he had mental illnesses including bipolar disorder, she said."When he started joking about his dark thoughts, I understood," she wrote. "Dark thoughts for someone with a mental illness are just a symptom that we have to learn how to manage."Johnson said on their first date, Betts showed her a video of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. She said Betts had "uncontrollable urges" that she called "red flags," which eventually led her to call things off in May. When she broke up with him, she said she reached out to his mother to express her concern, but she didn't elaborate on what they discussed.It's unknown whether any of the Dayton victims were targeted . Besides Betts' sister Megan, 22, the others who died were Monica Brickhouse, 39; Nicholas Cumer, 25; Derrick Fudge, 57; Thomas McNichols, 25; Lois Oglesby, 27; Saeed Saleh, 38; Logan Turner, 30; and Beatrice N. Warren-Curtis, 36.Betts was white and six of the nine killed were black, but police said the speed of the rampage made any discrimination in the shooting seem unlikely.Hospital officials said 37 people have been treated for injuries, including 14 with gunshot wounds.The shooting and another mass shooting in El Paso, Texas , over the weekend left 31 people dead and more than 50 injured in less than 24 hours.Johnson's comments add to a conflicting picture emerging of Betts, with some people defending him as a nice guy and friendly neighbor while former schoolmates recall a troubled teenager.Two former classmates told The Associated Press that Betts was suspended from Bellbrook High School after a hit list was found scrawled in a school bathroom. That followed an earlier suspension after Betts came to school with a list of female students he wanted to sexually assault, according to the two classmates, a man and a woman who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern they might face harassment.Others remembered how he tried to intimidate classmates."It's baffling and horrible that somebody who's been talking for 10 years about wanting to shoot people could easily, so easily, get access to a military grade weapon and that much ammo," said Hannah Shows, a former high classmate who remembered seeing Betts look at people and imitate shooting at them."He was someone who enjoyed making people afraid," she said.Brad Howard said he also long attended school with Betts but recalled him differently."The Connor Betts that I knew was a nice kid," Howard said.Bellbrook-Sugarcreek Schools wouldn't comment and refused to release information about his student records.Sugarcreek Township police said the only records they have on Betts are from a 2015 traffic citation. They noted without further explanation that Ohio law allows sealed juvenile court records to be expunged after five years or when the person involved turns 23.Bellbrook police say they weren't aware of any history of violence.GOP Gov. Mike DeWine said it's clear Betts exhibited anti-social behaviors in high school that should have alerted those around him to a problem. But Betts had no apparent criminal record as an adult, and police said there was nothing that would have prevented him from buying a gun.DeWine on Tuesday called on the Republican-led Legislature to pass laws requiring background checks for nearly all gun sales, allowing courts to restrict firearms access for people perceived as threats, and improving access to in-patient psychiatric care for those who need it most."If we, after a tragedy, only confine ourselves to doing those things that would have prevented this tragedy, we are missing a real opportunity," DeWine said. "So we need to look at these tragedies together."President Donald Trump, who is expected to visit Dayton on Wednesday, has said he wants Washington to "come together" on legislation providing "strong background checks" for gun users, but he gave no details.The Democrat-led House has passed a gun control bill that includes fixes to the nation's firearm background check system, but it has languished in the Republican-controlled Senate.The El Paso and Dayton killings have contributed to 2019 being an especially deadly year for mass killings in the US.A database by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University shows that there have been 23 mass killings so far this year, claiming the lives of 131 people. By comparison, 140 people died in mass killings in all of 2018. The database tracks every mass killing in the country dating back to 2006.AP

                    FBI: 24-year-old gunman in Ohio rampage was obsessed with violence

            <p class="style-content">
                NEW YORK - The gunman who killed his sister and eight other people in Dayton, Ohio, before he was slain by police had a history of violent obsessions and previously mused about committing mass murder, an FBI official said on Tuesday. FBI agent Todd Wickerham told a news conference two days after the massacre in the streets of Dayton's historic downtown Oregon District that investigators have yet to conclude what motivated the killer or whether he may have had an accomplice. Police said in the initial aftermath of Sunday morning's bloodshed they believed the slain suspect, identified as 24-year-old Connor Betts, a white man from the Dayton suburb of Bellbrook, had acted alone.

                China Society for Human Rights Studies has published an article to highlight the long-lasting, unsolved problemRecently, a number of deadly mass shootings have taken place in the United States, which have caused widespread concern in the United States and the international community. On August 3, 2019, El Paso shooter Patrick Krusius with an AK-47 rifle in hand went on a shooting spree in a busy Walmart store located in El Paso, Texas, killing 22 people and wounding more than 20. In the early morning of August 4, the Oregon District, a lively area full of bars, restaurants, and theaters in Dayton, Ohio, became a grisly crime scene, when the 24-year-old Caucasian Connor Betts shot at the pedestrians on the streets with an AR-15-style rifle loaded with 100 bullets, killing 9 people and wounding 27. These two mass shootings have once again exposed the grave consequences of the proliferation of guns in the United States. They have reflected the profound crisis in the US political and social systems and highlighted the United States' hypocrisy on human rights.Part 1 The proliferation of guns and the serious problem of gun violence in the United States
