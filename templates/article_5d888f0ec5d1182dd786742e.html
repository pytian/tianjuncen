                Police officers in Northern Ireland are bracing for a possible flare-up of sectarian violence and attacks aimed at law enforcement officials after a bomb blast on Monday came close to claiming lives. Stephen Martin, deputy chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, said the explosion in the county of Fermanagh was a "reckless and indiscriminate" attempt to kill police officers and he called on politicians to resolve issues that may have led to a recent upsurge in violence. "We need, as a society led by our politicians, to absolutely set out not just our condemnation to these people but to work collectively together," he said. "Police play their part, but police on their own are not sufficient to say 'you do not represent the society we want to live in'. We want to reclaim the prosperity we felt a few years ago.

                    UK's Johnson says Brexit deal 'touch and go'
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who spoke confidently in the past about the United Kingdom agreeing a satisfactory divorce deal with the European Union, has now admitted securing such an outcome will be "touch and go".Johnson, who had previously gone on record saying the odds of him failing to land such a deal were "a million to one", said in a BBC interview that it now "all depends on our EU friends and partners".From the sidelines of the G7 summit in France on Sunday, he said: "I think it's going to be touch and go, but the important thing is to get ready to come out without a deal."The UK is currently slated to walk away from the bloc on Oct 31 and business and banking groups have said they want it to leave with a deal in place that guarantees tariff－free trading.There is a deal on the table, one negotiated by former prime minister Theresa May that was thrice defeated by Parliament, but Johnson has criticized it heavily and said he could do much better.The BBC's Europe editor, Katya Adler, said talks on Sunday between European Council President Donald Tusk and Johnson had a "genuinely positive atmosphere" and the Financial Times said the two men will meet again on the margins of the UN general assembly in New York in September to continue discussions. Both are believed to want to avoid being known to history as the person responsible for the UK leaving without a deal.Johnson insisted in the interview issues that worry Britons, such as whether they will be able to get imported medicine in the event of a no-deal Brexit, have been taken care of but said: "I do not want… to say there won't be unforeseen difficulties."The biggest problem for Johnson in the proposed deal negotiated by May is the so-called Irish backstop, which aims to avoid the reinstatement of a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland by committing the UK to continue trading with the EU as if it were a full member until the two sides can agree a full trade deal. Johnson and his supporters say the arrangement could effectively trap the UK in the EU in perpetuity."I think, in the last few days, there has been a dawning realization in Brussels and other European capitals what the shape of the problem is for the UK," he said, suggesting that the bloc is now more open to seeking other ways to solve the problem.He also said the UK would keep a "very substantial" part of a proposed 39-billion-pound ($47.7 billion) separation payment called for in May's proposed deal if the nation ends up having to leave without a deal.He told ITV News: "If we come out without an agreement, it is certainly true that the 39 billion pounds is no longer, strictly speaking, owed."Several Sunday newspapers, meanwhile, suggested Downing Street may be preparing for a mid-October general election, based on the premise that Johnson's Conservative Party might be able to force the EU back around the negotiating table if it wins a large parliamentary majority.Johnson also met United States President Donald Trump on Sunday, to talk about a potential future trade deal between the UK and the US, something, Johnson said, the US wants in place within a year.

                    Uncertainties created by Brexit have increased
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Theresa May resigned as British prime minister in June after failing to complete the Brexit process, paving the way for Boris Johnson to be chosen as her successor by the Conservative Party. However, the uncertainties brought about by Brexit have increased since Johnson took office.Johnson is a hard-line Brexiteer, as even after becoming prime minister, he has emphasized the United Kingdom will leave the European Union on or before Oct 31. He is also prepared to settle for a "no-deal" Brexit unless the EU agrees to renegotiate the Irish "backstop" issue (that the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland remains open－as it is today－whatever the outcome of the UK-EU negotiations about their post-Brexit relationship).But Brussels has rejected the idea of renegotiating the "backstop" issue, asserting that the deal is non-negotiable. Which means Britain is staring at a no-deal Brexit, which could be disastrous for the UK economy.Also, a no-deal Brexit would further divide the Conservative Party, even threaten Johnson's prime ministership, because he does not enjoy the support of all Tory members of Parliament. For example, several important Tory MPs including former chancellor of exchequer Phillip Hammond resigned from their post shortly after Johnson became prime minister, and Labor Party leader Jeremy Corbyn plans to move a no-confidence motion against Johnson in Parliament.Also, judging by the opinion polls, the Conservative Party doesn't appear to be in a position to win a snap election, if one were to take place. In fact, the Conservatives could lose in the election.Besides, a no-deal Brexit could prompt the Scottish National Party to demand a second referendum on independence from the UK before 2021, especially because SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has said that even if the UK remains in the EU, the possibility of a referendum cannot be ruled out.Based on relevant laws, the British government should agree to the demand of a referendum on Scottish independence before one could be held. But Johnson has dismissed such an idea, intensifying the contradictions between the British central government and Scotland.The Brexit dilemma has deepened the differences among political parties, and social groups, prompting some to say Britain is experiencing the most serious political challenge in peace time.Economically, the Brexit process has had a negative impact on several fields. First, the pound sterling has depreciated by about 20 percent since the 2016 referendum, declining by 7 percent in the three months since May this year alone. While a devalued pound may be good for UK exporters, it would lead to inflation and an increase in commodity prices. Which could undermine the international status of the pound as a major international reserve currency.Second, commercial investment in the UK has shown a declining trend since 2018. Although investments increased in the first quarter of this year, they dropped again in the second quarter because enterprises are worried about the uncertainties created by Brexit.Third, the British economy's growth rate has lagged behind that of the eurozone and the United States. Actually, in the second quarter, Britain's GDP contracted by 0.2 percent compared with the first quarter, registering the first negative growth in the past seven years.Moreover, the Bank of England believes that in case of a no-deal Brexit, the UK would slip into recession which might be more severe than the 2008 global financial crisis－and GDP could decline by as much as 8 percent.As for the EU, Brexit could deal a blow to the European integration process, which would weaken the EU's influence in the international community.But Brexit would teach other European countries a lesson, prompting them to consider all the possible consequences of a political or economic move before actually making such a decision. And there is still enough reason to believe that after Brexit, the EU and the UK will not become antagonistic toward each other and, instead, will continue to cooperate in the economic and other fields for mutual benefits.The author is a researcher of the Institute of European Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

                PARIS - The United Kingdom is committed to leaving the European Union on Oct 31, said British Brexit minister Stephen Barclay on Wednesday, speaking just hours after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson moved to limit parliament's ability to derail Brexit.Barclay also reiterated Britain's opposition to the Irish backstop, a protocol negotiated by Johnson's predecessor to prevent a hard border between Ireland and the province of Northern Ireland."But if a compromise cannot be found, then we have been clear that we are leaving whatever the circumstances, on the 31st of October," said Barclay, speaking in Paris at a conference hosted by the MEDEF French business organisation."People voted for the Brexit, and it is important for democracy that we deliver," added Barclay.Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Johnson moved to limit parliament's opportunity to derail Brexit by cutting the amount of time it sits between now and EU exit day on Oct 31, infuriating opponents who accused him of leading a "very British coup".Reuters

                    Move to suspend UK Parliament increases chances of no-deal Brexit
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament has prompted an angry backlash from opponents of a no-deal Brexit, leading to protests across the country, a legal challenge and a petition with more than one million signatures.Outraged MPs accused Johnson and his government of sidelining Parliament in order to push through their Brexit plans — that could include no-deal — against the wishes of the House of Commons.After the prime minister confirmed he had obtained permission from Queen Elizabeth to prorogue Parliament, MPs from across the political spectrum, including some from Johnson's own Conservative Party, focused on fast-tracking legislation that would seek to prevent a no-deal Brexit.However, the government has defended the decision to suspend Parliament for a five-week period, likely from mid-September, and stressed the action is about launching Johnson's domestic agenda.House of Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said the outrage was "phoney", and that the move was "constitutional and proper"."The candyfloss of outrage we've had over the last 24 hours, which I think is almost entirely confected, is from people who never wanted to leave the European Union," he told the BBC on Thursday.Labour's shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner told Sky News he was "amazed" at "how easily Jacob Rees-Mogg, with what superior tone, he twists the facts"."This is a constitutional outrage," he added.Gardiner said Labour would try to force an emergency debate when the Commons returns from its summer break next week. The opposition would then try to "mandate the government" to seek an extension to the Article 50 negotiating period, thereby delaying Brexit, in order to prevent a no-deal Brexit.Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has quit her role, citing her "conflict" over Brexit as well as family reasons.Davidson's resignation will worry the Tories, as she is credited with the Conservatives' comeback in Scotland in the 2017 general election, when they won 13 seats that helped former prime minister Theresa May cling to power.The suspension plan is not favored by the European Union.The European Parliament's coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt, said the move was unlikely to deliver a stable future relationship.Writing in the Guardian newspaper, Verhofstadt said: "Taking back control has never looked so sinister".Nathalie Loiseau, a former Europe minister and a close ally of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the move heightened the chances of a no-deal outcome."We could see a Brexit without an agreement," the MEP wrote on Twitter. "It is, moreover, a Brexit without debate that is looming. From what disease is British democracy suffering from that there is a fear of debate before taking one of the most important decisions in its history?"The request to the queen was made as Johnson's Brexit envoy David Frost met senior EU officials in Brussels to continue talks.It has been noted that the move does in fact buy Johnson more time to strike a change to the proposed withdrawal deal, if there are fewer parliamentary sessions.EU diplomats remain skeptical about whether the prime minister can find alternatives to the Irish backstop — the main stumbling block — that can win over his party.Under the backstop, Northern Ireland would continue to follow many EU single market rules, while the UK would remain part of an EU single customs territory. The backstop would kick in automatically if the two sides failed to find an alternative and would apply until new arrangements could be agreed.

                    Northern Irish 'no-deal' Brexit challenge dismissed in court
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                 BELFAST - Belfast's High Court dismissed on Thursday a case arguing that a British exit from the European Union without a withdrawal agreement would contravene Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord.The case is one of a series across the United Kingdom challenging Prime Minister's Boris Johnson's Brexit strategy. Johnson has said Britain must leave the EU on Oct.、 31, whether or not it secures a deal on an orderly exit.Scotland's highest court of appeal ruled on Wednesday that Johnson's decision to suspend parliament for five weeks was unlawful and should be annulled, a verdict that will be appealed at the United Kingdom Supreme Court next week.Northern Irish rights campaigner Raymond McCord, one of three people backing the case, had argued that a no-deal Brexit would breach the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to the British-run province and that leaving without a divorce agreement was not provided for in existing legislation."I consider the characterisation of the subject matter of these proceedings as inherently and unmistakably political to be beyond plausible dispute," Judge Bernard McCloskey said in a 68-page written judgement."Virtually all of the assembled evidence belongs to the world of politics, both national and supra-national."A lawyer representing Johnson's government said on Monday that under Article 50 of the EU Treaty, the obligation to negotiate was on Brussels rather than on the member state. UK legislation in 2017 and 2018 "assumes but does not require a Withdrawal Agreement," said the lawyer, Tony McGleenan.The Northern Ireland case had also sought a legal challenge to the suspension of parliament but the court decided to hear the wider case against "no deal".Judges for Northern Ireland's Judge Court of Appeal said they could hear an appeal as early as Friday, if one is lodged. Lawyers in the case were told to return to the court with a decision at 1200 GMT.Reuters
