                Zhang helps to celebrate Houston Ballet
            </p>
            <p>
                About 30 dancers with the Houston Ballet gathered at the company's practice hall on the fifth floor in the city's downtown on a Friday afternoon in mid-August. Under the guidance of Zhang Disha, a Chinese dancer and choreographer, the dancers repeatedly practiced a five-minute segment.It was the toward the end of Zhang's three weeks working with the Houston Ballet. Invited to choreograph a dance piece for the ballet's 50th anniversary celebration, Zhang was trying to achieve as much as she could to perfect her chosen piece, Elapse.With translation help from Thea Liao, a former member of the Houston Ballet, some sporadic changes were made, and by the end of one hour, the later rehearsal looked markedly improved from the first one."This is the shortest time I have ever had to choreograph a new piece. It's has been challenging. However, this has been a wonderful opportunity and experience for me. It has improved my skills," said Zhang, who usually has had at least four weeks to create a new piece.Elapse is a 16-minute music piece that moves her, said Zhang. From the music, she created a dance to express a sense of loss and passing-away – passage of time, loss of loved ones."We are always losing something living our lives. I believe different people will feel different about my work depending on their ages and personal experiences," said Zhang.She found the music beautiful but challenging. There were only two climaxes in the music that lacked major structural change. "However, it also means that any possibility is possible."Zhang has always tried something new in her work. "I don't want my next piece to be an imitation of my last work. Under the pressure of time constraints here, I feel that I have improved my skill through the experience," she said, adding that she might have done better if given another week.Zhang was spotted by Houston Ballet's artistic director Stanton Welch, who had been watching her for some time."I saw Disha's emotional heart-pounding movement, How Beautiful Is Heaven, years ago in Hamburg and knew we needed to bring her here," said Welch.The 50th anniversary seemed to be a perfect time to do just that, and the invitation was extended to Zhang to create any piece she desired."It is an honor to be the first American company to present her work," Welch said.It's no wonder that Zhang caught the eyes of Welch.A graduate of the Beijing Dance Academy in 2002, Zhang was a member of the Beijing Modern Dance Company from 2002 until 2007. Her 2003 work Temporary Residence Permit in collaboration with Hu Lei established her as a choreographer in China.In 2007, Zhang left to explore a career as a freelance choreographer. In the past decade, she has made a name for herself in the modern dance world with her groundbreaking works and has won dozens of awards.Her Three Points in 2009 won first prize in the No-Ballet International Modern Dance Choreography Competition in Germany and first prize in the Masdanza International Modern Dance Choreography Competition in Spain. In China, she won the prestigious Wenhua Award in 2010.In 2013, legendary dancer and choreographer John Neumeier invited Zhang to perform her award-winning work Linen Braids at the Nijinsky Gala in Germany.At the 2018 USA International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Mississippi, her Sad Bird received the Choreography Award.Zhang considers the invitation from Houston Ballet the highest professional honor she has received so far."The Houston Ballet dancers are very professional and diligent. They paid close attention to my instruction and quickly grasped what I wanted to express. If they are not sure about certain things, they would ask and discuss with me until they fully understood. They are the best dancers I have ever worked with," Zhang said.Elapse will make its world premiere with the Houston Ballet on Sept 19, as part of the ballet's mixed repertoire program. It is scheduled for six performances."I have always wanted to work with US dancers. I feel incredibly honored to have my first US work to be performed by such a world-class ballet company," Zhang said.

                JELLYFISH SWIM, BIRDS FLY AS BIONIC ROBOTS TAKE OFF
            </a>
            <p>
                Inspiration from biological world key to producing devices Cai Yu developed his hobby into a career soon after he graduated with a doctoral degree in electronic engineering from the University of Houston in the United States in 2009. The then 31-year-old, who once fulfilled his dream of driving across prairielike parts of Arizona in the southwestern US, has a keen interest in wild birds - the eagle being his favorite. In 2013, reports of a raven-like robot, created by the University of Maryland, that is able to interact with real birds, drew Cai's attention and inspired him to produce animallike robots. Three years later, he started his own business in Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, and in August last year, he began to display his new bionic eagles at robotic and artificial intelligence conferences nationwide. Cai, who experienced numerous failures, carried out thousands of experiments to make the robots fly. "It's difficult to strike a balance between the power needed to propel these birds and the conditions in the air," he said. "We see more and more people investing money in researching and developing bionic robots, but how to spend this money to ensure that they are used well remains a problem." During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union provided a significant amount of funding for research into bionics, according to Paolo Dario, a professor at the University of Pisa Sant'Anna in Italy, and also director of the Biological Robotics Institute at the university. The term bionics was created in 1958 by Jack E. Steele, a worker at the Aeronautics Division House at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, and refers to the application of biological methods and systems found in nature to the study and design of engineering systems and modern technology. Dario said, "However, as some problems arose, the money that had been invested was later cut back," adding that research into bionic robots came to a standstill. But scientific research in this field led to the idea that robots could not only be used for specific practical applications, but also be prepared for future research purposes, Dario said. "For bionic robots, we need to simplify some existing processes and gain more experience from the natural environment," he said. "Inspiration from the biological world is important in producing robots." Bold ideas At the World Robot Conference in Beijing's Daxing district last month, some exhibits resembled scenes from a science fiction movie. Robots looking like jellyfish bobbed up and down in a water tank, their transparent tentacles floating on the surface. Named AquaJellies, these robots consist of a transparent hemisphere, a central waterproof body and eight see-through tentacles. A control panel is located in the body, along with intelligent sensors and adaptive systems, to enable the robots to independently determine their movements, and to track their location. The robotic jellyfish are designed and manufactured by Festo, a German multinational industrial control and automation company, which has produced various types of bionic robot for biological research and development. "The biggest difficulty in the jellyfish robot is replicating the way a jellyfish moves. By doing this successfully, we can apply this to the 'grabbing' operations of other robots," Liu Fang, Festo's Chinese marketing director, said. "We're trying to learn from those 'animals' to get inspired and use the method in industrial automation production for further research and development. We get inspired by nature through searching for principles in biology and solutions to save energy." The development of AquaJellies has led to widespread applications in the water sewage treatment industry. Placing the robotic jellyfish in a rainwater storage tank enables better control of the sewage purification system and enables the water system to be protected based on various data transmitted by sensors. "Since the robot is an independent individual itself, this means its maintenance and repairs can be carried out conveniently and quickly," Liu said. Industrial application As the bionic jellyfish floated quietly at the Beijing exhibition, robotic birds flew across the hall like flashes of lightning. The smart birds' wings are about 2 meters long and the robots weigh just 450 grams. The "birds" take off and land without any trouble, flapping their wings. Liu, the marketing director, said the intelligent birds' shape and their lightweight carbon fiber structure means that they can fly for about 15 minutes each time. "The birds are not available for direct sale to the public, but the method we used to design their linear and rotary motion driving technology can also be used in a hydroelectric generator," Liu said. The birds' bodies house batteries, motors and transmission components, as well as other electronic equipment. Their position and other information can be recorded during flight and real time data is used to ensure stability and safety when they are in the air. Liu said the company has received many requests from toy, entertainment and drone companies to buy these robots. "We'd rather use them for education and scientific research," she said. Festo specializes in pneumatics and industrial automation, but these robotic creatures are an interesting way to test innovative designs that may end up in more-basic industrial devices. "For example, to make a robotic octopus we did a lot of research on the tentacles... This is something we need in automation, where steel grabs have to 'catch' products directly on a production line, then stop, before moving again in the opposite direction. Now, we have some technical solutions that are inspired by this," Liu said. She added that the process is similar to how the car industry uses concept vehicles as test beds for ideas that could find their way onto production lines. Some companies are also producing animal-like robots for direct use in various fields. For example, package deliveries may be going to the dogs. A robotic dog named ANYmal, researched and developed by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, can provide data such as positioning, routes and maps. It can also detect smells, sounds and heat. An ANYmal weighs 30 kilograms and can carry up to 10 kg. It is not as agile as a real dog, but can move at a speed like human beings walk. The robot is equipped with laser radar and stereo-position cameras that can provide data that relates to navigation. In Beijing, at the World Robot Conference exhibition center, a battery-powered ANYmal robot, with red body and a black metal basket on top of its head, ducked through a low door frame in its path, before turning carefully and climbing the front steps of a model front porch. On reaching the front door, it raised a paw to ring the doorbell and gently slid a package onto the doorstep. These "dogbots" have been used widely in a variety of industries, such as tunneling and coal mining. Thanks to their flexible black-and-gray limbs, as well as carbon fiber and aluminum coating, they can rotate through 360 degrees and can move rapidly, both in daylight and at night. Robo-Shark in action An unmanned intelligent bionic shark diving vessel named Robo-Shark has been used for several industrial applications. Developed by Robosea, a Beijing company, these robots resemble large submersed sharks. The Robo-Shark can be used in several fields such as environmental protection and to test water quality. Last year, a scientific research institute used the bionic robot to collect hydrological information in specific marine areas near Qingdao, Shandong province, according to Robosea. Several major data collections, including information about sea salinity, temperature and depth, as well as undersea noise, have also been gathered and analyzed. Some aquariums also adopted the Robo-Shark to replace real sharks for exhibition purposes. Fu Yuhan, chief operating officer for Robosea, said the sharks' three-joint bionic tail fins are their sole source of power, and a special sound-absorbent material is used for the coating, enabling them to operate underwater with little noise. "This largely helps them to dive to the bottom without disturbing other marine creatures," she said."As a result, the robots can work quite smoothly." xinwen@chinadaily.com.cn  A staff member displays a robotic bird made by Festo, a German multinational automation company, at the World Robot Conference last month in Beijing.Wang Jing / China Daily(China Daily Global 09/06/2019 page1)

                Daqing turns to Houston for help on planning
            </a>
            <p>
                China's Daqing city wants to learn from Houston how to transform from an energy-centric city to a diverse economy for sustainable development, said Sun Miqiang, director of the Daqing High-Tech Business Incubator.On Sept 6, the US Innovation Station of the Daqing Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone opened in Houston. It's a partnership between Daqing and the WE Innovation Group."Daqing is a young city. It has 60 years' history of an oil business, and the municipality was established only 40 years ago. With a population of 3.5 million, we need to find a way to develop the economy beyond energy, so that the city can continue to develop," said Sun.Sun considers Houston a successful model of how to transform a former energy city into the diverse economy it is today. "Houston first centered around oil, then it developed aerospace and transformed into a diverse economy. We want to borrow Houston's experience to find a model suitable for Daqing," Sun said.The innovation station will focus on three aspects, said Sun."First, we will utilize this platform to let people get to know Daqing. Secondly, we possess many oil exploration and development technologies and want to share them with the world. Lastly, we want to attract new technologies to further expand our economic diversity from new material to agriculture," Sun said.Cui Guang, vice-director of the Daqing Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone, said he's enthusiastic about the program."Through this platform, we hope to work with Houston enterprises to grow together. We also hope to bring Chinese companies here to invest," Cui said.Amy Shen, CEO of WE Innovation Group, said her group aims to bring Western technologies and Eastern markets together and also have Eastern innovations meet Western market demand. Primarily, the group is focused on energy-related technologies and innovations.Headquartered in Houston, WE Innovation Group also operates innovation centers in four Chinese cities: Beijing, Daqing, Shenzhen and Qingdao."WE Innovation Group and Daqing Hi-Tech Innovation Station will serve Houston local companies' international growth needs. WE Innovation will also serve Chinese companies to come to Houston to invest in the United States," she said.Shen said a plan is in motion to bring Houston companies looking for opportunities to Daqing later this year.Jensen Shen, director for Asia, Australia and Oceania at the Greater Houston Partnership, said the collaboration will benefit both cities."I am confident that the US companies will find opportunities in Daqing, and Daqing will bring Chinese companies to Houston," Shen said.

                Yao vows to expand reforms
            </a>
            <p>
                National team's disappointing World Cup effort reflects stagnating developmentIn the wake of China's dismal performance at the home World Cup, national hoops boss Yao Ming is vowing to deepen reforms to overhaul the nation's flawed basketball development.After leading China to an eighth-place finish at the 2008 Olympics, Yao, an eight-time NBA All-Star and now chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association, is coming to grips with the real possibility that China will almost certainly snap its long streak of Olympic qualification by not competing at next year's Tokyo Games.Overwhelmed 86-73 by a stronger and faster Nigeria in front of a raucous crowd in Guangzhou on Sunday, China finished its World Cup campaign with a 2-3 record, losing Asia's only available direct Olympic berth to Iran after its continental archrival finished 17 points higher in aggregate margin of wins.Having qualified for every Olympics since its debut at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, China now has only a theoretical chance of making the cut for Tokyo by going up against global heavyweights in a 24-team qualifying tournament next June, where tickets for each of the six-squad group winners will be up for grabs.Overseeing basketball in a country where Olympic success is a major factor in allocating financial support, Yao is nonetheless determined to not let the poor Cup campaign deny his efforts to reform the sport's lagging development.Asked after the loss to Nigeria who should shoulder responsibility for China's woes, a grim-faced Yao responded, "Me!", as some outraged fans called for head coach Li Nan to step down."It is me and my association that disappointed the fans," said Yao, who took over the CBA in early 2017 as the association's first leader promoted from outside government ranks."We have been forced to open our eyes to realize how far the world has gone in front of us in basketball development," he said."Discouraged by the results, we should never let the disappointment shake our faith in carrying on the efforts in professionalizing the league, improving youth and coach training programs while expanding school participation," said Yao, who retired from the Houston Rockets in 2011.

                US-China trade friction increases risk of global recession: Chinese diplomat
            </a>
            <p>
                HOUSTON - The economic and trade friction between China and the United States increases the risk of a global recession, Chinese Consulate General in Houston Cai Wei said Wednesday.In a keynote speech at the Argus Methanol Forum in Houston, Cai said the US-initiated trade friction with China has caused direct negative impacts on both economies, shaken the confidence of international capital market, triggered turmoil in financial markets, and threatened the stability and security of global supply chain.Unilateralism, protectionism, and trade bullying run against the trend of the economic globalization and the principle of market competition, Cai said, noting that China has been a strong advocate for free trade, comprehensively fulfilling its commitments on opening the market, and strengthening protection of intellectual property rights.Noting that China has lifted more than 740 million people out of poverty and become the first developing country to achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, he said that China is "not only the most important producer, but also one of the most important markets.""Quality goods and services from all over the world are welcomed in Chinese market," he added."With social and economic development, and need to improve living standard and consumption level, the demand for various energy and chemical products, including methanol, is growing in China. That will create great potential for international cooperation," he said, encouraging more US methanol companies to enter the Chinese market.

                China made true leap in past 70 years, says US scholar
            </a>
            <p>
                HOUSTON - China has made a true leap in its economy and self-development in the past 70 years, a US scholar has said in a recent interview with Xinhua.The changes that have taken place in China are phenomenal and unprecedented in global history, said Jon R. Taylor, political science professor and department chair at the University of Texas at San Antonio."Lifting 700 million people out of poverty since reform and opening-up really is an impressive feature. This has had impacts globally in terms of economy and in terms of moving not just China, but the world to middle-class status, which is important because it leads to political and economic stability," he said.With the world's largest population, China has been boosting its economic development on one major theme: improving people's livelihoods. This has become a fundamental goal and a consistent priority in policy-making.According to figures released by the Chinese government, more than 700 million Chinese people have been lifted out of poverty over the past 40 years. The country's proportion of people living below the Chinese poverty line fell from 97.5 percent in 1978 to 3.1 percent among the rural population at the end of 2017."We can talk all day, and you can debate the numbers. But to lift that many people out of poverty in a relatively short period of time is phenomenal," he commented.Focusing his research on China for more than 20 years, Taylor pointed out that China has met most of its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).The MDGs, agreed by 189 UN member states in 2000, quantified eight targets, ranging from poverty eradication, women empowerment, child mortality reduction to combating AIDS and global partnership development, to address the needs of the world's poorest.By helping the international community to achieve the target of halving the poor population, China continued to grow its development strategy. Even though there can be modifications to national and local characteristics, the China Model is impressive and provides examples for others to follow, he said."If you are emphasizing rapid economic growth, starting with labor intensive manufacturing, the China Model has been copied and continues to be copied, from Bangladesh and Pakistan to Kenya, from Tanzania to the west coast of Africa," Taylor said.He also noted that China's growth and development is "unprecedented" in terms of increasing urbanization from around 10 percent in 1949 to over 50 percent today."Speaking of urbanization, we are talking about improving mortality rates both for individuals but also for children... about greater access to healthcare, to education, to transportation and infrastructure," he added.Beside economic development, China has also made great achievements in education and technology, said Taylor."The radical and rapid expansion of higher education is linked to science, technology, and development goals. When you have Chinese universities ranked in the top 50 worldwide for research, that tells you something where China is," he said."China is the leader in AI and smart technology. It is now a focus of the Chinese government for high-tech development and education," said Taylor."I can only imagine 20 years from now, how insane it is going to be in terms of the amount of people, the growth, and the development," he said.The professor recalled that when he went to China for the first time in 1996, there was not even a direct flight between Houston and Beijing. He had to make three airline connections from Oklahoma City to Beijing."Now it is a different Beijing, obviously much different," he said, adding that the new Daxing airport is opening in September, and Jingjinji mega region is being created.This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Witnessing the changes over the last four decades in China, Taylor believes although the country became more advanced, its people have never changed."It's still the same people. They are still wonderful, friendly, curious people," he added.

                Divide candidates becomes more acute in third Democratic debate
            </a>
            <p>
                HOUSTON - As 10 candidates took the stage here Thursday to engage in the third round of Democratic debate, the divide between the two ideological wings of the party is ever more acute, with cl*-ashes erupting on healthcare, gun control and trade policies.The battle for how the Democratic party should take on Trump lasted throughout the debate, with Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren pitted against former Vice President Joe Biden, and Senators Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker.The differences between the groups of candidates are becoming more acute as the election cycle progresses, as both sides are intensifying efforts to boost support in order to "stay alive" in the campaign.The debate imposed a much higher threshold for candidates, each of whom must enjoy at least 2 percent support rate in four national polls and have at least 130,000 individual donors. The new threshold has forced 10 candidates to miss the debate.U.S. billionaire Tom Steyer on Sunday became the 11th Democratic candidate to qualify for the fourth debate scheduled for October.

            <p>
                Democratic presidential candidates tackled the US-China trade dispute at their third debate on Thursday, with most criticizing US government handling of it.Entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who was the first to be asked about the trade issue, said: "I would not appeal the tariffs on day one, but I would let the Chinese know we have to hammer out a deal. We have to let the Chinese know that we recognize that Trump's administration has pursued an arbitrary and haphazard trade policy."US Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota talked about bins of soybeans sitting in the Midwest with no market because of the trade dispute. She said Trump is "treating farmers like poker chips in one of his casinos".

                Scola remains a 'Diamond' after all these years
            </a>
            <p>
                Yao's old sidekick belied his age to sparkle once more at WukesongLuis Scola is no stranger to Beijing's Wukesong Arena, where he led Argentina to the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics.More than a decade later, he was selected to the All-Star Five after the FIBA Basketball World Cup wrapped up at the stadium on Sunday night.At 39, Scola was the oldest player in the tournament, but he averaged 17.9 points and 8.1 rebounds in his fifth World Cup, helping Argentina finish runner-up to champion Spain.Scola was held scoreless in the first half of Sunday's final and finished with just eight points and eight assists, but that didn't diminish his overall contribution."Scola is our leader. He is a time-stolen man. He got up at six in the morning and made himself better and better and better throughout the tournament," said Argentina coach Sergio Hernandez.In fact, Scola achieved all the goals he set for himself at the World Cup, ticking off each objective in a Twitter post: "First goal: pass the group. Second goal: enter the quarters. Third goal: qualify for the Olympic Games. Fourth goal: enter the semis. Fifth goal: win a medal."As Chinese legend Yao Ming's teammate with the NBA's Houston Rockets, Scola won the hearts of Chinese fans and earned the nickname "Diamond" at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, impressing the crowds at Wukesong with his long hair and smart playmaking.At the World Cup, he sported a different look."The hair is a little bit white now. I like it long, but when it gets white, it feels weird," Scola said after Argentina secured its quarterfinal berth with an 87-67 rout of Venezuela.The flowing locks might be gone, but his determination remains as strong as ever.Scola didn't enter the NBA until he was 27. He was a 2002 second-round draft pick of the San Antonio Spurs but didn't play an NBA season until 2007-08. He gained renown as a stalwart of the Argentine national team that defeated Team USA and won Olympic gold at the 2004 Athens Games, among other accomplishments.Scola was a star in Europe, playing mostly in Spain, but could never join fellow Argentine standout Manu Ginobili on the Spurs due to buyout constraints with his team in Europe.After a decade in the NBA that included stops in Houston, Phoenix, Indianapolis, Toronto and Brooklyn, he joined the Chinese Basketball Association's Shanxi Loongs in 2017, then transferred to Yao's old team, the Shanghai Sharks.As the only member of Argentina's 2004 Olympic champions still playing for the national team, Scola has a wealth of international experience-but he was cautious heading into the World Cup.Although he enjoys popularity among Chinese media, the Argentine star remained silent in front of local journalists but showed his friendliness by patting their shoulders or giving them high-fives. He didn't speak to them until his team made it to the last eight."I understand everyone talks about my age, but my brain is not functioning that way," said the 6-foot-9 forward. "I just enjoy playing and helping my team win."In the semifinal, Scola displayed his offensive versatility by finishing with 28 points and 13 rebounds in the victory over France-offering a strong indication he could again be a force to be reckoned with at next year's Tokyo Olympics.In other words, just what his" Diamond" nickname suggests: A solid, shiny, time-honored jewel.Xinhua
