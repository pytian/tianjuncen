                Typhoon hits Fujian and Guangdong
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Battering by Bailu leads to cancellation of over 220 flights and about 30 trainsTyphoon Bailu made landfall on the coast of eastern China's Fujian province on Sunday morning and later swept over Guangdong province, bringing gales and torrential rains, China's national observatory said.The National Meteorological Centre issued a yellow alert－the third-highest level of China's four-tier color-coded weather warning system－on Sunday, predicting strong winds and rainstorms in Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Hunan provinces as well as the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. It predicted as much as 60 millimeters of rain an hour in some places.The typhoon, the 11th this year, made landfall in Dongshan county, southern Fujian, at 7:25 am. It forced businesses to shut down in affected areas and led to the cancellation of flights and trains.Airlines in Fujian canceled over 220 flights, starting on Saturday, and temporarily suspended about 30 train services to or from the province. The typhoon also halted ferry services between Xiamen in Fujian and Jinmen in Taiwan, and between Pingtan in Fujian and Taichung in Taiwan.The province's flood control and drought relief headquarters recalled 9,926 fishing vessels to port or safe sea areas and evacuated 81,170 people as it braced for Bailu. Local authorities also closed 149 seaside scenic spots and 1,318 construction sites due to safety concerns.Nearly 57,700 grassroots officials in the province were deployed in a bid to guide disaster prevention and relief work, the headquarters said.Tang Dengjie, Fujian's governor, said on Saturday that local government agencies responsible for guarding against typhoon hazards should be on duty 24 hours a day to ramp up warning efforts and evacuate residents in a timely manner.The typhoon also brought heavy rain to the neighboring province of Guangdong as it moved northwest at about 25 kilometers an hour, with maximum wind speeds near its center of 65 km/h, according to the observatory.Guangdong raised its emergency response to Level III－the third-highest level in China's four-level typhoon emergency response system－on Sunday due to the typhoon's intensity and potential impact.The Guangdong Power Grid Corporation deployed over 30,000 workers for emergency repairs, as well as more than 300 power generation vehicles and over 400 sets of satellite communication equipment.According to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, over 3,500 firefighters and commanders with rescue equipment were put on standby for rescue missions across the affected regions, and more than 960 soldiers had been deployed for typhoon relief work.The observatory said another typhoon forming in the West Pacific is predicted to land on the southeast coast of China around the end of this month.Li Wenfang contributed to this story.

                The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Ministerial Meeting held in Beijing on Aug 2-3, along with the 27th round of RCEP negotiations in Zhengzhou, Central China's Henan province, on July 22-30, has helped make some important breakthroughs.In terms of market entry, more than two-thirds of the bilateral negotiations have been concluded with the rest advancing smoothly. In the field of trade rules, negotiations have finished in the three key areas of financial services, telecommunications services and professional services, which means all parties have reached a consensus on more than 80 percent of the draft agreement on trade rules. The deal is expected to be finalized by the end of the year.The RCEP negotiations began in 2012 and involve the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea. When completed it will be the largest-scale free trade agreement in Asia.The 16 countries' active engagement in the RCEP negotiations have ensured the talks have progressed steadily, and have demonstrated the shared will of the countries to promote economic and trade cooperation. If the RCEP agreement can be inked, it will give a strong push to economic globalization and free trade.It is noteworthy that at the same time China and the ASEAN countries have finished their first review of the draft text of the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, and the ASEAN countries are optimistic that the negotiations might be finished in three years as it is planned or even ahead of that. This is also a substantial achievement, as some external powers have always tried to obstruct an agreement being reached on a code of behavior for the waters.It is China's hope that the region can ride these positive tides to build a community of common interests. Beijing unswervingly supports economic globalization, and higher level opening-up, and it is also its consistent stance that disputes should be managed and controlled through dialogues, and should not become excuses to thwart cooperation.As long as all parties continue to maintain the positive momentum of the talks on both free trade and the document concerning regional stability, they will move closer to their shared aspiration for a prosperous region.

                    Clear right of passage
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Philippine legislation does not require clearance or prior notification of foreign vessels passing through the waters within its baselines On Aug 20, Senator Christopher Lawrence Go said the Philippine government would require vessels from other countries to notify the Philippine authorities about their impending passage through "territorial waters" and get approval from proper government authority well in advance. It was reportedly a response to Chinese warships passing through the Situba Strait in July and August. Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr also said he filed a diplomatic protest to China over the ships' passage, and Philippine presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said it is a violation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) since they passed through the Philippine's "exclusive economic zone". It seems that the Philippine government officials are confused about the status of waters around the Sibutu passage - whether they are territorial sea, exclusive economic zone or archipelagic waters. Consisting of more than 7,000 islands and islets located around 600 miles off the southeastern coast of the Asian mainland, the Philippines is an Archipelagic State that made a significant contribution to the recognition of Archipelagic State status at the UN negotiation conferences of the UNCLOS. The 1987 Philippine Constitution stated that there is no difference between internal waters and archipelagic waters while the UNCLOS distinguishes the two. In 2009, the Philippines updated its archipelagic baselines through R.A. 9522, otherwise known as an Act to Amend Certain Provisions of Republic Act No. 3046, as Amended by Republic Act No. 5446, to define the Archipelagic Baselines of the Philippines, and for Other Purposes. However, it does not identify whether the waters within the baselines are archipelagic waters or internal waters, and it did not specify the breadth of the territorial sea. Moreover, while it is a consequence of acquiring archipelagic status to designate archipelagic sea lanes passage, it has so far not submitted a proposal to the International Maritime Organization designating archipelagic sea lanes passage. According to Article 53 paragraph 12, "if an archipelagic State does not designate sea lanes or air routes, the right of archipelagic sea lanes passage may be exercised through the routes normally used for international navigation". The Situba passage is a deep channel about 18 miles wide connecting the Sulu Sea with the Sulawesi Sea. It is one of the eight most important straits lying wholly within Philippine archipelagic waters. It is an important transit route for international trade between the Pacific and the Indian Ocean. Thus the Situba passage is a route "normally used for international navigation" that all vessels can sail through as an archipelagic sea lanes passage, including Chinese naval vessels. Some also accused China of having a "double standard" since it requires foreign vessels to have prior authorization in its territorial waters. But the accusation makes no sense. China does require foreign warships to apply for passage in its territorial sea according to the 1992 Law of Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone. It did not notify the Philippine government simply because the Philippine government has made no such requirement. The Philippines has no domestic law requiring foreign vessels to get such clearance before passing through the waters within its archipelagic baseline. In 2011, the Supreme Court stated that the sovereignty of Philippines over the waters within the archipelagic baselines is subject to the rights of innocent passage and archipelagic sea lanes passage as provided for under international law. However, the Philippine legislation never requires clearance or prior notification of foreign vessels passing through the waters within its baselines. China respects Philippine domestic legislation and will notify relevant authorization if there's such a legal requirement. Despite the unresolved territorial and maritime delimitation dispute, political relations between China and the Philippines have improved dramatically in the past three years. Stable top-level relations also help promote maritime cooperation and facilitate the expansion of economic deals. China has been the Philippines' largest trade partner since 2016 and its biggest investor since last year. The two countries established the Bilateral Consultation Mechanism and already held four conferences so far. Coastguard cooperation is also on schedule. The relationship between China and the Philippines is now on a healthy track and is perhaps as good as it has ever been. There is no reason for China to send military vessels to intentionally pose a security threat as it would damage bilateral relations. The passage of Chinese ships through Sibutu passage should not be a problem or concern. President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to make his fifth trip to China on Aug 28. It is better to save time to discuss real significant issues such as how to achieve a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea at the earliest date and resolve the long-standing disputes in a peaceful way.

                Editor's Note: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte begins his five-day visit to China on Wednesday, the fifth since he took office in June 2016. During his visit, the two sides are also expected to discuss many issues. Two experts share their views on Duterte's visit and Sino-Philippine ties with China Daily's Liu Jianna. Experts follow:Immense room for win-win cooperationOver the past few years, China and the Philippines have strengthened their relations thanks to frequent high-level exchanges between the two heads of state and the remarkable restraint they have exercised over the South China Sea dispute.The positive attitudes of the two sides and their deepening political ties have, in turn, helped promote economic and trade cooperation, as evident in the more than 18 percent growth in bilateral trade in 2018 against the background of sluggish global trade growth. As a result, a positive correlation between the Philippines' economic development and Sino-Philippine economic cooperation is becoming increasingly notable.The Philippines has also been trying to strike a balance between its relations with China and the United States, its traditional ally. Given the fundamental contradictions between the Philippine and US governments, especially the dispute over Manila's war on drugs, US-Philippine relations have not returned to the level they were when Benigno Aquino III was in office, even though they have largely improved since the incumbent US leader took office.At the moment, the US is desperate to rope in the Philippines in an attempt to list the disputed islands in the South China Sea under the Mutual Defense Treaty. The two countries' cooperation, especially between the two militaries, is expected to be strengthened. Yet Manila will not act as a cat's paw for the US and sour relations with China like Aquino III did by stirring up the South China Sea conflict.As a pivot of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, the Philippines could solicit China's cooperation in infrastructure construction and attract more Chinese investments to strengthen its industries, not least because the lack of a strong machinery manufacturing industry has made it greatly dependent on the exports of fruits and other agricultural products to maintain economic growth.In particular, the industrial transfer initiated by the Belt and Road Initiative can help many people in the Philippines get employment.Besides, exchanges between the two sides in different spheres should be strengthened to consolidate the social foundation of bilateral ties. But for that to happen, the Philippines' media and society have to view China and Sino-Philippine relations in the right perspective, because that is extremely important for the long-term development of bilateral ties.Song Wei, a research fellow at the National Academy of Development and Strategy and a professor at the School of International Studies, Renmin University of ChinaSouth China Sea can be a sea of cooperationSino-Philippine relations have developed quite smoothly over the past few years thanks to the political trust built under the guidance of the two countries' top leaders. This has saved the two countries and peoples from getting bogged down in the territorial dispute. That Manila has been wise enough to avoid being used by the US as a tool against China has ensured that it doesn't lose the opportunity to work with Beijing and achieve win-win results.Over the years, Beijing and Manila have also expanded and deepened their cooperation in anti-terrorism and security apart from enhancing economic and trade cooperation.Besides, as Shenzhen builds the demonstration pilot zone for socialism with Chinese characteristics which, among other things, aims to develop marine economy, the two countries could use the opportunity to foster and increase maritime cooperation given that the Philippines is short of technology to develop its marine economy despite having rich marine resources, while China has developed advanced technologies. In this way, conflict could be transformed into opportunity and the South China Sea turned into a sea of cooperation and friendship.It is also important to expand people-to-people exchanges, which is one of the pillars of bilateral ties. So there is still a lot of room for cooperation.The two countries should also expand collaboration along the Belt and Road, so that different Philippine interest groups can reap the early harvests of deeper cooperation, particularly because the pressure from the opposition party and pro-American lobbies on the Duterte administration could affect Sino-Philippine ties. The possible signing of the South China Sea Code of Conduct next year, however, will largely ease the tensions and prevent bilateral political ties from worsening due to the maritime conflict.Wang Yiwei, Jean Monnet chair professor at Renmin University of ChinaThe views don't necessarily represent those of China Daily.

                    China to launch polar-observing microsat
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                BEIJING -- China will send a remote sensing satellite into orbit for polar climate and environment observation in September, according to its developers.The satellite called "Ice Pathfinder" (Code: BNU-1), which weighs only 10 kg, is equipped with high-resolution cameras that can achieve full coverage of the Antarctic and Arctic in five days and strengthen monitoring of sea ice drifts and ice-shelf calving.In addition, it has an automatic identification system for vessels to navigate through parts or the entirety of the polar regions.The polar-observing microsat was initiated by scientists from the Beijing Normal University and developed by Shenzhen Aerospace Dongfanghong Development Ltd. It will be operated by Chinese University Corporation for Polar Research.With a design life of one year, it will improve China's polar remote sensing capability. Its data will also be used to study global climate changes and develop Arctic shipping routes, according to Cheng Xiao, lead scientist of the project.In the past, Chinese scientists conducted polar studies mainly based on data collected by vessels and research stations. The use of remote sensing satellite technology will enable them to monitor and obtain imagery and data of the difficult-to-access areas."The satellite will make up for China's lack of polar observation data and reduce its dependence on other countries for the technology," said Cheng.The Ice Pathfinder was the first member of China's polar observation satellite constellation, which will have a total of 24 satellites. They are designed to provide 24/7 all-weather polar observation.These satellites will also monitor the middle or lower latitude areas, playing a key role in the research of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, or the Third Pole region in the future.

                    Duterte's China visit boosts relations
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte visited China last week, his second this year and fifth in the last three years, which is deemed as a sign of rapidly improving relations between the two countries. Ge Hongliang, director of the China-ASEAN Research Center of Guangxi University for Nationalities, said the purpose of Duterte's visit was to turn the blueprint on deepening strategic cooperation into action. Duterte also participated in events dedicated to improving cultural and people-to-people exchanges. Last week, the two countries announced the setting up of an intergovernmental joint steering committee and a working group between relevant enterprises on oil and gas cooperation. Xinhua said in a commentary that it was the latest progress in the two countries' joint exploration of oil and gas. Duterte visited China on Wednesday to Sunday. Four months ago, he had visited the country for the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. Song Qingrun, associate researcher with China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, said such high frequency China visits by the Philippine president are rare in the history of the bilateral ties. After meeting with Duterte on Thursday, President Xi Jinping said the China-Philippines relations "smoothly realized taking an upturn and scoring consolidation and uplift, and continuously achieved tangible outcomes" during Duterte's administration over the past three years thanks to the two sides' joint efforts. Xi said he was willing to work with Duterte to continue to grasp the trend of the times from a strategic and long-term perspective, to lead the sound development of bilateral ties. "This will not only benefit the two countries and their peoples, but also add positive energy to regional peace and stability." On the South China Sea issue, Xi said China and the Philippines have been maintaining effective communication. He said the two sides should set aside disputes, eliminate external interference, and concentrate on cooperation, making pragmatic efforts and seeking development. "The Code of Conduct in the South China Sea is a pioneering undertaking in establishing rules and regulations in the South China Sea, and China and the Philippines should be committed to promoting the adoption of the COC at an early date," said Xi, stressing an early adoption will demonstrate the firm position and positive stance of China and the Philippines to jointly safeguard the long-term stability of the region. A draft of the COC was put forth in August 2018, with an agreement reached in November by China and Association of Southeast Asian Nations to finalize the COC within three years, starting from 2019. In a meeting with Premier Li Keqiang on Friday, Duterte said the Philippines will never confront China, adding that Western countries are not COC negotiators and should not hinder the efforts of regional countries in this regard. China has advocated the idea of pursuing joint development while shelving disputes, and it has become increasingly popular. Since Duterte took office in 2016, the two countries have been maintaining effective communication on the South China Sea issue. Xinhua said the amity is hard-earned because bilateral ties once suffered a setback and hit rock bottom due to the Philippines' unilateral filing of the South China Sea arbitration case against China, which was initiated by then Philippine president Benigno Aquino III. Under the guidance of Xi and Duterte, the situation in the South China Sea has stabilized. In 2017, the two sides re-established direct talks for the first time in six years to discuss security and trade issues. The two countries have been actively seeking to synergize the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative and the Philippines' "Build, Build, Build" program, accelerating cooperation in such areas as infrastructure, telecommunications, and energy. China became the Philippines' largest trading partner in 2017 in the region. Last year, Chinese investments into the Philippines reached $930 million, making China the Southeast Asian country's top foreign investor. "China is willing to import more high-quality fruits and agricultural products from the Philippines, and will send experts to the Philippines to teach agricultural and fishery technology," said Xi. caihong@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 09/03/2019 page3)

                    US desperate to boost presence in region
                </p>

                The US-ASEAN maritime exercise that started on Monday is the first joint naval drill between the United States and the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. However, the multilateral drill has raised speculation over US involvement in Southeast Asia despite the negotiations between China and some ASEAN members such as Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam making good progress toward resolving their territorial disputes in the South China Sea.Since the White House seems determined to push ahead with its so-called Indo-Pacific strategy, the US administration has made desperate efforts to expand its influence and boost its military presence in the Asia-Pacific region by strengthening its ties with regional allies and promising to safeguard the security of other countries.The US-ASEAN naval drill, which the US claims is aimed at "maintaining maritime security and preempting wrongdoings in the sea", is part of Washington's policy to advance its Indo-Pacific strategy and strengthen its presence in Southeast Asia.
