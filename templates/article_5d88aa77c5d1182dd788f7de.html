                Sci-tech board starts new era for investors
            </a>
            <p>
                China's stock market becomes more diversified and mature, thanks to continuous reform and opening-up measuresThe initial excitement surrounding the launch of a new market is bound to fade over time, but Shanghai's sci-tech innovation board, or STAR Market, has attracted continued interest from investors since its dazzling debut in late July.After getting off to a strong start with share prices soaring an average of 217 percent from offer prices in the initial two weeks of trading, the STAR Market's first batch of listed firms retreated later in August and broadly stabilized this month, ending 139 percent higher than offer prices on average on Wednesday.Turnover has declined but remains high, with about one in 10 floating stocks of STAR-listed firms changing hands on average on Wednesday, topping all A-share sub-markets, according to financial information provider Wind Info.As rationality gradually replaces exuberance, it is the STAR Market's groundbreaking reforms under the trial registration-based initial public offering system that account for investors' continuing interest in the tech board, experts said.Marked by the debut of the STAR Market, a new era may be dawning for China's 29-year-old A-share market, featuring accelerated market-oriented, law-based reforms and deeper integration with the global financial community, they said."Overall, the market-oriented reforms on the STAR Market have borne fruit, while more could be done looking forward," said Eugene Qian, president of UBS Securities and a member of the UBS Asia-Pacific Executive Committee.Registration-based IPO on the STAR Market "has been a success so far", Qian said. Easier listing standards have enabled pioneering new-economy companies to seek floats domestically, and the IPOs of the first batch of floats were priced reasonably, according to Qian.Securities authorities lifted the unspoken IPO pricing ceiling of 23 times earnings for the new tech board, giving the market a bigger say in IPO pricing. As for secondary trading, daily price fluctuation and short selling limits were also loosened.On the back of the market-oriented reforms, more institutional investors from home and abroad are expected to join STAR Market secondary trading after the market becomes more sizable and less volatile over the next few quarters, Qian said."I think it (the debut of the STAR Market) is the beginning of a whole new era of the A-share market potentially," Qian said, as the STAR Market serves as a prelude to more market-oriented reforms, including the adoption of the registration-based IPO system on the ChiNext board in Shenzhen, which aims to attract innovative and fast-growing enterprises.China's A-share market was born in December 1990, when the Shanghai Stock Exchange debuted with only eight listed firms capitalized at more than 1.2 billion yuan ($170 million) in total.Only 29 years later, the market has become the world's second-largest following the United States in terms of capitalization, with nearly 3,700 listed firms valued at more than 50 trillion yuan in total, or more than half of the country's annual GDP.Looking at the A-share market's history, the most significant watershed was the split share structure reform initiated in 2005, said Wang Maobin, investment department chair at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.The reform floated a large volume of non-tradable A shares that were largely State-owned. Non-tradable shareholders were required to bargain with and pay tradable shareholders compensation to make their shares tradable.The overhaul triggered a bull run from 2006 to 2007, with the Shanghai Composite Index peaking at 6124 points in October 2007, the highest level ever.The market became much more liquid and less volatile through the reform, while illegal trading behavior such as insider trading and market manipulation dropped markedly, according to Wang."Investors began to earn profit from growth in listed firms, rather than only from losses of other investors."The reform also ushered in an era of development marked by steady, gradual change characterized by growth in the number of institutional investors, improvement in market rules, enrichment of trading tools, and two-way market opening-up over the past decade, Wang said.

                A shares attracting foreign funds as economy maintains steady growth
            </a>
            <p>
                China's A-share market is becoming more attractive to overseas investors as the country maintains a steady pace of economic growth and capital market opening-up amid a precarious global recovery, experts said.When the market opens next Monday, two major investment index compilers, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indices, will implement their latest A-share inclusion steps. The former will roughly triple the weighting of A-share constituents, while the latter will add more than 1,000 A shares to its global benchmarks, after their competitor MSCI Inc raised A-share weighting in August.Founder Securities estimated the moves will trigger about $30 billion to $40 billion in foreign inflows into A shares.Huang Jun, chief Chinese analyst at currency trading platform forex.com, said the three major global equity index providers' successive inclusion moves demonstrated the increasing allure of Ashare assets to global investors.China's economic growth has slowed in the past two years but still showed "clear advantage" compared with other emerging markets and advanced economies, Huang said.In the first half of this year, the world's second-largest economy expanded by 6.3 percent. The figure slowed from 6.6 percent for the whole of 2018, but was the highest among all major economies worldwide, official data said."(The economic situation of) China has been stable with solid development foundation, which is the biggest reason why global capital favors the country," Huang said, citing the dampening effect of Brexit on the eurozone and emerging market debt issues such as those in Argentina and Turkey on global investors' confidence in these economies.Besides China's growth prospects, investment opportunities in A shares also derive from the potential enhancement in valuation, said Lynda Zhou, equities chief investment officer in China at Fidelity International."With deepening reform of China's asset management sector, onshore risk-free interest rates are expected to decline sustainably, pushing up the valuation levels of equity assets," Zhou said.Meanwhile, as the market's investor structure, which is dominated by retail investors, may make short-term stock price performance deviate from the true value of listed firms, long-term investment opportunities abound, she said."We believe the valuation levels and growth prospects of A-share listed firms still have an advantage (over global peers)," Zhou said, adding that she pays particular attention to investment opportunities related to consumption upgrading, high-end manufacturing and independent technologies.The A-share market regained upward momentum after the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index hit an intraday low of 2733.92 points in early August, the lowest since mid-February. The SCI went up by 0.25 percent to close at 2985.66 points on Wednesday.Foreign inflows accelerated along with the recovery, with net inflows via northbound trading of stock connect programs between mainland and Hong Kong bourses standing at 28 billion yuan ($3.95 billion) during the first trading week of September, the highest since the first week of November last year.By the end of the first half of this year, foreign capital accounted for 7.6 percent of the A-share market's free float capitalization, up from no more than 3 percent at the beginning of 2016, data collected by Fidelity International showed."Global investors have been structurally underweight in China for many years," said Michael Orzano, senior director of global equity indices at S&P Dow Jones Indices.But this situation has been gradually changing as investors' exposure to the A-share market rose after the market became more accessible and gained inclusion in global equity benchmarks, Orzano said.China has made steady progress in opening up the A-share market in recent years. The authorities quadrupled daily transaction limits for stock connects last year, and continuously relaxed regulation of qualified foreign institutional investor schemes, including announcing an end to quota limits of the schemes last week.
