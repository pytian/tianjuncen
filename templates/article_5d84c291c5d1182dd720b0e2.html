                Xi stresses ecological protection and high-quality development of Yellow River
            </p>
            <p>
                ZHENGZHOU - Chinese President Xi Jinping called for concerted efforts to promote ecological protection and high-quality development of the Yellow River.Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks while chairing a symposium Wednesday during his inspection tour to Henan province."The protection of the Yellow River is critical to the great rejuvenation and sustainable development of the Chinese nation," said Xi, adding that it is a major national strategy.Noting that the peace of the Yellow River is significant to the stability of China, Xi said Chinese people have struggled against the floods and droughts of the Yellow River since ancient times, and the Party and the state have attached great importance to the harnessing and development of the Yellow River after the founding of New China in 1949.Originating in Qinghai province, the Yellow River, known as China's "Mother River" and the cradle of the Chinese civilization, runs through nine provinces and autonomous regions including Shaanxi and Henan before emptying into the Bohai Sea in East China's Shandong province.The river got its name Huanghe in Chinese because of its yellow, muddy water, which appears as it runs through the Loess Plateau in Northwest China.The 5,464-km-long waterway feeds about 12 percent of China's population, irrigates about 15 percent of arable land, supports 14 percent of national GDP, and supplies water to more than 60 cities.Xi also pointed out difficulties and problems in protecting the Yellow River, including fragile ecological environment, severe condition of the water resources preservation and development quality that needs to be improved.

                Afghanistan Taliban kill at least 26 in Kabul suicide blast A Taliban suicide bomber killed at least 26 people and wounded dozens near a campaign rally for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Tuesday, with the insurgents warning of more violence ahead of elections. About an hour after the attack, another blast also claimed by the Taliban rocked central Kabul near the US embassy. It was not immediately clear if the second blast claimed any lives. The explosions came after US President Donald Trump abruptly ended talks with the Taliban on Sept 10 over a deal that would have allowed the United States to begin withdrawing troops from its longest war. South Korea Seoul files WTO export dispute with Tokyo South Korea has initiated a WTO dispute against Japan's latest export curbs, the World Trade Organization said on Monday, amid increased tensions between the two Asian neighbors. In July, Japan imposed tighter controls on exports of three materials to South Korea used in smartphone chips and displays following a diplomatic row over compensation for forced laborers during Japan's occupation of the Korean Peninsula during World War II. Under WTO rules, South Korea and Japan should meet within 30 days and if these talks fail, South Korea can request adjudication by a dispute settlement panel. The Philippines At least 15 dead as truck falls off cliff At least 15 villagers were killed and several others injured when the truck they were riding in lost control and fell off a cliff on Tuesday, in a remote mountain village in the southern Philippines, police and the Red Cross said. Provincial police chief Joel Limson said the truck was negotiating a downhill road in Tboli town in South Cotabato province when its brakes apparently failed and plummeted down a ravine. Police, Red Cross volunteers and villagers retrieved the 15 bodies from the wreckage. At least five of the injured were hospitalized in critical condition, Limson said.

                Major corn producing areas safe from army worms
            </a>
            <p>
                China has successfully defended its key corn-producing areas against the invasion of fall army worms, a destructive pest that has spread to 25 provincial-level regions since its first sighting in January, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said on Tuesday.The pest, which predominantly damages corn but also poses threats to sugar cane and sorghum, has infested more than 1 million hectares of farmland in China. About 80 percent of the affected fields are located in Southwest China, including Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, and Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, said Pan Wenbo, an official with the ministry."The worm did not reach the northeastern regions, the country's top corn growing area," he said."In affected areas, reductions in yield are contained under 5 percent. This means total grain production during this autumn won't be disrupted by the newly arrived pest."Despite progress in safeguarding the country's crops against fall army worms this year, Pan warned that its spread will become "normal" in the country."Agricultural experts have concluded that fall army worms can survive the winter and breed in southern parts of China, especially the subtropical areas," he said. "And new pests might migrate from neighboring countries during early spring."China plans to intensify its prevention and control efforts against the pest by deploying more monitoring devices and incorporating smart and big data technologies in the future, according to Zhu Enlin, an official with the ministry."We will also step up cooperation with Myanmar, Vietnam and other neighboring countries to minimize risks of the pest migrating from overseas," he said.The fall army worm, native to tropical and subtropical areas in North and South America, was first discovered in Yunnan province in early January and spread fast across the country's corn fields in the southern and southwestern regions.To curb its spread, the Ministry of Finance has allocated 500 million yuan ($72 million) while local finance authorities have allocated 360 million yuan.The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has also dispatched more than 40 groups of technical experts to carry out on-site inspections and provide guidance to farmers.

                S. Africa seeks to reassure neighbors after violence
            </a>
            <p>
                In a bid to restore foreign investors' confidence, South Africa has dispatched high-ranking envoys to several African neighbors to assure them of their citizens' safety in the country.Their outreach follows a wave of xenophobic violence in South Africa earlier this month that left at least 12 foreigners dead and many foreign-owned businesses and homes destroyed, especially in Johannesburg.Hundreds of economic migrants from Zimbabwe and Mozambique have fled while others have taken shelter in the country. Last week, Nigeria flew 600 of its citizens back home.The team of envoys departed from South Africa last weekend and are expected to deliver messages of solidarity to heads of state and governments in Nigeria, Niger, Ghana, Senegal, Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia, according to a statement from the presidential office.Africans have condemned the violence. South African businesses across the continent have faced retaliatory attacks. In addition, Madagascar and Zambia refused to send soccer teams for matches in the country, while Nigeria recalled its ambassador.Led by Jeff Radebe, the mission will reassure African neighbors that South Africa is committed to the ideals of pan-African unity and solidarity. His team will brief the governments of the steps that the country was taking to curb the attacks and hold the perpetrators to account.South Africa, the second-largest economy in Africa, continues to attract economic immigrants from other African countries, who are often blamed by locals for a lack of jobs and security in communities.The latest population census, in 2011, found that there were 2.2 million foreign-born people in the country.However according to pundits, the perception that immigrants occupy most available jobs or perpetrate crime continues to be untrue."Research by Institute for Security Studies do not back this perception. However, it has continued to be used to trigger violence against foreigners in South Africa," said Tanaka Chitsa, an economist researcher based in Harare, Zimbabwe.

                Kenya halts adoptions on trafficking fears
            </a>
            <p>
                Kenya has suspended adoption of children by foreigners, while it considers new policies.The move followed that of neighboring Ethiopia, which halted adoption of children by foreigners in 2018, in an effort to curb trafficking.After a cabinet meeting on Sept 12, chaired by President Uhuru Kenyatta, the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection was directed to streamline operations of the government's Child Welfare Society of Kenya.The ministry was also tasked with drafting a new policy on foreign adoptions of Kenyan children.The director of Kenyan national public prosecutions has also been tasked with investigating the state agency on charges of corruption and child neglect.The move is seen as a response to alarming practices around child adoption processes that have recently been highlighted by Kenyan media.In a case that gripped the country, a couple from the United States have been battling custody over a baby boy for months after their process was thwarted by the Child Welfare Society of Kenya. The baby has finally been united with the US couple.According to existing Kenyan law, a child must be at least six weeks old and declared free for adoption by a registered adoption society before an adoption can proceed.However, there have been cases where foreign nationals were stopped while taking children out of Kenya after it was discovered that the children were not abandoned orphans and still had known families.In 2014, the Kenyan government issued a similar directive to ban adoption by foreigners after a review revealed weaknesses in the legal system, which made it susceptible to manipulation leading to commercialization of adoption processes.A 2017 report from the Department of Children's Services in the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Development in conjunction with the UNICEF supported children staying with family members over adoption.There were also concerns among stakeholders that foreign adoptions were being sought for the wrong reasons and "children so adopted are being removed from the country without the necessary checks having been previously been done by a foreign adoption society", said the report.The report recommended that no more charitable children's institutions be opened and that punitive actions be considered for those that ignored the order. There were between 1,000 and 1,500 such institutions in the country in 2017.Existing ones were to be inspected and those falling short of the requirements shut down. Data was also to be collected and submitted to the government every year showing the number of children accepted by the institutions and those that had been reunited with their families.It also recommended that the state provide funding for adoption procedures to eliminate commercialization. This would especially be helpful to Kenyan families willing to adopt the children but unable to meet high charges set by adoption societies.This situation inadvertently led to more than 60 percent of local applicants withdrawing from the adoption process even after they had fostered the children they wanted to adopt, government figures show.According to a UN report, children make up a high proportion of people trafficked globally.One in six victims trafficked in Kenya for forced labor, sexual exploitation and begging, among other purposes, is a child, according to a report by Kenyan news site NationNewsplex early this year.

                Xi urges concerted efforts to protect, develop Yellow River basin
            </a>
            <p>
                ZHENGZHOU - President Xi Jinping has called for concerted efforts to protect and develop the Yellow River basin while chairing a symposium Wednesday during his inspection tour to Henan Province.Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, stressed strengthened coordination in the comprehensive management of the Yellow River basin to promote high-quality development.Calling for strengthened protection of the ecological environment of the Yellow River basin, Xi said that differences between the upper, middle and lower reaches of the river should be fully considered, given that the Yellow River ecosystem is an organic whole.Further efforts should be made to ensure the long-term stability of the Yellow River, Xi said, stressing that although the river has not seen major dangers for many years, we should not relax vigilance.Xi also stressed better use of water resources, with rational planing of the population, urban and industrial development to resolutely curb unreasonable water demand.When pursuing high-quality development in the region, authorities should actively explore new ways with regional characteristics and participate in the construction of Belt and Road to promote higher level of opening-up, Xi noted.Meanwhile, Xi called for preserving, inheriting and carrying forward the Yellow River culture."The Yellow River culture, as an important part of the Chinese civilization, is the root and soul of the Chinese nation," Xi said, calling for telling well the "Yellow River story" to pool spiritual strength for the realization of the Chinese dream of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

                Milk bank saving tiny lives in Kenya
            </a>
            <p>
                When Roseline Kwamboka gave birth to a baby girl seven years ago, ill health affected the flow of her breast milk and this left her baby starved and crying incessantly. It took another three weeks for her to recover. By then, her baby had dropped a lot of weight.To make up for the shortage, they had turned to baby formula, which was costly. It also took time for the baby to adjust from bottle to breast feeding afterwards, in what is referred to as nipple confusion.Asked if she would have agreed to feed her baby human milk that was not hers, Kwamboka does not hesitate. "If it would have nourished her, I would have done it immediately," said the mother of two.Presently, new mothers with premature or sickly babies do not have to undergo this experience anymore. Kenya's health ministry and PATH, a US-based nonprofit health organization, launched the region's first human milk bank at Pumwani Maternity Hospital in Nairobi city in April.The facility is targeting babies who have no access to human milk because their mothers may be sick, unable to produce breast milk or dead, or because the babies were abandoned.The move supports a global campaign by the World Health Organization promoting exclusive breastfeeding of newborn babies for six months.According to the global health body, one of the leading causes of death among children under five in 2017 was preterm birth complications. More than 60 percent of these deaths are in Africa and South Asia. Furthermore, preterm babies make up 12 percent of babies born in KenyaAccording to research by the African Population and Health Research Center, 44 percent of newborns in urban health facilities were separated from their mothers for varying periods of time. This ranged from less than an hour to more than six hours and even days after birth.Of these infants, only 14 percent were fed the mother's own milk during separation. Thirty-six percent of the newborns were not fed anything during this period and an additional 23 percent were fed formula or cow's milk."There is very strong evidence on the innumerous benefits of human milk. It reduces the risk of diseases and infections such as respiratory tract infections. Infants are also able to better tolerate human milk than baby formula. This is especially acute in newborn babies," said Beatrice Marube, a nutritionist at the Pumwani Maternity Hospital.The facility has been receiving at least 15 donors daily. Most of them have babies at the newborn unit, who are preterm or sickly. Therefore, after routinely feeding their babies, they would then donate the surplus at the milk bank.The stream of donors matches the baby-feeding times. The mothers would come after every three hours starting at 10 o'clock in the morning. Donors are assisted by supporting staff on how to use either electric or manual breast pumps.Prior to becoming a donor, the new mother undergoes counseling in a bid to determine their psychological fitness. She also goes through laboratory screening to test for HIV, hepatitis and syphilis. A clean bill of health adds her to the donor list."We also counsel them on their nutrition so that they are healthy throughout their stay in the hospital," said Marube. On average, they stay in hospital for five days."We have seen an upsurge in the number of voluntary donors. We have also seen a high uptake in the number of recipient babies as their mothers agree to feed them with the milk. We do not store this milk for long," said Faith Njeru, a nurse manning the station.She attributed the uptake to the strict screening tests done on the milk to ensure it is free from conditions that are transmissible through breast milk. It is tested before and after pasteurization to kill microorganisms, ensuring its nutritional composition is not altered and that it is safe for vulnerable babies.Before storing in a freezer, the milk is put in 50 milliliter bottles. "This curbs waste as the babies feed small amounts at a time," said Njeru. Priority is given to sick preterm babies, preterm babies, sick term babies and, last, a term baby without access to its mother's milk. Milk that is not used is discarded.The impact of the facility is already evident. Marube, the nutritionist, said the length of hospital stay for both mothers and babies has been tremendously reduced. The recovery period for the babies has also improved.On the other hand, the hospital has been able to significantly reduce the costs incurred in purchasing formula milk to cater to these babies. Geoffrey Mosiria, the hospital administrator, revealed that the hospital was spending $24,000 annually. "This has been cut down to zero," he said.He added that besides the facility expanding the range of services it offers to mothers, it has also opened it up to more partners. The mortality rate has also been reduced drastically."We are looking forward to scaling up our reach and supplying other hospitals with the milk. Once the pilot program is over, probably next year, we will then work on the logistics," he said.Mosiria said it will take time before they start receiving milk from donors already at home. Safety checks and storage are also a critical component in the supply chain and this cannot be guaranteed yet he said. "But I am sure we will reach there," he added.The Kenyan project has borrowed from milk banks in South Africa and Scotland.

                Efforts to fight female illiteracy, boost gender equality lauded in white paper
            </a>
            <p>
                China has made significant progress in curbing female illiteracy, according to a white paper on Thursday. Released by the State Council Information Office to mark the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in October, the report lauded the progress in several chapters - alongside other gender equality and women's welfare improvements - in a host of areas, ranging from financial and political status to maternal health. The illiteracy rate among women aged 15 and older has seen a drastic decline over the last 70 years, from 90 percent to 7.3 percent as of 2017, the report said.
