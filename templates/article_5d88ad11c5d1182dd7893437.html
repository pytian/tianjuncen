                China and its partners participating in the negotiations of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement are expected to conclude the talks within this year, a senior official said on Wednesday.Assistant Minister of Commerce Li Chenggang said since the 27th round of RCEP talks held in Zhengzhou, the provincial capital of Henan province, has made notable progress in many aspects between July 22 and 31, it will be conductive for the upcoming RCEP ministerial meeting to gain more consensus in Beijing from Friday to Saturday,More than 700 representatives from 16 countries including member economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Japan, Australia and India attended the 27th round of RCEP talks and they reaffirmed the goals reached during the second RCEP leaders' meeting in Singapore last November.The parties held a plenary session of the Trade Negotiation Committee and parallel sessions of working groups on trade in goods, trade in services, investment, rules of origin, trade remedy, finance, telecommunications, intellectual property rights, e-commerce and laws and mechanisms.As many parts of the world are dealing with unilateral actions and protectionism, Lu Pengqi, vice-chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, said China has been an active participant in the RCEP negotiations, and is willing to play an active and constructive role in accelerating the talks.He said China is taking a series of major reform and opening-up measures, strengthening institutional and structural arrangements, and promoting a higher level of opening-up, which will generate new growth momentum for China to better deepen trade ties with other partners within the bloc.If the RCEP deal can be sealed sooner or later, it will create one of the world's largest trading blocs, accounting for 45 percent of the world population, 40 percent of global trade and around one-third of the world's GDP.Launched in 2012, RCEP is expected to boost trade and economic integration among ASEAN members and its six trading partners - China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and India.Since the China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership Vision 2030 was adopted in 2018, Li from the Ministry of Commerce added that China will continue to enrich the development of the Belt and Road Initiative and enhance bilateral cooperation in areas such as trade, infrastructure development, big data and financial services with ASEAN economies.The 10-member ASEAN became China's second-largest trading partner, after the European Union, in the first half of 2019, overtaking the United States for the first time since 1997.Bilateral trade between China and ASEAN amounted to $291.85 billion in the first half of this year, up 4.2 percent year-on-year, and the two-way investment totaled $205.71 billion by the end of 2018, data from the Ministry of Commerce show."Against the backdrop of rising protectionism, China and ASEAN, both exporting a large amount of manufacturing goods, agricultural and commodity products to global markets annually, have been staunchly upholding a rules-based multilateral trading system and earnestly promoting regional integration," said Li Yong, deputy director of China Association of International Trade Expert Committee.Eager to diversify their commercial ties, China will hold the 16th China-ASEAN Expo in Nanning, capital of the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, from Sept 20 to 23.

                Now that the EU is encountering problems and can no longer be the pathfinder, East Asia can lead the way On August 2, 2019, the annual ASEAN"10+3" Foreign Ministers' Meeting and East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers' Meeting were held in Bangkok, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Ministerial Meeting was held in Beijing. With regional cooperation suffering setbacks in Europe and North America, East Asian regional cooperation has once again attracted global attention. Europe has long led the trend for regional cooperation. The regional cooperation under the European Union framework is the earliest, fastest, largest, highest, and the most complete mechanism and system construction. However, it is currently experiencing a serious setback from Brexit. But it is not just the United Kingdom where there has been upswing in anti-EU sentiment among the public. In fact, the European debt crisis exposed serious flaws in the EU's institutional mechanisms and the refugee crisis added fuel to parties opposing the EU. The United States has long dominated multilateral mechanisms to meet its global strategic interests and lead global governance without distracting from regional frameworks. However, under the current administration, the US has begun to pay attention to bilateral agreements in an attempt to leverage and maintain its dominant position in the global governance system. East Asia is therefore pursuing greater economic integration at a time when multilateralism is under threat and rapid changes and profound adjustments are happening in the global landscape. The total economic output of the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus China, Japan and South Korea (10+3) has surpassed that of the US and the EU, and they are keen to take advantage of that to establish a "three-pole" global economic pattern. Especially in the context of the rising anti-globalization sentiment in many EU countries and North America, it is now time for East Asia to shoulder the historical responsibility of leading the global trend of regional cooperation. East Asian regional cooperation started late, and it was not until the end of 1997 that the"10+3" cooperation framework was launched. Even as the "main channel" of East Asian cooperation, the progress of the 10+3 cooperation has not been smooth. Although there have been some cooperation achievements at the financial level, such as the establishment of the East Asian foreign exchange reserve, it has not been able to initiate free trade negotiations under this framework even till now. To make up for this deficiency, by the end of 2010, four pairs of"10+1" and a pair of"10+2" free trade zones were built. The main path and key step in promoting regional cooperation in East Asia is to combine these five groups of free trade partnerships into a unified Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (which would comprise ASEAN plus China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and India). At the 10+3 Foreign Ministers' Meeting held in Bangkok, China's State Councilor and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi clearly stated that "efforts need to be made to conclude the regional comprehensive economic partnership agreement negotiations by the end of the year". At the same time, the RCEP (Commerce) Ministerial Meeting held in Beijing made important progress. In terms of market access, more than two-thirds of bilateral market access negotiations have ended, and the remaining negotiations are actively moving forward. In terms of the negotiations on trade rules, the three contents of financial services, telecommunications services and professional services have been newly completed. The parties have reached agreement on more than 80 percent of the texts of the agreement, and the remaining rules negotiations are coming to an end. The ministers attending the meeting made it clear that the countries must work hard to achieve the goal of ending the negotiations within 2019, which was set at the RCEP Leaders' Meeting last year. East Asia has created a world-famous economic growth miracle and is still the main driver of global economic growth. East Asian economic growth, with typical external demand or export-led characteristics, is more dependent on a stable international environment and an efficient governance system. In the context of the deeply troubled multilateral governance system, the growing proliferation of protectionism, and the undercurrent of anti-globalization sentiment, East Asia needs to improve the regional governance framework to create a free, open and stable regional trade and investment environment. At present, the driving forces for regional cooperation in East Asia are many: China is striving to promote positive interaction between the Belt and Road Initiative and regional cooperation; ASEAN has established the ASEAN community in 2015 and it celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2017, and its leading capacity for East Asian cooperation has been further enhanced. Third, East Asian cooperation has been characterized by being crisis-driven. Just as the 1997 financial crisis forged strong East Asian cooperation, the external pressure caused by the "America first" strategy of the US has once again become a strong driving force for East Asian internal cooperation. East Asia, which once created a miracle of economic growth, has the ability to create a miracle of regional cooperation. The miracle of economic growth relies on a unique East Asian model. East Asian regional cooperation should also rely on its own methods, different from that of the EU and US. The "ASEAN Way" of seeking consensus through an approach that respects the cultural norms of Southeast Asia has played a pivotal role in enabling ASEAN to be at the forefront of East Asian cooperation and become the dominant force in East Asian cooperation. What is needed now, is for East Asia to actively explore how to carry forward the "ASEAN Way" and build the "East Asian Way" of regional cooperation when European and US way of regional cooperation have got into trouble.

                While the number of Chinese multinationals is increasing, they need to up their game by strengthening their innovation capacity Chinese multinational companies (CMNCs) have a significant presence on the world stage, some 129 of them making it to this year's Fortune Global 500 list of top companies, up from just three in the first Global 500 list published by the magazine in 1995. Also, for the first time, the number of Chinese companies on the list surpassed those of the United States. However, while the CMNCs have expanded greatly in size, profitability is nothing to brag about yet. CMNCs on the list registered profits of $3.5 billion, compared to an average of $4.3 billion for the entire 500 companies. And, remove the 11 Chinese banks from the list, and CMNCs' average profits dip to $1.93 billion, far lower than the $5.28 billion average profit of US companies on the list. This profit gap can be linked to three key issues: the focus sectors of CMNCs, their innovation capabilities and their utilization of global value chains. Compared to those of the US, fewer Chinese companies are profitable in emerging industries. Most CMNCs in the Fortune 500 list focus are in heavy industries, finance, and real-estate; Chinese companies in emerging industries rank far down the list. So while Chinese technology companies are expanding fast, there remains a huge gap between them and US technology companies. Among CMNCs, only Huawei made it to the top 100, being ranked 61. In contrast, Apple ranked 11, Amazon 13, Alphabet 37 and Microsoft 60. These US tech companies were significantly more profitable than Huawei, despite the Shenzhen-based enterprise's rapid rise in recent years. Apple's annual profits of $59.5 billion were more than six times Huawei's and even Microsoft, ranked just one place above, doubled Huawei's profits. These profit signals show there is room for improvement in realizing innovation as a lasting competitive advantage. CMNCs also have room to grow in terms of fully utilizing global value chains. According to the 2018 Top 100 CMNCs and Transnationality Index, co-published by China Enterprise Confederation and China Company Association, the average transnationality index of the top 100 CMNCs is 15.80 percent, much lower than that of global top 100 MNCs (66.1 percent). This indicates that the ability of CMNCs to integrate resources on a global scale remains relatively weak. Global top 100 MNCs recruit talent from around the world, reducing costs through international division of labor and selling their products and services to international customers. In contrast, Chinese corporations tend to rely heavily on the domestic market. While the number of globally-oriented Chinese enterprises is increasing, there remain challenges to overcome. Also, in the current wave of anti-globalization, Chinese companies face obstacles from protectionism, unilateralism and greater scrutiny of foreign investment. There is a need for CMNCs to up their game to build innovation capacity and global competitiveness. The following steps can help achieve this. First, CMNCs should recruit more international talent, as it plays a vital role in improving innovation capability. Only when CMNCs "go out," recruit and cultivate international talent will they be able to optimize the use of global value chains, adapt to overseas markets, and localize products. Xiaomi's achievement, climbing the Fortune Global 500 list in just nine years, cannot be separated from its international talent strategy. When it was founded, Xiaomi recruited high-level talent from Google, Microsoft and other well-known MNCs to develop its brand strategy. On entering overseas markets, Xiaomi has worked closely with local talent to integrate its brand into these markets and ensure products meet customer needs. Other CMNCs expanding overseas could also benefit from such a globally-oriented talent strategy. Second, China should continue to deepen its reform and opening-up to create a favorable environment for Chinese companies to strengthen their competitiveness. Interacting and competing with world-class enterprises is essential for CMNCs to sharpen their abilities on the global stage. In the globalized digital economy, the distinction between domestic and international markets is disappearing. Only through open competition and innovation can CMNCs grow strong and smart enough to be true world-beaters. Third, China should continue to promote free trade agreements (FTAs) to open up new market opportunities and safeguard the interests of CMNCs in overseas markets. Over the last 18 years, Chinese companies have benefitted from greater market access under the WTO, which also gives them mechanisms to address unfair non-tariff barriers. Now that WTO is not as effective as it used to be, China needs to promote more regional FTAs to support the globalization of its enterprises, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP). China could also consider joining the Comprehensive Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which came into force at the start of this year. While Chinese enterprises have gradually integrated into the global economy and become global leaders over the past two decades, for the next phase of globalization, it is imperative that Chinese enterprises continue to explore new ways of not only being large, but also smart and sustainable.

                    ASEAN reaffirms trade commitment

                Economic ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, have reaffirmed the bloc's commitment to integration and free trade, a move analysts expect will shield the region from external headwinds.Analysts noted that the 51st ASEAN Economic Ministers meeting, held in Bangkok from Sept 6 to 11, comes at a time that the region faces the economic uncertainties due to the trade tensions between the United States and China, the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, and weakness in both global investments and consumer demand.The 10-member bloc concluded the meeting with a call for broader intra-regional trade and the immediate conclusion of negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a proposed free-trade agreement."ASEAN is sending a signal that it opposes protectionism," said Siwage Dharma Negara, senior fellow at the Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.In an interview, Negara said ASEAN members believe that any protectionist trade measures can hurt their economies. The bloc favors rule-based cooperation and seeks to further reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers in line with its commitments to the ASEAN Economic Community, or AEC.Established in 2015, the AEC is seen as a way to transform Southeast Asia into a globally-competitive single market and production base by 2025.In a statement, the trade and economic ministers of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam said they "remain resolute in their commitment to the region's economic integration agenda and to achieve the target to double intra-ASEAN trade by 2025, supported by an open, inclusive, and rules-based international trading system".The ministers said the region collectively reported higher trade and foreign direct investments in 2018. Trade in goods in ASEAN went up 8.7 percent, while trade in services expanded 10.6 percent. Total FDI inflows to the region increased 5.3 percent to $154.7 billion."If the ASEAN member states could more proactively promote trade among themselves by taking advantage of AEC, then their reliance on trading with the major world economies would be lightened, and ASEAN countries could thus be more resilient," Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow with the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, told China Daily.Oh said ASEAN also looks forward to the immediate conclusion of RCEP's negotiations as the trade pact will open up more markets.ASEAN led the formation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in 2012 and was supported by China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. If completed, it will be the largest multilateral trade deal in history, accounting for about one-third of the global economy. But negotiations over the trade pact stalled as some countries were reluctant to slash tariffs.At the conclusion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership's ministerial meeting - held during the just concluded 51st AEM in Bangkok - the trade and economic ministers of ASEAN and their counterparts in Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand issued a joint statement that "reaffirmed their collective resolve to bring negotiations to a conclusion"."Continuing uncertainties in the trade and investment environment have dampened the growth outlook across the world, with a likely impact on businesses and jobs, adding to the urgency and imperative of concluding the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership)," the ministers said.Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Jurin Laksanawisit said an agreement on Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, is expected to be signed by 2020, according to a report by Bangkok Post.Nawazish Mirza, associate professor of finance at France's La Rochelle Business School, said concluding the negotiations for Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, is "very critical" for ASEAN economies.Mirza said once partnership is in place, ASEAN can access bigger markets such as China, India and Australia.
