            <p class="style-content">
                NEW DELHI - India's second Moon mission, Chandrayaan-2's Lander Vikram, lost communication with the ground station at an altitude of 2.1 kilometers from the Lunar surface, said Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chief K. Sivan on Saturday.Vikram was scheduled to land on the moon surface at around 01:55 am (Indian Standard Time).However, as no data could be received from the Rover "Pragyan" even after several minutes passed, the atmosphere turned somber inside the ISRO control room. ISRO chief rushed to brief Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was present on the occasion to watch the landing process, to brief him about the loss of communication with the Lander.Later, Modi tweeted that India was proud of its scientists, and that the country will continue with its space program."India is proud of our scientists! They've given their best and have always made India proud. These are moments to be courageous, and courageous we will be! ISRO Chairman gave updates on Chandrayaan-2. We remain hopeful and will continue working hard on our space programme," Modi wrote.

                    Annual G7 summit set to focus on world economy
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump and other leaders of the world's most industrialized nations will open their annual G7 summit over the weekend by discussing the global economy. White House officials said on Thursday that the session was added to Sunday's schedule at the last minute at Trump's request. Trump insists the US economy is strong despite fears that a recession may be on the horizon. At the same time, global economic growth has slowed due to weakness in Germany, Europe's largest economy, and a slowdown in China, the world's second-largest economy, as it remains locked in a trade standoff with the United States. The dour global outlook is partly a reflection of Trump's combative approach to trade with China and other nations he has hit or threatened to hit with tariffs. Trump and the six other leaders of the Group of Seven nations will begin meeting on Saturday for three days in the southwestern French resort town of Biarritz. France holds the 2019 presidency of the G7, which also includes the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Italy and Japan. Those leaders are to meet at an informal dinner on Saturday, where they are expected to discuss foreign policy and security issues before more formal working sessions on Sunday and Monday. Trump is also scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the summit with several world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Boris Johnson, Britain's new prime minister, will also have his first face-to-face meeting with Trump, a personal friend, since taking office a few weeks ago. Trump also plans to raise the issue of a landmark tax France is imposing on major tech companies like Google and Facebook despite Trump's threats of retaliatory tariffs on French wine. Paris has said the tax is meant as a temporary measure pending the conclusion of negotiations on an international deal France wants to work out with the US. The tax is designed to keep multinational corporations from avoiding taxes by setting up European headquarters in low-tax European countries. Currently, companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Airbnb and Uber pay very little tax on their significant business in countries like France. The US government said the tax is discriminatory against US business. The European Union hopes to ease trade tensions with the US during the summit, a senior EU official said on Thursday. "We see trade tensions as the single most important risk factor to the growth of the global economy," the senior EU official said. The bloc would be seeking to defuse them and to concentrate on a "positive" EU-US trade agenda. The EU would also prefer to resolve a dispute between aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus without resorting to tariffs, the official said. Agencies (China Daily 08/24/2019 page8)

                    Brazil rejects G7 aid on Amazon fires
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Monday rejected aid from G7 countries to fight wildfires in the Amazon, after the seven leaders concluded their summit on Monday in France's seaside town of Biarritz with a pledge of more than $20 million to combat the horrendous fires. The leaders of France, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States made the aid offer to fight the blazes at the weekend summit hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron insisted the fires should be a top item on their agenda. Macron and Chilean President Sebastian Pinera, who was invited to the summit, announced the contribution on Monday. "We must respond to the call of the forest which is burning today in the Amazon," said Macron. He said the G7 nations also agreed to support a medium-term reforestation plan. But Onyx Lorenzoni, chief of staff to Bolsonaro told Macron to take care of "his home and his colonies", according to the G1 Globo news website. "We appreciate (the aid offer), but maybe those resources are more relevant to reforest Europe," he said. "Macron cannot even avoid a foreseeable fire in a church that is a world heritage site," he added, referring to the fire in April that devastated the Notre Dame Cathedral. "What does he intend to teach our country?" Brazilian environment Minister Ricardo Salles had earlier told reporters they had welcomed the G7 funding to fight the fires that have swept across 950,000 hectares and prompted the deployment of the army. Macron has threatened to block the new trade deal between the European Union and several South American countries reached in June unless Bolsonaro takes serious steps to protect the Amazon. On Twitter, Bolsonaro described the G7 plan as an attack on his country's sovereignty. Absence of Trump On Monday morning, US President Donald Trump was the only G7 leader that did not show up at a G7 session on climate, oceans and biodiversity. At the afternoon news conference, Trump called himself an environmentalist. He said his absence was due to his bilateral meetings with leaders from Germany and India. But both Chancellor Angela Merkel and Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the environment session. Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord has been regarded as a major setback for the global cause. Iran also became a major subject of the G7 summit. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif made a surprise visit to Biarritz to meet Macron, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and British and German officials. At the news conference on Monday, Macron said he had informed Trump of his plan to invite Zarif for the visit. Trump said he is open to meeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani under the right circumstances. Tensions between the US and Iran have escalated after Trump pulled the US out from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Iran. Rouhani said on Tuesday that a meeting with Trump would be just a photo op and "that is not possible", adding that the US president first must lift sanctions imposed on Teheran. China, Russia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Iran have all hoped to salvage the deal.
