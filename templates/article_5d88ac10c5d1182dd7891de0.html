                I t's no news that Chinese real estate developers and property buyers are flooding into the US - something that's currently, to many Chinese, a better investment than gold - and it's bringing more than just cash into the market. The increasing interest from the Chinese in US real estate is also creating new business opportunities. Jason Chen, chairman of Shenzhen World Union Properties Consultancy Co Ltd, a listed company that provides real estate consulting services in China, sees it as a trend. "So the idea is to team up with local agents in the US - even smaller ones (compared to the size of World Union) - to serve the growing number of Chinese buyers here," said Chen, who recently attended a business forum in New York to make new business connections. "That is the trend now," said Chen, adding he has visited New York three times this year and has a few agencies in mind. World Union employs some 15,000 people across China who broker all kinds of properties. With a market share of 3 percent, its revenue last year was close to $34.4 billion with the sale of some 300,000 apartments across China, and profits that make him look beyond the home market. "We won't really operate solo here [in New York], and this won't be money-making in the beginning, but we see this as a trend that is still developing and we want to be part of it," he said. "We just need to find a trustworthy partner and feed them with our Chinese client source list." Chen's plan is echoed by industry leaders in the US real estate market who call it a way to "bridge a gap". "In various So Cal communities, we've experienced an upward trend in Chinese buyers purchasing our homes and the majority of those are not local Chinese buyers but those coming from China," said Brian Harrelson, a senior project manager in the Southern California office of Toll Brothers, a US luxury homebuilder. As part of their strategy to attract more Chinese buyers, Toll Brothers has teamed up with realtors for joint events to provide more buyer services, including reimbursing home buyers' international airfare on their Fly-and-Buy program. "There are a lot of agents in China," said Harrelson, "so we're thinking: how can we empower them by providing supporting information in Mandarin and develop relationships between the local and Chinese agents so they work together? "If we can bridge that gap, there will be more potential buyers in the pool, rather than just what we see domestically," he said. Chinese buyers accounted for 18 percent of the $68.2 billion that foreigners spent on residential properties in the US during the 12 months ending March 31, according to the National Association of Realtors. Chinese shoppers are known for being "cash-buyers" and for buying expensive homes, spending a median price of $425,000, almost double the median of what other foreign buyers pay. In California, the Chinese are the third-largest foreign buyers of real estate, after Mexicans and the Filipinos, according to Realtor.org. "The growing number of international buyers in Los Angeles has been an ongoing trend," said Sally Forster Jones, an agent with Coldwell Banker International in Los Angeles. "More and more of the high-end deals are going to international buyers, many of which are coming from China. This is a growing market so it makes sense to do everything possible to tap into the needs of this demographic," said Jones. "I think that the willingness of local and international real estate agencies to work together can bring positive results," said Jones. "We are really living in a global marketplace and real estate is a very collaborative business where connections are everything." In New York, Chinese are second only to wealthy Dominicans in purchasing homes. "It's clear that wealthy Chinese are looking for good investments and NYC real estate is especially appealing to them, so it's nice to have brokers working together to connect those dots, especially when there are language barriers," said Todd Dumaresq, a marketing manager with Toll Brothers City Living in New York. In late June, US developer Tishman Speyer and China's largest residential developer Vanke broke ground on a joint venture to build 655 luxury condos on the San Francisco waterfront. Vanke is one of World Union's clients in China, so, according to Chen, it makes sense for them to follow their big client to the US. "Our business follows our clients - most of whom are major Chinese commercial and residential developers in China - and they are all looking into the US now," Chen said.

                Asian-American community leaders and parents are planning a meeting on Sunday in Flushing over proposed bill that would change admissions to specialized high schools in New York.The Coalition Supporting NYC Specialized High Schools will host a public forum at the Flushing Library on the proposed legislation which would change a 1971 law that makes an exam, known as the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT), the only measure that can be used to admit students to the high schools.Since the 1930s, admission to these schools has been gained through this exam, which is taken by about 30,000 students a year.Community leaders and parents are concerned that the changes could significantly reduce the number of Asian-American students admitted to the schools.The group has circulated a petition that already garnered 3,000 signatures and will be presented to the Mayor's Office. It has also maintained engagement with opponents of the new bill on social media sites, encouraging people to support the current admissions process.Phil Gim, a Chinese American who is a senior adviser to the Asian Cultural Federation (ACF), said on Wednesday that Sunday's event would help dispel misconceptions about the proposed legislation and give residents a venue to address concerns, express opinions and ask questions.Gim said proponents of the bill should not push for a change in the admission criteria unless there is a better alternative to the status quo."The test is the best we have for now, but … all we want is a discussion," Gim said at a media-briefing event. "People need to know and be educated about the law and we want the parents to understand where it's going.""If you come up with something better I have no problem, but until that is the case, I will support the SHSAT," said Gim, a resident of the heavily Asian-populated Flushing, who is running for a state Assembly seat in the 40th District, which covers Flushing and Murray Hill.Critics of the test say it gives a big advantage to those who can afford test preparation instruction. Those backing the proposed legislation say it will make admissions fairer at schools where few black and Hispanic students gain entry.Two of the backers of the proposed bill are Assemblyman Karim Camara of Brooklyn and Senator Adriano Espaillat of Manhattan, The New York Times reported on June 9."Queens has 1900 offers to go to specialized high schools, and under a proposed addition to the bill, we could lose more than 800 seats at these schools," said David Lee, a liaison for the National Association of Asian American Professionals in New York (NAAAPNY). "Queens high schools are at capacity, and [we] don't have any place to send these students."Lee, who is an alumnus of Brooklyn Technical High School, said "it's a shame" that there's a lack of diversity in these schools. He said the "real reason" that officials want to change the test policy is because of "a lack of diversity".The proposed legislation, which is supported by the teachers union and the city's schools chancellor, would allow the schools to use multiple measures, including grade-point averages and state test scores, as well as the current admissions exam to decide whom to admit, rather than just the current 2 1/2-hour-long multiple-choice test.The eight schools include the Bronx High School of Science, the Brooklyn Latin School, Brooklyn Technical High School, High School for Mathematics, Science and Engineering at the City College, High School of American Studies at Lehman College, Queens High School for the Sciences at York College, Staten Island Technical High School, and Stuyvesant High School.A ninth special school has a different process. For Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, acceptance is based on an audition and a review of a student's academic records.jackfreifelder@chinadailyusa.com

                Editor’s Note: What do you think about buying second hand items for you and your family? Do you do it all the time? Or do you think it makes you look cheap? Our Forum readers share their views. You're also welcome to leave your comments.Anming (Austria)In Europe we often collect clothes, books and other things to sell at a flea market or give to charity. We don't mind having stuff that has been used before. In some cases, for example children clothes, it can be healthier to use second-hand clothes, because the textile is treated with chemicals in the factory and if the clothes are washed many times it will be healthier for the child.We have stores to resell second-hand clothes, it is not only for poor people, but also for families with less income or parents who see it as a waste of money to buy clothes for children because they grow so fast. Especially people, who want to protect the environment and have a critical attitude towards consumerism, would also buy in these stores. You can save money and create less trash.

                Editor's note: It is common to see electric bicycles, often referred to as e-bikes, racing down the road, especially in major cities of China. With growing concern about the rising number of electric bicycles and their effect on road safety, some cities, including Shenzhen and Guangzhou, have banned them from most of their streets. Should China consider a total ban on e-bikes? Forum readers share their opinions. You're welcome to add yours.Joe (Canada)Blame the rider, not the ride. An e-bike, bicycle, skateboard, car, rollerblades, etc can be dangerous if the person riding it is careless. What needs to happen is to have more cops out there nailing the bad drivers on any of these forms of transportation.Six young men ride an electric bike on a road in Luoyang city, central China's Henan province, on June 22, 2014.

                As robots are used for a growing number of business and everyday applications, experts say there is a need for more education and a better understanding of the industry."We have to prepare our workforce, and we have to prepare our students," said Dennis Kambeitz, education and business development leader for Canada-based EZ Robot. "They don't understand the scope of what's coming and what they need to do to prepare in what little time they have to do it.Kambeitz spoke during RoboUniverse NYC on Wednesday. The May 11-13 event at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan was the first robotics trade show dedicated to end users of service and collaborative robots."There's no need to hide from the fact that robots will take away jobs," he said during a presentation titled Preparing Our Workforce for a Robotic World. "But we have to change the way we educate people."EZ Robot, which was founded in 2011, is located in Calgary, Alberta. The company makes a robot software platform that can be customized for home, classroom or light industrial use.EZ Robot's manufacturing is based in China, said Kambeitz, and the company ships robots to a number of global locations, including to resellers in the US, Denmark, Spain, South Africa and Singapore.Kambeitz said the company is also looking for partners for resale points in China and India."The biggest challenge is people don't understand the breadth of what robotics is going to do," Kambeitz told China Daily. "My expectation would be that China is going to probably face that, too. But China is investing in robotics, and it's clearly important.""Robotics is really new, and it's still a relatively young industry," said Barry Braunstein, a vice-president with Acorn Product Development in California. "People are still trying to both understand what is good for a robot and what are good applications for a robot."But costs are continuing to come down, and the amount of computing power you can put in per dollar is phenomenal," he said. "So now you can do a lot more things with robotics."Acorn, which was founded in 1993, is a product development firm that has four design centers across the globe, with one in China. The China office has been open for about 10 years.Changing demographics in China, including a shrinking working-age population and an aging society, are two situations that have raised demand for robots, said Liu Junchang, a researcher at the Ministry of Science and Technology in Beijing, in a recent interview with Hebei Daily.By 2050, the Chinese population over age 60 will reach roughly 500 million from nearly 200 million at present, according to Xinhuanet.com.Although China's robotics market still lags that of other major economies, the market is growing rapidly, according to data from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR).In 2013, China became the world's largest robot market with 36,560 industrial robots sold, IFR data showed.Global industrial robot sales reached 225,000 in 2014, up 27 percent from 2013, according to Qu Daokui, president of the Shenyang-based Siasun Robot & Automation Co Ltd, one of China's largest robotics companies.About 56,000 were sold in China, an increase of more than 50 percent year over year, Qu said during a speech at the 2015 China National Robotics Development Forum in Beijing.The IFR forecasts that China will have more robots operating at its production plants by 2017 than any other country, due to growing automation in the auto and electronics industries, as well as a hedge against rising wages.David Askey, co-founder of EnergID Technologies, a robotics engineering firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said: "With the labor shortage in China, there's certainly a demand for automation, and there's a number of incentives in place. Right now, we see a lot of energy and forward focus on automation. Provincial governments are getting involved now because they see the long-term benefit, and local manufacturers seem to be involved too."Wang Ying in Shanghai and Chen Yingqun in Beijing contributed to this story.jackfreifelder@chinadailyusa.comDennis Kambeitz (in purple shirt) of Canada-based EZ Robot speaks with guests during RoboUniverse NYC at the Jacob K.

                NEW YORK -- Some 500 experts, scholars, policymakers and practitioners in the field of education gathered in New York on Saturday to discuss new trends in the industry and the importance of educational exchange between the United States and China.During her keynote speech at the opening of the third annual US-China Education Forum of Columbia University, Julia Chang Bloch, president of the US-China Education Trust, a US-based non-profit organization, said she firmly believes that education is the foundation for building understanding and trust, and has been a "cornerstone" of the US-China relationship.As the two countries are facing some difficulties in bilateral ties, it is "more important than ever to draw on the power of education exchange to build mutual trust, avoid conflict, and ensure peace and prosperity in the 21st century," said 77-year-old Bloch, whose father F.Y. Chang was among the first Chinese students coming to study in the United States over 100 years ago.Bloch, former US ambassador to Nepal and also the first Asian American to hold such a high diplomatic position in US history, called on educators from both sides to play an essential role in promoting one of the most important bilateral ties in the world today.Those who have had the opportunity of studying, living and working in both countries need to step up efforts to safeguard US-China relations against misunderstanding, misperception and miscalculation, she added.Jointly hosted by Columbia University Teachers College Chinese Student and Scholar Association (TCCSSA) and Global China Connection (GCC), the two-day event will also have dozens of panel discussions on early childhood education, educational technology and innovation, career development, and other key issues in the industry.TCCSSA, founded in 1913, is the largest student organization in Teachers College, Columbia University and dedicated to bridging US-China conversations through education.GCC, founded in 2008 also at Columbia University, is a nonprofit organization for university students and young professionals of all nationalities looking to engage China's emergence in the world. GCC is today present in more than 60 universities worldwide.
