                China-Indonesia oil palm plantation gives more income for local villagers
            </p>
            <p>
                SINTANG, Indonesia -- An oil palm plantation operated by the Chinese Julong Group in Indonesia's West Kalimantan province has made local people earn more from their work in the plantation.Most of the villagers around the plantation in Sintang district work part time to harvest oil palm fruits. The rotating harvest in each of the plantation blocks allows them to get extra money besides revenues from their own farmlands."They actually were farmers working in their own land around the village. They were eager to make more money by harvesting the oil palm fruits," Sugianto, chief of Sungai Maram village located near the oil palm plantation, told Xinhua in the plantation in Sintang.Besides the farmers, the plantation also benefits land owners who plant oil palm trees in their lands through a partnership scheme with attractive offer for their oil palm fruits, he added."Basically we have no unemployed people since the plantation's operation here as long as they are willing to work," the village chief added.Farmers can now buy more household necessities and are even able to pay tuition fees for their children up to university, he said.A local couple employed by the plantation said they could save up to 2 million rupiah (about $175) per month compared with almost nothing at their previous workplace in Java."Besides the saving, we can now also have more family time as we only need to work until the afternoon. We worked around the clock to monitor leafs in a tobacco plantation in East Java province," said Tori with his wife standing by his side in the Julong Group plantation.The couple from East Java city of Situbondo also encouraged their family and friends in their hometown to work with them in the plantation.The Julong Group's oil palm plantation in Sintang is a take-over zone from a domestic firm since 2014.The Tianjin-based company has planted 60,000 hectares of oil palm trees, with a total investment of nearly $1.3 billion. The plantation has recruited nearly 10,000 locals, including employees and part-time workers.As the Julong Group prioritizes local employment in Indonesia, it only has 70 Chinese personnel in the plantation.Its cooperation with local oil palm cooperative organizations, like the scheme in Sungai Maram village, has covered 20,000 hectares of land, involved 9,000 villagers and benefited nearly 50,000 people.The China-Indonesia Julong Agricultural Industry Cooperation Zone with five parks on the Kalimantan island was promoted as an economic and trade cooperation zone in August 2016.The group's Supply Chain Director Fan Yang said Julong is a practitioner of China's Belt and Road Initiative.The Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road initiative, proposed by China in 2013, is aimed at building a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient trade routes."The initiative has provided various opportunities for our local investment and expansion. We are confident of making greater achievement and serve the two countries," he said.

                ASEAN subregional grouping reaps rewards
            </a>
            <p>
                For most consumers in the southernmost Philippine province of Tawi-Tawi, the East Malaysian state of Sabah is the main source of most food and consumer products.Merchants from both sides have been sailing the Celebes Sea since the pre-colonial era and the practice continues to this day, owing to the proximity between the two areas.The age-old trade is one of the factors that inspired leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to establish in 1994 a subregional group that aims to boost growth in some of the most neglected provinces in the region.That grouping, the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA), was formally established on March 24, 1994, with then Philippine president Fidel Ramos hosting Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, the late Indonesian president Suharto and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.Besides Brunei, BIMP-EAGA consists of provinces of three ASEAN countries: the eastern islands of Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Maluku and the southernmost province of West Papua in Indonesia; the eastern states of Sabah and Sarawak, and the federal territory of Labuan in Malaysia; and the southern island of Mindanao and the western island province of Palawan in the Philippines.Twenty-five years on, the grouping is firmly established and playing a beneficial role.Antonio Peralta, a former Philippine government official who helped establish BIMP-EAGA, said trade expansion among its members is one of the group's key achievements in the past two decades."Most of the trading activities occurred among businesses in Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei because they have a shared border and have historical trading links," he said.According to the joint statement issued in April 2017 during the 12th BIMP-EAGA Summit held in Manila, the combined GDP of the subregion grew at an annual average of 6.4 percent from 2010 to 2015.Peralta once served as regional economic adviser to former president Ramos. It was Ramos who initiated the creation of BIMP-EAGA as he was then studying how to bring development to Mindanao.Mindanao is a resource-rich area but was often neglected by the national government as it is geographically distant from Manila.Peralta's study of the commodity flows between Sabah and Tawi-Tawi is one of the factors that sparked the creation of BIMP-EAGA.Adriana Elisabeth, a researcher at the Jakarta-based think tank Indonesian Institute of Sciences, said a subregional grouping like BIMP-EAGA allows the national government to bring economic gains to "border" areas - far-flung provinces that are usually off the radar of the country's political and business centers.Elisabeth said member economies of the subregion also focused on developing connectivity by building more infrastructure and communication links.Analysts said that these achievements have spurred the area's leaders to be more ambitious in their goals.The growth area has also extended its reach beyond Southeast Asia and sought China's support.In a statement issued during his Nov 16 state visit to Brunei, President Xi Jinping said the country will "further enhance its cooperation" with the area.A week after the state visit, Brunei hosted the first BIMP-EAGA-China Ministerial Meeting to discuss China's role in the subregional grouping.Peralta said BIMP-EAGA reached out to China given that it is now one of the global economic powerhouses.BIMP-EAGA leaders, he said, are looking into projects that are aligned with the Belt and Road Initiative.China looks at subregional groupings like BIMP-EAGA as it complements its global development projects such as the BRI and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Elisabeth said.

                Indonesia set to move capital city
            </a>
            <p>
                At last it is official. Indonesia is to get a new capital.Indonesian President Joko Widodo made the announcement in a speech to Parliament on Friday, ending months of speculation.The new capital will be relocated to Kalimantan on the island of Borneo, which Indonesia shares with Malaysia and Brunei.Jakarta is one of the world's fastest sinking cities, with some estimates suggesting one-third of the city's landmass could be submerged by 2050.Already regarded as one of the world's most polluted cities, Jakarta, a city of more than 10 million people, is also one of the most congested.In his address to parliament, Jokowi said: "A capital city is not just a symbol of national identity, but also a representation of the progress of the nation."He did not give the exact location in Kalimantan for the new city. It is a region with a population of just over 16 million people and known for rainforests and orangutans.Widodo toured Kalimantan in May to survey potential sites.Kyle Springer, a senior analyst with the Perth USAsia Centre at the University of Western Australia, said from an infrastructure perspective, Jokowi's push to move the national capital to Kalimantan is "interesting"."It is a less developed part of Indonesia where there are a number of infrastructure gaps," the analyst said.An archipelago comprising nearly 17,000 islands, Indonesia has a population of more than 270 million, mostly concentrated on the islands of Java and Sumatra.A question mark has been hanging over the future of Jakarta as the nation's capital for decades.Heri Andreas, a lecturer and researcher with the faculty of Earth Science and Technology and the Institute of Technology Bandung, Indonesia, said Kalimantan was chosen because of its central location in the archipelago.He said the new capital will probably be the political capital of the country while the economic and commercial activities will remain on Java, at least for the time being.He said Jakarta will be the "central economic city" of Indonesia."I don't see Jakarta being left behind after the new capital is established," he said."The magnet of Jakarta is strong and all of the elements that built up Jakarta including the people will still remain."Apart from the obvious reasons to relocate it, "Jokowi's reasoning for the move could be diversifying development in a different part of the archipelago", Springer said.He said the move to Kalimantan will require significant investment in infrastructure."However, moving the seat of the government and bureaucracy out of Jakarta (won't alone) solve the city's problems with pollution, traffic and flooding," he said.As an archipelago stretching 5,000 kilometers from east to west, Indonesia is on the Pacific Ocean basin's so-called Ring of Fire, a 40,000-km horseshoe-shaped arc which is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.Kalimantan sits outside the risk area.North Kalimantan is one of the four economic corridors where Indonesia has proposed China direct its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) investments in the country."This came out of the Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs Luhut Pandjaitan's visit to China in 2018," said Springer."I can identify at least two BRI projects in this province: the Kayan (River) hydropower project and the Tanah Kuning Industrial Park."There could be more, but the BRI does not maintain a public, official list of active and proposed projects in Indonesia."He said the other provinces or "economic corridors" that Indonesia has sought BRI investment in are Bali, North Sumatra and North Sulawesi.Yayat Supriyatna, an urban planner at Trisakti University in Jakarta, said a number of factors favored Kalimantan.While Java is Indonesia's fourth-biggest island, it is home to more than half of the nation's population. Borneo, on the other hand, is the country's third-biggest island but has less than 6 percent of the population."It is ideally situated to be the new capital," Supriyatna said."It is strategically located in the middle of Indonesia and a great deal of the land is already owned by the government or state-owned companies. This would reduce investment costs for infrastructure and relocation," he added.He said existing cities on the island already have airports, ports and roads; good drinking water, electricity, sanitation and communication network services.Moving the capital to a safer, less congested location would cost up to $33 billion, according to Bambang Brodjonegoro, the country's planning minister.The price tag includes new government offices and homes for about 1.5 million civil servants expected to pack up and start moving in 2024.
