                The digital revolution's silent majority
            </p>
            <p>
                A sustainable technological transformation requires widely shared benefits, which means that helping the laggards adapt to the changes is just as important as enabling the innovators to thrive. The voices of the disrupted must be heard.  Statistics can hold brutal truths. We are constantly told that innovation is occurring faster than ever, yet the data coming out of the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution suggest that it is anything but revolutionary. Among advanced economies, productivity growth is the slowest it has been in 50 years.This "productivity paradox" is often attributed to measurement problems or lags following the adoption of disruptive technologies. But another possible explanation is that public debates on technological trends tend to be dominated by the companies and entrepreneurs that are shaping them. The voices of the vast majority of companies that are struggling to keep up with technological change (or actively resisting it) are going unheard.Buzzy talk relies on biased generalizationsAcknowledging this underrepresented perspective is essential to understanding why the digital revolution isn't showing up in the data, and why it may yet stall. Simply put, buzzy talk tends to rely on biased generalizations. For all of their purchase on the public imagination, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, Big Data, and humanoid robots fall within the remit of only a handful of companies. The attention these technologies receive is wildly disproportionate to the scale of their development and adoption. As Dan Ariely of Duke University said in a lighter vein back in 2013, "Big data is like teenage sex: everyone talks about it, nobody really knows how to do it, everyone thinks everyone else is doing it, so everyone claims they are doing it."The dynamic is easy to discern. Journalists chase juicy stories. Investors seek attractive returns. Consumers try to anticipate the next technological fad. Social networks, global media, and international conferences amplify the voices of disruptors who have an interest in inflating their own prospects. And as the information cascades, the ranks of believers grow. The rumor becomes the rule.Consider the World Economic Forum's latest annual report on emerging labor market trends, which is based on a survey of large, multinational corporations. It contends that by 2022, a substantial increase in investments in machine learning, data analytics, new materials and quantum computing will boost demand for data scientists, AI specialists, and robotics engineers, to the detriment of existing professions.Sample not representative of the real economyThe problem is that the World Economic Forum's population sample is hardly representative of the real economy. Across OECD countries, enterprises employing more than 250 workers account for just 7 percent of all active companies and employ less than 40 percent of the workforce. And while the authors of the report acknowledge this bias, their conclusions still amount to dangerous generalizations. Their jobs of the future have nothing to do with the immediate employment needs of the vast majority of small and medium-sized enterprises that are still operating within the framework of the Third Industrial Revolution.Similarly, an OECD study finds that the labor productivity gap between enterprises at the technological frontier and all other enterprises has been widening sharply over the last decade. Many of the advanced technologies one hears so much about in the media remain unexploited by a nontrivial share of companies, which suggests that we have a long wait before even the most revolutionary innovations start driving GDP.It has been said that general-purpose technologies such as electricity and the personal computer tend to boost productivity not immediately, but around 25 years after their inception. Yet it has now been 32 years since Robert Solow, winner of the Nobel Prize for economics observed that, "you can see the computer age everywhere but in productivity statistics", and we still do not see the computer age in the productivity statistics. Why should AI be any different from the personal computers in this respect?Ignoring the perspective of technological laggards can have far-reaching policy implications, especially if techno-alarmism diverts attention from pressing problems facing education systems and labor markets in the here and now. If governments start allocating more resources to train the high-skilled professional elite of tomorrow, they could foster even deeper inequality today.Small firms can seek tougher rules for new technologiesOf course, cynics might dismiss the "losers" as having little to add to the debates on technology: at best, they will fill the roles created for them by the digital vanguard－at worst, they will be forced out of the labor market altogether. But it is worth remembering that smaller companies, even if they face economic headwinds, still have the political power to push for tougher regulation of new technologies that threaten their existence.A global giant like Uber knows this all too well. Over the years, it has encountered strong resistance from small groups of well-organized taxi drivers who were never invited to gatherings of the global elite to contemplate the virtues of the platform economy. By the same token, the "left-behinds" across the world's advanced economies are now taking their revenge by bringing anti-trade, populist parties and politicians to power.To avoid an even worse backlash, and to develop a better appreciation of what the Fourth Industrial Revolution actually entails, one must understand where all companies－not just those at the top－stand with respect to today's disruptions. A sustainable technological transformation requires widely shared benefits, which means that helping the laggards adapt to the changes is just as important as enabling the innovators to thrive. The voices of the disrupted must be heard.The author is a Future of the World fellow at the Center for the Governance of Change at IE University in Madrid.Project SyndicateThe views don't necessarily represent those of China Daily.

                White paper: Democratic Reform in Tibet (full text)
            </a>
            <p>
                Editor's note: China's State Council Information Office on Wednesday issued a white paper titled "Democratic Reform in Tibet－Sixty Years On." Full text below:PreambleThe year 2019 marks the 60th anniversary since the launch of democratic reform in Tibet. In traditional Chinese culture, the 60th year is always memorable as it completes a cycle called the jiazi, a concept unique to the Chinese calendar.Tibet's democratic reform that began six decades ago gave a new life to Tibet and the ethnic peoples living there.These 60 years have changed Tibet completely. Tibet's democratic reform is the greatest and most profound social transformation in the history of Tibet. By abolishing serfdom, a grim and backward feudal system, Tibet was able to establish a new social system that liberated the people and made them the masters of the nation and society, thus ensuring their rights in all matters.These 60 years have turned Tibet into a beautiful home to the people of Tibet. Tibet's democratic reform opened up bright prospects. With the strong support of the central government and the rest of the country, the ethnic peoples of Tibet have spared no effort in forging ahead and transforming their poor and backward old land into a beautiful new home that is economically prosperous and socially advanced, with a sound ecological environment where people live in happiness and contentment.These 60 years have seen solidarity and the enterprising spirit of the people in Tibet. Thanks to democratic reform, the ethnic peoples of Tibet and the rest of the country have worked together with one heart to develop ethnic relationships characterized by equality, unity, mutual support and harmony. In the fight to guard national unity and oppose separatism, the people of Tibet have closely followed the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in the face of all forms of hardship, challenge, and test, reinforcing the communal strength of the Chinese nation.These 60 years have seen a great leap of social progress. Under the strong leadership of the CPC, Tibet has been able to transform from a society under feudal serfdom to socialism, from poverty and backwardness to civility and progress. As Chinese socialism has entered a new era, the ethnic peoples of Tibet, led by the CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinping as the core, are working together with the people of the rest of the country to realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.I. Feudal Serfdom: A Dark HistoryFor centuries Tibet was ruled by theocratical feudal elites. Millions of serfs were subjected to cruel exploitation and oppression until democratic reform was launched in 1959.－Serfs deprived of all rights by the three major estate-holdersThe laws of old Tibet divided people into three classes and nine ranks, legalizing the unequal status of different groups and allowing the estate-holders to deny all human rights of their serfs. In the government, controlled by the three major estate-holders (government officials, nobles, and upper-ranking lamas in monasteries), all levels of officials came from the families of high-ranking lamas and nobles. Children of major noble families, upon birth, would automatically obtain the fourth-highest official rank, and they could take key positions in government when they were 17 or 18 years of age. Children from middle-ranking and lesser noble families could also take up official positions in government after spending some time studying at official training schools. Most monk officials were lamas from noble families, while serfs, who constituted the vast majority of the Tibetan society, struggled hopelessly on the very bottom rung of society.－The serfs' life and death in the hands of the three major estate-holdersThe three major estate-holders applied every means to maintain feudal serfdom, with cruel and barbarous laws and punishments imposed by judicial organs and courts set up within their scopes of influence. Apart from jails set up by the government, there were penitentiaries and private jails run by large monasteries and aristocrats where instruments of torture were kept and private tribunals were held. They cast verdicts, flogged and tortured serfs, had them chained and shackled. Volumes of documents written in Tibetan testify to the savage punishments meted out to serfs, such as cutting off the tongue, nose, hands and feet, making them wear stone hats, gouging out the eyes, pulling out tendons, skinning, drowning, and even feeding them to scorpions. The Snang Rtse Shag, located to the north of the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, used to be the judiciary of old Tibet. Infamously known as a "living hell", this was where serfs were tortured and slaughtered at will to supply the upper class of the Kashag (cabinet) regime and high-ranking monks with such horrible offerings as human head, skin, flesh, heart, and intestines, which were considered "necessary" when chanting certain scriptures.－Land, pastures and other means of production monopolized by the three major estate-holdersAccording to statistics gathered prior to democratic reform, a staggering 99.7 percent of all the 220,000 hectares of cultivated land in Tibet was owned by the government (85,580 ha), the monasteries and high-ranking monks (80,960 ha), and aristocrats (52,800 ha), while the remaining 0.3 percent of cultivated land was owned by a handful of land-tilling peasants in remote areas. Most pastures were controlled by herd owners. A ballad among serfs of the time goes:Even if the snow mountain melts into butter,It is the property of the masters.Even if the river water turns into milk,There is not a single drop for us.－Serfs owned and enslaved by the three major estate-holdersThe bondage of serfs to the land owners was protected by the powerful theocratic rule. The Kashag regime prescribed that all serfs must stay on the land within the manor of their owners. They were not allowed to step out of the manor without permission; fleeing the manor was forbidden. Any serf who attempted to flee might receive a lashing as punishment or have their feet chopped off. The Kashag and the Dalai Lama also issued decrees prohibiting the furnishing of refuge to fleeing serfs.With their absolute control of land, the three major estate-holders held the power of life, death and marriage over their serfs. Since serfs were their private property, they could trade and transfer them, present them as gifts, use them as gambling stakes or as mortgages for debt, or exchange them at will.The three major estate-holders also imposed heavy corvée labor on serfs. For example, before the liberation of Tibet in 1951, the Darongqang Manor owned by Gyaltsap Tajtra held a total of 96 ha of land, and 81 able-bodied and semi-able-bodied serfs. They were assigned a total of 21,266 corvée days per year, including 11,826 days working for their owners and 9,440 days for the government. The average corvée labor of each serf amounted to 262.5 days a year, or 72 percent of their entire year of labor.－Serfs exploited by exorbitant taxes and leviesIn old Tibet, the three major estate-holders possessed almost all means of production. They burdened their serfs with inhumane taxes and levies. The Kashag regime alone imposed some 200 different taxes. Serfs had to borrow money to survive, and more than 90 percent of serfs were in debt. Serfs were burdened with all kinds of debts such as debts passed down from previous generations, new debts, debts resulting from joint liability, and debts apportioned among all the serfs. The debts that were passed down from previous generations and could never be repaid even by succeeding generations accounted for one-third of the total debts. There was a widespread ballad that described the debts that bound serfs:The debts owed by the grandpa of my grandpaCould not be paid off by the father of my father,And the son of my sonWill not be able to repay even the interest.According to statistics collated in 1959-60, during Tibet's democratic reform usurious loans of 236,600 tons of grain and 700 million liang of Tibetan silver were written off. The loans written off during democratic reform surpassed the entire 175,000-ton grain output of the whole of Tibet in 1958.－Strict mind control in the name of religionThe three major estate-holders exercised mind control over serfs so that they accepted their fate in the hope of entering the "Elysium" after they died and obtaining "happiness in the next life". In Tibetan Travel Notes (Chibetto Taizaiki), a Japanese monk named Tokan Tada, who entered Tibet in 1913, wrote: "The Tibetans are very religious. They are convinced of their sins, and believe that the Dalai Lama's heavy taxes are a means of redemption. They also believe in happiness in the next life if their sins are cleansed in this life."In Abolishing the Feudal Privileges and Exploitation in Tibetan Lamaist Monasteries, well-known Tibetologists Wang Sen and Wang Furen wrote: "From 1958 to the spring of 1959, one chapel in the western suburbs of Lhasa, for the purpose of prayer, asked for 27 human heads, six skulls, four leg bones, one full human skin, one corpse, 14 bundles of intestines, eight chunks of human flesh, and nine bottles of human blood."After presiding over the enthronement ceremony of the 14th Dalai Lama in 1940, Wu Zhongxin, chief of the Commission for Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs of the National Government, described the situation in old Tibet in his "Report on Tibetan Affairs on a Mission": "People of all classes and ranks believe they are destined to belong to a certain class or rank from the previous life, and they are accustomed to it. Even those in the lowest rank are content with the status quo." Monopolizing the spiritual and cultural life of the Tibetan people, the three major estate-holders attacked as heresy any idea or culture that ran contrary to their interests. The Tibetan scholar Gedun Chophel, who exposed the corruption and degeneracy of monks and advocated reform in Tibetan Buddhism, was imprisoned and persecuted by the Kashag government.

                De'ang ethnic group have overcome impoverished lives by their own initiatives and government support programsEditor's Note: As the People's Republic of China prepares to celebrate its 70th anniversary on Oct 1, China Daily is featuring a series of stories on the role regions have played in the country's development and where they are today.Australia is far away, but the word "Australian" is often on the lips of villagers at Santaishan township, home to a large population of the De'ang ethnic group.The macadamia nut, called the "Australian nut" by villagers in recognition of where it originated, is widely planted in Santaishan. Growing the nut is one of many ways that local residents have been lifted out of poverty in recent years.Located in southwestern Yunnan province, close to the Myanmar border, the township is surrounded by mountains and shrouded by clouds and mist almost every morning.Around 60 percent of its 7,593 people belong to the De'ang ethnic group, accounting for one-fifth of all De'ang people living in China.A total of 2,481.4 hectares of macadamias are planted near the township, producing 833.2 metric tons of the nuts, selling for 10 yuan ($1.44) to 12 yuan per kilogram, according to the local government.It has become one of the farmers' main sources of income along with sugar cane, tea, passion fruit and livestock.The idea of growing macadamias in the province germinated in the 1990s in the village of Mengzhi after one local man read a magazine article about the environment needed to grow them, and the high prices the nuts fetched.Today more than 174,667 hectares are under cultivation in Yunnan, and revenue from the nuts is benefiting those ethnic groups living in remote areas, such as the De'ang.The De'ang and two other ethnic groups, the Derung and Jino, were in April declared to have come out of serious poverty.

                Class barriers still loom large in British life
            </a>
            <p>
                The head of Britain's once-powerful trade union movement has called on Parliament to outlaw discrimination against the working class, citing income gaps between people of different social backgrounds.It may be three-quarters of a century since reforming politicians attempted to level the playing field by introducing universal education, free healthcare and other egalitarian measures, but Britain - or more specifically England - continues to be obsessed by the issue of class.Keen-eared, keen-eyed Brits can instantly position their fellow citizens on the social scale by their accent, their table manners or their dress, and they judge them accordingly.What concerns Frances O'Grady, head of the Trades Union Congress, known as the TUC, is that young people from a working class background can still expect to earn less than their counterparts even when they are engaged in the same work."The system is rigged from the start," she told the TUC's annual conference. "Where you come from. What your parents do. Your accent. Which school you went to. If you're from a workingclass family, the odds are stacked against you."She proposed that companies should be forced to report any gaps in pay between workers from different social backgrounds in the same way as they are obliged to report on any wage gaps linked to ethnicity or gender.Among the concerns of labor union officials is that employers interviewing new staff often display a perhaps unconscious bias against applicants from more modest backgrounds.The class issue has inevitably surfaced in the context of Britain's Brexit debate, with supporters of the 2016 referendum vote to quit the European Union interpreting it as a revolt by a marginalized proletariat against an ill-defined ruling elite.Academic research showing that the leave vote was most concentrated among those who would define themselves as middle class has failed to overturn this misconception.Ironically, among the chief defenders of the perceived revolt of the dispossessed are Boris Johnson, the eminently bourgeois prime minister, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, a parliamentarian who never tires of projecting an aristocratic image. Both men went to Eton, the country's premier public school. In the lookingglass world of the English class system, a public school is one that elsewhere in the world would be called a private school.Britain's post-World War II reformers hoped that their policies would make class distinction a thing of the past, as they aimed to introduce equality of opportunity, if not necessarily equality of outcome.Tony Blair, who was leader of a Labour Party government until 2007, sought to establish a meritocracy in which the most able from any social class would rise to the top. The theme was also picked up by Theresa May, one of his Conservative successors as prime minister."I want Britain to be the world's great meritocracy," she said in 2018, "a country where everyone has a fair chance to go as far as their talent and their hard work will allow."She added: "And I want Britain to be a place where advantage is based on merit not privilege; where it's your talent and hard work that matter, not where you were born, who your parents are or what your accent sounds like."The reality, in 21st century Britain, is that it has become more and more difficult for talented youngsters from a working class background to progress toward a better life than their parents enjoyed. Increasingly, economics, not just social snobbery, is holding them back.Outsiders continue to look on Britain's class obsessions with a mixture of fascination and bemusement. In many societies, money, rightly or wrongly, tends to be the measure of people's self-identification in the social order.In Britain, however, a middle class family fallen on hard times will always feel themselves the social superiors of the self-made millionaire who rose from the working classes.These atavistic attitudes will not dissolve overnight. After all, they have survived the legacy of post-war progressive legislation.The fear, however, as expressed by the TUC's O'Grady is that the country is going backwards by entrenching class privileges that many hoped would one day disappear.Changing patterns of work and above all declining job security, once jealously defended by the now-depleted union movement, means many at the lower end of the social scale have fallen into a poverty trap from which they and their children will find it impossible to escape.Education, theoretically free to all, now imposes the burden of high college fees on those who can ill-afford to take on debt. The best jobs go to those whose parents can afford the fees at expensive public – that is, private - schools.If you grew up in the wrong part of town, speak with the wrong accent, went to the wrong school or had the wrong parents, it seems that in contemporary Britain, the odds are still stacked against you.
