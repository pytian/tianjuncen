                When the US administration decided to add Huawei to its sanctioned entity list in May on the grounds that the Chinese company threatens US national security, it was no doubt expecting a big win. Cutting the Chinese telecommunications equipment giant off from key US component and software suppliers was meant to at least delay, if not derail, its advance on many technological fronts such as 5G networks, thus benefiting peer US technology companies. But things don't always go as intended. In the era of globalization where economies in the global supply chain are closely interdependent, the technology ban means pain for US companies too.

                People in Chongqing enjoyed a spectacular show in the sky performed by 250 drones over the south bank of the Yangtze River on Monday night.As part of the 2019 Smart China Expo, which opened in the city on Monday and runs through Thursday, the local organizer Nan'an District hoped to showcase its smart technology development.The performance started at 8:30 pm and lasted about 10 minutes. The drones formed a dozen of images in the sky, including of a robot and local landmarks.The annual Smart China Expo, launched last year, aims to present new products, technologies, business formats and modes of smart technology through conferences, exhibitions, summits and competitions.This year's expo has attracted over 1,800 participants and 843 companies from 28 countries and regions, including 13 Nobel Prize laureates, four Turing Award winners, Fortune 500 business leaders and tech giants including Intel, Tencent, Baidu, Alibaba and Xiaomi.

                When the US administration decided to add Huawei to its sanctioned entity list in May on the grounds that the Chinese company threatens US national security, it was no doubt expecting a big win.Cutting the Chinese telecommunications equipment giant off from key US component and software suppliers was meant to at least delay, if not derail, its advance on many technological fronts such as 5G networks, thus benefiting peer US technology companies.But things don't always go as intended. In the era of globalization where economies in the global supply chain are closely interdependent, the technology ban means pain for US companies too.The US Commerce Department has reportedly received more than 130 applications from companies for licenses to sell US goods to Huawei. That number far exceeds the 50 or so that the US disclosed receiving in July. The US suppliers just cannot afford to lose their key client.Last year, Huawei bought $70 billion worth of components and parts from suppliers worldwide, of that about $11 billion was spent purchasing products from US companies such as Qualcomm, Intel and Microsoft. Ceasing doing business with Huawei represents a loss of billions of dollars for these US companies.Sure, the technology ban may cause Huawei temporary interruption in supplies. But it will eventually weather the storm by either increasing its self-reliance with greater innovation or finding new supplies from sources in other countries. Huawei has already unveiled its own operating system, Harmony, as an alternative to Google's Android.That's why the US administration, in response to calls from US technology companies, has twice given three-month reprieves for them to continue selling components to Huawei after the ban, to at least offset the ramifications of the restriction. It is evident that US tech companies cannot just "decouple" with their Chinese counterparts without suffering damage. But the US administration's intransigence — even after repeated setbacks — should never be underestimated.The US president still believes that he will be able to coerce China into reaching a deal on his terms if more pain can be inflicted on the country through use of even higher tariffs. "China should not retaliate — will only get worse!" he tweeted on Monday after raising tariffs on $550 billion in Chinese imports. It sounds like he wants to push the "war of attrition" forward, even at the cost of US businesses.Hopefully, the US companies' pleas for a truce — in the form of their applications for license to continue business as usual — will incentivize Washington to have second thoughts on the future relations between the world's two largest economies.

                    China excels in using AI in security and retail: expert said

            <p class="style-content">
                The applications of computer vision technologies are very impressive in China but more progress is needed for the use of artificial intelligence in smart cars and other open scenarios, a senior expert said.Song Jiqiang, managing director of Intel Labs China, said the last two years have seen rapid applications of AI, with progress in computer vision most impressive."Computer vision technologies are being increasingly used in the security and surveillance sector. And its use in smart retail, such as face-recognition-enabled payments, is also very fast. China excels in applying cutting-edge technologies to daily consumption scenarios," Song added.Also, AI-enabled customer services are getting more popular, with smart-voice-assistants increasingly used in banks and other sectors, Song added.But when it comes to open environments, such as autonomous driving, where machines need to be flexible and smart enough to deal with a wide range of new experiences, progress fell short of expectations, the expert said."In general, the commercial use of sensing technologies is quite good, but AI's ability to deal with the unknown fell short of expectations," Song added.

                    From agrarian backwater to industrial powerhouse
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                BEIJING -- An agrarian backwater that struggled to feed its population 70 years ago, China is now an indispensable supplier in the global industrial chain, manufacturing and exporting everything from daily necessities to high-speed trains.The following are quick walk-throughs of the tectonic shifts in China's industrial strength and the drivers behind the changes, which may offer a glimpse of the country's industrial future.-- How was the "world factory" built from scratch?From having only mining, textile and some simple manufacturing industries to covering nearly all industrial categories, China's emergence as the "world factory" is built upon low labor and production costs compared with that of more developed countries.The country's reform and opening-up drive in the late 1970s enabled the more adventurous entrepreneurs in coastal cities to start their own businesses, overcoming difficulties and successfully turning small workshops into big manufacturing companies.Since then, China's manufacturing sector started to take off. World Bank data showed that China overtook the United States as the world's largest manufacturing country in terms of added value in 2010 and has retained first place ever since.-- How China has moved up the industrial value chain?Coming into the 21st century, China started to focus on high-tech and advanced manufacturing sectors, with a modern industrial system gradually taking shape.Apart from the traditional "Made in China" tags on the store shelves, high-speed trains and semi-conductors are becoming the new signatures for Chinese manufacturing.In 2017, the high-tech sector's prime operating revenue above the designated size came in at 15.9 trillion yuan (about $2.2 trillion), up 55.8 percent than the same period in 2012.The rapid development can be attributed to the continuous investment in research and development, with its expenditure surging 83.6 percent in the same period to 318.3 billion yuan.-- How will China's industrial strength contribute to a shared future?Over the past decades, China's industrial development has benefited from open cooperation with other countries, and its gaining strength will in turn help deliver more opportunities for other market players.In June 2019, China officially approved 5G commercial services, marking the start of a smart new era as the application of the superfast wireless technology helps connect more things, services and market players.Foreign enterprises including Nokia, Ericsson, Qualcomm and Intel have been deeply involved in the experimentation of the technologies, and Chinese regulators have welcomed enterprises from home and abroad to actively participate in the building, application and promotion of its 5G network and share the sector's development dividends.As the 5G case has showed, China's industrial ambition means more opportunities for domestic and foreign companies to compete and prosper together. The one propeller for the country's industrial upgrading is to keep opening up its market and economy to the world.
