                            TEHERAN - Thousands of Iranians rallied on Friday to mark Quds, or Jerusalem Day, which will see demonstrations across the Middle East as the Trump administration tries to offer an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. Addressing a nation bewildered by the prospect of an unprecedented second election campaign in the same year, Netanyahu brandished an official US State Department map that had been updated to incorporate the long-disputed Golan Heights as part of Israel. This year's protests come as the White House is promoting the June 25-26 meeting in the Gulf state of Bahrain as the first phase of its long-awaited Middle East peace plan

Not only were cross-Straits ties friendly but also two-way trade and people-to-people exchanges flourished because Ma accepted the 1992 Consensus. Hopefully, the loss of "diplomatic" allies will force the Tsai administration to realize there is no international space for Taiwan "independence", and it would be playing with fire if it continues to pursue that illusory goal

                             That the island has been further isolated in the world during Tsai's tenure can be squarely blamed on her refusal to accept the 1992 Consensus that there is only one China.Given the pro-independence stance of Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen and her Democratic Progressive Party, it is not surprising that the island has lost many of its "diplomatic" partners in recent years. It was particularly appalling to hear a Taiwan official say the aid Kiribati has sought from Beijing includes loans and a Boeing 737 aircraft, as it is an insult to all the 179 countries that have diplomatic relations with Beijing
