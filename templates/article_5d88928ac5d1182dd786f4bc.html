                Trade friction to weigh on Latin American economies: Scholars
            </p>
            <p>
                BEIJING - The US escalation of trade friction with China will incur negative impact on Latin American economies, according to scholars.Higher tariffs as well as US restrictions on investment between the two countries will send the global trade and investment liberalization process that continued during the past century into a backwater, said Enrique Dussel Peters, coordinator of the Center for China-Mexico Studies of the National Autonomous University of Mexico.The trade friction will shrink global trade, risk threatening global economic growth, and weigh on the export-oriented Latin American economies, which already suffered from trade weakness, said Yue Yunxia, a scholar with the Institute of Latin American Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.Andres Borquez Basaez, director of Chinese Studies Program at the Institute of International Studies with the University of Chile, said the world economy was an interdependent system and US-China trade friction would cause damage to developing countries.Yue said some Latin American countries would take a direct hit as falling trade volumes could erode the countries' revenues from Panama Canal passage charges.

                High-speed train plan follows tracks of history
            </a>
            <p>
                China's latest proposal to help build Panama's railways is a proposed high-speed line connecting the country's capital with the western province of Chiriqui, which borders Costa Rica.China's involvement in Panamanian railroads goes back more than 160 years to the many Chinese workers who were hired to help build the interoceanic railroad starting in 1849, before the Panama Canal was built to connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.Just five months after the establishment of diplomatic ties in June last year, the two countries signed a collaboration memorandum to promote cooperation in technology and enhance the role of China's financial institutions in Panama's rail network, according to the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner.In December last year, China's Ministry of Commerce confirmed it would finance a feasibility study for a railway connecting Panama City with David, the capital of Chiriqui province.The study will analyze the viability, benefits, technical parameters and other factors involved in building a rail system.The train would reduce travel time for passengers and freight between Chiriqui province and the national capital, which can take eight to 10 hours on the Pan-American Highway, as well as serve cities along its route. Flights between David and Panama City take about an hour."The new railway is expected to greatly cut travel time and thus facilitate the movement of agricultural products along the route. It will bring convenience to travelers who want to transfer at the capital's airport," said Mai Qijia, director of the Panama Association for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China.The plan to build a new railway comes at a time when efforts have been made to commemorate the first group of Chinese workers to arrive in Panama in the mid-19th century and the subsequent people-to-people ties that have grown between Chinese and Panamanians.Records from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council show that about 4,000 Chinese workers were hired by a company from the United States to work on what is now called the Panama Canal Railway from 1849 to 1854."Some died on the ship to Panama, and some died of tropical diseases or lived under extremely miserable conditions," Mai said.As a result of those early Chinese workers and others that arrived later, people of Chinese ancestry are a significant minority group in Panama. Their descendants have spread out to other nations in the Americas.For years the Panamanian government didn't acknowledge the contributions made by Chinese, and years of exclusionary laws against Chinese people hampered the search for the workers' bodies, Mai said.However, people of Chinese ancestry in Panama have shown their capability to boost development and have built friendships.In 2010, Mai participated in a mission that eventually located the graves of many missing workers. Each was marked with a block of stone inscribed with an employee number."The scene was heart-wrenching," Mai said. Chinese associations in Panama collected money to inter the remains according to the customs of Guangdong province, the home of the majority of the workers.Memorials have also been built in memory of Chinese workers in Panama, erected not only as a remembrance of history but also as a testament to the advancing cooperation between the countries."I am looking forward to seeing China utilize its experience in building bullet trains and freight trains to help ramp up Panama's infrastructure," Mai said."Nowadays, there are mutual interests in cooperation. I understand that issues like different labor laws and land-use regulations might pose challenges in the process of building the new railway, but we believe in the potential of China's involvement in Panama."

                Natural extension of the Belt and Road
            </a>
            <p>
                For Latin American and Caribbean countries, China's model of globalization, based on connectivity and inclusive development, has great potential and attractiveness After four decades of unprecedented growth, China has not only lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, it has also become one of the two leading economies in the world, both in terms of GDP as well as share of world trade. Moreover, in the last decade, China has taken a much more active role as a global actor and has become more assertive in multilateral agendas. The Belt and Road Initiative, announced by President Xi Jinping in 2013, is a key element of this new role, as it represents a new type of globalization - globalization with "Chinese characteristics". China and Latin America and the Caribbean have boosted their relationship significantly, particularly since China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001. A growing number of partnerships and free trade agreements in force and in negotiation - two White Papers; the China-CELAC Forum; China's incorporation to the Inter-American Development Bank as the first extra regional member in 2009, and more interest in joining the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Belt and Road Initiative are proof of this. Since 2013, President Xi and Premier Li Keqiang have made five trips in all to Latin America and the Caribbean and visited 12 countries. Total trade between China and the LAC has increased more than 15 times between 2002 and 2017. And the LAC is currently the second largest recipient region of Chinese foreign direct investment and third - after Africa and Central and Eastern Europe - in receiving financial assistance from China. Chinese banks such as the China Development Bank and the China Export-Import Bank have become the largest lenders to the region, surpassing the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. In addition to the growing diplomatic, commercial and financial relations between the LAC and China, during the Belt and Road Initiative Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing in May 2017, two leaders from South America, Mauricio Macri from Argentina and Michelle Bachelet from Chile attended. At the forum, President Xi referred to the LAC as the "natural extension" of the Belt and Road Initiative. This is also in line with several of President Macri's main objectives for his mandate - investment in national infrastructure, (bi-oceanic) connectivity between Mercosur and the Pacific Alliance, and the broader Initiative for the Infrastructure Integration of South America. Regarding the bi-oceanic connections, this is not new, although in the light of the Belt and Road Initiative it has taken on a new dimension. In 2013 there was a proposal for a Central Bi-oceanic Railway as a result of the meeting between Bolivian President Evo Morales and President Xi, which would unite the port of Santos in Brazil with Ilo in Peru in a total distance of around 3,000 kilometers, half of which would be through Bolivian territory, in a project which is usually referred to as the "Panama Canal of the 21st century". Panama, an important logistics hub in Latin America, not only by its bi-oceanic channel but also by its multiple air connections in the region, restored diplomatic relations with People's Republic of China in June 2018 and, since then, 28 bilateral treaties have been signed. In addition, in the latest trip of President Xi to Panama in December 2018, it became the first country in the region to formally join the Belt and Road Initiative. Moreover, an imminent announcement is expected regarding a free trade agreement between the two countries. In the first decade of the new millennium the relationship between the LAC and China was mainly marked by trade; whereas in this second decade energy and infrastructure investment sectors have gained in importance. Now, numerous investment projects exist in the region, from nuclear plants, lithium extraction and dams in Argentina, oil in Venezuela, hydraulic power in Ecuador, electric power in Brazil, among others. Even in terms of digital connectivity, there is the possibility of installing a high-speed fiber optic submarine cable between China and Chile, which would be the first through the South Pacific and would transform the Andean country into a digital hub in the Southern Cone region. In March 2018, the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank was held in the Argentine city of Mendoza, which Jin Liqun, president of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, also attended, and the possibility of cooperation between the two institutions was raised, especially to address the infrastructure deficit in the LAC. The next annual meeting will coincide with the 10th anniversary of the incorporation of China in the bank and the meeting will take place in Chengdu on March 26-31, so more cooperation between the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank can be expected. There are currently seven countries in the region that have applied for membership of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, among which Brazil has been a prospective member since its founding in 2015; Peru, Venezuela, Bolivia, Argentina, Chile and Ecuador have been prospective members since 2017. China has focused on a dual-type strategy, in which it not onl participates in the existing post-Bretton Wood Western institutions, but at the same time proposes its own alternative and complementary ones. China's new model of globalization, based on connectivity and inclusive development, has great potential and attractiveness for the LAC countries. Investments in infrastructure, greater connectivity, greater inclusive development - are undeniably urgent and necessary for the economic development of the region. However, it is vital that this infrastructure does not replicate past patterns of the 19th century, which focused solely on extractive and export-oriented insertion. Instead, local, national and regional economic development of an inclusive, balanced and long-term nature is needed. On the other hand, the greatest benefit China can obtain out of involvement in the region is its building and cementing its reputation as a good articulator of this new globalization. Therefore, in the coming decades, it will be crucial, that not only the LAC design long-term beneficial strategies together with China, but also that China take the necessary precautions to ensure its investments and projects in the region are mutually beneficial.

                Jimmy Carter becomes longest-living US president
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - Jimmy Carter on Friday passed George H. W. Bush to become the longest-living US President at the age of 94 years and 172 days.Bush, the 41st US President, died on Nov 30, 2018, 171 days after he reached the age of 94.Carter, born Oct 1, 1924, served as the 39th President of the United States from 1977 to 1981 after being the 76th governor of the southern state of Georgia for several years.During his presidency, Carter, a Democrat, established a national energy policy to deal with the energy shortage, strengthened environmental protection, and created the Department of Education, while seeking to address the nation's economic woes of inflation and unemployment.In foreign affairs, he obtained ratification of the Panama Canal treaties in 1977, helped bring amity between Egypt and Israel through the Camp David Accords in 1978, and established Washington's formal diplomatic ties with Beijing as well as reached an agreement with Moscow on the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II) in 1979.Carter is an underrated president, US former senior diplomat J. Stapleton Roy said last week during a seminar at Johns Hopkins University."He was only in for four years, but in the first two years of his administration, he established diplomatic relations with China, he got the SALT II agreement, and he got the Camp David Accords," Roy said.Carter's breakthrough with China was one of the major foreign policy accomplishments during his presidency.In late 1978, Carter and the then Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping reached a historic decision to establish full diplomatic relations between the United States and China on Jan 1, 1979, laying the foundation for the rapid growth of bilateral relations.In January at Atlanta, Carter said in a symposium that the 40-year-long diplomatic relationship between the United States and China has contributed to peace, stability, and prosperity of both countries and beyond.He noted that since 1979, peace and stability have prevailed in East Asia, the hotbed of conflicts and wars for long, and that both China and the United States have been blessed with economic growth."The 40th anniversary of this relationship is a testament to the ability of countries with different histories, cultures and political systems to work together for the greater good," Carter said in his article published in The Washington Post in December.The former president also suggested that Washington and Beijing should continue to work together on global issues like the denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula, counter-terrorism, environmental and climate change, and promoting development in Africa in particular."I believe they (the leaders) also must accept our conviction that the United States and China need to build their futures together, for themselves and for humanity at large," he added.

                Record Chinese representation in global yacht race
            </a>
            <p>
                The twelfth consecutive edition of the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race is set to prove sailing in China is going from strength to strength, with a record number of Chinese crew and teams set to take part in the global ocean adventure.For the first time in the 23 year history of the Clipper Race, there will be three Chinese teams, with the cities of Qingdao, Sanya and Zhuhai to compete against eight other teams as they race 40,000 nautical miles around the planet.To assist in their global adventure, the Qingdao team will be led by British yachtsman Chris Brooks, Scottish Skipper Seumas Kellock will be at the helm for team Visit Sanya, while world record breaking South African sailor Nick Leggat will skipper the Zhuhai team.The previous edition of the Clipper Race was a huge triumph for the Chinese entrants. Sanya capped off a memorable debut by claiming the overall win, with Skipper Wendy Tuck making history as the first female skipper to ever win a round the world yacht race. Team Qingdao continued the Chinese success by finishing third.Following the recent Selection Week in Sanya, there will be a record 48 Ambassador Crew from the cities of Sanya, Zhuhai and Qingdao travelling to the UK to spend a month training to be ocean racers. Just like the wider Clipper Race crew, the ambassadors are of all ages and come from all walks of life, and include a graphic designer, engineer, CEO, bilingual event host, snowboard instructor and teacher. What unifies the ambassadors is their desire to become sailors and promote their cities around the world.The Clipper Race is undoubtedly one of the greatest ocean adventures and renowned as the toughest endurance challenges on the planet. Founded in 1996 by Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, who this month celebrated 50 years since becoming the first person to sail solo and non-stop around the world, it is the only event of its kind for non-professional sailors.Taking almost a year to complete, it consists of eleven teams, each made up of a Skipper, Mate, and a crew who come from all over the globe and many different walks of life, competing against each other on the world's largest matched fleet of 70-foot ocean racing yachts. Fewer people have sailed around the world than climbed Mount Everest, and with 40 percent of crew having no previous sailing experience before signing up – the achievement is all the more incredible.Clipper Race Founder and Chairman Sir Robin Knox-Johnston said: "Through the Ambassador Crew programmes for our Chinese Partners, hundreds of people have been introduced to sailing and trained as ocean racers."The first Chinese man and woman to sail around the world, Guo Chuan and Vicky Song, both began their sailing careers as Qingdao Ambassadors in the Clipper Race."More than 700 people from 44 different countries will be taking part in the Clipper 2019-20 Race, with more than half of them visiting one or more of our Chinese Host Port Partner Cities during their time on the race. Chris, Nick and Seumas (the three Skippers representing Qingdao, Zhuhai and Sanya respectively) are exceptional leaders and ready to fly the flag for their adopted Chinese cities. The welcome they will receive into their Host Ports will be second to none."The Clipper Race's association with China is long standing. Qingdao is the longest serving Host Port and Team Partner in the history of the global event. The Clipper 2019-20 Race will be the eighth consecutive edition to feature the iconic red and gold hull of China's Sailing City. This will be the second straight race for the tropical paradise city of Sanya, while Zhuhai will make its debut in the upcoming Clipper 2019-20 Race which will start in the UK this summer. Zhuhai, China's City of Islands, is already shaping up as highlight destination for crew due to its spectacular coastline and the world's longest sea crossing bridge, has signed a three edition deal to be a Host Port and Team Partner for the 2019-20, 2021-22 and 2023-24 editions of the global event.Beyond the race, its organizing company, Clipper Ventures, recently announced a new Chinese division to meet the country's growing participation in sailing. Named Clipper China, this new division will utilize the world-class sail training expertise of the Clipper Race to develop offshore sail training and regattas in cities across China, and is currently building its own offshore racing yachts for its use.Starting from the UK later this summer, the Clipper 2019-20 Race route will see the teams race from the UK, across the Atlantic to South America; the South Atlantic to South Africa; across the Southern Ocean's Roaring Forties to Western Australia; around to East Australia, back into the Northern Hemisphere to China where teams will race to Qingdao, via Sanya and Zhuhai; across the mighty North Pacific to West Coast USA; to East Coast USA via the famous Panama Canal; and then it's a final Atlantic crossing; before arriving back to the UK as fully proven ocean racers.

                Panama to deepen ties with China at ongoing trade show
            </a>
            <p>
                Panama is eyeing opportunities created by the ongoing 2019 China International Fair for Trade in Services aiming to deepen cooperation with China in fields including tourism and logistics, said Ariadna Padron Di Bello, charge d'affaires at the embassy of Panama in China. This is the first time for Panama to take part in CIFTIS, Di Bello said. "During the fair, we hope to seek more cooperation opportunities with our location advantage as the gateway of China to Latin America." Located at the American continent, Panama borders both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. It is home to the Panama Canal and the Colon Free Trade Zone, a global commodity distribution center. The Panama Canal carries nearly 6 percent of the world's trade volume annually. Panama's domestic market is mainly based on the service-oriented economy and the country has become a regional financial hub, signing more than 20 business agreements with relevant parties in Latin America, said Di Bello. "With these advantages, we hope to attract more companies to set up their headquarters in our country," she said. In 2017, China and Panama established diplomatic relations. Over the past two years, the two countries have signed a total of 48 agreements incorporating trade, infrastructure construction, tourism and marine transportation, according to Di Bello. Data from CEIC, an international financial information provider, showed that from January to October in 2018, China's exports to Panama reached $5.71 billion. with imports from Panama amounting to $53.7 million. "China is a crucial trade partner for Panama. The two countries will have further exchanges especially in promoting bilateral trade," Di Bello said. Last year, Air China launched the first direct flight from Beijing to Panama, taking about 19 hours. In early May, an agreement on mutual passport facilitation came into effect, increasing the validity period for mutual multiple-entry visas from three years to five years. From November 2017, Panama has been involved in the Belt and Road Initiative. The initiative brings opportunities for the two countries to deepen cooperation in fields such as logistics, infrastructure and maritime, said Di Bello. "Panama will enhance strengths to provide a better platform for Chinese companies to develop in Latin American markets," she said. liangkaiyan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily 05/31/2019 page12)

                Donate blood, but not to mosquitoes
            </a>
            <p>
                INSTEAD OF KILLING MOSQUITOES, people should let them take "blood donations" because they need to fertilize eggs - That's what French animal-rights activist Aymeric Caron advises people to do. China Daily writer Zhang Zhouxiang comments: It is admirable that the animal-rights activist has so much love and sympathy for mosquitoes as a species. We hope he extends a little to his own species, too, which is a victim of mosquitoes. According to statistics of US website Science Alert, mosquitoes cause the deaths of more than 750,000 humans every year. In comparison, sharks are responsible for six human fatalities a year, while wolves kill 10. Of course, it is not mosquitoes that are the actual killers, but the diseases such as the Zika virus, yellow fever and encephalitis B that they carry. During construction of the Panama Canal, so many workers were killed by yellow fever that the construction work had to be suspended for months, until doctors killed the majority of the mosquitoes. In the past, the list of mosquito-carried epidemics also included malaria, which took millions of human lives every year until quinine and artemisinin were discovered. Some people worry that if mosquitoes die out, the whole ecological chain might be affected. But that worry is far from necessary because mosquitoes are far from dying out. It is cold temperature and lack of water ponds that threaten their survival. Human self-defense claps kill very few of them. Mosquitoes have very strong survival ability, even if the number of individuals becomes very small, they can quickly breed and can easily re-form into big groups. It is temperature and water that affect their survival most. Unless all the standing water on the planet vanishes or becomes heavily polluted, or the Earth enters another glacial age, there is little possibility of mosquitoes dying out. If that day comes, mosquitoes will not be the only species that faces extinction. Human kind will have to worry about its own survival, instead of caring about a species that sucks its blood and claims lives. It is good to promote love for animals and protection of their rights, but totally unnecessary to deprive humans of the right to self-defense when being attacked by mosquitoes. Just kill them, for your own health and that of others. (China Daily 08/07/2019 page8)

                Panama Canal is 'innocent passage'
            </a>
            <p>
                Passageway will continue servicing Venezuelan ships despite US sanctionsFamously neutral Panama is resisting pressure from the United States to stop allowing Venezuelan vessels to traverse the Panama Canal, the key link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and one of the most important passageways for global trade.The US has been building fences around the Venezuelan government since the US administration moved on Aug 5 to impose sanctions on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, which the US opposes. The sanctions aim to cover Venezuelan ships moving through the Panama Canal.But those fences have some big holes and none bigger than the Panama Canal, an 82-kilometer passageway through which about 5 percent of global trade moves and which links Venezuela with Asia-Pacific markets.Panama has said it will continue servicing Venezuelan vessels despite the US sanctions, according to Panama Canal Authority chief Jorge Quijano. He said in a statement that Panama is signatory to a treaty of neutrality and that the canal is "an innocent passage".Asked about possible sanctions against Venezuelan vessels, Humberto Jiron, a Panamanian lawyer and former ambassador to the European Union and to the International Maritime Organization, said his country has no reason to accept the internal policies of the US government."There is a constitutional chapter that allows the administration of the Panama Canal to be absolutely independent," he said. "The canal works at the margin of politics, and that is the reason why it is so successful, and why it works so well, or even better than when it was managed by the Americans."The Panama Canal has remained neutral since its inauguration in 1914. Even during World War I and World War II, when the canal was administered by the US, its safe-passage status was sustained and no transits were prohibited.Politically neutralIn 1977, Panama and the US signed a treaty concerning the permanent neutrality and operation of the Panama Canal. Panama has continued to remain politically neutral during the years since the canal was handed over to the Latin American country.Daniel Di Martino, a Venezuelan economic analyst, said Panama under Laurentino Cortizo, who was sworn in as the country's president on July 1, is not likely to stop any ships from making their way through the canal. The Panamanian authorities know the US needs the canal, but they were willing to go ahead despite US threats of sanctions, Di Martino said.Panama's decision not to enforce US sanctions on vessels moving through the canal is doing little to reassure humanitarian organizations who fear the sanctions will push Venezuela deeper into economic crisis."The economic impact of these sanctions will be to reduce overall imports in a context in which millions of ordinary Venezuelan people are already highly vulnerable," said a joint statement signed by 16 NGOs from all over the Americas and shared by the Washington Office on Latin America. "The Trump administration's announcement is premised on the idea that imposing broad economic sanctions will force regime change in the short term."The US backs Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido and is betting that sanctions will put more pressure on Maduro's government.However, analysts like Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University' in New York and author of the book The Art of Sanctions: A View from the Field, do not agree that sanctions that destroying Venezuela's economy."The primary damage being done to Venezuela's economy stems from the poor policies of the government rather than sanctions," Nephew said."Sanctions are further undermining his (Maduro's) flexibility and options to address those policies, creating pressure."Nephew said he is not surprised that Panama's authorities have decided to allow goods to transit through the canal."The Panamanians believe they have legal obligations that require them to act this way," he said. "I do not see the US sanctioning the Panama Canal over it."The author is a freelancer for China Daily.
