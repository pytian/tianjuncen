                Mexico eyes Brazil for US asylum deal as Trump revives tariff threat
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                MEXICO CITY - Mexico and the United States may explore additional steps next month to restrict illegal immigration from Central America, with the threat of tariffs hanging over Mexico if it does not do enough to satisfy US demands, officials said on Monday.Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Brazil, Panama, and Guatemala may need to be brought in to help if a deal unveiled last week between Washington and Mexico fails to reduce the numbers of US-bound migrants crossing Mexico.The deal struck on Friday averted import tariffs on all Mexican goods, which US President Donald Trump had vowed to impose unless Mexico did more to curb migration.The Trump administration said on Monday it could still apply tariffs if it judged that Mexico had not done enough, with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo telling reporters it expected to see results within four to six weeks.The deal cut between the two nations last week means Mexico will expand a program under which migrants applying for asylum in the United States wait out the process in Mexico. Mexico also pledged to reinforce its southern border with Guatemala with 6,000 members of its National Guard militarized police.A major sticking point in last week's talks was a US demand that Mexico be declared a "safe third country" for asylum seekers, requiring them to seek refuge in Mexico if they passed through the country on the way to the United States.Mexico rejected that demand, though Ebrard revealed it would go back on the table if Mexico could not stem the flow of migrants heading to the US border."If we don't have results on what we're doing (in 45 days), we'll start conversations on what they want, which is that Mexico will be a safe third country," he told Mexican radio.Such a step would require the Mexican government to consult the Senate on how to proceed, Ebrard said.Trump said on Monday afternoon Mexico would soon announce an "undisclosed portion" of the deal that would have to be taken up by the Mexican Congress. He did not offer more details."They have to get approval, and they will get approval. If they don't get approval, we'll have to think in terms of tariffs or whatever," he told reporters at the White House.US stocks were higher on Monday after the deal, easing worries about the impact of another trade war on the global economy. The Mexican peso rose more than 2% against the dollar.BRAZIL, PANAMA, GUATEMALAEbrard said that if Mexico could not contain the migrant flows, other countries might also need to be involved.Asylum seekers from El Salvador and Honduras first pass through Guatemala when fleeing their homes, while Cubans and Haitians often fly first to Panama before heading to the United States through Mexico. Migrants from African countries regularly fly to Brazil before making the arduous journey north."If the measures we are proposing are not successful, we have to discuss with the United States and with other countries, like Guatemala, Panama and Brazil," Ebrard said. "If we have to participate in a regional model like the one I have just described, we would have to present that to Congress."While he did not go into detail, Ebrard suggested that asylum seekers might have to seek refuge in the first country they reached after leaving their homeland.The governments of Brazil, Panama and Guatemala did not immediately reply to requests for comment.US border officers apprehended more than 132,000 people crossing from Mexico in May, the highest monthly level since 2006. Trump, who has called the surge in migrants an "invasion," had threatened to keep raising duties up to 25% unless Mexico did more to curb it.Mexico had no specific target for the reduction of migrant numbers, Ebrard said. Still, Martha Barcena, Mexico's ambassador to Washington, told CBS News at the weekend there had been discussion of reducing the numbers to levels of around 2018.Ebrard also said there was no agreement between the United States and Mexico to purchase more agricultural products under the accord, despite Trump saying over the weekend that Mexico had agreed to buy "large quantities" from US farmers.Ebrard said he thought Trump might be making a calculation based on Mexican agricultural imports when freed from the threat of tariffs.Reuters

                    UN advisory group calls for addressing root causes of instability in Haiti
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                UNITED NATIONS - Head of a UN advisory group on Haiti said Thursday that the world body must address the root causes of political instability and worsening security situation.Marc-Andre Blanchard, chair of the UN Economic and Social Council's Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti, said the group is concerned about the deteriorating political, economic and social situation in Haiti after a trip to the country in late May."And everyone we met (in Haiti) agreed on one point: exclusion and economic inequalities are the root causes of the political instability and deteriorating security situation."Blanchard, who is the Canadian ambassador to the United Nations, saw a direct link between violence and the fact that there is no perception of an economic future for many people. The hopelessness is driving people into criminality, he said.And there is a deep institutional and governance and rule of law crisis that is born out of a worsening economic situation, a gridlocked political process, and a pervasive feeling of social exclusion and disenfranchisement, he said in an informal briefing to the Economic and Social Council.Blanchard said the United Nations, which is in transition to a non-peacekeeping presence in Haiti, should look at the root causes of the problems in the country.The mandate of the UN Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH) expires on Oct 15 and the Security Council is considering replacing it with a special political mission (SPM)."It seems obvious to us in the mission (trip) that there was one angle that was missing out of MINUJUSTH. The mistake that we don't want the UN to make one more time is that, while you focus on some aspects for security reasons, you forget what are the real root causes of all of this. We want to make sure that we don't address only some of the symptoms. But we address the root causes of the issues in Haiti," said Blanchard.Although there should be a strong rule of law component in it, the SPM really needs to have the tools necessary to deal with the deep inequalities, social exclusion and the economic hardships.The SPM should be equipped with robust expertise and skills that will enable it to foster inclusive and transformative economic development, focusing on job creation for young people in particular, and women; tax and duty collection by the authorities; tackling the scourge of corruption; and building sustainable infrastructure, said Blanchard.He also asked for tools and resources for the SPM to tackle gang violence through a weapon and ammunition rendition program, constructive youth engagement, and training for the national police.He noted that gang violence in Haiti is not pushed by the drug lords. There are indications that it was fueled by some political parties and some parts of the business community. "So you are dealing with a completely different (situation)."In addition, the SPM needs to be able to support a much-needed and much-awaited inclusive national dialogue. As the Haitian government lacks capacity, the SPM can fill up this gap, said Blanchard.The Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti was created in 1999. The role of the group is to make recommendations on how to ensure that international assistance to Haiti is adequate, coherent, well-coordinated and effective.

                    Trump says immigration raids coming 'fairly soon'
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                US President Donald Trump said on Friday mass deportation roundups would begin "fairly soon" as US migrant advocates vowed their communities would be "ready" when immigration officers come.Trump, who has made a hardline immigration stance a key issue of his presidency and 2020 re-election bid, postponed the operation last month after the date was leaked, but on Monday he said it would take place after July 4."They'll be starting fairly soon, but I don't call them raids, we're removing people, all of these people who have come in over the years illegally," he told reporters at the White House on Friday.US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last month said operations would target recently-arrived undocumented migrants in a bid to discourage a surge of Central American families at the southwest border.ICE said in a statement its focus was arresting people with criminal histories but any immigrant found in violation of US laws was subject to arrest.Government documents published this week by migrant rights groups showed some past ICE operations resulted in more so-called "collateral" arrests of undocumented migrants agents happened to find, than apprehensions of targeted people.Migrant rights groups said this generalized threat is harmful to communities, and the US economy, as it forces adults to miss work and children to skip school out of fear they may be picked up and separated."We have to be ready, not just when Trump announces it, because there are arrests every day," said Elsa Lopez, an organizer for Somos Un Pueblo Unido, a New Mexico group which educates migrants on their civil rights and creates phone networks to send alerts if ICE enters their neighborhood.The threatened raids come after migrant apprehensions on the southwest border hit a 13-year high in May before easing in June as Mexico increased immigration enforcement.A rising number of migrants are coming from outside Central America, including India, Cuba and African countries. The Del Rio, Texas, Border Patrol sector on Friday reported the arrest of over 1,000 Haitians since June 10.Democratic lawmakers visited an El Paso, Texas, Border Patrol station on Monday and said migrants were being held in "horrifying" conditions, with women told to drink out of a toilet.To "dispel" what he called "the misinformation," Chief Border Patrol Agent Roy Villareal put out a video showing fresh water available from a cooler and a faucet in a cell at a Tucson, Arizona, sector migrant processing center."We're not forcing aliens to drink out of the toilet," said Villareal, head of an area that in May apprehended nearly six times fewer people than the El Paso sector, a stretch of border that has borne the brunt of the migrant surge.Reuters

            <p class="style-content">
                 PORT-AU-PRINCE - Haitian President Jovenel Moise on Monday named Fritz William Michel as the new prime minister, after Jean Michel Lapin announced his resignation earlier in the day."Following the resignation of Mr. Lapin, I chose, in consultation with the leaders of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, citizen Fritz William Michel as PM," Moise tweeted on Monday.Michel's nomination must be approved by legislators."I have made a choice for Haiti," Lapin said in an interview with the newspaper Le Nouvelliste.Lapin's tenure as prime minister was brief. He assumed office after his predecessor Jean Henry Ceant was ousted in March.Michel, a former executive in the Ministry of Economy and Finance, is Moise's fourth head of government in his two and a half years in office.Michel faces the tough task of restoring public confidence in the government.At a United Nations (UN) Security Council meeting on Haiti in April, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said with about 59 percent of the population estimated to live below the poverty line, Haiti remains the poorest country in the Americas.

                    'Hour of darkness' for Bahamas; 43 dead, with toll to rise
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                ABACO, Bahamas — The hurricane death toll is rising in the Bahamas, in what its leader calls "this hour of darkness."Search and rescue teams were still trying to reach some Bahamian communities isolated by floodwaters and debris Saturday after Hurricane Dorian struck the northern part of the archipelago last Sunday. At least 43 people died.Several hundred people, many of them Haitian immigrants, waited at Abaco island's Marsh Harbour in hopes of leaving the disaster zone on vessels arriving with aid. Bahamian security forces were organizing evacuations on a landing craft. Other boats, including yachts and other private craft, were also helping to evacuate people.Avery Parotti, a 19-year-old bartender, and partner Stephen Chidles, a 26-year-old gas station attendant had been waiting at the port since 1 a.m. During the hurricane, waves lifted a yacht that smashed against a cement wall, which in turn collapsed on their home and destroyed it."There's nothing left here. There are no jobs," said Parotti, who hopes to start a new life in the United States, where she has relatives.Dorval Darlier, a Haitian diplomat who had come from the Bahamian capital of Nassau, shouted in Creole, telling the crowd that sick people along with women and children should be evacuated before men.Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said late Friday that 35 people were known dead on Abaco and eight on Grand Bahama island."We acknowledge that there are many missing and that the number of deaths is expected to significantly increase," he said. "This is one of the stark realities we are facing in this hour of darkness."On Saturday, US President Donald Trump tweeted that Minnis had told him that there would have been "many more casualties" without US help. Trump credited the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the US Coast Guard and the "brave people of the Bahamas."The US Coast Guard has evacuated some people from devastated areas by helicopter. The United Nations, the British Royal Navy, American Airlines and Royal Caribbean and other organizations have mobilized to send in food, water, generators, roof tarps, diapers, flashlights and other supplies.Marvin Dames, security minister in the Bahamas, said authorities were striving to reach everyone, but the crews can't just bulldoze their way through fallen trees and other rubble because there might be bodies not yet recovered."We have been through this before, but not at this level of devastation," Dames said.Dames said the runway at the airport on Grand Bahama island had been cleared and was ready for flights. Authorities also said that all ports had been reopened on that island and Abaco, both of which were devastated by the Category 5 storm.On Grand Bahama, a long line formed at a cruise ship that had docked to distribute food and water. Among those waiting was Wellisy Taylor, a housewife."What we have to do as Bahamians, we have to band together. If your brother needs sugar, you're going to have to give him sugar. If you need cream, they'll have to give you cream," she said. "That's how I grew up. That's the Bahamas that I know."AP
