                Tourism, education, and healthcare will also benefit from new measures, officials say Beijing has recently released an action plan to expand reform and opening-up in the city's service industry for more foreign investment and international cooperation, according to the city's commerce bureau. The capital city will focus on expanding opening-up in major fields including science and technology, finance, education, cultural tourism and healthcare, according to the plan. "Beijing is the first and only pilot city to expand opening-up in the service industry nationwide," said Yan Ligang, head of the Beijing Commerce Bureau. It has attracted high-end international resources, which helped create an open environment and lay a solid foundation for the city to carry out a range of reforms, Yan said. The three-year action plan consists of eight major fields with 190 measures, instructing eight relevant departments to conduct pilot measurement. These departments include the Beijing Science and Technology Commission, the Beijing Bureau of Economy and Information Technology, the Beijing Local Financial Supervision and Administration, the Beijing Education Commission, the Beijing Culture and Tourism Bureau and the Beijing Commission of Development and Reform. In the next three years, the city will seek breakthroughs in policy reform and industrial innovation, which includes reforming institutional business registrations, optimization of the funding environment for companies and the rolling out of preferential policies. The action plan also features the launch of major projects and Beijing will promote the construction of international communities and establish a sound environment for the service industry following international standards, Yan said. In addition, the city will set up a one-stop service center for foreign professionals and establish an online platform for a national scientific research innovation center. Wang Jianxin, an official of the Beijing Science and Technology Commission, said the commission would engage in introducing overseas technological talents, offering customs conveniences for technology companies, supporting companies in building an automotive test and development center and rolling out regulations to promote the commercialization of science and technology. "We will cooperate with related departments to mobilize high-end scientific research resources and strengthen international exchanges to contribute more to the construction of an innovation center with a global influence in Beijing," Wang said. From January to June, 755 foreign-invested companies involved in the service sector opened for business in Beijing, and the amount of foreign capital utilized was $8.59 billion. The added value of the service industry accounted for 82.8 percent of the city's GDP during the period. Li Yan, deputy head of the Beijing Local Financial Supervision and Administration, said Beijing has an edge in expanding opening-up in the financial sector with many financial institutions, large markets and outstanding innovation capabilities. The city plans to ease market access of various financial institutions and conduct measures such as expanding pilot projects for cross-border investment and financing and launching international exchanges and cooperation in green finance and financial technologies. "We will take stronger financial measures to serve the demands of financial institutions in the next three years," Li said. Beijing will expand the supply of international education services, cultivate educational pilot projects and expand its educational scale by 2021. Beijing should further optimize the layout and structure of international education, said Huang Kan, deputy director of the Beijing Education Commission. By 2021, the city is set to build 11 new international schools in Chaoyang district, Haidian district and other talent concentration areas. It is expected to build 50 new schools qualified to accept foreign students, and there will 330 schools eligible to receive international students in 16 districts in the city. It will also support 40 local schools to establish national talent cultivation bases under the Belt and Road Initiative. liangkaiyan@chinadaily.com.cn   An intelligent robot developed by foreign high-tech enterprises is displayed at the 2019 World Robot Conference in Yizhuang economic development zone in Daxing district, Beijing.Provided To China Daily(China Daily 09/19/2019 page10)

                Canada's Trudeau apologizes for dressing up in brown face, election chances could suffer
            </a>
            <p>
                OTTAWA - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized on Wednesday for wearing brown face make-up in 2001 after an embarrassing picture emerged less than five weeks before an election in which he faces a tough fight.The image of a 29-year-old Trudeau with his face in dark make-up is a major challenge for a leader who often speaks about the need to fight racial discrimination and who has three prominent ministers of Indian descent in his cabinet."I should have known better then, but I didn't and I did it and I'm deeply sorry," Trudeau, 47, told reporters on his campaign plane in Halifax, Nova Scotia, after Time magazine published the image.Time said the image was provided by Vancouver businessman Michael Adamson earlier this month. Adamson was part of the West Point Grey Academy community where Trudeau, then 29, worked at the time, the magazine said. The picture was in the Vancouver private school's yearbook."I dressed up in an Aladdin costume and put make-up on. I shouldn't have done it," Trudeau said in comments carried live on Canadian television.The picture shows him wearing a turban and a white robe, with his face covered in dark makeup.Trudeau, questioned by reporters, also admitted he had dressed up in make-up when at high school and performed "Day O", a traditional Jamaican song about people loading bananas onto boats.Trudeau is locked in a tight battle with Conservative leader Andrew Scheer ahead of the Oct 21 federal election.Scheer said he was "extremely shocked and disappointed" by the photo."Wearing brown face is an act of open mockery and racism. What Canadians saw this evening is someone with a complete lack of judgment and integrity and someone who's not fit to govern this country," he told reporters in Quebec.Trudeau has seen his once sky-high popularity hurt by a series of missteps, including a ruling last month by a top watchdog that he had breached ethics rules by pressuring the former justice minister to ensure a major construction firm avoid a corruption trial. Reuters

                Firm eyes overseas demand for better Chinese education
            </a>
            <p>
                Zhuge Academy, one of the major Chinese education brands owned by Lanxum Inc, will quicken its overseas expansion to meet the rapidly growing demand for better Chinese education."We will consider entering the Asian and Middle Eastern markets after opening campuses in Canada and the US," said Shang Mei, head of international business for Zhuge Academy.The academy just opened a campus in Silicon Valley on Sept 8 (US time), its second one overseas after establishing the first in Canada in 2018. "Our quick overseas expansion is in line with the fast-growing demand for quality Chinese education overseas," Shang added.US demographic data as of 2018 shows that California is now home to a Chinese population of more than 1.8 million, of which 200,000 live in the San Francisco Bay Area.Many Chinese parents want to see their children gain proficiency in Chinese language and become acquainted with the great works of Chinese literature.Lanxum was the first Chinese learning organization to teach literary history to adolescents. And Zhuge Academy is Lanxum's overseas platform for its proprietary Mega Chinese study program. The approach for Mega Chinese is based on reforms in China's educational system, which has taken a much more holistic approach to how Chinese is taught in the country's schools."We are contacting partners in Singapore and Australia for possible cooperation but there are no specific details to disclose so far," said Zhu.The brand will provide professional and engaging Chinese education products to school-age children. In June 2018, the company announced a plan to set up an overseas subsidiary, Lanxum (USA) Limited, with operating capital of $10 million. Lanxum plans to focus on building its education portfolio around the Mega Chinese model, while continuing its exploration and development of additional markets throughout the world.Wang Jiaqi contributed to this story.
