                Indonesia finds design flaw, oversight lapses in 737 MAX crash - WSJ
            </p>
            <p>
                Indonesian investigators have found that design and oversight lapses played a key role in the October 2018 crash of Boeing Co's 737 MAX jet that killed all 189 people aboard, the Wall Street Journal said on Sunday.The draft conclusions, expected to be the first formal government finding of flaws in the design and US regulatory approval, also identify a string of pilot errors and maintenance mistakes as causal factors of the Lion Air crash, the WSJ said.The Boeing 737 MAX has been grounded since March in the aftermath of two fatal crashes in five months.A Boeing spokesman did not comment on the newspaper report but said the plane maker continued to offer support to the investigating authorities as they complete their report.Soerjanto Tjahjono, the head of Indonesia's transport safety committee, told Reuters he could not comment before the release of the final report, which is expected by early November.He said several stakeholders, but not all, had already provided feedback on a draft of the final report that has not been released publicly.The draft was circulated to parties including Boeing, Lion Air and the US Federal Aviation Administration on Aug 24."There are stakeholders that have sent their answers to us and we are evaluating them," Tjahjono said.US air crash investigators are readying to announce a handful of separate safety recommendations, from bolstering pilots' manual flying skills to boosting FAA vetting of new aircraft designs, the WSJ added.Around month-end, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is expected to call for improvements to cockpit training and crew decision-making and focus on potential changes to certification of new airliners, the newspaper said.The NTSB declined to comment on the WSJ report but said it planned to release recommendations on the FAA's certification program sometime in September.The FAA welcomed the scrutiny from safety experts and looked forward to their findings, it said in a statement."We continue to work with other international aviation safety regulators and will carefully consider all recommendations," it added. "The FAA will incorporate any changes that would improve our certification activities." Reuters

                TV documentary on music brings old classics to life
            </a>
            <p>
                When renowned songwriter Qiao Yu was taking a train departing from Shanghai to Changchun in Jilin province, he saw through the window of Yangtze River, a symbol of Chinese civilization.The scenery aroused his patriotism and spawned the song My Motherland, which was composed by Liu Chi and sung by soprano Guo Lanying. Released as the theme song of 1956 war movie Shang Gan Ling, the song became a classic that has been etched into collective memory ofl generations.Now more than 60 years later, the story is unveiled in The Melody of Time, a music documentary series which has run its second season on Hunan Satellite TV and Hunan Economic TV since Sept 16.In the 16-episode documentary, My Motherland alongside other 15 classic songs are featured , sung by 16 young singers, mostly born in 1980s or 1990s.The young musicians also visited some famous figures who shot to fame for or were influenced by the 16 songs, including Li Guyi, Yan Weiwen and Cai Guoqing, all popular singers in their eras.In the episode of My Motherland, singer Zhou Shen visited late composer Liu Chi's Liu Xinxin, who recalls that his father "locked" himself at home for several days to focus on composition as he was so excited to read the lyrics written by Qiao Yu.Recently in Beijing, the National Library of China announced that it had collected the video footage and a book of The Melody of Time for its historic value.

                AI strikes note of confidence in arts
            </a>
            <p>
                Music, painting, singing ... firms make robots that can master higher pursuitsChen Xi, 25, an IT professional in Shanghai, could never picture himself writing or composing an entire song. But now, with the help of artificial intelligence, everyone, including Chen, can be a musician.An AI-enabled robot, developed by Ping An Technology, the tech arm of insurer Ping An Insurance Group, helps users to compose. With simple humming, AI can write a complete song in seconds."We integrate AI into different modules in the music field such as lyric, song and education. Through data accumulation and model training, algorithmic models in each module are developed. Furthermore, we have developed an interactive musical app suitable for both professionals and non-professionals," said Xiao Jing, chief scientist at Ping An Insurance.For Magical Brush An, the poem-writing robot developed by Ping An Technology, creating poems is a piece of cake. Given a few keywords or a picture, the robot pens original poems, with either modern or ancient themes, in a few seconds."With Magical Brush An, I never need to worry about writing poems for my girlfriend. The poem I got from the robot is creative and artistic. It is a lot of fun," said Li Nan, a male attendee at the recently concluded 2019 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai.There is more than fun on offer. Ping An's intelligent writing robot is now widely applied in the automobile industry. Based on the UVN-B(user, value, need, behavior) user segmentation model, the robot now produces over 20,000 articles every day, targeting different consumption groups."AI technology has a broad application prospect in art creation, communication and consumption," said Xiao.He noted that through the research and analysis on artistic works created by human beings, AI figures out the inherent laws. With the perception of the surrounding environment, AI can imitate, integrate, or even create art.Specifically, according to Xiao, the model algorithms for sound, image and text processing in AI technology, as well as structural analysis modeling of art works, induction and learning of expert experience, can all be deeply applied to the analysis and creation of works of art.AI is already making money in the field of arts. Last year, an AI-generated portrait painting, called Edmond Belamy, was auctioned at Christie's for $432,500. It is said to be the first piece of AI art to be sold at an auction.This marked AI-based art's entry into the world of auctions, Christie's said in a news release.However, there are doubts whether AI robots will eventually replace artists."In the process of art creation, the relationship between AI technology and human artists must not be opposite. It is rather an assistive, or interactive relationship. AI technology saves artists time and energy so that they can concentrate on art creation, emotion expression and efficient trial and error iteration. It can even 'talk to' or interact with artists," Xiao noted.Agreed Jared Donovan, senior lecturer in interaction design at the School of Design of the Creative Industries Faculty of the Queensland University of Technology. "Artists have done a lot of things using AI robots. For sure, these robots will have more room for development in the future. They may have major influence on how artists work."In the fields of art communication and consumption, AI technology also plays an important role. For those with demands of artistic creation and expression but limited by artistic culture, AI helps them in creating high-quality works of art, Xiao said.Chen Jiong, associate professor at the School of Art of the Renmin University of China, said: "Although currently art is an enviable occupation, and represents educational background, cultural knowledge, attitude toward life or even wealth, with the development of AI technology, these tags will no longer be shiny. Everyone can be called an 'artist'."Promising as the prospect of application of AI in arts is, challenges abound."One thing is that the assessment standard in the field is not established yet, making it difficult to evaluate a piece of art. The other thing is about emotional expression. AI technology needs more data accumulation and deep learning, to strengthen the story and emotional feelings in works of art, creating an art full of warmth," said Xiao from Ping An Insurance.

                MNCs set to expand presence in Chinese market
            </a>
            <p>
                XIAMEN - Advancing with a more localized development strategy, foreign firms are expanding investment in the Chinese market on a strong belief in the country's future.Over 100 senior leaders from US companies, acting as a delegation of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) South China, have demonstrated their interest in creating a greater presence in China. They attended the China International Fair for Investment and Trade in the coastal city of Xiamen, East China's Fujian province, for the 17th consecutive year."We are here at CIFIT to make sure that we have the avenues and ways of doing business with our friends in China," said Harley Seyedin, president of AmCham South China.A report released earlier this year by the chamber showed that multinational corporations, or MNCs, have not withdrawn from the Chinese market on a large scale and they maintain a strong interest in investing in China. The report attributed this to the market's growth potential and its relatively high returns on investment.As Seyedin noted, China has a market with lots of opportunities and room for cooperation.Investing over $1 billion in China in the past 30 years, US-based global food processor Osi Group plans to keep improving its investment level and adapt the development strategy to the opportunities in China."China has been continuously launching new measures on industries upgrading, providing powerful support for the multinationals developing in China," said Cai Hua, government affairs director of OSI Group's China office.Louis Dreyfus Company, a French firm of agricultural goods, has positioned China as an investment focus in the future with an improved localization strategy."We are cooperating with Meituan, an online food delivery-to-ticketing services platform, and have invested in Chinese startup Luckin Coffee, which reflects our progress on cooperating with local companies to serve consumers together," said Jiao Yan, vice-president at Louis Dreyfus Company China.China's opening-up policy also provides more opportunities for foreign firms to connect with the world."Today we have more than 2,000 employees in R&D in China, delivering innovative products all over the world," said Chen Silin, vice-president of Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) China.As the world's top automation technology provider, ABB has advanced from investing in China to taking root in China while serving globally, Chen noted, adding that ABB had more than 280 projects related to the Belt and Road Initiative in the past year, benefiting the company a lot.According to Seyedin, besides a US-led multinational joint venture that involves 150 million yuan ($21 million) of investment, more projects will be announced during this year's CIFIT."I personally feel we have every confidence in investing in China," he said.

                NEV sales slide but market remains charged to develop
            </a>
            <p>
                Orders for first eight months of 2019 still up on previous yearSales of new energy vehicles experienced an even greater fall in August, after recording reduced sales in July, the first sales drop for NEVs in more than two years. However, industry insiders remain confident of the upward trajectory in the NEV market.China sold 85,000 NEVs last month, a drop of 15.8 percent from the previous year. While in July, the sales volume was 80,000, a decrease of 4.7 percent year-on-year.In August, 69,000 NEVs sold were fully electric vehicles, a decrease of 6 percent on the previous year, and 16,000 were plug-in hybrids, dropping 41.3 percent year-on-year.However, the overall sales volume of China's NEV market in the first eight months of 2019 has still grown.Statistics show that 793,000 NEVs were sold from January to August in 2019, an increase of 32 percent from the same period last year. Of which, 629,000 electric vehicles were sold in the first eight months of this year, up 40.8 percent on the same period in 2018."The sales fall in the Chinese new energy market in July and August is mostly due to the scaling down of government subsidies, which will not alter the course of the whole industry," said John Zeng, managing director of LMC Automotive Shanghai.From the perspective of not only environmental protection, but also industrial development, developing new energy vehicles is agreed by the industry to be the future of mobility, he added.
