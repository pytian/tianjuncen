                Expo marks Queen Victoria's 200th birthday
            </p>
            <p>
                To mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Queen Victoria, a special exhibition has opened at Buckingham Palace, telling the story of how the young monarch turned an unloved royal residence into the center of social, cultural and official life of the country.The exhibition, Queen Victoria's Palace, which runs through Sept 29, offers visitors an immersive experience in how Victoria made Buckingham Palace what it remains today－the headquarters of the monarchy, a rallying point for national celebrations and a family home.Amanda Foreman, historian and curator of the exhibition, said: "Queen Victoria saved Buckingham Palace and transformed it. By transforming this building, she made it bigger, more welcoming, and much more inclusive for the community, for the country."She transformed the monarchy, and the monarchy that we know today is her creation," Foreman said. "It's much more open, there's a real relationship with the public, there's an expectation that the monarchy exists for public service to serve the country."Queen Victoria ascended the throne at the age of 18 on June 20, 1837. Just three weeks into her reign, she moved into Buckingham Palace, despite the building being incomplete and many of the rooms undecorated and unfurnished.The palace had been empty for seven years following the death of Victoria's uncle, George IV, who had commissioned at great expense the conversion of Buckingham House into a palace by architect John Nash. The King never occupied the Palace, and his successor, William IV, preferred to live at Clarence House, a British royal residence in Westminster, London, during his short reign.The Queen's ministers advised her to stay at Kensington Palace, her childhood home, until Buckingham Palace could be brought up to a suitable standard, but Victoria wanted to move immediately and begin her new life.Foreman explained the reason Victoria was so eager to move into the royal residence, because she'd been very unhappy as a child living in Kensington Palace which had bad memories for her."She needed to move into the residence of the Queen and this was going to be it, and being young she didn't want to wait, and it was all very exciting for her," Foreman added.Victoria married her first cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, a duchy, on Feb 10, 1840. Over the next 17 years, they had nine children, eight of whom were born at Buckingham Palace.During her reign as a monarch, Foreman said Queen Victoria achieved much, particularly as a woman. "I can only compare her in some ways to Empress Wu Zetian, in the sense that Empress Wu had to create a new language of power, because the language of power that was available to her was male."Queen Victoria had the same problem－that power had a male face and male characteristics, so when Queen Victoria decided to change Buckingham Palace, she wanted to make it into a family home, which is a female characteristic," Foreman added.Wu Zetian (625-705) was China's only female emperor who lived during the Tang dynasty (618-907).The balcony of Buckingham Palace is arguably one of the best known in the world, and it was Queen Victoria who first used it as a stage to mark historic royal occasions, setting a trend that is still followed today.The ballroom, the centerpiece of the exhibition, utilizes a combination of old and new visual technologies, such as the Pepper's Ghost holographic effect. Pepper's ghost, named after scientist John Henry Pepper, who popularized the effect in a demonstration in 1862, is an illusion technique used in amusement parks, museums, television, and concerts.During their time together at Buckingham Palace, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert held three magnificent costume balls. Queen Victoria's costume for the Stuart Ball is another of the highlights at the exhibition.The Queen wrote a detailed account of the occasion in her journal and commented: "I was so proud and pleased to see my beloved Albert looking so handsome, truly royal and distinguished, and so much admired. I must say our costumes were beautifully made."

                Over 460,000 suspected cholera cases in Yemen this year, 705 dead: UN
            </a>
            <p>
                UNITED NATIONS - A UN spokesman said on Monday there have been more than 460,000 suspected cases of cholera in Yemen so far this year, compared to 380,000 cases for all of last year.Farhan Haq, deputy spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said that out of the suspected cases there already have been 705 deaths this year, compared to 75 in the same period last year.Moreover, approximately 200,000 children are suspected of contracting the disease in 2019, according to Haq.Recent flash flooding accelerated the spread of cholera across the country, which has also been exacerbated by poor maintenance of waste management systems and lack of access to clean water for drinking or irrigation, he said.The United Nations and its partners are running nearly 1,200 cholera treatment facilities around Yemen, he said, adding funding for the facilities is urgently needed."The Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan requires 4.2 billion dollars to deliver humanitarian assistance to more than 20 million people this year," the spokesman said. "As of today, only 32 percent of those requirements have been met."Yemen is suffering a long-running civil war between its government and the Houthi rebels, which humanitarians said has brought the country to the brink of famine.

                Subway system stretches into the future
            </a>
            <p>
                Three decades ago Shanghai had no metro network, but today it boasts the world's longest subway systems, which stretches more than 705 kilometers with 415 stations.Along the way it has had to overcome construction and engineering problems associated with soft soil conditions and land subsidence."With high construction standards and pioneering methods, the metro development in the municipality over the past 26 years has gone through a process that took almost a century in some developed countries," said Feng Hao, an information officer with Shanghai Shentong Metro Group.He said the scale and speed of the construction were acclaimed as "a world-level miracle" by the Community of Metros, an international organization of metro builders and operators.The development of the metro system is indicative of the advances Shanghai has made in its entire transportation system. City authorities began to think about a subway system in the 1950s, but some foreign experts said soil testing showed the underground water level was too high and the soil texture too soft. They said excavating underground tunnels for a rail system would be like "digging holes in tofu".But engineers and builders developed core techniques to deal with the soft soil and introduced construction standards replicated in many other parts of China.The metro system today boasts a number of firsts for the country. The metro line spans two provincial-level regions, provides voice navigation for the blind and stays open longer than any other system, including 20 hours on weekends and holidays.More than 10 million passengers travel on the Shanghai metro an average weekday, accounting for two-thirds of the capacity of the city's public transportation, official statistics show.Wu Jizhen, 70, was born and raised in Qingpu district on the municipality's western outskirts and has witnessed the changes in Shanghai's public transportation system.She clearly remembers the days before the subway was built when it would take six hours traveling on four bus routes to visit a relative in Baoshan district in the north.She doesn't have to walk far from a bus station to a metro station. "The interval for bus and metro schedules has been significantly improved as well," she said. "In the 1980s, there were only four buses a day on a route that I relied on. I had to wait for at least one and a half hours if I missed one."Since 2017, six metro routes that connect the city's two airports and run through commercial districts have extended operating hours until after midnight on weekends and major holidays.Zhi Yuan contributed to this story.

                Researcher recognized for improving subway service
            </a>
            <p>
                Six seconds might not seem like much time to most people, but it makes a huge difference to commuters using Shanghai's metro system, one of the longest in the world.That small amount of time can allow the metro to add another train to the service every hour, each with the capacity to carry 3,000 passengers.As assistant director of the technical research center of Shanghai Shentong Metro, Wang Xiaoxiao spends most of his time trying to work out how to improve train speeds, passenger flow and customer satisfaction. His team relies on subway-control technology and model simulations of the urban rail transit system"According to our experience, every six-second optimization allows one more subway train to run per hour, which greatly alleviates the degree of crowding in subway cars during rush hour," Wang said."Every second of the passengers' time is worth our team fighting for."After graduating from Shanghai Dianji University as a computer science major in 2012, Wang joined Shentong. In 2010, the metro company had started to look at ways to improve its subway-control technology and simulation system.Launched in 1993, Shanghai's metro system has rapidly expanded to include 16 lines, which cover most of the city and have a total length of 705 kilometers. It has become one of the world's busiest metro systems with nearly 10 million passengers a day on average.

                News jobs emerge as service sector grows
            </a>
            <p>
                Novel professions offer high pay with lower entry qualifications, report says Novel professions including pet photographer and stylist of hanfu - Han Chinese clothing - have emerged in China's booming services industry. Figures from the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security show the services industry has been growing rapidly over the past five years, with the sector accounting for 46 percent of total employment last year, up from 40.6 percent in 2014. Zhaopin, an online recruitment platform in Beijing, and Meituan Dianping, an online e-commerce platform that also conducts industry research, said in a report released recently that the new professions spawned by the burgeoning sector hint at the breadth of the nation's economic transformation and have helped ease employment pressure. Examples of other new jobs include food delivery consultant and online business instructor. The report said the new professions are the result of the digital revolution, which has created new lifestyles and upgraded the industry. The high incomes and lower entry qualifications of the new professions were highlighted in the report. A survey of 9,800 people found that about 55 percent of those working in new professions earned more than 5,000 yuan ($705) a month, with 24.6 percent saying their monthly salary was over 10,000 yuan. The qualifications required for the new professions are much lower than for some traditional positions, such as teachers and financial analysts. The report said about 70 percent of the employees surveyed were vocational college graduates, with only 30 percent having bachelor's or higher degrees. The easier access to the job market offers people with fewer skills or less education more opportunities and stable incomes. People born since 1980 accounted for more than 90 percent of those working in the new professions, the report said. Li Qiang, Zhaopin's vice-president, said the new professions offered more flexible schedules than traditional work, which was attractive to young people. "Also, enthusiasm and passion for new jobs and the appeal of human contact are big reasons people are driven to join these new professions," he said. Han Shuang, a 27-year-old from Beijing, found work as a hanfu stylist after resigning from a financial company earlier this year. "I believe it has a promising future," she said. "Hanfu, traditional Han Chinese clothing, was not that familiar to modern society years ago, and it used to be embarrassing to wear hanfu on public occasions because people would be scornful. "But things have changed since last year, when wearing hanfu was recognized as a new fashion." She said customers can receive one-stop service at her hanfu experience store at Nanluoguxiang, a tourist street in Beijing, from makeup and hair styling to dressing up. "We offer free rooms for them to take photos in the shop and also provide paid photography services if the customer wishes to take pictures," Han said. She said she was under a great deal of pressure when she decided to become a hanfu stylist. "Most of the people I turned to for financial support for my hanfu experience shop rejected me at the very beginning because they didn't recognize that styling people with traditional Chinese clothing will make money," Han said. "It's a real challenge working in a brand-new profession, but it's also interesting and meaningful as I'm doing a job that no one has done before." Some people held stereotypical impressions or prejudices against such new professions, believing those working in them had been unable to find work in more traditional areas, and that undermined employees' passion for the work and hampered the development of the professions, Zhaopin's Li said. The report said over 60 percent of workers who have spent up to three years in the new professions say their jobs frequently befuddle or trouble them. "Positive promotion of new professions is important to let people know more about the jobs," Li said. "We hope the government can offer some preferential policies to improve the working environment. Vocational education and training courses for new professions are also a pressing need." chengsi@chinadaily.com.cn  Li Huiting, a 20-year-old infant nurse, interacts with a child at a maternity hotel in Chenzhou, Hunan province, in April last year. Infant nursing is one of many new service industry jobs that have been created in the burgeoning sector.He Maofeng / For China Daily(China Daily Global 09/18/2019 page4)
