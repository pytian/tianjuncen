                Range of policies to reduce financing costs A combination of monetary, fiscal and regulatory policies will be implemented to reduce financing costs in the real economy and ensure the aggregate financing cost of loans for small and micro-sized enterprises is reduced by 1 percent. They are among measures China will take to reduce real interest rates and ease the financing difficulties faced by businesses, according to a statement released after a State Council executive meeting on Friday. Efforts made this year have kept real interest rates stable, with a slight decline, the statement said, noting that reform measures should be taken to keep liquidity reasonably sufficient and lower real interest rates. It said efforts will be made to reform and improve the loan prime-rate mechanism. An LPR for above five years will be made available in addition to the current one-year LPR to serve as a pricing reference for new bank lending and act as a catalyst for further reductions in real interest rates. The meeting decided that interest rates and borrowing costs should be more open and transparent. It said charges levied by financial institutions should be strictly regulated and the fees charged by intermediate agencies reduced. Credit support for creditworthy enterprises that have received orders and have a market should be strengthened to ensure their loans will not be reduced or cut in an unreasonable way, the statement said. The meeting also required efforts to solve the financing difficulties facing small and micro-sized enterprises. To that end, evaluation and supervision will be strengthened to guide banks in innovating business models and improving business procedures, to better serve the real economy, the statement said. Team to resolve migrant worker pay delays The State Council has decided to establish a leading team to work on resolving delayed wage payments for migrant workers, according to a notice released by the General Office of the State Council on Thursday. The notice, issued to governments and departments at all levels, said the move was an effort to strengthen leadership and overall coordination of work to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the vast numbers of migrant workers. As a deliberation and coordination agency of the State Council, the team will be responsible for major decisionmaking and policy implementation regarding work related to resolving delayed wage payments for migrant workers. It will also play a role in work coordination, policy research and supervision of the implementation of laws, regulations and policies regarding the payment of wages to migrant workers. Led by Vice-Premier Hu Chunhua, the team will be composed of six deputy directors and members from State Council departments and bureaus. The office of the team will be located at the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, which will be responsible for the team's routine work. The working meetings of the team will be convened from time to time, according to need. (China Daily Global 09/23/2019 page5)

                    AI strikes note of confidence in arts
                </p>

                Music, painting, singing ... firms make robots that can master higher pursuitsChen Xi, 25, an IT professional in Shanghai, could never picture himself writing or composing an entire song. But now, with the help of artificial intelligence, everyone, including Chen, can be a musician.An AI-enabled robot, developed by Ping An Technology, the tech arm of insurer Ping An Insurance Group, helps users to compose. With simple humming, AI can write a complete song in seconds."We integrate AI into different modules in the music field such as lyric, song and education. Through data accumulation and model training, algorithmic models in each module are developed. Furthermore, we have developed an interactive musical app suitable for both professionals and non-professionals," said Xiao Jing, chief scientist at Ping An Insurance.For Magical Brush An, the poem-writing robot developed by Ping An Technology, creating poems is a piece of cake. Given a few keywords or a picture, the robot pens original poems, with either modern or ancient themes, in a few seconds."With Magical Brush An, I never need to worry about writing poems for my girlfriend. The poem I got from the robot is creative and artistic. It is a lot of fun," said Li Nan, a male attendee at the recently concluded 2019 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai.There is more than fun on offer. Ping An's intelligent writing robot is now widely applied in the automobile industry. Based on the UVN-B(user, value, need, behavior) user segmentation model, the robot now produces over 20,000 articles every day, targeting different consumption groups."AI technology has a broad application prospect in art creation, communication and consumption," said Xiao.He noted that through the research and analysis on artistic works created by human beings, AI figures out the inherent laws. With the perception of the surrounding environment, AI can imitate, integrate, or even create art.Specifically, according to Xiao, the model algorithms for sound, image and text processing in AI technology, as well as structural analysis modeling of art works, induction and learning of expert experience, can all be deeply applied to the analysis and creation of works of art.AI is already making money in the field of arts. Last year, an AI-generated portrait painting, called Edmond Belamy, was auctioned at Christie's for $432,500. It is said to be the first piece of AI art to be sold at an auction.This marked AI-based art's entry into the world of auctions, Christie's said in a news release.However, there are doubts whether AI robots will eventually replace artists."In the process of art creation, the relationship between AI technology and human artists must not be opposite. It is rather an assistive, or interactive relationship. AI technology saves artists time and energy so that they can concentrate on art creation, emotion expression and efficient trial and error iteration. It can even 'talk to' or interact with artists," Xiao noted.Agreed Jared Donovan, senior lecturer in interaction design at the School of Design of the Creative Industries Faculty of the Queensland University of Technology. "Artists have done a lot of things using AI robots. For sure, these robots will have more room for development in the future. They may have major influence on how artists work."In the fields of art communication and consumption, AI technology also plays an important role. For those with demands of artistic creation and expression but limited by artistic culture, AI helps them in creating high-quality works of art, Xiao said.Chen Jiong, associate professor at the School of Art of the Renmin University of China, said: "Although currently art is an enviable occupation, and represents educational background, cultural knowledge, attitude toward life or even wealth, with the development of AI technology, these tags will no longer be shiny. Everyone can be called an 'artist'."Promising as the prospect of application of AI in arts is, challenges abound."One thing is that the assessment standard in the field is not established yet, making it difficult to evaluate a piece of art. The other thing is about emotional expression. AI technology needs more data accumulation and deep learning, to strengthen the story and emotional feelings in works of art, creating an art full of warmth," said Xiao from Ping An Insurance.

                    Parents say no to campus politics in the SAR
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                About 60 Hong Kong parents on Sunday launched a protest against advocating politics on local campuses, saying it could "brainwash" their children and affect their academic performance.They took to the streets as some secondary students in the city boycott classes and launch human chain campaigns on campuses to press their political demands. The parents marched from Chater Garden in Central to the Central Government Offices in Admiralty, chanting "oppose brainwash, keep campuses away from politics" and "children are not teachers' pawns".The Education Bureau had earlier issued warning letters to two teachers who had written offensive words against police officers on their social media accounts. The police arrested a 13­-year-­old boy for various offenses, including possession of offensive weapons in public, and a 13-­year-­old girl who burned the national flag, during two violent protests on Saturday.A total 15 other juveniles, aged between 12 and 15, have so far been detained for suspected roles in protests against the now­-abandoned extradition bill from June to late August, according to the police.Ouyang Haixuan, one of the conveners of the demonstration, has a son attending a local primary school. She said she opposes campus politics in order to protect his son and other children from the political turmoil and ensure that children have a peaceful and safe environment to study."Seeing secondary students in school uniform forming human chains and chanting political slogans after the new semester started, I doubt whether they clearly know what they want. I'm worried whether they realize their priority is to study hard," she said.As a mother, Ouyang said she's disappointed with Hong Kong's education system. If the chaos continues, she said she would get her son to leave the chaotic environment and study on the Chinese mainland.Jackey Ko, 40, a music teacher, urged school teachers to behave in strict accordance with work ethics and the professional spirit, and to avoid expressing their political views in front of students.Concerned about his 17-­year-­old son being bullied in social media groups involving classmates, and subject to political wrangling on campuses and in society, Ko decided to send his son to study overseas a year earlier than previously planned."I hope he (my son) can grow up in a harmonious society," he said.Renee Leung, a mother of two underage sons, told China Daily she's firmly opposed to bringing politics into campuses.Juveniles, especially kids in primary and secondary schools, have yet to develop a mature outlook, and they are taught to follow the "authorities", including teachers and parents, she said.Parents and teachers should provide appropriate guidance to help children develop righteous value systems rather than forcing their own opinions onto their children, Leung added.
