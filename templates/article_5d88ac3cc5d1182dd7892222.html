                Shi Jinglan has set an uncompromising standard for herself and her team of prosecutors: If a criminal suspect who should be sentenced to death under the law receives life imprisonment, it means the prosecutors have not done their best.Shi made her name through her dedication to judicial justice and her pioneering reforms of work procedures, which have dramatically increased the efficiency of prosecutions and been promoted countrywide."I'm not dealing with cases but the lives of each and every person involved in these cases," said Shi, 44, who has worked as a prosecutor in Shanghai for 25 years.Considered as outstanding by her colleagues, Shi has handled more than 1,000 cases, many of them high-profile ones.One of her most famous cases happened in 2013 when a medical student from the prestigious Fudan University killed his dorm mate by putting poison in a water dispenser. He was convicted and received the death sentence in 2015.Another feather in Shi's cap involved a case where a senior manager at a company was caught defrauding investment funds from the public. Shi studied the case files for days and noticed the suspect's son, who worked for the same company, was also defrauding money and had stolen five times the amount his father had taken."I regard fairness and justice as the supreme pursuit in my work and make sure that every judicial case that I deal with can stand the test of law and time," Shi said at a recent conference the city hosted for her to share her experiences.Zhu Qijia, who works on Shi's team, said that Shi absorbed and scrutinized every fact and piece of evidence relating to a case. "She often says that if we don't dig into the complicated evidence and details of facts, we're likely to miss key clues to crack a case," she said.Chen Yulin, vice-president of online game developer Shengqu in Shanghai, said when investigating an intellectual property infringement case the company was involved in, Shi went through a staggering 400 gigabytes of data from three mobile phones, three computers and four servers to collect evidence against the suspects. He said he respected Shi's dedication to her work.As part of the country's judicial reforms, four pilot prosecution groups were established in Shanghai Pudong New District's People's Procuratorate in March 2017.Shi became a leader of one of the groups and was given six staff members. But Shi found that procurators were often caught in a mass of trivial administrative and procedural work, and the improper division of labor affected their handling of cases. She revised the work organization manual several times and finally came up with a new job list for members of her group - prosecutors, assistant prosecutors and clerks.Redefining roles in the team has proved effective in improving the quality and efficiency of case handling. The number of cases handled by her group under the new system has increased by 50 percent, even though more than one-third of the cases are complex ones covering finance and intellectual property rights.Such prosecution groups began to be replicated in other regions of the country this year after they were included in the revised Organizations of the People's Prosecutions Departments Code, which became effective at the beginning of this year.In recognition of her contributions and achievements, Shi became the only deputy from prosecution agencies in Shanghai appointed to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in late 2017.In sharing her experience of managing the pilot prosecution groups Shi said, "I felt proud that in Pudong, a place at the forefront of reforms, I was carrying on with the mission of reforms."Shi added this was the embodiment of Shanghai's role in the country as "a pacesetter in reform and opening-up, and a pioneer of innovation and development".

                    It's time for Cathay Pacific to fasten its seat belt
                </p>
            </a>

                That security is supreme on flights is a well-known fact. It is equally well known that no one should tamper with any equipment in an airplane. And flight crew should be the last people to break this rule, comments China Daily writer Zhu Yuan.Yet 13 empty and partly empty bottles of oxygen were found on two Cathay Pacific flights from Hong Kong to Toronto on Aug 17 and 18. Another empty bottle of oxygen was found on a flight operated by Cathay Dragon (a subsidiary of Cathay Pacific) before it took off for Kuala Lumpur on Saturday.Investigators are yet to identify the suspects or whether they have any links with the illegal demonstrations in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, but the recent actions of some Cathay Pacific employees suggest their minds have been poisoned by anti-Chinese mainland ideas.Although the airline has put 40 crew members on a "duty to be assigned" list and introduced a new policy requiring flight crew to conduct even stricter checks on flights every 60 minutes to ensure complete security, there is still enough reason for the public to be worried about security on Cathay Pacific flights.In fact, on July 26, the pilot of a Cathay Pacific flight from Tokyo to Hong Kong, instead of informing passengers about the weather and flight condition, used the public address system to voice his support for the demonstrators, seriously violating work ethics.True, even a pilot has the right to air his or her political views－but not on flights or at airports.Perhaps owning up for the unethical and illegal behaviors of some of the airline's employees, John Slosar resigned as Cathay Pacific chairman on Wednesday, even though the airline said his resignation is due to "his retirement and that he is not aware of any disagreement with the board of the company".Still, Cathay needs to focus more on beefing up security on flights rather than being lulled into a false sense of security. The airline should also ensure that its employees don't express support for the Hong Kong demonstrations while on duty, for by so doing they would not only break service rules but also could compromise flight security.After all, whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out.

                    UK lawmakers reject PM's motion for early election on Oct 15
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                LONDON - British lawmakers on Wednesday rejected a motion tabled by Prime Minister Boris Johnson calling for a general election on Oct 15, dealing another blow to the prime minister, who vowed to take his country out of the European Union on Oct 31 with or without a deal.The lawmakers voted 298-56 on the motion, after the House of Commons passed a Brexit delay bill to prevent a no-deal departure from the European Union.Johnson failed to get sufficient two-thirds majority House of Commons required by law for an early general election, which is not due until 2022. Johnson would have needed 434 votes to succeed in his bid to dissolve parliament.After the vote result was announced, Johnson said that Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is the first leader of the opposition in the country to "refuse the invitation to an election".Johnson said that he had "an obvious conclusion that he (Corbyn) thinks he will not win" in the snap election if it is held next month as he proposed.In return, Corbyn accused the prime minister of "playing a disingenuous game" to force a no-deal Brexit. He said his party would back an election after the bill had been passed, but not before.Corbyn told MPs that Johnson's offer of an election was "a bit like an offer of an apple to Snow White from the Wicked Queen... offering the poison of a no deal".Before the voting, Johnson said the no-deal bill passed minutes earlier essentially ended Brexit negotiations and handed control to Brussels."Today parliament has voted to stop, to scupper any serious negotiations," he told MPs.Johnson said the purpose of the no-deal bill was to take away the right of Britain to determine how long it wants to stay in the EU, and to hand the decision to Brussels.Indicating why he wants a general election, Johnson said it would enable the country to now decide whether the leader of the opposition, Labour's Jeremy Corbyn, or he goes to Brussels."I think it's very sad that MP's have voted like this, I do, I think It's a great dereliction of their duty," Johnson added.

                The appointment of a new envoy may not necessarily create miracles but it can still be perceived as a gesture for resetting relations between two countries. By appointing a new ambassador to China on Wednesday, Canada has sent such a signal, which gives the two sides an opportunity to begin repairing damaged bilateral ties.Sino-Canadian relations came to a standstill after Canada detained Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei, on Dec 1 at the behest of the United States. That has been followed by not only exchanges of bitter words but also setbacks to bilateral trade and people-to-people relations.The detention of Canadian nationals Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor on Dec 10 and the suspension of Canadian imports such as canola oil and meat — despite being on legal grounds, not in response to Meng's detention — reflect the extent to which bilateral relations have deteriorated.Canada, on its part, has adopted a non-reconciliatory stance and refused to respond to China's repeated demand for Meng's release. And its politicians have invited the ire of China for making irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong and the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and thus blatantly interfering in China's internal affairs.As such, Dominic Barton, the new Canadian ambassador to China, is on a difficult and challenging mission to mend bilateral relations.Barton may not be an old "China hand" like his predecessor John McCallum, whom Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired in January. But given his experience of having worked in China before and his economic expertise, there is still much he can do to bridge the gaps between the two sides and help repair the damaged trade ties.More important, with a new envoy in Beijing, Ottawa needs to reflect afresh on the current gridlock. It may have already felt the pain of unilaterally poisoning the relationship with the world's second-largest economy by blindly following the US.Canada also knows where the bilateral ties are stuck.Therefore, as Geng Shuang, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said on Thursday, the Canadian side should have the courage to correct its mistakes and release Meng, and treat China's solemn concerns and core interests with due seriousness.As for Beijing, it welcomes any well-meaning gestures that could help improve bilateral relations.

                    Red tourism rising
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                 Millions of visitors are flocking to the birthplace of the revolution, creating business opportunities to lift villagers out of poverty. Zhang Yangfei reports from Ji'an, Jiangxi province. A dozen "soldiers" tossed fake grenades into the target area, climbed over a wall made of tires and zigzagged nimbly to avoid touching white ropes meant to simulate a "rain of gunfire".The scene might look like a military drill, but it was a dozen university students reliving a day of the Red Army. The event was part of a summer boot camp they attended to learn the history of the Chinese revolution in its birthplace, Jinggangshan, Jiangxi province.The city offers a number of experiences to bring alive the difficulties the Red Army faced in the late 1920s.The students are attracted by so-called "Red Education", and are among more than 10 million tourists who travel to Jinggangshan every year to experience its role in the revolution.The massive number of visitors and limited amount of accommodations is helping lift the largely rural population out of poverty.The hotels around the main attractions offer no more than 20,000 beds, which means homestays have huge potential to meet demand, according to Liu Jiguang, Party secretary of Dalong township."We have red stories backed by the 5A-level tourist spot (classification), we have green ecology. These are the best conditions to develop rural tourism, so we don't lack customers," he said.In Bashang village, Xiao Fumin, 66, and his wife are among the beneficiaries of the tourism boom.The couple, who run a homestay, expect the students in their house after the reenactment is completed. They will be fed a rustic meal stir-fried in a big wok on a wood-fire stove and served in the kitchen. "Students of all grades, from primary school to university, from all over the country come to my house every year," Xiao said. "In 2016, we received more than 800."Before 2016, Xiao's family struggled financially.His daughter was diagnosed with the kidney disease uremia in 2013 and the high medical expenses dragged the family into debt. "She took the medicine for a couple of years but we couldn't afford better treatment so she passed away," he said.In the entrance to Xiao's house, a plate issued by the local government hangs on the main door. It reads: "This family is in difficulty due to their daughter's disease. They have a monthly overdraft and annual extra medical costs of 20,000 yuan ($2,786). Personal wish: they want to buy a gas stove."

                    When exports to China get digital spike

                Alibaba, its affiliates leverage cutting-edge technologies to help SMEs grow in Southeast AsiaOne man's meat is another man's poison - the proverb holds true for people's responses to durian. You either loathe the pulpy-creamy, sweet and stinky fruit or love it so much you strike gold by exporting it.In May, China decided to allow imports of Malaysian whole durians. Ever since, fruit traders in China and Malaysia have been blazing a trail in the multibillion yuan durian market.The expansion of export portfolio beyond frozen pulp and puree is what drives Leron Yee Poh Soon, the Malaysian co-founder of durian seller DKing, and his colleagues these days. They sleep just three hours a day during the harvest season.Every day, they pick up fruits across the 1,000 mu (66.7 hectare) orchard located in Raub, a township within two hours' drive to Kuala Lumpur, categorizing them based on stringent selection tips, and transporting them to ports and processing plants.Soon has jumped on the durian export bandwagon in right earnest. He picks up only premium-quality fruits known as A-level Musang King for export to China. Every fruit is tied to the tree with a cord so it does not fall and split open prematurely.But, for a relatively small businessman like Soon, rivaling Thailand's dominance in the durian export market is no mean feat. His approach is to team up with Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce platform, which has pledged to facilitate cross-border trade for small and medium-sized enterprises through a variety of digital vehicles."Obviously Tmall and Hema Fresh (both are Alibaba's e-commerce platforms) provide very good platforms for us to reach the farthest parts of China," said Soon. He has inked a deal to supply one container-load of whole durians to Hema. "This is one of the fastest, most secure and stable way to be in this massive market."While cross-border e-commerce is old hat for Alibaba, the world's largest online site by transaction volume, the real game-changer empowering Malaysian merchants is an initiative called electronic World Trade Platform.Three years after the concept was first proposed by Alibaba founder Jack Ma, eWTP sank its very first root in Malaysia, where a string of commercial facilities, from e-commerce infrastructure, logistics, financial technology to cloud computing, are being upgraded, or even revolutionized, thanks to latest technology.
