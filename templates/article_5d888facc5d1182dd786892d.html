                Brazil rejects G7 aid on Amazon fires
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Monday rejected aid from G7 countries to fight wildfires in the Amazon, after the seven leaders concluded their summit on Monday in France's seaside town of Biarritz with a pledge of more than $20 million to combat the horrendous fires. The leaders of France, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States made the aid offer to fight the blazes at the weekend summit hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron insisted the fires should be a top item on their agenda. Macron and Chilean President Sebastian Pinera, who was invited to the summit, announced the contribution on Monday. "We must respond to the call of the forest which is burning today in the Amazon," said Macron. He said the G7 nations also agreed to support a medium-term reforestation plan. But Onyx Lorenzoni, chief of staff to Bolsonaro told Macron to take care of "his home and his colonies", according to the G1 Globo news website. "We appreciate (the aid offer), but maybe those resources are more relevant to reforest Europe," he said. "Macron cannot even avoid a foreseeable fire in a church that is a world heritage site," he added, referring to the fire in April that devastated the Notre Dame Cathedral. "What does he intend to teach our country?" Brazilian environment Minister Ricardo Salles had earlier told reporters they had welcomed the G7 funding to fight the fires that have swept across 950,000 hectares and prompted the deployment of the army. Macron has threatened to block the new trade deal between the European Union and several South American countries reached in June unless Bolsonaro takes serious steps to protect the Amazon. On Twitter, Bolsonaro described the G7 plan as an attack on his country's sovereignty. Absence of Trump On Monday morning, US President Donald Trump was the only G7 leader that did not show up at a G7 session on climate, oceans and biodiversity. At the afternoon news conference, Trump called himself an environmentalist. He said his absence was due to his bilateral meetings with leaders from Germany and India. But both Chancellor Angela Merkel and Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the environment session. Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord has been regarded as a major setback for the global cause. Iran also became a major subject of the G7 summit. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif made a surprise visit to Biarritz to meet Macron, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and British and German officials. At the news conference on Monday, Macron said he had informed Trump of his plan to invite Zarif for the visit. Trump said he is open to meeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani under the right circumstances. Tensions between the US and Iran have escalated after Trump pulled the US out from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Iran. Rouhani said on Tuesday that a meeting with Trump would be just a photo op and "that is not possible", adding that the US president first must lift sanctions imposed on Teheran. China, Russia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Iran have all hoped to salvage the deal.

                TEHRAN - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said here Monday that he is open to meet "an individual" if national interests are at stake, official IRNA news agency reported."Iran should use any tools at hand to guarantee national interests," Rouhani was quoted as saying.If meeting someone is needed to help solve the problems of the country, he would do it, Rouhani said, adding that "what is important is our national interest.""Every means must be used in order to protect the country's national interests," he noted without further elaboration on the individual that he hinted to meet.The remarks by Rouhani followed Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif's surprise Sunday visit to the French seaside town of Biarritz, the venue of the 45th G7 summit, and his subsequent comments about Iran's resolution to settle problems with the United States through diplomatic means."Iran's active diplomacy in pursuit of constructive engagement continues," Zarif tweeted on Sunday. "Road ahead is difficult. But worth trying," he added.French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday said that the condition has been prepared for the meeting between the US President Donald Trump and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani.Macron expressed hope that the meeting could take place in the next few weeks.

                    Iran's Rouhani rules out talks with US until sanctions lifted

                DUBAI - Iran will not talk to the United States until all sanctions imposed on Tehran are lifted, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday, a day after US President Donald Trump said he would meet his Iranian counterpart to try to end a nuclear standoff.Trump said on Monday he would meet Iran's president under the right circumstances to end a confrontation that began when Washington pulled out of Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers and reimposed sanctions on the country. Trump also said talks were under way to see how countries could open credit lines to keep Iran's economy afloat.Rouhani said Iran was always ready to hold talks. "But first the US should act by lifting all illegal, unjust and unfair sanctions imposed on Iran," he said in a speech broadcast live on state TV.Speaking at a G7 summit in the French resort of Biarritz, Trump ruled out lifting economic sanctions to compensate for losses suffered by Iran."Washington has the key for positive change ... So take the first step ... Without this step, this lock will not be unlocked," Rouhani said.European parties to the deal have struggled to calm the deepening confrontation between Iran and the United States since Trump pulled Washington out last year.French President Emmanuel Macron has led efforts to defuse tensions and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif flew in to the Biarritz G7 meeting unexpectedly on Sunday for side talks with French officials.Since ditching the deal last year, Trump has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" to try to force Iran into broader talks to restrict its ballistic missile program."Iran does not seek tension with the world. We want security in the Middle East. We want better and friendly ties with other countries," said Rouhani.Reuters

                    Rouhani to US: First lift sanctions, then let's talk
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                          GENEVA - Iranian officials on Tuesday urged the United States to lift its sanctions against Iran to pave the way for talks on mutual issues.              As the "first step" toward dialogue, the US should lift all its "cruel" and "unlawful" sanctions against Iran and respect the Iranian nation's rights, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in his speech aired live by state TV on Tuesday.                  Rouhani's speech came a day after US President Donald Trump said that there was a "really good chance" the two could meet on their nuclear impasse after a surprise intervention by French President Emmanuel Macron during the G7 summit to try to bring Washington and Teheran together after decades of conflict.                      "Without the US' withdrawal from sanctions, we will not witness any positive development," Rouhani said, adding that Washington "holds the key" as to what happens next.                          "If someone intends to make it as just a photo op with Rouhani, that is not possible," he said.                              On Tuesday, Iran said it would need three days to lift its oil production back to the level it was at before US sanctions were imposed, according to the semiofficial Mehr news agency, which quoted Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh.                                  Earlier on Monday, Rouhani expressed readiness to negotiate a way out of the crisis following US's pullout from the 2015 nuclear deal.                                      "If I knew that going to a meeting and visiting a person would help my country's development and resolve the problems of the people, I would not miss it," he said.                                          "Even if the odds of success are not 90 percent but are 20 percent or 10 percent, we must move ahead with it. We should not miss opportunities."                                              Rouhani also shielded his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, against criticism from hard-liners over his surprise visit on Sunday to Biarritz, France, where leaders of the G7 nations were meeting.                                                  Iran's English-language Press TV issued a statement later on Monday, rejecting Macron's initiative.                                                      Macron said he hoped Trump and Rouhani could meet within weeks in hopes of saving the 2015 nuclear deal that Teheran struck with world powers, but which the US unilaterally withdrew from last year. Under the deal, Iran agreed to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.                                                          'Possible path'                                                              On Tuesday, Macron acknowledged his efforts to bring Iran and the US together are "fragile" but said he still sees a "possible path" to rapprochement between the two.                                                                  It's France's responsibility to play the "role of a balancing power", Macron said, adding that his efforts allowed hope for a "de-escalation" of tensions.                                                                      Since the US pullout from the nuclear deal, Iran has lost billions of dollars in business deals allowed by the accord as the US reimposed and escalated sanctions largely blocking Teheran from selling crude abroad, a crucial source of hard currency for the Islamic Republic.
