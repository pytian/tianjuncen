                    Plastic junk spawns disaster in Pacific island
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                WELLINGTON - Floating plastic garbage has swamped a remote Pacific island once regarded as an environmental jewel and scientists say little can be done to save it while a throwaway culture persists.Henderson Island is an uninhabited coral atoll that lies almost exactly halfway between New Zealand and Peru, with 5,500 kilometers of ocean in either direction.Despite its extreme isolation, a freak confluence of geography and ocean currents means Henderson has one of the highest concentrations of plastic pollution on the planet."We found debris from just about everywhere," said Jennifer Lavers, an Australia-based researcher who led an expedition to the island last month."We had bottles and containers, all kinds of fishing stuff and it had come from, well, you name it - Germany, Canada, the United States, Chile, Argentina, Ecuador."It was a real message that every country has a responsibility to protect the environment, even in these remote areas."Henderson lies at the center of the South Pacific gyre, a vast circular ocean current that runs anticlockwise down the east coast of Australia and up the west coast of South America.The gyre should be a boon for the 10-kilometer-by-five speck of land, carrying rich nutrients into the waters surrounding Henderson to feed huge colonies of sea birds.The atoll's ecosystem is so rich that Henderson was included on the UN World Heritage List in 1988, with the body hailing it as an untouched paradise."As one of the last near-pristine limestone islands of significant size in the world, Henderson Island retains its exceptional natural beauty with its white, sandy beaches, limestone cliffs, and rich and almost undisturbed vegetation," it said.But three decades later, the gyre has become a marine conveyor belt dumping endless waves of plastic detritus onto Henderson's coast, making it the hub of what has become known as the South Pacific Garbage Patch.Lavers led her first expedition there in 2015. On the island's East Beach, her team found about 700 items of plastic per square meter, one of the highest concentrations found anywhere in the world.Compounding the problem, the churning waves have reduced more than half the waste to tiny particles almost invisible to the human eye, making them impossible to clean up but easily digested by wildlife such as birds and turtles.Garbage patch Lavers organized a cleanup effort on her most recent trip to the island last month and her team collected six tons of plastic garbage from the beach over two grueling weeks.They were unable to take away the rubbish because their ship could not find a safe mooring on the rugged coastline, instead storing it above the high-tide line for future removal.Lavers admitted it was "heartbreaking" to make such a mammoth effort only to see more garbage floating ashore where they had just cleaned."We'd be having our lunch and watching it replenish in real time as things like buoys and bits of rope washed onto the beach," she said.The marine scientist, who plans further trips to Henderson in 2020 and 2021, said the experience underlined that cleanups were not a long-term solution to the ocean's pollution crisis."It just speaks to the importance of shutting off the tap at the source," she said, calling for tighter restrictions on single-use plastics."There's already so much debris in the oceans, we really need to do all we can to prevent any more getting out there."Agence France-Presse

                    TCM, acupuncture enhance world's medical field
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                US citizen Gavin Wilson, 50, from San Francisco, would have never believed traditional Chinese medicine could help him cope with high blood pressure had he not traveled to China this year and happened to visit a TCM hospital.High BP had been troubling him for three years. Three months ago, while vacationing in Shangrao in East China's Jiangxi province, one of Wilson's friends recommended a local TCM hospital.Out of curiosity, Wilson went to see a TCM doctor. After reading his pulse, the doctor cautioned Wilson about not just high BP but early-stage heart disease.After undergoing TCM treatment for three months, Wilson's BP dropped, and the heart condition was under control."TCM is so amazing! Just a simple pulse reading helped me better understand my illness. I never thought I had a heart issue before. TCM saved my life," Wilson said.Data from the World Health Organization showed that 103 of its 194 member countries use acupuncture, a Chinese practice. And 29 of them had enacted laws to regulate TCM, while 18 had included acupuncture in their medical insurance system.A report from the State Council Information Office said the Chinese government had signed 86 agreements with various countries and international organizations for cooperation in the field of TCM. They envisage establishment of 17 TCM centers overseas.Using TCM, China is offering medical help to developing countries. This way, the world gets a better understanding of TCM.According to the report, China has sent its medical assistance teams to over 70 countries across Asia, Africa and Latin America. TCM professionals accounted for roughly 10 percent of the medical staff members.In recent years, China had sent out over 400 TCM professionals to more than 40 countries. These include Tanzania, Comoros and Indonesia. The goal was to enhance the efforts to prevent many diseases including AIDS and malaria.In addition, international medical assistance teams helped combat a lot of acute diseases using Chinese herbs, acupuncture, tuina (massage), and a combination of Chinese and Western treatments, and saved tens of thousands of lives."Up to 70 percent of the Australian citizens had experienced TCM treatment. Some used TCM to cure diseases, others used TCM to prevent illnesses. This is why the Australian government included TCM in the country's laws and regulations," said Dong Qihan, a professor at the Medical School of the University of Sydney."Acupuncture is unexpectedly popular in Minsk," said Zhou Haijiang, head of the Acupuncture Department at Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of TCM, which teamed up with the government of Belarus in January 2018 to establish a local TCM center. According to Zhou, five more TCM centers will open in Belarus later on.
