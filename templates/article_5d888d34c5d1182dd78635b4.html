                Hainan offers housing incentives to attract talent
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Hainan is offering housing incentives to attract talent to the tropical island province, where the country's 12th free trade zone - its largest - is being created.A notice from the provincial government on Friday said the employees of companies that move their headquarters to the island will enjoy the same housing policies and credit support as locals when buying a house, even though they don't have household registration in Hainan.The supplementary measure, which is intended to address problems of new employees settling in the Hainan FTZ, will improve the business environment, attract investors, promote opening-up and development of headquarters, and optimize the living environment, local officials said.In April last year, after the central government said Hainan would become a pilot free trade zone, the island announced it would attract 1 million skilled workers. To accomplish that, it has adopted measures to support free housing for topnotch personnel, child education, spousal employment, medical insurance and car purchases.Hainan also announced an islandwide housing quota - regarded as the strictest in the country - to curb speculation. The new rules required those who do not live on the island but want to buy houses to provide local tax records for the past 60 months from at least one member of the applicant's family - making it impossible for nonnative residents to buy a home there."The latest move to help newcomers buy a home will make talented people feel more at ease and work more wholeheartedly," said Xia Feng, director of the economic research department of the China Institute for Reform and Development."The government should also promote the rental housing market for those who cannot afford to buy, and cultivate more diversified business platforms to attract talent from outside the island," he said.Wang Lu, chairman of Jincheng Consultancy, a Haikou-based real estate information provider, said that because of the province's small population base and weak economic and industrial foundation, investment and talent attraction are two urgent issues for the development of the FTZ.Since April last year, 65,000 market entities have entered Hainan, up 33 percent year-on-year. Twenty-seven of the world's top 500 companies have landed in Hainan, including Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Thomas Cook, Sinopec, Alibaba and Tencent, said Fu Xuanchao, director of the provincial Development and Reform Commission.mazhiping@chinadaily.com.cn(China Daily 04/02/2019 page4)

                    Hainan takes the green path for sustainable economic development
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Hainan province will come out with more green, innovative measures to attract investors and make the province a leading global trade hub, according to officials."We are done with sacrificing the environment for economic growth, for now and for good, as it is by no means a way to real prosperity," said Wang Guangmin, curator of the planning exhibition hall of Lingshui Li autonomous county in Hainan province, during the anniversary of the launch of the Hainan free trade zone.President Xi Jinping said on April 13, 2018 that Hainan island would be developed as the nation's 12th FTZ. Since then, the province has been looking to play a bigger part in the opening-up and reform process by charting development plans loaded with green, innovative efforts.Located at the southeast part of Hainan island, Lingshui utilized the beneficial policies pertaining to the Hainan FTZ to transform the county into a popular destination with vast tourism resources for domestic and international tourists."The pilot free trade zone plan has been a big boost to our Beautiful Villages project, and is making the village an attractive tourist destination," Wang said.Beautiful Villages is a project initiated by the Hainan provincial government in 2016 to improve the infrastructure of villages on Hainan island without damaging the environment, and transform them into tourist spots with distinct characteristics.Local government officials said a sum of 250 million yuan ($37.31 million) has so far been spent to undertake beautification projects in Lingshui. Under the project, 20 villages have been earmarked for transformation and nine have already attained the project standard.Such efforts have also started to bring in revenue for the county. According to data from Lingshui Tourism Association, 5.3 million tourists visited the county in 2018, a year-on-year growth of 20.9 percent. The increasing visitor flows helped generate record revenues of 3.59 billion yuan, up 20.1 percent from the same period a year earlier."The infrastructure upgrade has been gaining momentum since the launch of the free trade zone, and is as such crucial for local development. The free trade zone has already become a name card for the island, helping attract more tourists from home and abroad," Wang said.The success achieved by the autonomous county is now regarded as a shining example within the island and is being emulated by other smaller villages like Shamei village in Qionghai city and Boao township, which recently hosted a leading global economic forum."Our per capita annual income on average rose to 16,000 yuan last year, from 14,500 yuan in 2017," said Wang Qiuyu, an official in charge of publicity affairs for Shamei village.Shamei village managed to achieve the required standards and greeted tourists from October. In just three months, the village managed to attract 820,000 tourists and earn 2 million yuan from the tourism sector, said Wang.Apart from the tourism and service sectors, which are seen as Hainan's traditional strengths and the backbone for the pilot free trade zone, efforts are also being stepped up to take the high-tech highway to sustainable growth.Fullsing Town Internet Innovation Park, an industrial park for high-tech enterprises and an incubator for innovative startups based in Haikou, started another investment promotion event on Saturday targeting domestic and foreign investors."The focus of our efforts was to increase corporate occupancy at the International Offshore Innovation Building, a newly established plaza," said Ma Liang, deputy general manager of the park."More than 50 investors, including industry leaders and entrepreneurs from home and abroad, have expressed interest in setting up operations at the park," said Ma.Though the building was opened for use only in December, it is already home to big-ticket companies such as consultancy giant PricewaterhouseCoopers and internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Alibaba has teamed up with the local government for cooperation in the digital economy, smart services and e-commerce, with an overarching vision of transforming Hainan into an intelligent information island."Hainan is slowly but surely becoming the test bed for China's further opening up and reform and companies like Alibaba are the catalysts and magnets for sustained investments," said Ma."We have accommodated the companies and startups in three parts of the park depending on their business operations so that there will be closer synergy and fruitful cooperation between big and small companies."The pattern has already started bearing fruit. By the end of last year, the park was host to 202 companies, with 65 percent of them from outside the island. Total revenue rose to 15 billion yuan in 2018, up 67 percent on an annualized basis.According to data from the Hainan provincial government, by the middle of March this year, 30 of the world's top 500 companies had conducted business operations in the island, including firms like Tencent, Deloitte and Thomas Cook."We have been taking positive steps to transform the development pattern since the establishment of the free trade zone and have made some modest achievements within the first year," said Zhu Lian, deputy director of the Hainan Provincial Development and Reform Commission.According to Zhu, the island had 381 high-tech companies as of last year, a year-on-year growth of 46.1 percent, and total revenue of over 100 billion yuan. Revenues of internet companies posted year-on-year growth of 40 percent and amounted to 60 billion yuan."It is important to further efforts to create an improved business environment on the island as it will help attract more investors and investment," Zhu said.Statistics from the provincial government show that foreign direct investment increased 112.68 percent year-on-year to $733.05 million in 2018. Foreign trade grew 20.8 percent year-on-year to $12.52 billion during the same period.Apart from the internet and tourism sectors, the province is also stepping up efforts in 10 other pillar industries, including high-efficiency agriculture, medical tourism, exhibitions and modern logistics, according to an annual government work report released in January.

                    China's Fosun expected to bid for UK travel firm
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Chinese conglomerate Fosun International is considering a bid for all or part of United Kingdom-based travel company Thomas Cook, according to reports.Fosun is understood to be one of a number of potential bidders that have held preliminary talks with Thomas Cook, which is the UK's oldest travel company.Discussions are in the early stages and any potential takeover would be months down the line, according to Sky News, which first reported the developments.Sky News named New York City-headquartered investment company KKR and Swedish private equity firm EQT as two other interested parties.Thomas Cook declined to comment when contacted by China Daily, and Fosun had not responded to requests at the time of publication.Established in 1841, Thomas Cook is the world's longest-running tour operator. Initially founded as a railway service, the company now has 22,000 staff serving 19 million customers a year in 16 countries. The company runs its own airline and operates nearly 600 high-street travel stores around the UK.Last year, the company suffered heavy losses, brought on by an increasingly competitive travel market and a summer heatwave that saw fewer Brits go abroad on holiday.In November, Thomas Cook announced pre-tax losses of 163 million pounds ($211 million) for 2018, compared with profits of 9 million pounds the previous year.Thomas Cook put its airline up for sale earlier this year when it also announced the closure of 21 UK stores and the loss of 300 jobs.The company's chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, said 2018 had been a "disappointing year"."The UK was particularly hard hit with very high levels of promotional activity coming on top of an already competitive market for holidays to Spain," Fankhauser said when he issued the profit warning in November.Thomas Cook and Fosun have already partnered in China, where they established a joint venture in January. That deal involves building two hotels, including a Chinese branch of the British travel company's Casa Cook chain. The hotels will be constructed by Fosun and managed by Thomas Cook.Fosun has made notable investments in the UK in recent years. It purchased Premier League soccer club Wolverhampton Wanderers for 45 million pounds in 2016. And, last year, Fosun affiliate Resolution Property bought four floors of the Royal Exchange building in the City of London for 45 million pounds.Fosun is also focusing on building out its tourism portfolio. Its travel arm, Fosun Tourism, took control of major French holiday group Club Med in 2015. And last week, Fosun's venture capital branch, Fosun RZ Capital, led a $6.75 million Series A investment round in Splitty, an online hotel booking startup based in Israel."Fosun will definitely invest more in travel," Wilson Jin, chairman of Fosun RZ Capital, said last Monday when the investment was announced.The largest-ever acquisition of a British travel company by a Chinese buyer happened in 2016, when Ctrip took control of Edinburgh-based flight booking company Skyscanner in a $1.7 billion deal.

                Nearly 100 corporate projects launched, pumping 41 billion yuan into city's economy Sanya, one of tropical coastal cities at the southern tip of Hainan island, is becoming a popular destination for domestic and overseas investment as construction of the China (Hainan) Pilot Free Trade Zone (Port) gains momentum. Construction of 15 projects began and agreements on 11 projects were signed on May 18. The latest batch of investment in Sanya, dubbed the "oriental Hawaii", covering fields like headquarters economy, tourism, finance and high-tech industries. Over 9 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) was invested in the area. Since the central government announced plans in April last year to build Hainan into a pilot free trade zone and gradually explore building it into a free trade port with Chinese characteristics, the tourist resort city has signed strategic cooperation agreements on 300 projects with names like Merlin Entertainments, Thomas Cook, China Taiping Life Insurance, China Minmetals and COFCO, among many others. In total, 101 projects have been launched, with investment reaching 41.25 billion yuan. Much of the funds came from overseas conglomerates and domestic business giants, according to the local government. A total of 29 Fortune Global 500-listed conglomerates have decided to launch business in Sanya, and 23 corporations, including China Minmetals and Sunshine Insurance Group, have registered their regional or business section headquarters in the tropical city. A recent Deloitte's evaluation gave Sanya's business environment a score of 73.4 points, earning it the 49th place in a global comprehensive simulation ranking, according to a report from Sanya Daily. Sanya is a strategic node on the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and is working to be a leader in the construction of the Hainan FTZ and free trade port with Chinese characteristics, said Tong Daochi, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Hainan Committee and secretary of the CPC Sanya Committee. He said Sanya presents great opportunities and shoulders heavy responsibilities in promoting the Belt and Road Initiative and the construction of the Hainan FTZ. He added Sanya will highlight work in 10 key areas this year, including implementing policies for deepening reform and opening-up in an all-round way, promoting trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, accelerating financial opening and innovation, promoting high-quality tourism development and overall institutional reform. The priorities also include optimizing the business environment, promoting construction of the national ecological civilization pilot area, accelerating construction of key projects and strengthening construction of risk prevention and control systems. Sanya will strive to establish special customs regulatory areas, introduce service agencies specialized in international legal, arbitration, accounting, auditing, intellectual property rights and rating services, in a bid to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, according to Tong. He said the free trade account system will be adopted by all major commercial banks, and eligible financial institutions will be encouraged to carry out cross-border investment, financing, trade settlement, offshore insurance, as a move to accelerate financial opening-up and innovation. Sanya's International Trade Center will also be established this year. "Tourism is Sanya's traditional advantage and leading industry, which received more than 20.99 million tourists last year. Efforts must be made to upgrade the industry by taking advantage of the construction of Hainan into an international tourism center, one of the four positions for the Hainan FTZ set by the central government, and make Sanya a benchmark for Hainan FTZ development," said Tong. To promote high-quality growth of tourism, Sanya will increase international air routes, explore the policy of no-visa transit linking with other domestic cities, open up more transnational cruise routes, promote pilot routes for cruises to nowhere from Sanya cruise port. The city will also vigorously promote full coverage of online payment and terminal payment services at tourist attractions, hotels and for large and medium-sized commodities, in addition to making foreign currency exchange more convenient, according to the city government. Tong said Sanya will concentrate on the development of tourism, the hospitality industry, duty-free shopping, healthcare industry, exhibition industry, financial industry and other modern service industries to achieve high-quality development. On March 23, about 20,000 car-racing fans and spectators came to Sanya from home and abroad to enjoy the excitement from the FIA Formula E Championship. "This is one of the many international sports events introduced by Sanya, which is cultivating a 'tourism+ sports' industry," said Chen Zhenmin, director of the Sanya Tourism, Culture, Radio, Television and Sports bureau. "Sanya has been promoting deeper integration of tourism with health, culture, exhibition and sports to introduce and develop world-class quality products and attract tourists from all over the world," said Chen. Besides deepening supply-side reform in the tourism sector, Sanya is also striving in developing high-end service industries and high-tech industries, according to Tong. "High-tech industry is one of our focuses to ensure the city's high quality development. Sanya will promote construction of the Yazhou Bay Science and Technology City, 42 kilometers in the west from the city proper, including the construction of the National South China Seed Breeding Base, the National Tropical Agricultural Science Center, the South Center of the National Deep-Sea Base and the Global Animal and Plant Germplasm Resources Introduction and Transfer Base," said Tong. He added Sanya will also speed up construction of infrastructure, promote interconnection between Sanya and regions taking part in the BRI. Exchanges and cooperation with the outside world will increase in the fields of culture, tourism, sports, science and technology and education. Policies on talent introduction and visa-free entry for tourists from 59 countries will be implemented to bring together more talent, increase logistical flow, funds and technologies for the development and prosperity of Sanya, and for mutual development and benefit of the city's cooperation partners from home and abroad, said officials with the city government.  A bird's eye-view of Sanya, one of tropical coastal cities in China.Fu Bin/for China Daily(China Daily 05/29/2019 page10)

                    Sanya to explore establishing tax policies compatible with Hainan FTZ

                Sanya, a resort coastal city at the southern tip of South China's Hainan island, will explore establishing tax policies and legal systems compatible with the China (Hainan) Free Trade Zone and Free Trade Port with Chinese characteristics, to attract more overseas Chinese to make investment, work and live in Sanya, according to the city's top official.Sanya welcomes overseas Chinese from all over the world to gather to jointly build the Hainan Free Trade Zone (FTZ) and free trade port, and share development opportunities in Hainan, said Tong Daochi, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Hainan Provincial Committee and secretary of the CPC Sanya Municipal Committee.He made the remarks on Saturday when meeting representatives of the 2019 Sanya Conference on Overseas Chinese Investment, Innovation and Pioneering, which closed on Sunday.Tong said Hainan has attracted 3.9 million overseas Chinese who have made an important contribution to social and economic development over the years."And now Hainan needs more support from the overseas Chinese community, as it is making every effort to build a free trade zone and free trade port," Tong said.He added that in line with the strategic positioning of the central government, Sanya is accelerating the development of tourism, the modern service industry and high-tech industries and actively building the city as a benchmark for the Hainan FTZ.He noted Sanya is creating a legal, internationalized and convenient business environment and upgrading local infrastructure. It also will explore the establishment of tax policies and legal systems that are appropriate to the FTZ and free trade port to attract more overseas Chinese to make investment in Sanya, and ensure they enjoy work and life in the tropical city as well."Hainan has unique environmental and policy advantages, and it is also an important window for China to open to the outside world," said Dhanin Chearavanont, chairman of Chia Tai Group and director of the China Overseas Chinese Entrepreneurs Association, in a keynote speech at the opening ceremony.He suggested that Hainan introduce more open, complete and innovative modern laws, regulations and investment policies to attract more world-class talents to innovate and start up businesses in Hainan.He said as one of the first overseas-funded enterprises to enter Hainan, Chia Tai Group will cooperate more extensively with Sanya in the field of biotechnology research and development.Chain-ing Thomas Shih, professor and founder of Taiwan BioSolultion Co Ltd, said there is a huge space for cooperation in a number of fields, especially agriculture, between Hainan and Taiwan. He expects in-depth cooperation in farm produce processing, services and R&D between Hainan and Taiwan companies.The four-day conference attracted more than 1,000 overseas Hainan business delegates, elites and representatives of well-known domestic enterprises.They discussed a slew of topics, including young talent recruitment, Chinese wisdom on innovation and entrepreneurship, wealth management and modern finance, global medical equipment ecology, digital trade strategy, the aerospace industry, artificial intelligence and sci-tech innovation, and Hainan-Taiwan agricultural cooperation.The conference also witnessed the signing of 10 projects, including a flower tourism demonstration park, an internet hospital highlighting artificial intelligence, a cruise port theme park, a demonstration base for Hainan-Taiwan tropical agriculture cooperation and a movie making project.Since the central government announced plans in April last year to build Hainan into a pilot free trade zone and gradually explore building it into a free trade port with Chinese characteristics, Sanya has signed strategic cooperation agreements on 300 projects with names like Merlin Entertainments, Thomas Cook, China Taiping Life Insurance, China Minmetals and COFCO, among many others.A total of 29 Fortune Global 500-listed conglomerates have decided to launch businesses in Sanya, which is at the same latitude of 18 degrees north as Hawaii, and 23 corporations, including China Minmetals and Sunshine Insurance Group, have registered their regional or business section headquarters in the tropical city, according to the local government.

                From security concerns to travel and accommodation woes, European teams have to adjustHuge entourages, heavy security and demands for the sort of police protection normally reserved for heads of state.For European soccer teams jetting across Asia, nothing is left to chance - but they sometimes run into problems anyway.Today's money-spinning preseason tours are a far cry from 30 years ago, when the likes of Manchester United played friendlies against local sides, or at most hopped over to Ireland.United, now a global brand, sent staff to Shanghai several times ahead of last week's friendly against Tottenham to ensure the Hongkou Stadium pitch was up to scratch.Paris Saint-Germain dispatched a chef ahead of the team's arrival in each location in Asia to check that the food adheres to players' strict diets.Security - which usually means keeping away overzealous fans - has been a primary concern for the clubs fanning out across Asia this month.Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola was accompanied by a beefy escort as he made the short walk to the team bus inside Nanjing Olympic Stadium.Autograph and selfie-hunters were left empty-handed.City's guarded approach - its security detail was never far away - angered Chinese media, which accused the club of an "attitude of arrogance".Guardiola retorted: "Maybe one journalist is a little bit upset, I don't know why, but it's far away from what is reality."

                    Chinese investment in the UK bounces back after slow year
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Firms are again showing interest as the clock ticks down to exit from European UnionAfter a fallow year, Chinese investors are once again opening their wallets and heading to the United Kingdom to snap up assets.Energized by a Brexit-battered pound, Chinese businesses poured more money into the UK between January and August than they did in the entirety of 2018, according to UK consultancy Deloitte.This week, Shanghai-based conglomerate Fosun provided Thomas Cook with an estimated 450-million-pound ($550.6 million) rescue package, in return for a 75 percent stake in the beleaguered UK travel company's tour operator and a 25 percent share of its airline.And another mammoth deal went ahead earlier this month, when Hong Kong-based CK Asset Holdings bought British brewer Greene King, for an estimated $3.3 billion."Interest from China, both mainland and Hong Kong, in the UK is bouncing back," Deloitte's vice-chairman and Chinese services group leader, Angus Knowles-Cutler, told China Daily. "2017 was the big year in terms of M&A, and then it fell off a cliff last year. The year to date, it's already up. It is coming back; perhaps not to 2017 levels, but there is a fair amount of a judicious, strategic interest from Chinese buyers in the UK. We remain the number one destination in Europe over and above any other country."In 2019, non-real estate related foreign direct investment from China into the UK has reached an estimated $8.3 billion, compared with $6.1 billion for the whole of 2018, according to Deloitte.Official figures for overseas direct investment into the UK for 2018 have not yet been released by the China National Bureau of Statistics, or NBS.The big deals have been diverse. In February, Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial took over UK-based international payments company World First in a deal believed to be worth $641 million. And in June, Hillhouse Capital, the management company founded by Chinese billionaire Zhang Lei, snapped up Scottish whisky maker Loch Lomond Distillers for a reported $508 million.The increased Chinese interest is partly due to currency fluctuations brought on by the UK's pending exit from the European Union.The pound fell 0.7 percent against the dollar, to trade at around $1.221 on Wednesday after it emerged that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson would ask the queen to suspend Parliament, a move that critics say is designed to thwart those wanting to block a no-deal Brexit.Responding to the slide, Panmure Gordon's chief economist, Simon French, said the situation could worsen if a no-deal Brexit looks certain."We could see sterling trading down towards its all-time low of 1.08 pounds versus the dollar, a level hit 34 years ago," French told UK financial paper City AM.The weakening of the pound has made assets more attractive in the UK this year and Chinese investment has picked up, relative to other large European investment destinations, including Germany.But Knowles-Cutler also believes that 2018 was a year of consolidation for Chinese investors, who completed more than $35 billion in UK deals during the previous two years, according to the NBS."With the big tidal wave of Chinese investment in 2016-17, I think some of the investment was good and sensible," he said. "I think, also, in their enthusiasm to internationalize, Chinese businesses have made a number of poor investments as well."Last year, a Deloitte analysis revealed that one in five UK businesses bought by Chinese buyers is loss-making."There has been a regrouping of Chinese interest, to make sure what the Chinese are buying is a sensible, strategic fit with their domestic business," said Knowles-Cutler. "They have wanted to make sure things are more thought-through. The consolidation of what they have already bought has distracted Chinese buyers, but now they are back."The Thomas Cook purchase by Fosun provides an example of a strategy that augments domestic business.Prior to the takeover, the two companies established a joint venture in January, involving the construction of two hotels in China, including a branch of the British travel company's Casa Cook chain.Fosun also added French holiday group Club Med to its portfolio of tourism businesses in 2015 and invested in Israel-based online hotel booking startup Splitty in April.Knowles-Cutler said the prospect of a no-deal Brexit may not deter future Chinese investment in British business and infrastructure."In my conversations with Chinese businesses around Brexit, I generally haven't got a sense that it's one of the major factors in their decisionmaking," he said. "Whereas, I think, Japanese businesses have taken Brexit very seriously and viewed it quite negatively, I think Chinese businesses are being a bit more commercial about the opportunities with the UK."

                    NHL moving forward with female officiating
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                BUFFALO, NY - Once the butterflies and adrenalin rush of officiating her first NHL prospects game subsided, Kirsten Welsh woke up on Saturday eager to get back on the ice again.Whatever miscues Welsh made and hesitancy showed during her debut at the Buffalo Sabres prospects tournament a day earlier were overshadowed by how much she enjoyed the experience. There was also the realization she might have a future as an NHL linesmanor - or is it lineswoman?"I just think this is what I love. This is what I've always been about," Welsh said. "Having the opportunity to pursue this is just unbelievable. I can't tell you how thankful I am."The 22-year-old from Toronto was, as she put it "thrown into the fire" by working a game between Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins prospects. Aside from calling offside and icing and handling faceoffs, the 5-foot-10 Welsh was unafraid to get in the middle of several post-whistle scrums."I think the guys were kind of thrown off that a girl was rushing in there to break them up," said Welsh, who completed a four-year college career playing defense at Pittsburgh's Robert Morris University last season. "I got smushed in the boards yesterday, too. It's fun. I just think it's so great to be out there with them and being able to be on the ice with all these amazing athletes."Welsh has the potential to become a trailblazer in a role that's been exclusively reserved for men at NHL level until last Friday. That's when the league announced Welsh was one of four women selected for the first time to officiate the league's various prospect tournaments held around the nation.Welsh is joined by Katie Guay and Kelly Cooke, who were selected as referees to work tournaments in Anaheim, California, and Nashville, Tennessee. Kendall Hanley was assigned to work as a linesman at the Detroit Red Wings tournament in Traverse City, Michigan.The four were chosen after being among 89 participants - 11 of them women - at the NHL's annual officials scouting combine in Buffalo last month. And they become the first women assigned to work on the ice in a competitive NHL setting.All four are considered candidates to eventually break the NHL's officiating gender barrier, which has become a point of emphasis stressed by commissioner Gary Bettman and the league's director of officiating, Stephen Walkom.The NBA has had female officials since Violet Palmer and Dee Kantner were hired in 1997. Sarah Thomas was the NFL's first female official in 2015. Pam Postema, in 2000, was the first female to umpire a Major League Baseball spring training game, and there are at least two women currently working at the Triple-A level.Al Kimmel, the NHL's director of scouting and development for officiating, said last month that the growth of women's hockey has led to a surge of candidates."In my six years here, the growth and improvement of the on-ice and off-ice abilities match some of the men and surpass some of the men," Kimmel said. "We've got some high-caliber women officials here that have world-class experience that are going to show some of the boys some things out there."Guay is the most experienced of the four. Her 14-year officiating career includes working women's games at last year's Winter Olympics, college hockey men's games and being part of the first all-female officiating crew to work the women's Frozen Four championship last spring.Her lifelong objective was limited to working the Olympics, before finally realizing the possibility of working in the NHL."I think it's huge," she said last month, of the chance of being selected to work an NHL prospects game. "I think any time people are given a chance and new paths are formed, it opens eyes for others to kind of dream bigger."Welsh's debut wasn't spotless. She said she needs to be more assertive in her calls and more in control of players during faceoffs."It's really being firm, like kicking them out of the faceoff if that's the case, don't let them get away with stuff because I'm a girl," she said.Welsh was grateful for the positive support she received from her fellow on-ice officials and league supervisors, who immediately went over her tape to provide tips on what she needs to improve. She also leaned on the support of former Robert Morris player Brandon Blandina, who made his NHL officiating debut last season.Welsh was particularly encouraged by undrafted Penguins prospect Chase Berger congratulating her by shaking her hand following the game."I literally had to say, 'Wow. Thank you. You have no idea how much that means to me,'" she recalled.Bruins prospect forward Cooper Zech said he wasn't aware of a female linesman working the game until he noticed Welsh's long hair."It didn't change anything. It's a linesman. It doesn't matter if it's a boy, girl, they blow the whistle, the plays dead. Nothing changes," Zech said. "She's got the same jurisdiction of any linesman in the National Hockey League or anywhere. Hockey's hockey."Associated Press
