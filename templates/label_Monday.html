We are expecting additional consignment that will bring relief to millions of Kenyans as the current rains end by the end of this month

Removing fuel from the cooling pools will help free up space for the subsequent removal of the melted fuel, though details of how to gain access to it are yet to be decided

Known as the "Dixie Mission", this delegation had been sent to establish the first-ever US government contact with the Chinese Communist Party.As the issues that divide the US and China today are considered, it can be extremely helpful to remember that the current trade dispute is not anywhere close to the significance of the threats to both the Chinese and American people in 1944

Choosing policies that support growth has become the priority for global leaders, and Chinese policymakers are expected to follow suit in their own way, providing assurances that the economy is on firm footing while striking a macroeconomic balance for long-term stability, analysts said." Stephen Schwartz, senior director of sovereign ratings at Fitch (Hong Kong), said, "In the face of the external headwinds, we believe the Chinese authorities will stop short of the type of credit-led stimulus policies that could exacerbate medium-term financial and economic imbalances

The bill-signing prompted a round of applause from first responders in the Rose Garden as well as Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who was mayor of New York City during the attacks and was widely praised for his leadership in the aftermath of the World Trade Center collapse

                            WASHINGTON - The United States tested a new ground-based cruise missile which can hit a target after more than 500 kilometers of flight, weeks after withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty banning such systems, the Pentagon said Monday in a statement.The United States will fully develop ground-launched conventional missiles after withdrawing from the INF Treaty earlier this month, US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has said.The collapse of the INF Treaty, which was signed by the Soviet Union and the United States in 1987, has triggered the fear that a new round of arms race is looming, many analysts say

                            Since Japan and the ROK, as the two major US allies in Asia, will be expected by Washington to play host to new US intermediate-range ballistic missiles, they should give careful consideration to the increasingly obvious fact that it is the outdated Cold-War and zero-sum mindset of the US that is the biggest threat to regional peace and stability.This, along with his earlier revelation of the US intention to deploy ground-launched, intermediate-range missiles in Asia and State Department Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security Affairs Andrea Thompson's disclosure of consultations with allies and partners regarding such deployment, cannot but raise serious security concerns on the part of Beijing.It wants to go all out developing cutting-edge intermediate range missiles so it can apply pressure on what it views as the unholy trinity of China, Russia, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and trigger a new arms race

                             According to the KPMG report, Australia is the second most favored country for Chinese investment, behind only the United States ($118 billion in 2015). The report also showed that while investment in agriculture was small, the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA), as well as pending deals for agribusiness firms such as S Kidman and Co, had paved the way for a leap in this year's figures. The state of New South Wales remains the Chinese investor's state of choice, accounting for almost 50 percent of all investment in Australia, while Chinese money poured into the Northern Territory for the first time in 2015
