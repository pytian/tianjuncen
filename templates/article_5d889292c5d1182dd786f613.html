                Mayweather pondering China boutIf you've got it, flaunt it.Floyd Mayweather, who has pledged to use his fame and influence to focus boxing's global spotlight on China, knows there's no better way than by climbing back in the ring himself.The South China Morning Post reported on the weekend that the retired former five-division world champion is in negotiations with the Mission Hills Group to stage an exhibition bout against a Chinese opponent, and a media conference has been scheduled for Sept 18 in Haikou, Hainan province, to announce the details."The media conference will announce that Mayweather will hold a boxing match in China next year," a representative of MHG told the Post."We have already got the Hainan government's temporary approval for this event, but everything needs to be confirmed with Floyd as well. The details are not yet 100 percent finalized. We are in negotiations with Mayweather's management team."This match aims to enhance the friendship between two powerful nations through boxing, gaining popularity for Hainan in the role of an international tourism island and achieving Mission Hills' vision of bringing world-class sports events to Haikou."In July, the 42-year-old Mayweather was recruited by the Chinese Boxing Federation to serve as a special adviser to the national team.In announcing the deal, the featherweight bronze medalist at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and one of the greatest defensive fighters in ring history pledged "to go all out" to use his influence and resources to boost China's profile in the sport ahead of next summer's Tokyo Games.China first competed in Olympic boxing in 1984 at Los Angeles, but it wasn't until Athens 2004 that Zou Shiming won the nation's first medal－a bronze in the light flyweight division.Zou and light heavyweight Zhang Xiaoping became national heroes by winning gold at the 2008 Beijing Games and Zou was champion again at London 2012, but there's been little for Chinese fight fans to get excited about since.A total of 43 boxers (38 men, nine women) have represented the nation in nine Olympics, bringing home 12 medals. In 2016 at Rio de Janeiro, Yin Junhua captured silver in the women's lightweight division, Li Qian won bronze in women's middleweight and Hu Jianguan took bronze in men's flyweight.After retiring in late 2016 with a 50-0 record, one of Mayweather's first moves was to visit Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Chengdu (where he purchased naming rights to a baby panda). The champ interacted with fans and posted online photos of himself and his entourage on the Great Wall.Mayweather－aka 'Money'－pocketed an estimated $300 million for defeating Manny Pacquiao in 2015's "Fight of the Century" and earned another $350 million two years later for his TKO of Irish mixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor in a crossover match.Mayweather is set to tour the Missions Hills Resort Haikou on Sept 17, after which he will be feted at a private welcoming dinner.

                    Serena Williams reaches US Open final again
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                NEW YORK — With another US Open final in sight, and Grand Slam title No 24 within reach, Serena Williams got past a slightly shaky start and quickly took control.Williams turned in an increasingly impressive performance for a 6-3, 6-1 victory over No 5-seeded Elina Svitolina of Ukraine in their semifinal at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Thursday night.This will be Williams' fourth final in the past six major tournaments. She was the runner-up at Wimbledon each of the past two years, losing to Angelique Kerber in 2018 and to Simona Halep in July. And she was also the runner-up, of course, a year ago at Flushing Meadows, losing to Naomi Osaka.That final was, and forever will be, overshadowed by Williams' extended argument with chair umpire Carlos Ramos, who docked her a point, then a game — and was barred by the US Tennis Association from officiating any matches in this year's tournament involving her or her older sister, Venus.So much of what Williams does nowadays must be seen through the prism of tennis history, and that was certainly the case this time. Her 101st career match win at Flushing Meadows tied Chris Evert's tournament record."It's just impressive, I guess," Williams said. "I don't think about it. I just come out here and do what I can."By getting to the final, Williams set a record for longest gap between first career Grand Slam title match and most recent such appearance: It's almost exactly 20 full years since she won the 1999 US Open as a teenager.Most importantly, if she can beat No 13 Belinda Bencic or No 15 Bianca Andreescu in Saturday's final, Williams will equal Margaret Court with 24 Grand Slam singles titles, the most in tennis history. Court, though, won more than half of hers against amateur competition before professionals were allowed to play in majors starting in 1968.This was Williams' 38th Grand Slam semifinal; she made it that far for the 10th appearance in a row at Flushing Meadows. And it was only the second time to the final four at a major for the 24-year-old Svitolina, who also got there at Wimbledon in July.Right from the start, though, it was Svitolina who was steadier. She earned three break points in the opening game — but failed to convert one. In the second game, Svitolina went ahead 40-love — yet somehow got broken.In all, Svitolina held eight game points across that opening pair, and was left with nothing to show for it. Quickly, it was 3-0 for Williams.If it wasn't as lopsided a performance as she put forth in a 6-1, 6-1 victory over Maria Sharapova in the first round or a 6-1, 6-0 win over Wang Qiang in the quarterfinals, it was pretty dialed-in.She launched serves at up to 119 mph and saved all six break points she faced. She smacked three return winners in one game alone. She revved up some of the very best groundstrokes you'll see at angles a pool shark would appreciate, to the tune of a 34-11 edge in winners. She sprinted this way and that, showing no trace of any sort of lingering effect from a rolled ankle earlier in the tournament.As if for good measure, Williams even threw in a serve-and-volley approach while facing break point at 3-1 in the first set — and, naturally, it worked, thanks to a swinging putaway."Don't expect that again," Williams said, joking that this was going through her mind: "What am I doing at the net?! Let me get back to the baseline!' Maybe Svitolina, whose one upset of Williams in five previous matchups came at the 2016 Rio Olympics, was just a bit too passive, content to say way back and try to chase down everything sent her way.Not the right approach. At least not against this opponent, in this match, on this day.By no means was Williams perfect. She was awfully good, though, which was more than enough. It often is for her. Just hasn't been in the three most significant matches of her comeback so far.She'll get another shot at it Saturday.One more for 24.AP

                RIO DE JANEIRO — Firefighters in Brazil say the death toll in a hospital fire that forced the evacuation of patients in Rio de Janeiro has risen to at least 10.The fire department on Friday also said four firefighters were hospitalized after battling the blaze at Badim Hospital and that about 90 patients were transferred to other medical facilities.Authorities are investigating the cause of the fire Thursday night, which forced staff to evacuate patients and temporarily settle some on sheets and mattresses in the street.Staffers in surgical masks wheeled medical equipment in the road as smoke billowed from the building.Television images showed medical workers tending to some patients sitting in wheelchairs with IV poles beside them in the street. Elderly and intensive care patients were among those rescued.AP

                    China routs Russia 3-0 at Women's Volleyball World Cup

                YOKOHAMA, Japan - China stormed past Russia 25-22, 25-16, 25-18 here on Monday to record its third straight win at the FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup.China bested Russia in attack (51-39), blocks (8-7), reception (16-9), and especially in serves (7-0), thanks to setter Ding Xia's four aces.Captain Zhu Ting returned to China's starting line-up after she was rested for the match against Cameroon and scored 21 points. Wing spiker Zhang Changning contributed 17."We prepared a lot for this match and I'm happy we could win," Zhang said at a press conference. "I knew I had some shortcomings technically and I paid extra attention to them during training sessions. Today I showed on court what I have been practising, and hope I can keep making progress."Irina Voronkova had a team-high 11 points for Russia, while Nataliya Goncharova, who had 31 points in her team's 3-2 victory over Japan on Sunday, was limited to nine points."We will take this competition as an opportunity to test our own strength as we prepare for the Olympics," said Russia captain Evgeniya Startseva, with both Russia and China having secured places at Tokyo 2020.The match was intense from the beginning with Voronkova firing for Russia while Zhang led China's attacking line. The deadlock was broken after Zhang scored four points in an 8-1 run to help China into an 18-12 lead, and the defending champion claimed the set 25-22 with Yuan Xinyue's spike.China had a dream 8-2 opening in the second set. Although Voronkova and Kseniia Parubets gave China's defense a stern challenge, China was unstoppable, with six players contributing points, and the 25-16 win was sealed after captain Zhu netted four points in a row.The third set became an attacking exhibition for Zhang and Zhu while Gong Xiangyu and Yan Ni were solid in their blocking. The match lost suspense after a 5-0 run saw China surge ahead 18-10 and the Rio Olympic champions triumphed 25-18 in one hour and 18 minutes."It is always tough playing against Russia. Their players are tall and very strong in front of the net. We had careful preparation before this match, and we were good in serve and reception," Chinese coach Lang Ping said.China will play the Dominican Republic on Wednesday while Russia now face South Korea.
