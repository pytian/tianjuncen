                Red tourism rising
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                 Millions of visitors are flocking to the birthplace of the revolution, creating business opportunities to lift villagers out of poverty. Zhang Yangfei reports from Ji'an, Jiangxi province. A dozen "soldiers" tossed fake grenades into the target area, climbed over a wall made of tires and zigzagged nimbly to avoid touching white ropes meant to simulate a "rain of gunfire".The scene might look like a military drill, but it was a dozen university students reliving a day of the Red Army. The event was part of a summer boot camp they attended to learn the history of the Chinese revolution in its birthplace, Jinggangshan, Jiangxi province.The city offers a number of experiences to bring alive the difficulties the Red Army faced in the late 1920s.The students are attracted by so-called "Red Education", and are among more than 10 million tourists who travel to Jinggangshan every year to experience its role in the revolution.The massive number of visitors and limited amount of accommodations is helping lift the largely rural population out of poverty.The hotels around the main attractions offer no more than 20,000 beds, which means homestays have huge potential to meet demand, according to Liu Jiguang, Party secretary of Dalong township."We have red stories backed by the 5A-level tourist spot (classification), we have green ecology. These are the best conditions to develop rural tourism, so we don't lack customers," he said.In Bashang village, Xiao Fumin, 66, and his wife are among the beneficiaries of the tourism boom.The couple, who run a homestay, expect the students in their house after the reenactment is completed. They will be fed a rustic meal stir-fried in a big wok on a wood-fire stove and served in the kitchen. "Students of all grades, from primary school to university, from all over the country come to my house every year," Xiao said. "In 2016, we received more than 800."Before 2016, Xiao's family struggled financially.His daughter was diagnosed with the kidney disease uremia in 2013 and the high medical expenses dragged the family into debt. "She took the medicine for a couple of years but we couldn't afford better treatment so she passed away," he said.In the entrance to Xiao's house, a plate issued by the local government hangs on the main door. It reads: "This family is in difficulty due to their daughter's disease. They have a monthly overdraft and annual extra medical costs of 20,000 yuan ($2,786). Personal wish: they want to buy a gas stove."

                    Costco cuts Shanghai debut short as shoppers jam store
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The world's second-largest retailer, Costco Wholesale Corp, got an exceptionally warm welcome from consumers when its first brick-and-mortar store on the Chinese mainland opened in Shanghai on Tuesday. Despite the store's location in suburban Shanghai, with no close public transportation, consumers in Shanghai and from neighboring cities flooded in before its 9 am opening. At 1 pm, the store put up a notice saying it had suspended sales due to the heavy crowds. Costco did not disclose the number of customers who visited the store on Tuesday. Jason Yu, general manager of market consultancy Kantar Worldpanel China, said the quality and good prices of Costco's food products are a major attraction to Chinese consumers, since the demand for such products has grown. The retailer could bolster its fresh food offerings to increase its customer retention here, Yu said. "As Chinese consumers put more stress on healthy products and higher living standards, the retail industry's growth has remained robust in China and the momentum will continue," he said. Wang Caidi, a 57-year-old retiree in Shanghai, left the store with avocados, cheese, milk and a pizza. She said quality foods enticed her to travel the 40 kilometers to the store. "The products are of good value. I may come here one month later when it is less crowded," she said. Membership at Costco Shanghai has been available since July 1, with an annual membership card priced at 299 yuan ($42). The company put its Chinese membership at over 120,000. The store, with a shopping area of 14,000 square meters, is located in suburban Minhang district, nearly 30 km from the city's center. Richard Zhang, Costco's senior vice-president for Asia, said on Aug 20 that the location was influenced by the presence of seven international schools in the area, indicating a large group of middle-class consumers who are Costco's targets. He also said that the market has matured sufficiently for Chinese consumers to be "ready to pay for a membership card". Little effort was spent on educating the market about membership. Costco is the world's largest membership-only retailer. Walmart, the world's largest retailer, has opened 26 membership-based Sam's Club stores in China. The latest was opened in northern Shanghai in June, only 10 km from Costco Shanghai. While membership-based hypermarkets have been successful, other overseas retailers have mostly received a cold shoulder from Chinese consumers. The acquisition by local retailer Suning.com of an 80 percent stake in French supermarket giant Carrefour's China holdings was given the green light on Monday by China's State Administration for Market Regulation. In March, German retailer Metro was reported to be selling its Chinese business, with Tencent and Alibaba among potential buyers. shijing@chinadaily.com.cn  Shoppers in Shanghai line up at the first Costco outlet on the Chinese mainland on Tuesday, its opening day.Gao Erqiang / China Daily(China Daily Global 08/28/2019 page1)

                    Spain's Basque region entices professionals in Brexit Britain
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Spain's Basque Country is the latest corner of Europe ready to seize on Brexit with hopes of luring back skilled Spanish nationals as well as British professionals when the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.With its economy bouncing back from a long recession, the autonomous region of Northern Spain wants to entice workers with perks such as income tax rebates of up to 35 percent for skilled professionals who relocate to the region.Other incentives include a range of support networks to help those considering relocating, from renting a house to finding the right school for their children.According to Bizkaia Talent, a nonprofit organization that coordinates talent outreach policies for the Biscay Government, there has been than a threefold increase in interest in the Basque Country's relocation and career packages since 2016.Biscay is one of the provinces that make up the autonomous community, along with Alava and Gipuzkoa.The recruitment organization also noted that 10 percent of those that expressed interest in the Basque outreach program during a recruitment conference last year in London relocated to the region within three months.The Basque region government can make concessions due to its unique autonomy, which gives them powers over areas such as tax, policing, transportation and industry.Basque is Spain's fifth largest regional economy, with a gross domestic product of 66.1 billion euros, accounting for around 7 percent of the national GDP, Reuters reported.According to the Office of National Statistics, there are 150,000 Spanish nationals residing in the UK, approximately half of them between the ages 20 and 39.Statistics also show that there were 293,500 British citizens living in Spain and it remains the most popular destination for British nationals in the EU.Salvador Acha, a research fellow and project manager in the Faculty of Engineering at Imperial College London, is considering a move to Basque following the referendum and the increased uncertainty surrounding Brexit. He has been living in the UK for 12 years after arriving from Mexico.He fears coming out of the EU will lead to research funding cuts as well as problems of retaining academic staff and attracting young engineers if the UK is no longer thought of as a good destination."With my background in engineering, (Basque) does have a solid cluster of engineering firms, especially in manufacturing and energy," Acha said. "The companies are quite international, highly competitive and they do quite a lot of business in China, Europe and Latin America."Iker Fernandez de Larrea, a former engineer at Airbus, an aerospace and defense company, relocated from the UK to the Basque Country in January and so far, has no regrets."After Brexit, the economic situation was getting worse for us Europeans living in the UK. At the end of the day, and thanks to having a highly qualified job, I was able to save some of my monthly earnings," Fernandez de Larrea said. "Furthermore, things were starting to become more complicated in terms of paperwork and social stability, so I decided it was a good time for returning back home."Ivan Jimenez, manager director of Bizkaia Talent, explained that during the last financial crisis, Basque Country lost many young, highly educated people and was left with a shortage of talent.Coupled with one of the oldest populations in Europe, Biscay recruiters are now using Brexit to attract highly skilled and young professionals to the region searching for those in academia to banking and finance and also transport and communications.Jimenez highlighted the importance of the region's manufacturing sector, one of the main drivers in the Basque economy, with automotive, aeronautical and tool machinery as its key industries."We are very focused on industry which represents 24 percent of our GDP. The region also produced 50 percent of automotive supplies in Spain," Jimenez said.So far, around 740 UK-based professionals are engaged in talks about relocating within the Basque Country network.Asier Alea, director of tourism and foreign promotion of the Biscay government, said Bilbao, the de facto capital of the Basque Country, is enjoying a bright economy and industry."We are one of the main hubs of Europe. We are very well connected with main European hubs with our airport to the UK, Netherlands, France, etc," he said, noting while tax incentives are very attractive, the Basque Country is also home to the second-most Michelin-starred restaurants in the world.Basque Country is not the only region wanting to attract the UK workers after Brexit, with the likes of Frankfurt, Dublin and Paris courting the financial sector and countries such as Italy, Portugal and the Netherlands offering income tax breaks.

                    Stores offer 'experiences' to fend with internet
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Spending a Saturday afternoon shopping at a US department store used to be a favorite pastime in America. But stepping foot in a store has long been replaced with point-and-click from the comfort of home or anywhere.The shift in consumer behavior in favor of online buying knocked down sales at US department stores 20 percent from 2017 to 2018, according to the US Census Bureau.Now, American department stores — and many stores throughout the world — are trying to reinvent themselves, seeking to offer consumers something they can't get from Amazon or other online sellers: an experience.They are combining digital technology with meaningful experiences to draw shoppers into their stores. Some, like Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's in New York City, are spending millions to make existing stores more attractive."Retailers must adapt to a new technology-enhanced environment or go under. Stores (and shopping centers) must get creative to offer enticing experiences that will get consumers off-line and in the stores,'' Mary Gilly, a professor of marketing at the University of California-Irvine Paul Merage School, told China Daily.In Plano, Texas, a store called Neighborhood Goods is showcasing what the future of retail shopping might look like, according to The Wall Street Journal.Customers talk with a brand ambassador' about what they would like to buy while sipping on a specially prepared cocktail from a cafe. Customers can complete a purchase using an app and have their purchases delivered by a sales assistant, who knows their in-store location.The store has no cash registers, and shoppers must scan a barcode to buy things. There is also the option to buy out-of-stock items in-store and have the product delivered home."Some retailers (Nordstrom, for example) are using their online site to build traffic to their real-life stores. When consumers come to the bricks-and-mortar store to pick up items they've ordered online, there is always the opportunity to attract them to other purchases, Gilly said.Nordstrom also lets customers in some stores make returns by dropping their items into a box and walking out — no human interaction required.Macy's shares are down 35 percent so far this year after dismal second-quarter earnings. But the department store is testing new concepts to increase in-store traffic, including Market @ Macy's, launched last year at the Manhattan store.It is a pop-up retail experience that offers new and existing brands a chance to showcase their goods in the store.To capture customers, Macy's and J.C. Penney announced a partnership with the resale marketplace thredUp in August. The deal will see the department stores sell used clothes and accessories at some of their branches.It comes as buying secondhand clothes, shoes and bags gains momentum among younger shoppers, who are more conscious of recycling.Bloomingdale's (owned by Macy's), Urban Outfitters and Ann Taylor are launching services that will let customers rent clothes. Walmart, the world's largest retailer, has embraced "omnichannel'' retail, which blends online and in-store channels to let customers order by text at Walmart.com for same-day deliveries. The service is called Jetblack.Neiman Marcus' "Snap Find Shop" app' allows customers to take a picture of an item in the store and look for it or similar items online, seamlessly blending online and offline shopping.Make-up store Sephora's mobile app lets users sample makeup by placing filters over their live selfies to see what it would look like on their face before heading into the store to buy it.Target's app allows customers to shop in-store and then get a discount on, for example, beauty items, by scanning the items into the app and then paying for the goods at a cash register.Other ways department stores are taking advantage of technology include using social media to market their brands and promotions, and sending digital coupons.In-store facial recognition technology is being deployed in several big-box retailers to map out where customers like to stand and where they go after entering the store to determine layouts, according to Forbes.Big stores realize that they must use their selling points – location, size and scale – to offer "experiences" to entice shoppers, says one expert.Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, a data analytics and consulting company, told China Daily: "Department stores need to innovate and think about the services people want from a modern-day shop. This goes beyond selling products and involves concepts like food service, beauty spas, classes and events."Essentially, they need to differentiate and think of new things to bring customers in. Working with third parties is one of the solutions, but department stores need to do most innovation on their own so they can reap full rewards," he said.The consequence of getting it wrong means many more stores will either go belly-up or be forced to close branches, data from Coresight Research shows.At least 7,500 stores will close this year — including Dressbarn, Pier 1, Gap and others – according to Coresight Research. It predicts that that number could increase to 12,000 by year-end.Another problem for department stores is that some big brands are pulling out.Ralph Lauren closed about a quarter of its US department store distributions last year. Michael Kors, Coach and others also have announced plans to pull back from their dependence on department stores, preferring to use online stores."In many ways, the fate of department stores is in their own hands, and one of the issues is that too many of the chains have not properly invested and evolved their concepts as customer demands have changed," he said.

                A Beijing-based travel summit is building partnerships with overseas agencies and discussing ways of enticing more tourists to visit the mainland, Yang Feiyue reports.Nimesha Sarangi made her 40th trip to China in August. Working in outbound-tourism operations for Sri Lankan travel agency Jetwing Holidays means she has been dealing with the Chinese market since 2011."I've been to many places across the country, especially Beijing," Sarangi says."Whenever there's a new destination or hotel, I'll come and learn about it and then promote it among the people back in my country."Business has been good at her agency."We've seen a 10 to 20 percent growth every year over the past few years," Sarangi says.Just a few weeks ago, she traveled with 80 tourists from Sri Lanka to Beijing.Sarangi expects to bring about 2,000 travelers to the capital this year."They love to travel here because of the Great Wall and the Forbidden City," Sarangi says."Shopping and local food are also on their list of favorite things to do."Direct flights connecting Sri Lanka to Beijing and the welcoming nature of Chinese people have also helped fuel the Sri Lankans' enthusiasm to travel to the capital, she says.Sarangi is among the 60 overseas travel-service providers, who attended the Beijing Tourism Global Distribution Partnership Summit in late August.The summit was hosted by Beijing's municipal culture and tourism bureau with the aim of developing a global network of travel-business partners for Beijing to boost its inbound tourism.The summit was launched in 2018 and aspires to reach 100 foreign travel partners within three years."We keep them updated on tourism resources (in Beijing) for free on a regular basis so they can promote them on platforms in their respective markets," says Cao Pengcheng, deputy director of the Beijing's culture and tourism bureau.The partners will also be invited to experience unique travel experiences in Beijing every year, in addition to joining events like the summit."This way, they can come up with better tourism products based on the requirements of travelers from their countries," Cao says.

                    Changing patterns of retail consumption

                Rising demand for high-end products fueling big growth opportunities for companies in ChinaEditor's note: As the 70th National Day of China on Oct 1 approaches, China Daily's special business stories will explain how various industries have upgraded over the years on the back of a more open economy. Here, we recount how consumption upgrade has helped transform the nation's commercial landscape. Next up will be special stories on the latest developments in fields like e-payments, telecommunications, capital markets, real estate and insurance.Ryne Fang had to wait for seven days to visit the new Costco outlet in Shanghai, as overcrowding had forced the membership-only US warehouse retailer to suspend sales early for the first few days."It was a rainy day when I finally went to the store. There was a much shorter waiting time on that day," said the 30-year-old Fang, who had become a registered member several months ahead of the official store opening on Aug 27."I bought my favorite roast chicken for 29.8 yuan ($4.15), a six-pack muffin with nuts, Kirkland Signature nuts and giant jars of jam. The products are of good quality and are really value for money. That is also why there are such huge crowds. For shoppers like me, the inaugural membership fee of 199 yuan was a promise of that trust," said Fang.Jason Yu, general manager of Kantar Worldpanel China, a market research firm, believes that the resounding demand for Costco products is a clear indicator of the changing consumption patterns in China."The crowds at the Costco outlet indicate that consumption demand from affluent Chinese consumers remains robust," said Yu.According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the share of consumption in the overall output value has been climbing steadily for the last eight years.Total retail sales of consumer goods amounted to 38.1 trillion yuan in 2018, compared with 2.77 billion yuan in 1952, or an annual growth rate of 11.6 percent, according to the NBS. Domestic consumption was one of the main triggers for higher economic growth in the country and made up 76.2 percent of the gross domestic product.Yu, who has been tracking the Chinese retail industry for more than two decades, said consumption has risen as consumers are now more than willing to spend money on quality products. That was not the case in 2000 when consumers were more cost-conscious. Since then the market has grown rapidly in terms of retail offerings and quantity, while brands are willing to spend more to attract consumers, he said.Demand for fast-moving consumer goods has fallen sharply in the last five years in China, with the growth rates tapering off from the double-digit levels to 5 percent currently, an indication of the change in growth, demand patterns, according to data from Kantar."Chinese consumers want diverse, quality products, and a nice consumption environment," said Yu, adding that spending on health, convenience and personalized lifestyle products has risen.Demand for high-end products has grown by 6 percent between 2015 and 2018 in the country, fueled largely by rising per capita disposable income, urbanization and consumption upgrades. The desire to lead quality lives is not restricted to the younger generation as several of the frugal retired population are now not averse to spending money on high-quality products.Li Guixia, a retired professor from Peking University, first came to Beijing in 1970. She remembered spending 4 yuan every month on groceries - basically a soap, towel and tomatoes. In the 1980s, she had to save money for several years to buy her first fridge for 800 yuan, which was equivalent to six months of her salary then.In recent decades, Li, who is now 69, has traveled with her family to neighboring countries and regions in Southeast Asia and last year went to Perth in Australia for a tour."We bought an apartment, upgraded our car and now I get to see the world," said Li."Many of those between 50 and 70 years old are misunderstood as savers, not spenders. They actually want to have the lifestyle they could not when they were young. With property and savings, they are now more than willing to spend on products like fine wines, olive oil and pet food, as well as travel and education," Yu said.Young people in urban areas who have a fast-paced work life are seen as the backbone for imported and niche products, health-related and even night economies. Young consumers in small towns with more disposable income are found to have a preference for high-end domestic brands.In terms of where to buy products, Yu said though online shopping is the most-preferred source for high-end consumption, traditional channels such as brick-and-mortar supermarkets are still relevant for several daily consumers. The online-and-offline omni channels have stimulated the market growth, offering more convenience and more consumption power to shoppers. More than 63 percent of shoppers have spent money on multiple consumption channels, according to a Kantar's report on consumption trend in China.Technology-savvy Chinese consumers have contributed to the growth of Chinese e-commerce platforms like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and JD over the last two decades, on the back of fast deliveries, low costs and convenient user experiences.E-commerce is now a major driver of China's retail economy, accounting for almost one-fifth of the country's total retail sales in 2018, according to the NBS.Online retailers have created shopping festivals to unlock consumer desire and tap the consumption potential. Since 2009, Alibaba, founded in 1999 by Jack Ma and now the largest retail commerce company in the world in terms of gross merchandise volume, has transformed the date of Nov 11, also known as Singles Day, into the world's biggest online shopping carnival by offering attractive discounts and coupons to entice consumers.During last year's Singles Day shopping spree, sales on Alibaba's online marketplace Tmall broke its own record by racking up 213.5 billion yuan in just 24 hours, up 27 percent on a yearly basis.It was a similar story during this year's midyear retail carnival, spearheaded by JD. The company reported sales of 201.5 billion yuan for this year's June 18 shopping gala, which ran from June 1 to 18, compared with 159.2 billion yuan during the same period in 2018.Online operators have gradually expanded their territory offline and altered retail landscapes by coining the term "New Retail" to create a seamless shopping experience so that consumers can shop whenever and wherever they want.Meanwhile, China's cross-border e-commerce sector has been growing exponentially over the last few years, as demand from the country's middle-income shoppers is becoming increasingly diversified and personalized.The Shanghai-based Fang said she was willing to visit Costco frequently if she gets better prices for imported products along with lesser waiting times."I hope they open more stores in the future and also sell some of their products online," Fang said."With the ongoing consumption upgrade in China, consumers are showing a preference for high-quality and imported products," said Cao Lei, director of the China E-Commerce Research Center, adding the integration of both online and offline retail businesses will be a trend.

                Island tourism is luring a growing number of Chinese travelers, Yang Feiyue reports.About a third of outbound Chinese travelers opt for island destinations, according to a report by the International Islands Tourism Conference in Zhejiang province's Zhoushan in late August.That's as outbound travel from China increased nearly 15 percent to 150 million visits.About 70 islands in China and overseas have become major destinations for Chinese, the report says. Over 40 percent of them generate at least a fifth of their GDP from tourism."Island tourism enables people to enjoy nature and improve health," Zhejiang's vice-governor, Cheng Yuechong, told the conference hosted by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, and Zhejiang's government.Tourism players from 24 countries and regions attended to discuss cooperation and seek ways to better tap islands' potential."We hope to strengthen exchanges with well-known island destinations around the world and jointly develop a high-quality island-tourism industry," Cheng says.A total of 21 project agreements, involving nearly 50 billion yuan ($6.9 billion), were signed at the conference.

                Participants of the Belt and Road Media Community have agreed to promote media exchanges and bring more award-winning programs, documentaries and reports about countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative.They made the announcement during the community's 2019 summit forum, held in Beijing from Monday to Wednesday.The community is the world's first coalition aiming to promote media ties for countries involved in the initiative, which was forwarded by China's central leadership in 2013. Members of the community include 130 institutions from 58 nations and regions."The community will help enhance people-to-people exchanges and mutual understanding for countries involved in the initiative, and we'll be seeing even more enticing stories and better ties and convergence," said Wang Xiaohui, deputy head of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.A governing council of 29 media and production outlets from 23 countries and regions was also set up at the summit, aiming to promote cooperation in various areas, including news production and media industry alignment.Shen Haixiong, president of China Media Group and head of the council, said that over the past three years there have been concrete results coming out of international cooperation across the board."China Media Group and the community hope to engage more people and create a bright future for global media," he said.Abdelrahim Suleiman Ahmed Elkheir, secretary-general of Arab Broadcasting Union, another member of the newly established council, said: "I think this is a great and very timely project, especially with all kinds of new technology coming along right now."I also anticipate more in-depth cooperation between Arab and Chinese media. This will benefit everyone."
