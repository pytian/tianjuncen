                Consumer boycotts, canceled tours, poor sales of automobiles among trade conflict's impactsJapan's decisions to tighten controls on exports of some materials to South Korea and remove the country from its "white list" of preferential trading partners has created a backlash, and the trade dispute between the two is hitting their businesses hard.In addition, South Korean consumers are boycotting Japanese goods and canceling tours to Japan.Airfares from Japan to Seoul are in a free fall this month, with one-way fares from smaller Japanese cities as cheap as 1,000 yen ($9.30), and 1,500 yen from major hubs Kansai International Airport and Narita International Airport, before taxes and fuel surcharges - roughly 60 to 80 percent less than a year ago, according to AirPlus, operator of the Ena budget ticket site.Large South Korean carriers such as Korean Air Lines and Asiana Airlines have reduced or suspended service to Japanese destinations due to a sharp drop in the number of South Koreans visiting Japan.Japanese companies have also faced consumer boycotts in South Korea of products ranging from cars to beer.According to the Financial Times, Nissan Motor Co is considering pulling out of South Korea, citing poor sales and ongoing financial losses as the main reasons.The Japanese carmaker sold just 58 vehicles in South Korea in August, down 88 percent from a year ago, according to the Korea Automobile Importers & Distributors Association.At a news conference in Tokyo on Monday, Hiroaki Nakanishi, the chairman of the Japan Business Federation, warned that Japanese companies continue to face major risks stemming from heightened tensions with South Korea and the uncertain outlook for Britain's exit from the European Union.South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in a show of his administration's resolve to support the domestic production of major industrial materials amid the trade dispute with Japan, said on Tuesday that enhancing competitiveness on industrial materials, component parts and other technological equipment is a "strategic task for (becoming) an economic powerhouse".It's a "matter of establishing the foundation of the South Korean economy, beyond the level of South Korea-Japan relations," he said at a meeting in Seoul at the Post-Silicon Semiconductor Institute of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology.The Post-Silicon Semiconductor Institute has mapped out a blueprint for South Korea's industries, including shipbuilding, steel and automobiles, which led to the miraculous growth of Seoul from 1953 to 1996.Moon considers the nurturing of local suppliers as a mid - to long-term solution, Yonhap News Agency said.The South Korean government is planning to spend 5 trillion won ($4.2 billion) on related projects over the next three years, according to Yonhap.Japan's removal of South Korea from its "white list" of preferred trading partners went into effect last month, in addition to restrictions it placed on exports of key resource materials for smartphones and smartphone displays to South Korean companies in July.In a tit-for-tat move, South Korea also removed Japan from its list of trusted trading partners.Kimura Kan, a professor at Kobe University, wrote in an article published on nippon.com, "Both Seoul and Tokyo keep upping the ante in the expectation that Washington will ultimately settle the dispute in their favor."US foreign affairs experts are worried that the Japan-South Korean dispute will deal a blow to the US alliance with the two countries.Seoul has decided to scrap a 2016 intelligence-sharing pact with Tokyo, saying that the pact did not comport with South Korea's national interest.In Foreign Affairs magazine, Bonnie S. Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and Oriana Skylar Mastro, assistant professor at Georgetown University, wrote that for more than half a century, US power in Asia has rested on the alliance system that Washington built in the years after World War II. "Now, a dispute between Japan and South Korea ... threatens to undo decades of progress."Amid worsening bilateral ties over wartime history, trade and territorial disputes, nationalist sentiment is growing on both sides.On August 31, six South Korean lawmakers visited the islets controlled by Seoul and claimed by Tokyo - known as Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan - in part to protest Japanese curbs on shipments of essential components to South Korea.In response, Hodaka Maruyama, a lawmaker from a Japanese opposition party, wrote in a tweet, "Isn't war the only way to get them back?"In a Cabinet reshuffle on Wednesday, outgoing Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono was shifted to the defense portfolio, a move that the Japan Times said was "seen as reinforcing Tokyo's hard line toward Seoul".caihong@chinadaily.com.cn(China Daily Global 09/12/2019 page1)

                    S. Korea asks IOC to ban 'rising sun' flag at 2020 Tokyo Olympics
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                SEOUL - South Korea's sports ministry on Wednesday made an official request to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ban the so-called 'rising sun' flag from being flown at next year's Tokyo Olympic Games.The rising sun flag, which was used by the Imperial Japan's army and is currently used by Japan's self-defense forces, is widely seen in Korea as a symbol of Japan's imperialism and militarism.In the letter to the IOC, the Seoul ministry noted that the rising sun flag had been used by the Japanese military from the late 19th century until the Pacific War and Imperial Japan's invasion of other Asian countries. It is currently used by Japan's far-right activists to express discrimination and hatred, according to the letter.The letter added that just as the swastika of the Nazi flag reminds people in Europe of the atrocities of World War Two, the rising sun flag reminds people in Asia, including South Koreans, of historical scars and pain suffered at the hands of Japanese invaders.The Tokyo Olympic organizing committee had already rejected the South Korean Olympic committee's request to ban the use of the flag, prompting Seoul to express deep concern and disappointment to the IOC.The South Korean ministry has called for the IOC to play an active role in prohibiting the flying of the flag at the upcoming Olympics, emphasizing that it runs counter to the Olympic spirit of world peace and love for mankind.
