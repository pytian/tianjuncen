                ZHENGZHOU - President Xi Jinping has called for concerted efforts to protect and develop the Yellow River basin while chairing a symposium Wednesday during his inspection tour to Henan Province.Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, stressed strengthened coordination in the comprehensive management of the Yellow River basin to promote high-quality development.Calling for strengthened protection of the ecological environment of the Yellow River basin, Xi said that differences between the upper, middle and lower reaches of the river should be fully considered, given that the Yellow River ecosystem is an organic whole.Further efforts should be made to ensure the long-term stability of the Yellow River, Xi said, stressing that although the river has not seen major dangers for many years, we should not relax vigilance.Xi also stressed better use of water resources, with rational planing of the population, urban and industrial development to resolutely curb unreasonable water demand.When pursuing high-quality development in the region, authorities should actively explore new ways with regional characteristics and participate in the construction of Belt and Road to promote higher level of opening-up, Xi noted.Meanwhile, Xi called for preserving, inheriting and carrying forward the Yellow River culture."The Yellow River culture, as an important part of the Chinese civilization, is the root and soul of the Chinese nation," Xi said, calling for telling well the "Yellow River story" to pool spiritual strength for the realization of the Chinese dream of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

                ZHENGZHOU - Chinese President Xi Jinping called for concerted efforts to promote ecological protection and high-quality development of the Yellow River.Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks while chairing a symposium Wednesday during his inspection tour to Henan province."The protection of the Yellow River is critical to the great rejuvenation and sustainable development of the Chinese nation," said Xi, adding that it is a major national strategy.Noting that the peace of the Yellow River is significant to the stability of China, Xi said Chinese people have struggled against the floods and droughts of the Yellow River since ancient times, and the Party and the state have attached great importance to the harnessing and development of the Yellow River after the founding of New China in 1949.Originating in Qinghai province, the Yellow River, known as China's "Mother River" and the cradle of the Chinese civilization, runs through nine provinces and autonomous regions including Shaanxi and Henan before emptying into the Bohai Sea in East China's Shandong province.The river got its name Huanghe in Chinese because of its yellow, muddy water, which appears as it runs through the Loess Plateau in Northwest China.The 5,464-km-long waterway feeds about 12 percent of China's population, irrigates about 15 percent of arable land, supports 14 percent of national GDP, and supplies water to more than 60 cities.Xi also pointed out difficulties and problems in protecting the Yellow River, including fragile ecological environment, severe condition of the water resources preservation and development quality that needs to be improved.
