                Threat of no-deal Brexit fades away after Lords debate
            </p>
            <p>
                Upper chamber to return legislation to MPs by end of the weekThe bill ruling out the possibility of a no-deal Brexit should complete its passage through all stages of Parliament by the end of the week after an agreement was reached in Britain's upper chamber, the House of Lords, to return it to the House of Commons for approval by the close of business on Friday.There had been fears that Conservative members of the Lords would filibuster, or deliberately slow down, proceedings to hold up its legislative passage, with the debate going on long into the night. The Liberal Democrats' leader in the Lords was even pictured turning up at the House with a duvet and shaving kit, but in the end an agreement was reached in the early hours of the morning."It has been quite a night. It has been a long debate – and I am grateful to the noble Lords who have stayed the course – it shows the importance of the work we do but also the issue on which we are debating," said Labour's leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith."I am grateful that we are now able to confirm that we will be able to complete all stages of the bill in a time-honored way by 5 pm Friday."This means it could be returned to the House of Commons and MPs can vote on it one last time on Monday, before it is presented to the Queen for royal assent, ahead of the chamber being shut down for five weeks.This extended shutdown coincides with the annual conferences of all the major parties, but it caused outrage when it was called by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a now-failed bid to restrict the time available for rebel MPs to block a possible no-deal Brexit.The news from the Lords is another blow for Johnson, whose first week as prime minister following the summer recess has seen a succession of defeats.On Tuesday night, a rebellion by 21 of his own Conservative MPs saw the government lose control of the parliamentary legislative process, and resulted in the rebel MPs, including former chancellors of the exchequer Philip Hammond and Kenneth Clarke, the longest-serving member in Parliament, being thrown out of the party.Following this defeat, MPs then voted for the first time on the legislation to prevent a no-deal Brexit, and despite having long protested that he did not want to call a general election before Brexit was delivered, Johnson was then forced to seek MPs' backing for one – but he failed to secure the two-thirds of the house required, largely because of Labour members failing to vote.They do not want an election until the prospect of no deal is utterly eliminated by statute, because an election before that happens might throw Johnson a lifeline, with him potentially securing public support for Brexit by whatever means, enabling him to deliver his long-held promise that Brexit will happen on Oct 31 "do or die, come what may".For that deadline to pass without any progress would hugely damage the new prime minister's authority, and make the Conservatives more vulnerable at any election that could take place at a later date.Even though the prospect of a snap general election has now receded, it has left its mark on Britain's political landscape.According to government figures, on Monday, 52,408 people registered to vote, with another 64,485 applying on Tuesday, the day of the rebel MPs' victory in the Commons, with the majority of those applications thought to be from younger voters, many of whom were too young to have a say in the Brexit referendum of 2016. In the previous month, the typical number of weekday applications was around 27,000.

                LONDON - Britain's Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd resigned from the government on Saturday, saying she cannot stand by while loyal Conservatives are expelled from the party.Earlier this week 21 Conservative lawmakers were ousted from the ruling party after failing to vote with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government."I have resigned from Cabinet and surrendered the Conservative whip," Rudd said on her Twitter account."I cannot stand by as good, loyal moderate Conservatives are expelled. I have spoken to the PM and my association chairman to explain," she added.Reuters

                In new blow, minister quits Johnson govt
            </a>
            <p>
                Rudd, critical of PM's ousting of 21 MPs, also leaves UK's ruling Conservative PartyLONDON－British Prime Minister Boris Johnson received a fresh blow on Saturday when Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd quit from the government and the ruling Conservative Party in protest at his handling of the Brexit crisis.Rudd's resignation caps a miserable week for Johnson as he tries to steer his splintered country through its biggest political crisis since World War II.Rudd was a moderate member of former prime minister Theresa May's government. Johnson coveted Rudd's endorsement during his successful leadership challenge in July.But she said on Saturday that she could no longer support Johnson's approach to negotiations with Brussels－or his handling of domestic politics."I have resigned from Cabinet and surrendered the Conservative Whip," Rudd tweeted."I cannot stand by as good, loyal moderate Conservatives are expelled," she said referring to Johnson's decision to expel 21 MPs from his Conservative party for voting against the government on Brexit.Those expelled included the longest-serving Conservative in Parliament, Ken Clarke, and Nicholas Soames, grandson of World War II Prime Minister Winston Churchill.Rudd said in her resignation letter that she felt uneasy about Johnson's commitment to take the United Kingdom out of the European Union on Oct 31, even if the two sides fail to reach a negotiated deal.The 56-year-old said she had once viewed Johnson's threat of a messy "no-deal" divorce as a useful negotiating tactic to take with Brussels."However, I no longer believe leaving with a deal is the government's main objective," she wrote in her resignation letter."The government is expending a lot of energy to prepare for 'no deal' but I have not seen the same level of intensity go into our talks with the European Union."Johnson has been adamant that he will not seek a third Brexit extension this year. He is instead seeking to hold an early general election on Oct 15 that could give him a mandate to take Britain out on Oct 31 and at any cost.Johnson said earlier that he would "rather be dead in a ditch" than seek a Brexit extension until January that more moderate forces demand.The main opposition Labour Party is plotting a strategy with smaller parliamentary groups that could leave Johnson with no other alternative but to seek an extension to the Brexit talks or resign.They are expected to push through a legislation on Monday, forcing Johnson seek a Brexit delay from Brussels unless he can strike a deal at an EU summit next month.They are also trying to make sure that a general election is held only after Johnson is forced to go back on his word and delay the exit from the EU once again.Johnson has branded the delay bill a "surrender" that would allow the other 27 EU leaders to dictate the terms on which Britain leaves its closest neighbors after 46 years.Both Labour leaders and rebel Conservatives praised Rudd's decision to walk away from Johnson."Everyone has a point beyond which they cannot be pushed," centrist Conservative MP Nick Boles tweeted. "Amber Rudd has reached hers. How much more of the party he inherited will Johnson destroy before he has second thoughts or is stopped by his Cabinet colleagues?"Agencies

                UK PM Johnson vows to get Brexit deal after losing election vote again
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed to secure a divorce deal with the European Union at a crucial summit in October, after lawmakers voted for a second time to reject his bid to hold a snap election.Johnson had wanted to hold an election in mid-October, before a European Union summit on Oct 17 and before the country is due to leave the bloc on Oct 31."This government will press on with negotiating a deal, while preparing to leave without one," Johnson told parliament."I will go to that crucial summit on October the 17th and no matter how many devices this parliament invents to tie my hands, I will strive to get an agreement in the national interest."This government will not delay Brexit any further." Reuters

                British PM Johnson prepares for Brussels showdown in bid to win deal
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed Friday that he will hold a crucial meeting in Brussels on Monday in his latest bid to win a Brexit deal.During a visit on Friday to the county of Yorkshire, Johnson said during a keynote speech that he would be meeting the European Union (EU)'s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday."We will talk about the ideas that we've been working on and we will see where we get. I would say I'm cautiously optimistic," he said, adding that Britain will leave the EU by the Oct. 31 deadline whatever happens."We are working incredibly hard to get a deal. There is the rough shape of a deal to be done. I myself have been to talk to various other EU leaders, particularly in Germany, in France and in Ireland, where we made a good deal of progress," he added.Media reports from mainland Europe indicate that Johnson may face an uphill struggle securing the kind of deal he is seeking to bring Britain out of the bloc.In Yorkshire where he met business leaders and politicians from across northern England, Johnson was also heckled and asked why he wasn't in the Houses of Parliament.It was a reference to Johnson's suspension of the House of Commons, or the lower house, for five weeks, a move criticized by opponents as an attempt of Johnson to stifle debate on Britain's future with the EU.A vote in the House of Commons before its shutdown earlier this week means Johnson will have to ask Brussels to extend Britain's EU membership until Jan. 31 if there is no deal reached by the deadline.Despite warnings that he has to abide by the decision, Johnson has insisted that he will not ask the EU for an extension.On Tuesday, Johnson faces another major hurdle when his decision to suspend, or prorogue the British Parliament, goes before the Supreme Court.Three judges in Scotland have already ruled that the advice Johnson gave to Queen Elizabeth II to secure the British monarch's assent for the suspension was wrong.If the Supreme Court also rules that Johnson's advice was wrong, he will face intense pressure by opposition politicians to immediately recall the parliament rather than wait until Oct. 14 when it is scheduled to reopen.Johnson said Friday that even with the suspension, lawmakers will still have time to debate Brexit before the current Oct. 31 deadline.Although Johnson will meet two of the key figures from the EU side on Monday, political commentators in London said Friday night that the real focus will come on Oct. 17, when he will attend a meeting of the European Council, which is made up of the leaders of the 28 member states of the bloc.
