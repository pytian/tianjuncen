                Brexit differences dominate first day of Labor Party's annual conference
            </p>
            <p>
                LONDON - The National Executive Committee (NEC) of Britain's main opposition Labor Party voted Sunday in favor of a statement outlining how the party would delay a decision on whether to back Britain staying in the European Union until after a general election.As part of a plan, put forward by party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a Labor government would strike a new Brexit deal with the EU and then put it to a public vote. There would be an option on the ballot paper to remain.But the strategy threatens to put Corbyn and the NEC on a collision course with leading front-bench Labor members, including shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry.Thornberry has called on Labor to make a clear statement now that it wants Britain to remain in the EU.The Times in London quoted Thornberry warning that Labor would lose 30 percent of its vote at the next general election unless it adopted an unambiguous pro-Brexit stance.Thornberry said the party would hemorrhage support to minority parties unless it campaigned against Brexit.She was backed by London's Labor mayor Sadiq Khan who said Corbyn must get party managers to get Labor MPs in the House of Commons to campaign to remain in the EU.The crunch will come Monday when thousands of delegates at the conference vote on what the party's Brexit policy should say.The minority Liberal Democrats has already voted at its conference to make its election pledge to keep Britain in the EU if it wins.If Labor does back a policy that could keep Britain in the bloc, it will be seen as the party going head-to-head with Boris Johnson's Conservative Party that has pledged to leave the EU with or without a deal on Oct. 31.The battle over Brexit at the Labor conference dominated the headlines Sunday in the on-line stories for Britain's main newspapers.The Guardian's headline read: "Corbyn heading for clash with Labor members by calling for Brexit decision to be postponed".The Guardian reported that the party's NEC shows that Corbyn's current plan is for a Labor government to negotiate a new Brexit deal within three months of coming to power and then to hold a new referendum. The party would decide at a one-day special conference after the renegotiation on how it would campaign in the new referendum.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meanwhile, arrived in New York Sunday with plans Monday to meet European Council President Donald Tusk, as well as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanual Macron.Media reports in London said they are likely to discuss a series of ideas put forward Thursday by Britain in a bid to break the current Brexit deadlock."This gives the Prime Minister an opportunity to talk to them at leader level about what some of our proposals are," a government spokesperson said in London.The leaders have travelled to the US for a meeting of the United Nation's General Assembly, but talks on Brexit are expected to take place on the sidelines.Johnson is also expected to learn Monday when the British Supreme Court will announce its decision on whether he acted unlawfully by suspending the British parliament for five weeks. The court's president announced Thursday the decision would be announced early in the coming week. Some newspapers in London suggested Sunday that the result could be announced as early as Monday, Sept 23.

                Military uniform exhibition on show in Wuhan
            </a>
            <p>
                The 2019 Wuhan International Military Uniform Exhibition opened Thursday in Wuhan, Hubei province, and will run till Sept 27.Included in the exhibition are hundreds of military uniforms and accessories from different periods, such as original A1 flight jacket issued by the US Naval Air Force in 1927, Australian World War II military uniforms, and the uniform of heroic Chinese pilot Long Qiming of the Flying Tigers.Every piece in the exhibition has its own historical significance.In the years of war, military uniforms improve in style and texture, while during peacetime, uniforms tend more towards functionality.Many of the uniforms have provided inspiration for global brands and the clothing lines seen on international runways.The exhibition, organized by the Jianghan district government of Wuhan, aims to explain the history and culture of military uniforms.It comprises three sections: military uniforms of the early and mid-20th century; military-influenced contemporary fashion; and an exploration of how military uniforms relate to the aesthetics of public life in terms of evolution, etiquette, function and fashion.The exhibition also brings an interactive experience to visitors through advanced technology such as augmented reality AR.Wu Yunru in Beijing contributed to this story.

                EU is 'in no way responsible' for Brexit consequences, Juncker says
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON - The European Union (EU) is "in no way responsible" for the consequences of Brexit, and the bloc should not be held accountable for what is a "British decision," European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Sunday."The European Union is not leaving the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union," Juncker said in an interview with Sky News, which was broadcast on Sunday."The EU is in no way responsible for any kind of consequences entailed by the Brexit," he said."That's a British decision, a sovereign decision that we are respecting but don't try to charge the European Union with the responsibility," he said.The statement came as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is leaving for New York on Sunday to attend the annual high-level debate of the UN General Assembly, and he is expected to use the visit for an informal Brexit summit.Johnson is expected to hold discussions with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and European Council President Donald Tusk on the sidelines of the General Debate of the General Assembly, which is slated to begin on Tuesday at the UN headquarters.Juncker said earlier this week that he was "doing "everything" to help secure a withdrawal agreement because he felt a hard Brexit, or a no-deal Brexit, would be "catastrophic" for both sides."It's better for Britain and for the European Union to have an organised deal," he said.

                NEW YORK - Most people in the English-speaking world are probably aware that people in the United States and United Kingdom have different ways of describing the same thing.A garbage can in the US is a rubbish bin in the UK. A sweater in one is a woolly jumper in the other. A checking account in the US is a current account in Britain.Pants here are always trousers over there. Here you order takeout food; there it's "a takeaway". A truck here is a lorry there. A cookie here is a biscuit there, whether it's chocolate chip or peanut butter.
