                UK military rugby team criticized for visiting Japanese shrine
            </p>
            <p>
                A rugby team drawn from members of the United Kingdom's armed forces has been criticized for reportedly visiting a highly controversial shrine in Japan that honors dead Japanese soldiers, including mass murderers and war criminals.The 27-man team included players from the Parachute Regiment and crew members from the aircraft carrier Queen Elizabeth, according to The Times newspaper, which said they were told off by the UK's ambassador to Japan, Paul Madden.The players had not been aware of the controversy that surrounds the Yasukuni Shrine, which honors all of Japan's war dead, including convicted criminals, as if they are so-called Shinto gods.The UK Armed Forces rugby union team is currently in Japan competing in the International Defence Rugby Cup.The paper said the team hastily removed an online post it had made about the visit and took down a photograph of players smiling in front of the building, which houses a museum that boasts an original Zero fighter plane, a kamikaze submarine, and one of the locomotives from the Thailand-Burma "Death Railway".The 415-kilometer railway celebrated in the museum was built in 1943, when Japanese hegemony saw it colonize much of Asia. The line was constructed by between 180,000 and 250,000 Southeast Asian forced laborers and around 61,000 Allied prisoners of war. The slave laborers were subjected to horrific conditions and around 90,000 civilian laborers and more than 12,000 Allied prisoners died on that project alone.The Mail Online news website said the visit almost caused a "diplomatic incident".The paper said a team organizer said: "It was very, very naive"."We've been told not to visit any more shrines, just in case," the unnamed source said.Many nations, especially in Asia, see the shrine in central Tokyo as extremely distasteful.It was built in 1869 and since been used to commemorate those who have died in the service of Japan. It currently lists the names, origins, birthdates, and places of death of 2,466,532 men, women, and children. Among them are 1,068 convicted war criminals, of whom 14 are A-Class war criminals, which means they were convicted in a court of law of planning, preparing, initiation, or waging war.In recent years, visits to the shrine by Japanese leaders have attracted criticism and it has been shunned by most international visitors.In 2014, Canadian singer Justin Bieber was criticized for visiting the shrine, especially by fans in China and South Korea. He apologized and said he had not realized the significance of the site.In January 2014, a poll by the rightwing newspaper Sankei Shimbun found that only 38.1 percent of respondents thought Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was right to visit the shrine. Some 53 percent disapproved of such visits.Many rugby players and fans are in Japan at the moment for the Rugby World Cup, which runs from Sept 20 to Nov 2.

                Russia-Japan gap remains on peace deal
            </a>
            <p>
                Long-standing territorial dispute continues to be a sticking point on World War II treaty Tokyo and Moscow remain divided on a territorial dispute and negotiations on a peace deal, according to Japanese and Russian media. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia's Far Eastern city of Vladivostok last week to deliver a speech at the fifth Eastern Economic Forum and for a one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Each time the two have met - Thursday was their 27th sit-down - Abe has called on Putin to conclude a World War II peace treaty at an early date. But a dispute over four islands, which Russia calls the Southern Kurils and Japan calls the Northern Territories, has prevented the two countries from signing the peace treaty. Russia took control of the four islets off Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido at the end of the war, and by 1949 it had deported all residents to Japan. Last year, Abe and Putin agreed to accelerate peace treaty talks based on a 1956 joint declaration that mentioned Moscow handing over the two smaller islands - Shikotan and Habomai - to Tokyo once a peace treaty is signed. But the ministerial and working-level negotiations have failed to bridge the gap between the countries regarding the dispute. Japanese news agency Kyodo News said Abe and Putin remained at odds over territorial talks. Russian news agency Interfax also reported that Putin's national security adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said there was a gap in the two leaders' positions on negotiations for a peace treaty. On Thursday, Abe told Putin that he wants to discuss a peace treaty and bilateral and international issues in a forward-looking manner. Speaking at a regional economic forum after talks with Abe, Putin said he sees many challenges before signing a peace treaty, including Japan's security alliance with the United States. "There are issues of a military and defense nature, the issues of security, and here we should take into account the position of third countries and Japan's commitment to third countries, including the US," Putin was quoted by Tass news agency as telling the EEF's plenary session. Putin also said that if the United States deploys missiles to Japan and South Korea, they will cover a considerable part of Russia. Following the nullification of the US-Russia treaty to ban intermediate-range nuclear forces, Washington disclosed a plan to deploy missiles in the Asia-Pacific region. Russia said it is poised to counter such a move. In an editorial, Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun said, "It can be said that the environment has not been ready for Russia to make concessions to Japan on the territorial issue." The two leaders' most recent meeting seems to have produced no decisive movement, resulting only in a commitment to "working with a forward-facing attitude," Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun said. Russia has insisted that Japan recognize the islands' seizure as a legal consequence of WWII's outcome, while Japan considers Russia's move to have been illegal. Last month, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev visited a disputed island known as Iturup in Russian and Etorofu in Japanese. "This is our land," Medvedev declared. Japan filed a formal protest against Medvedev's visit to the island. In 2016, Russia deployed missile systems on Kunashir (known in Japanese as Kunashiri) and Iturup (Etorofu), two of the four disputed islands. A Russian government document obtained by Kyodo News said a new land-to-ship missile system with a range of more than 300 kilometers would be deployed on Paramushir and Matua in the Kuril Islands chain, which also includes four islands claimed by Japan. The plan indicates that Russia places strategic importance on the Kuril Islands in defending the Sea of Okhotsk and its nuclear forces against the United States, Kyodo News said. While the negotiations over the peace treaty are stalled, Japan has been using economic cooperation as an overture to Russia. Russia's economic growth remains sluggish due to prolonged Western sanctions and low crude oil prices. When the two leaders met on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Osaka in June, Abe and Putin agreed on plans to conduct joint economic activities on the islands, with a pilot program for tourism to start in October. caihong@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 09/09/2019 page1)

                Political row with S. Korea starts to hurt Japan
            </a>
            <p>
                TOKYO - Japan's surplus in spending by overseas visitors declined in July from a year earlier as the numbers from South Korea tumbled, a sign the souring bilateral relations are taking a toll on the world's third largest economy.The travel account surplus－or the amount spent in Japan by foreign visitors minus that by Japanese traveling overseas shrank 0.9 percent in July from a year earlier to 229.3 billion yen ($2.1 billion), current account data by the Japanese Ministry of Finance showed on Monday.Japan removed South Korea last month from its whitelist of trusted trading partners, which are given preferential export procedures. In response, Seoul dropped Tokyo off its whitelist of trusted export partners.Japan's decision has prompted a backlash in South Korea, with consumers boycotting Japanese goods and canceling tours to the neighboring country.In July, the number of South Korea visitors dropped by 7.6 percent from a year earlier－and was the lowest in nearly a year, according to Japanese government data.Such a drop is "certainly a factor" in the travel services account, a Japanese Finance Ministry official said. "We are monitoring developments."The decline in the travel account surplus contributed to a 32 percent rise in Japan's service account deficit, the data showed.As a result, Japan's overall current account surplus fell 1.4 percent in the year to July to 1.9999 trillion yen ($18.7 billion), largely in line with economists' median forecast for a surplus of 2.0832 trillion yen.The drop in South Korean tourists is a blow to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's plan to make inbound tourism a pillar of Japan's economic growth, and comes at a time the export-reliant recovery has been hit by slowing global demand and the trade dispute between the United States and China.Since Abe took office in late 2012, foreign visitors to Japan have more than tripled to 30 million people as of 2018, helped by a weaker yen and easing of visa requirements.Abe's government set a target to increase the number of foreign visitors to 40 million by 2020 and 60 million by 2030.South Koreans account for the second largest chunk of visitors to Japan, numbering around 7.1 million in 2017. Next were Chinese at 7.4 million, according to government data.In the balance of payment data since 1996, travel accounts are included in service accounts, which cover transactions for tourism and logistics with other countries.The travel account surplus rose 3 percent, to a record 1.3 trillion yen, from January to June compared to the same period a year earlier, helping the service account balance swing to a surplus for the first time.Japan's current account surplus mainly consists of income gains from foreign direct investments, and services including money spent by overseas travelers, while the trade balance tends to log deficits due to trade frictions and weak global demand.Reuters - Xinhua

                Japan's Abe reshuffles Cabinet in bid to boost public support, retains support of key allies
            </a>
            <p>
                TOKYO - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday reshuffled his cabinet with the hefty revamp aimed at boosting public support while retaining the services of his allies holding similar political views in key ministerial and executive positions.The reshuffle, which followed a shakeup of his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) executive lineup earlier Monday, has seen 17 of the prime minister's 19 cabinet ministers either replaced or reassigned within the government, with as many as 13 new ministers being introduced.Finance Minister Taro Aso, who doubles as deputy prime minister, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga have retained their positions, as they have served as particularly close allies of the prime minister in their respective posts, held since Abe returned to power in 2012.In other key moves, Foreign Minister Taro Kono was picked as defense minister and economic revitalization minister Toshimitsu Motegi was given the foreign minister portfolio.In a move aimed at improving public support for the ruling party, 38-year-old Shinjiro Koizumi, son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, was given a cabinet position and will take up the environment minister portfolio in his first role as a minister.In other moves aimed at shoring up support among his administration, Koichi Hagiuda, executive acting secretary general of the LDP was named education minister, while Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasutoshi Nishimura will now assume the position of economic revitalization minister.Abe named upper house lawmaker Seiko Hashimoto as minister in charge of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, bringing the number of females in his cabinet to two, and from the LDP's junior coalition Komeito ally, Kazuyoshi Akaba has replaced Keiichi Ishii as minister of land, infrastructure, transport and tourism.In a party meeting in the morning, the Japanese premier pledged to achieve a first-ever amendment to the Constitution.Abe also said he wants to establish a new team that can ensure political "stability" and "tackle new challenges."The prime minister earlier Monday also rejigged his executive lineup, with his selections maintaining the backbone at LDP headquarters with the selection of key party influencers.The new lineup saw Toshihiro Nikai retained as secretary-general and Fumio Kishida, a possible successor to Abe when his term as party leader ends in 2021, kept on as the party's Policy Research Council chief.Shunichi Suzuki, meanwhile, will relinquish his post as Olympics Minister, and be reassigned as the chairperson of the LDP's decision-making General Council.Hakubun Shimomura, for his part, will serve as chairperson of the LDP's Election Strategy Committee.Abe's cabinet revamp comes on the heels of a national poll showing on Tuesday the approval rating for the former cabinet had dropped from last month, with the disapproval rate rising.According to the survey conducted by Japan's public broadcaster NHK, the approval rating for Abe's cabinet dropped by one point from last month to stand at 48 percent, while the disapproval rate rose by two points to 33 percent.Those in support of the cabinet said that the administration "seems better than other alternatives," although only 20 percent felt it had the ability to put new policies into effect.As for Abe's trustworthiness, 31 percent of those polled by NHK and were disapproving of the current cabinet said they did not trust the prime minister. An overall 33 percent, meanwhile, were in disapproval of the overall current administration.While Abe is now almost certain of becoming Japan's longest-serving prime minister in November and thus theoretically raising his chances of achieving his career-led goal of amending Japan's pacifist Constitution, NHK's poll showed that only 5 percent of respondents felt that this was an important policy issue that the new cabinet should tackle.For Abe's and the LDP's singular objective of amending the Japanese Constitution to ostensibly allow the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) a bigger footprint on the global stage in a significant departure from Japan's long-held and revered pacifist stance, a two thirds majority will be needed on the issue in both houses of Japan's bicameral parliament.Thereafter, a simple majority will be needed to be achieved in a national referendum, successes in both of which will still remain an uphill struggle for Abe and other pro-amendment forces within the ruling camp considering ongoing resistance in parliament and the public's opposition to the move, as was shown in July's upper house election results.

                Japanese PM taps new Cabinet ministers to freshen image
            </a>
            <p>
                Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe brought in new foreign and defense ministers on Wednesday, and appointed a rising political star as environment minister in a Cabinet reshuffle as he prepares for a tax hike in October and aims to revise the nation's pacifist Constitution.Emphasizing his new cabinet is characterized by "stability and challenges", Abe retained key allies and heavyweights while introducing 13 new ministers."This is a lineup to push hard for a new era nation-building," Abe said at a news conference after a certification ceremony at the Japanese Imperial Palace."From now on there will only be challenges, and I will always carry out bold reforms as a challenger," he said.Former economy minister Toshimitsu Motegi was appointed as the new foreign minister, seen as a promotion for his recent work in achieving a trade deal with the United States as the top negotiator.The 63-year-old lawmaker is a Harvard-educated political veteran who worked as a McKinsey consultant before winning a lower house seat in 1993.Consequently, outgoing foreign minister Taro Kono was shifted to the defense portfolio, in a move seen as reinforcing Tokyo's hard line toward South Korea at a time of worsening ties between the two allies of the United States.An eye-catching appointment on Wednesday was former Japanese prime minster Junichiro Koizumi's 38-year-old son, Shinjiro Koizumi, who was named environment minister. He is the third youngest Cabinet minister since the end of World War II in a country where seniority is prioritized in many sectors including politics.As a rising political star, Koizumi had long enjoyed intense media spotlight in Japan with the latest focusing on his marriage to television broadcaster Christel Takigawa, which was announced by the prime minister's office.Concerning Koizumi's appointment, Abe said, "We are looking forward to innovative initiatives unique to younger people on global issues such as marine plastics and climate change."Although bringing in many new faces, Abe kept key allies and aides within his Cabinet and top layers of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party to shore up his position for the next two years.Taro Aso remains as deputy prime minister and finance minister. Yoshihide Suga kept his job as chief cabinet secretary while Toshihiro Nikai will still be LDP's secretary-general."The new Cabinet is Abe's final push to realize his dream of revising the pacifist constitution and to start an open race to pick the next prime minister," said Yu Qiang, a researcher of Japan studies at the University of International Relations in Beijing.Set to become Japan's longest-serving prime minister in November, Abe had long-hoped to achieve his ambition of amending Japan's postwar constitution to change the status of the country's Self Defense Forces."We will strongly promote discussions on the constitutional amendment under the new system," Abe said, adding: "The LDP should demonstrate strong leadership at the Constitution review board."AFP contributed to this story.

            <p>
                The 5th Eastern Economic Forum took place Sept 4–6 in Vladivostok under the motto "The Far East – Development Horizons".   "We are still going to aim high. At the same time, if prior to the first EEF five years ago you would have asked me to guess the future – I don't think I would have said 1800 projects. Perhaps, I would have been ambitious enough to guess 300, and I would have thought that daring. 1800 projects launched in the Far East – it is simply amazing. I am confident: the preferential economic policy, initiated at the behest of the President of the Russian Federation works. It improves people's lives and the Far East is only going to keep getting better year after year. The economy will stay on the rise, there will be more theatres, schools, museums, libraries, and scientific centers," said Yuri Trutnev, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Presidential Plenipotentiary Envoy to the Far Eastern Federal District.Business ProgramThe Forum hosted over 100 panel discussions, roundtables, and business breakfasts dedicated to the most relevant topics on the international and regional agendas. The discussions have been broken into 4 thematic areas:• New Solutions for Accelerating Economic Growth• Improving the Business Environment • The Far East and Asia Pacific: Fostering Collaboration • New Solutions for Improving Quality of LifeKey event of the business program took place Sept 5.

I was very impressed with what I saw – great versatile talents of the people living in the region and innovations that happen here. I saw many opportunities for cooperation and mutual progress."    President of Mongolia Khaltmaagiin Battulga: "This is the third time I take part in the Forum as the head of Mongolia, while this event takes place for the fifth time.

Let us create history together, let us pave the way."  Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Bin Mohamad: "It was great to hear that of all regions, Russia is going to develop the Far East.

                Meicun still sings as erhu production hub
            </a>
            <p>
                Wuxi, home to legendary folk musician Abing, continues to foster craftsmen, performers When studying the modern history of erhu, a two-stringed Chinese musical instrument, Wuxi in Jiangsu province is a place that researchers can't ignore. Meicun, an ancient town located in the Wuxi National Hi-Tech District, or Wuxi new area, stands at the core of the production of erhu and is also a hub for erhu performing arts. Meicun, as well as Wuxi, is associated with many renowned artists, craftsmen and their stories. And erhu has become the cultural symbol of the town and the city. One of the local legendary figures is Hua Yanjun, whose masterpiece Erquan Yingyue, or The Moon's Reflection on the Second Spring, is among the most frequently played erhu solo in China. Hua, also named Abing, was a folk musician born in Wuxi in 1893.He learned to play the erhu and other instruments from his father. Hua showed great talent when he was a teenager, but the talent did not earn him a decent life. After the death of his mother and father, he became homeless and had to play on the streets to make money. Adding to his misfortune, he developed a serious disease and became blind. He died in poverty in 1950. And Erquan Yingyue was a reflection of his life. The style of this piece displays an intense folk character. At the same time, it portrays the hardships, trials and tribulations of the composer's life. A soft and fluent melody combined with a profound inspiration conjure up the composer's sense of dissatisfaction and bitterness in his world, and also reveal his longing for a better life. In addition to Hua, Wuxi is the hometown of more than half of the top erhu artists in China over the past century. Sharing a similar reputation with Hua is Wuxi's native Liu Tianhua, who was the leader of the modern, academic school of erhu artists in China. His masterpieces include Beautiful Night, Autumn Moon over the Han Palace and Marching on the Bright Road. Today, such masterpieces by Hua, Liu and other musicians are not only popular in China, but have also impressed audiences from around the world. One crucial figure promoting Wuxi's erhu arts to the world is Japan's most renowned orchestra conductor Seiji Ozawa. Ozawa was invited to serve as the conductor at the China National Symphony Orchestra in 1978. He was then asked to lead a string ensemble based on Erquan Yingyue. After hearing the music, the veteran conductor said he was deeply touched by the pathos of the piece, according to a report in Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun in September 1978. "Bursting into tears, Ozawa said 'one should kneel down to listen (to the music)'," the report said. Thanks to the influence of the famed Japanese conductor, Erquan Yingyue immediately became a classic on the world stage of music. Artists from Wuxi have also played an important role in promoting the local musical heritage to the world. Hu Jiandong, a renowned erhu player from Wuxi, staged a solo concert in Vienna in 2008, featuring masterpieces by erhu masters from Wuxi. The event further contributed to the understanding of Chinese music among audiences in the West. He is also the "image ambassador" for the erhu production and performing industries in Meicun. A hub for erhu In Wuxi, the boom of erhu music arts is closely related with Meicun, according to Wan Jiang, deputy chief of the Wuxi new area's publicity department. In Meicun, which is also known as Meili, there are a number of time-honored companies where skilled craftsmen still use ancient techniques to make the authentic Chinese erhu. One such company is Guyue Qinhang, owned by master erhu maker Wan Qixing. Wan, who has been in the industry for more than 60 years, is a legend of the town. He began to learn erhu-making in 1953 when he was 15 years old. He began to run an erhu factory in 1965. Wan is a believer of the idea that "one is never too old to learn". He became a student of master erhu maker Lyu Weikang in 1999 to improve his skills, which led to the creation of the famous local erhu brand Wan's. "Selecting the right materials is crucial in making a premium erhu," Wan said. He uses hardwood varieties such as mahogany and Indian sandalwood to make the long neck of the erhu, while the cover of the body is usually made of python skin. "We select the tail part of the python skin as the cover for making the best erhu," Wan said, adding that the tail section only accounts for a very smart part of the entire python skin that is usually four to five meters long. He said a top-quality Wan's erhu sells at prices up to 180,000 yuan ($25,290). But despite the high costs, premium erhu instruments are always highly sought after by professional erhu artists. Over the past six decades, Wan has made great efforts to pass down his skills and techniques to younger generations. Today, a number of local erhu makers are students of Wan. Wan's erhus are currently sold in China, as well as in overseas markets including Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Europe and the United States. Innovation While top makers like Wan's are using traditional techniques to make upscale products, companies targeting the medium and lower-end markets are using cost-effective, environmentally friendly materials and techniques in the production. For instance, local company Wansheng Musical Instrument uses artificial leather to take the place of python skin for erhu body. Huang Jianhong, general manager of the company, admitted that erhu made of the new material lacks a sense of "depth and broadness" compared with traditional products. "However, it is enough and suitable for amateurs and beginners," Huang said. Zhang Xiaoming, party secretary of Meicun township, said the innovative alternatives by makers like Wansheng are in line with the sustainable, environmentally friendly requirements of the industry. He called for more efforts in searching for higher-quality materials that can be used to produce erhu for the upper-end markets. Erhu making in Meicun, is on Jiangsu province's list of intangible cultural heritage protection, according to Wan Jiang of Wuxi New Area's publicity department. Meicun produces about 25 percent of all erhu for China's medium and high-end markets, according to the local government. The town is also the hub of Wuxi's erhu performing arts. Since 2011, Meicun has been the permanent host of China's highest-level erhu performing event. In 2012, the Erhu Culture Park, a facility for erhu production, performing, training and related cultural activities, was launched in the town.  With a number of erhu-themed events held in Meicun, the ancient town in the Wuxi National Hi-Tech District is a central stage for erhu performing arts.

                Trump says US reaches 'initial' trade deal with Japan
            </a>
            <p>
                 WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration has reached an "initial" trade deal regarding tariff barriers with Japan, indicating that the agreement doesn't need to be approved by the US Congress."I intend to enter into the agreement in the coming weeks," Trump said in a message to Congress released by the White House, adding that he will also be entering into an "executive agreement" with Japan regarding digital trade.He said that his administration looks forward to "continued collaboration" with the Congress on further negotiations with Japan to achieve a comprehensive trade agreement that results in more fair and reciprocal trade between the two countries.Trump cited the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015, which allows the US president to proclaim reciprocal reductions in tariffs without congressional approval.In October 2018, the Trump administration notified the Congress that it intended to initiate trade negotiations with Japan under the framework of the act.In late August, Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced at the summit of the Group of Seven (G7) in Biarritz, France that they had reached an agreement in principle to lower tariffs on agricultural and industrial goods, leaving out the auto sector.When a Japanese reporter asked Trump whether he could rule out the possibility of US tariffs on Japan's auto industry, the US president didn't give the confirmation.Earlier this year, Trump had threatened to impose tariffs on imported cars and auto parts on national security grounds, provoking backlash at home and abroad.

                Trump: Trade deals with Tokyo reached
            </a>
            <p>
                But Japanese officials cautious on prospects as no word on auto tariffsWASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump said on Monday the United States had struck "initial" trade agreements with Japan that could be implemented without congressional approval, but stopped short of assuring Japan new tariffs would not be slapped on vital auto exports.In a letter to the US Congress released by the White House, Trump said that he intends to enter into the agreements on tariff barriers and digital trade "in the coming weeks" and was notifying lawmakers that the tariff deal would be made under a trade law provision allowing the US president to make reciprocal tariff reductions by proclamation."In addition, I also will be entering into an Executive Agreement with Japan regarding digital trade," Trump said in the letter.Neither agreement would require a vote in Congress under the so-called "fast track" approval process. The Trump administration last year notified Congress that it would pursue negotiations with Japan under this method.On a critical issue to Japan, Trump's announcement left unclear whether he had agreed not to impose threatened national security tariffs on Japanese vehicles and auto parts. Avoiding the Section 232 tariffs of up to 25 percent was a major motivating factor for Tokyo in negotiating with Washington on trade."At the finishing stage, we plan to reconfirm that 232 won't be imposed," Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, Tokyo's lead negotiator, told a regular news conference in Tokyo on Tuesday.Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said the deal won't contain any provision on currencies - another worry for Tokyo. Japan wants to avoid any agreement hindering its ability to intervene in the foreign-exchange markets in the event of a spike in the yen, or to expand the Bank of Japan's massive monetary stimulus.Trump said after the G7 summit in France last month that he was not considering auto tariffs "at this moment".Over much of the past year, the scope of talks has narrowed to exclude the automotive sector, the source of most of the $67 billion US trade deficit with Japan.Instead, Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in August announced an agreement in principle of a deal that covered reductions in tariffs on agricultural and industrial goods, but not autos.Japan's chief government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said on Tuesday that the two sides are still finalizing details after reaching a basic agreement in late August on trade in farm products, digital trade and other industries.Suga said Trump and Abe are considering signing a deal in late September when they attend the UN General Assembly in New York.We are accelerating the work that still remains," he said. "But I decline to comment further because we have not reached a formal agreement."A spokesman for US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer could not immediately be reached for comment on the letter and the trade deals.Trump and Abe said at the G7 summit that they hoped to sign the agreement at this month's United Nations General Assembly in New York.Trump's letter did not disclose any content of the agreements, but Japan had previously said it was willing to consider a deal that would reduce agriculture tariffs to levels previously contemplated under the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that Trump quit on his third day in office in 2017.Trump's letter said that the US would pursue further trade negotiations with Japan.US technology industry officials say they expect the digital trade agreement with Japan to be closely aligned with provisions in the new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, which follow the US model for internet development.The USMCA provisions aim to ensure the free flow of data across borders without taxation, prohibit data server localization requirements and limit governments' ability to require the disclosure of source code by the companies they regulate.For Trump, the signing of even a partial trade deal with Japan centered largely on agriculture would provide some relief to US farmers who have been battered by a 14-month US-China trade conflict and lost market share.Agencies - Xinhua - China Daily

                TOKYO - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday expressed his commitment to reforming the nation's social security system as the country is increasingly grappling with a demographic crisis as the population here rapidly ages and shrinks to the detriment of the economy."Reform toward social security for all generations is the biggest challenge. We will consider sustainable reforms for the entire social security system," the Japanese leader told a panel charged with dealing with the issue at their first meeting.One of the government's aims has been to encourage senior citizens to actively contribute to society by working for longer, which means they will still be eligible to contribute taxes to help trim the ballooning social welfare costs the government is and will have to cover, more so in the years to come.One scheme under the proposed social security reforms initiative is to incentivize Japanese businesses to hire, or allow those who wish to do so, to work or to continue working up until the age of 70.Reducing or ditching the system that lowers pension allocations for people who are earning a certain amount, has also been an idea floated to encourage businesses and seniors to begin to revamp the workforce and extend participation by seniors.The proposals come as social welfare expenses, which span public pensions and medical costs among others, are set to significantly increase from 2022, as postwar baby boomers turn 75 years old or older.At the end of August, the Japanese government ministries and agencies' budget requests for the next fiscal year hit a record high of close to 105 trillion yen (around $972.82 billion), government officials said, owing to the need to finance ballooning social welfare costs and other spending plans.The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has requested a budget of 31.90 trillion yen ($295.55 billion), a new record high and a 2.5-percent increase from the previous budget, as spending on social security is expected to rocket to more than 32 trillion yen ($296.48 billion), up by about 600 billion yen ($5.55 billion).Amid the record-high requests, the Japanese government also has to contend with a planned tax hike in October from 8 percent to 10 percent.Japan's economy plunged into recession when the government raised the tax to 8 percent from five percent in 2014.The budget requests, meanwhile, will be assessed by the Finance Ministry and adjusted as necessary and submitted to the Cabinet Office for approval by the end of the year.The panel charged with tackling the demographic crisis, comprising 16 people from ministerial, business and academic backgrounds, will compile a report on how to deal with the issue in two stages, with an interim report due before the end of the year and the final deliverable by the summer of 2020.
