                    IS local leader killed, 6 captured by paramilitary force in western Iraq

            <p class="style-content">
                BAGHDAD - Iraq's paramilitary Hashd Shaabi force killed Thursday a prominent leader of Islamic State (IS) militant group and arrested six of his bodyguards in Iraq's western Anbar province.An online statement by the Hashd Shaabi said a force from the 18th brigade conducted an operation in the desert area of Wadi Hauran in western Anbar province and killed Abdul-Salam Hamad, nicknamed Abu Nour, believed to be the IS leader for the capital Baghdad.The force also captured Hamad's six bodyguards and wounded his aide, who blew up his explosive belt before being captured, the statement said without giving further details.IS militants are known for exploiting the gorges of Wadi Hauran to set up hideouts and arms depots and use the area as a launching pad for attacks on civilians and security forces.The operation came a day after the Iraqi forces backed by Iraqi and U.S.-led coalition aircraft concluded a major offensive dubbed "Victory Will" to hunt down remnants of IS militants in central Iraq.The security situation in Iraq has been dramatically improved after Iraqi security forces fully defeated IS in late 2017.IS remnants, however, have since melted in urban areas or resorted to deserts and rugged areas as safe havens, carrying out frequent guerilla attacks against security forces and civilians.

                    Chinese air conditioners cool Iraq this summer
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                BAGHDAD - Days of sizzling heat have engulfed Iraq in another muggy summer and Chinese-made air conditioners have become popular among local customers because of their advanced technology."About 70 percent of air conditioners in Iraqi markets today are made in China and the most popular brands are also Chinese, like Aux, simply because they've proved their quality," said Ashraf Abul-Huda, Aux's marketing and sales manager in Iraq.On the one hand, the rising interest in Chinese air conditioners is proportional to the increasing purchasing power of Iraqis, especially as the country's slumping economy gradually picks up after the victory over the Islamic State militant group and the subsequent stability in many cities across the country.On the other, the improving quality of Chinese products has gained the trust of Iraqis in recent years. Chinese products like smartphones, home appliances and even automobiles have become part of many Iraqis' everyday life."In the past, Chinese products were lagging behind their rivals from other manufacturing countries but today you no longer feel a difference. They (Chinese products) have become competitive. In fact, they use advanced technologies in Chinese air conditioners that are non-existent elsewhere," Abul-Huda said.Tosot, Gree, Midea and Aux air conditioners are among the most popular cooling devices in the Iraqi market. In the past few years, their sales have been skyrocketing compared to rivals from different countries.Buying an Aux air conditioner, customers will benefit from reasonable prices that start at $280 and higher. They will also get their hands on some of the most advanced technologies in the world cooling industry."I have been following the business in Iraq for more than five years, so I can feel there have been a lot of changes during this period. People see Chinese products as similar to Japanese, South Korean or American products, on the same quality level," Andy Shew, Aux's Middle East sales manager, said in Baghdad.Aux devices are also convenient in areas of unstable power supply like Iraq, where people still suffer from low voltage that limits their options in running their regular cooling devices. Aux air conditioners can also run on voltage as low as 187 volts.Iraq's power network has been damaged by armed conflicts, mismanagement and corruption. It struggled with the rapid growth in population and increasing demand. Innovative power saving technologies are greatly needed in the country.Shew added that the demand for Aux devices is increasing and he believes the market will keep growing for Chinese brands, especially as the political situation becomes more stable and Iraq's economy recovers.
