                Wild panda spotted walking with cub in China's Sichuan
            </p>
            <p>
                CHENGDU - Photos of a wild giant panda wandering with its cub were captured in a nature reserve in the Tibetan-Qiang Autonomous Prefecture of Aba in southwest China's Sichuan Province. The photos were captured by infrared cameras installed in Wujiao Nature Reserve under the forestry bureau of Jiuzhaigou County. It is the third time that an adult giant panda has been photographed in the area this year, but it is the first time one was spotted walking with a cub, said the administration on Tuesday. "The cub is only a few months old," said Hu Xueyu, head of the administration office of the nature reserve. "Giant panda cubs always live with their mother until they are two-and-a-half to three years old," Hu said. There are 26 rare animals in the Wujiao Nature Reserve, including golden monkeys, snow leopards and gnus.

                Pandas mating again after mountain road cools passions
            </a>
            <p>
                Communities of wild giant pandas on Mount Qinling in Shaanxi province have begun mating with each other again after being cut off by a State road built over the mountain in the 1970s. Long-term monitoring has shown that different populations of the rare animal have been visiting each other via an ecological corridor built in 2005 by Shaanxi Guanyinshan National Nature Reserve and the World Wide Fund for Nature. Liu Xiaohai, executive director of the WWF China project, said the WWF has been focusing on improving connections between panda habitats, so it started to develop the ecological corridor for pandas in cooperation with the reserve in 2005.

                No heart of darkness on my trip
            </a>
            <p>
                My misconceptions were quickly debunked as I took the inaugural China Southern direct flight from Guangzhou to a friendly Nairobi Three years ago, a friend told me that he spent almost 24 hours traveling from Beijing via two different cities to reach Kenya. "But it is absolutely worth it for the splendid great migration on the savanna," he emphasized, referring to the huge seasonal movement of wild animals such as wildebeest. Since that time, I was very curious about the African savanna but it seemed very far away. I never expected to get to the region in any way but through a similarly lengthy journey. I also still worried a little about safety there before I departed, although it turned out that my fear was unjustified. Fortunately, I got to be one of the 200-plus passengers on China Southern Airlines' first flight from Guangzhou, in Guangdong province, to Nairobi, capital of Kenya, on Aug 5. The flight departed at midnight from Guangzhou and arrived in the early morning in Nairobi after 11 hours. The flight was perfect for sleeping, and, I sank into sleep as soon as we took off. There were two meals, including dinner after departure and breakfast before landing, but I skipped both to sleep. I'm not so fond of in-flight meals, so I didn't miss them, but some Chinese passengers told me they cherished the in-flight food because it was from China. They had doubts about how the local food would suit them. That Airbus 330 aircraft was full and most of the passengers were Chinese excited to visit Kenya. About an hour before landing, I talked with a Congolese man, one of the only two African passengers. I was so surprised that while he is Congolese, his trip started in Japan - his wife is Japanese. He told me it is cheaper and easier to fly through Guangzhou to reach Nairobi and then his hometown. Before talking with him, I assumed Chinese and Africans living in China would be the only passengers for the Guangzhou-Nairobi route. A China Southern employee told me Japan and South Korea are also the route's target markets because there are no direct flights from the two countries to Africa and it is the shortest way for those passengers to get there. We received a warm welcome from local residents in Nairobi that included traditional song and dance as soon as the plane's doors opened. The route is not just significant for Chinese airlines as their only direct route connecting China and the continent at present, but also important for Africa, given that China has become the world's largest outbound tourism market. Chinese tourists I talked to on board, who were excited to be going to Kenya, shared my opinion that the Chinese airline's direct flight will lure more Chinese travelers to visit the continent. "We prefer Chinese airlines, which have no language or cultural differences," says a young mother traveling with her son. It is not easy for Chinese carriers to break into the market in Africa, especially Kenya, where local and Gulf airlines have been the big players for years. In Nairobi, I saw many airlines' outdoor advertisements, including Turkish Airlines and Qatar Airways. Naturally, Jomo Kenyatta International Airport is dominated by Kenya Airways' planes. It is clear that China Southern has its job cut out for it in the African market. While I was well-prepared with medicines and vaccines for my four-day stay, Nairobi surprised me. Local friends kept correcting my many misunderstandings about the country. The air quality in Africa generally is much better than that of Beijing, where rapid growth has brought air pollution. I enjoyed the clean and moist air in Kenya. While we imagine African nations close to the equator as hot and steamy - the equator runs through the middle of Kenya - this is not always true. Actually, August is Kenya's coolest season and Nairobi, at 1,795 meters above sea level, can be a little chilly at times. It is hot in the noontime sun, but in the early morning and at night the temperature can drop to 15 C. "We went to Africa to avoid the summer heat in Beijing," a colleague says. Mosquitoes comprised another of my misunderstandings. Before leaving China, I was told to pay attention to mosquitoes in Africa because they spread malaria, and I took three different kinds of mosquito repellent with me. I wore a long-sleeved coat and trousers even in the warm daytime hours, and some local friends laughed at me. They said perhaps I might find that protection useful in some other cities and remote areas in Africa, but not Nairobi. "Mosquitoes in Nairobi do not carry malaria," a local friend tells me. The last day I was in Nairobi, I was bitten by a mosquito, but no problems so far. Local residents looked relaxed and enthusiastic, but the tight security in Nairobi reminded me the regional situation is not so calm. Every hotel and market I saw in the city had security checks, and most of the communities have electric fences and tall iron gates. However, after I saw groups of zebra, gnu and giraffe eating grass on the savanna, as well as families of lions looking for prey and vultures flying above waiting for scraps, I knew this is what my friend who had visited Kenya was talking about when it said the journey was worth it. wangwen@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Africa Weekly 08/28/2015 page7)

                Natural areas, cultural relics and elite schools, including the Brazilian city Rio de Janeiro, NASA's aviation center in the United States and Disney parks are among the top destinations for Chinese families traveling abroad with their children. [Photo/China Daily]Luxury travelers are willing to spend big bucks on trips with their kids. Yang Feiyue reports.Affluent families travel with their children about twice a year on average and cite learning experiences for their kids as their main motivation, says a report by HHtravel, a luxury-tour operator affiliated with China's biggest online travel agency, Ctrip.HHtravel's family clients' average spending per trip ranges from 80,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan ($11,728 to $17,593).The Belt and Road Initiative has also made it easier for Chinese to travel, and families are taking advantage of the new opportunities, HHtravel's chief operating officer Guo Ming says.China and 46 countries and regions have liberalized visa requirements, and 19 offer visas on arrival to Chinese, the National Tourism Administration reports.Over 40 percent of recent inquiries received by HHtravel have been about family tours for the summer, Guo says.Wealthy parents tend to favor natural areas, cultural relics and elite schools as destinations for their kids.Favorites of those heading abroad include Easter Island, African savannas, Disney parks, Ivy League schools and NASA's aviation center. These attractions are particularly preferred by parents planning to educate their children overseas, Guo explains.

                Zimbabwean President Mnangagwa rules out unity government with opposition
            </a>
            <p>
                HARARE - Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa said Wednesday that the ruling ZANU-PF party does not intend to invite the opposition to form a Government of National Unity (GNU) following its resounding victory in the July 30 tripartite elections.Mnangagwa narrowly beat Nelson Chamisa of the MDC Alliance while his party won a two-thirds majority in Parliament and also swept the majority of local authority seats, except in urban areas where the MDC Alliance holds sway.Chamisa and his party have since refused to accept Mnangagwa's victory and in late November demonstrated in Harare against his legitimacy and the deteriorating economic situation in the country.The opposition now wants Mnangagwa to come to the negotiating table saying that the ruling party cannot solve the country's economic problem on its own.The party's national vice chairperson Tendai Biti said recently that it would want to negotiate for a national transitional authority instead of a GNU.However, Mnangagwa poured cold water on the opposition's overtures saying that the ruling party had the mandate to govern on its own for the next five years."We won and we are planning on how we are going to go about governing for the next five years to grow our economy," he said."We, as ZANU-PF, are now seized with the growing of the economy, finding solutions to resolve all those challenges that the country is facing." he said.Many people have experienced economic hardships lately with prices of basic commodities skyrocketing while many schools are now demanding school fees in US dollars or four or five times the amount in bond notes and electronic bank transfers.Prices of school uniforms have also gone up, prompting parents to demand that schools should not demand them to buy branded uniforms from select retailers.
