                Editor's Note: The Ministry of Education said on Tuesday that a working group for the establishment of colleges of the proposed Xiongan University was formed in Beijing recently. 21st Century Business Herald comments: When the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council, China's Cabinet, decided to establish Xiongan New Area in North China's Hebei province two and a half years ago, the "millennium strategy" was welcomed by all sections of society. From the regional economic development point of view, the significance of the Xiongan New Area lies in "transferring some non-capital functions of Beijing" and "adjusting and optimizing the urban layout and spatial structure of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region".

                Legal system for women's rights protection subject to constant improvement: white paper
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - The legal system for women's rights protection has been subject to constant improvement in China, according to a white paper released by the State Council Information Office Thursday.Built on the Constitution and with the Law of the People's Republic of China (PRC) on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women at the core, a legal system for the protection of women's rights and interests now covers over 100 separate laws and regulations, said the paper, titled "Equality, Development and Sharing: Progress of Women's Cause in 70 Years Since New China's Founding."The Constitution of the PRC, as the fundamental law of the country, has maintained the principle of gender equality, according to the white paper."Over the past 40 years of reform and opening up, China has constantly cemented the legal assurance for gender equality," it noted.Law of the PRC on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women that came into force in 1992 was the first fundamental law in China designed specifically for realizing gender equality and protecting rights and interests of women.It sets forth in details the legal rights and interests of women in politics, culture, education, property, personal affairs, marriage and family.An amendment to Law of the PRC on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women in 2005 officially established the legal status of gender equality as a fundamental national policy, according to the white paper.New breakthroughs have been made in the legislation for the protection of women's rights since the 18th CPC National Congress, said the white paper, citing the enactment of Anti-domestic Violence Law in 2015 as an example.

                Humorous and serious stories of China-US relations shared
            </a>
            <p>
                How many Americans can say they've shaken hands with President Xi Jinping — and with his father?That was one of the anecdotes offered by the speakers at a Vision China event in New York on Tuesday. The distinguished guests enlightened the 300-strong diverse audience at the Asia Society, who turned out to hear the topics discussed at "China-US Relations: 40 Years & Beyond".Kenneth Quinn, now president of the World Food Prize Foundation in Iowa, joked about a mistake on a graphic posted on the stage's video screen that said in 2012, with the signing of the US-China Strategic Cooperation Agreement in Agriculture, China would buy $3.5 million in Iowa soybeans. The number should have said $3.5 billion."I have to text my special assistant. That's what maybe we get today," Quinn deadpanned, to much audience laughter, referring to the dropoff of soybean exports to China during the current trade dispute.Quinn got to escort Xi Jinping, who was vice-president at the time, to the World Food Prize Hall of Laureates in Des Moines, Iowa, for the agricultural agreement signing. Xi also had been on a "sentimental" return trip to Iowa, which he first visited in 1985."By the way, I just shook your hand, and I'm one of the few Iowans to shake your hand who also shook your father's hand when your father came to Iowa in 1980," Quinn said to Xi through an interpreter."So, Vice-President Xi is walking along. He literally stops in his tracks and he turns and looks at me, and his eyes get big, and a big smile comes across his face and he says, 'You have two interesting stories.'"Quinn then proceeded to tell the first interesting story, when the then-governor of Guangdong province, Xi Zhongxun (father of now President Xi Jinping), arrived in October 1980, where the province and Iowa made a toast to "future trade and friendship". At the time, Iowa had zero agriculture sales to China.After taking the elder Xi to see various sights around Iowa, "We ended up on the second day stopping at the Amana colonies," Quinn said.The colonies were started by German immigrants in the 19th century."It was a total communist society," Quinn said. "It was organized exactly the same as any Chinese village and commune. He (Xi Zhongxun) could not stop asking questions about it."Because in China at that time was this discussion. He was about to start the Shenzhen special zone for manufacturing. Could agriculture be put on a free market basis in China, could it be socialism with Chinese characteristics?" Quinn said."Whatever he took away, they went back, and with Deng Xiaoping, Xi Zhongxun began the incredible transformation of China."The gregarious Quinn also proudly displayed a photo of his 4-year-old granddaughter, who is of Irish and Chinese descent.Other guest speakers included Connie Sweeris, who along with her husband, Dell, played a key role in the "ping-pong diplomacy" of the 1970s between the two nations.In April 1971, she traveled to China just shy of her 24th birthday on a historic trip by a nine-member US table tennis team.There, team members got to meet then-premier Zhou Enlai."What a joy it is to bring friends from afar," Zhou told the team."Every place we went we were served eight-to-10 course banquet meals," Sweeris recounted Tuesday of the hosts' hospitality.Besides the lighter moments, there were some serious ones, such as the current trade standoff between the US and China. (Incidentally, that issue will be addressed once more on Thursday, with a round of talks in Washington, to be followed by high-level talks in October.)Economist Stephen Roach, a leading Wall Street expert on China, explained in simple terms why the current approach to US-China trade disagreements needs to be rethought."I think we need to be much more creative in our negotiating tactics," said Roach, who is senior fellow at the Yale University Jackson Institute of Global Affairs. "I'm looking for macroeconomic adjustments in both countries, where we save more and China saves less."On a video screen behind Roach was a timeline of the various starts and stops to the trade negotiations over the past year and a half, over who wants a deal and who doesn't.Maurice Greenberg, chairman of the Starr Companies, said: "It's time that we have an agreement. I believe it's possible. If both sides can't do it, then both sides will suffer. I'm convinced of that."And the only person on the stage sprinkling in any Mandarin was an American, Max Horne, an avid student of Chinese language and culture. A freshman at Harvard University, Horne was the champion of the 2018 Chinese Bridge Speech Contest for US high school students. He and China Daily's Dong Leshuo cheerfully served as the emcees of the event.

                Country musician wants to promote Chinese artists in US
            </a>
            <p>
                Stokes Nielson has a dream-to make Chinese pop singers big in the United States.He wants to find talented Chinese, who could one day become as popular as the K-pop band BTS from Seoul.Nielson was born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee, known as the "home of country music", where the music industry has an economic impact of about $10 billion a year.The 2000 graduate of Vanderbilt University in Nashville dived into the music industry as a singer, producer, recording artist and songwriter. The award-winning songwriter has also been nominated for the Academy of Country Music Award three times. Nielson has produced original content for such leading artists as Tim McGraw, Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez.He's the founder of Channel Greatness, a media content provider and online video channel-building company. Nielson also consults for major brands and broadcast companies.Nielson befriended a music group from Shanghai at the Grammy Awards ceremony five years ago. They asked him if he could help to bring some exposure to Chinese artists in the US."They also suggested that I start to think about making songs available to the Chinese audience as well when I write," Nielson says."That started my real collaboration."In the past few years, Nielson has promoted Chinese pop singer Zhang Liangying (Jane Zhang) and Yiyang Qianxi (Jackson Yee) of TFBoys in the US via radio programs. He brought Zhang to the Grammys and set up interviews for her with top 40 US pop stations."They talked about her music and played her songs," he recalls.Nielson did an interview with Yi in China and had it aired over major US pop stations. He also became friends with Chinese Canadian actor-singer Kris Wu."In the US, the audience generally discovers singers through radio. We started introducing these Chinese artists to Americans," Nielson says.He says he considers Zhang, Yi and Wu "fantastic" artists."Jane Zhang is one of the best pure singers on the planet. Her vocal range is amazing. Kris Wu is very creative. His new song, Freedom, proves that he is a wonderful lyricist. Jackson Yee is an amazing dancer. Each of them can compete with any on the planet," Nielson adds.However, Chinese artists still need marketing and promotion to make it in the US."You have to learn about the American market. It's different from China."Nielson says this is an exciting period of growth in China's music industry."China's film industry is very mature, the music industry is an emerging economy, and there are a lot of opportunities. A lot of music artists can benefit by having a collaborator in the US where the music industry is very mature," he says.He says he believes a Chinese pop singer will connect with American audiences in a major way in the next four or five years."I want to be part of that story when it happens. I want to find, discover and promote that artist here. When I go back to China in September, one of my purposes is to become more aware of the new artists," says Nielson, who on average travels to China four times a year.Nielson also wants US artists to treat China as an equal market. He finds such opportunities in China, especially in cities such as Chengdu and Chongqing."We have been hearing news about the tariff issues between China and the US. We need to look at the broader story-these are two great nations that are trying to find out equitable ways to work together," Nielson says."I want to do as much as possible with my counterparts in China to build a true bridge good for creativity and money. I believe music can build a bridge of understanding for the two cultures."Recently, Nielson took a group of Chinese listeners of a Shanghai radio station to a Nashville studio, where one of his client artists was recording."They learned the lyrics in the studio. We had them sing, and they are recorded in the production. They are part of the song, which is coming out this fall. That's the kind of cultural bridge I am talking about," Nielson says.
