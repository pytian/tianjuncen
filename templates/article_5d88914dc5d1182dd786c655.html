                IN ORDER TO MAKE THE FUTURE SCIENCE PRIZE "CHINA'S NOBEL PRIZE", the Chinese science prize committee should adopt a more open and inclusive attitude toward researchers and encourage scientific innovation. Beijing Youth Daily comments: The winners of the 2019 Future Science Prize were announced on Saturday. They are Shao Feng, a professor at the National Institute of Biological Sciences, Peking University, for life sciences; Wang Yifang, a professor at the Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Luk Kam-Biu, a professor at the Physics Department, University of California, Berkeley, for physical science; and Wang Xiaoyun, a professor at Tsinghua University, for mathematics and computer science. A group of scientists and entrepreneurs established Future Science Prize in 2016 with the aim of making it "China's Nobel Prize". The prize worth $1 million is given to scientists for original and innovative research in life sciences, physical science, and mathematics and computer science irrespective of their nationality. Although the Future Science Prize amount is higher than that of the Nobel Prize, which is 9 million Swedish kronor ($930,000), the prestige associated with the latter is unrivaled in the world. In its 118-year history, the Nobel Prize committee has awarded the Nobel science prizes for pioneering and innovative work. It will take time for the Future Science Prize to become "China's Nobel Prize". But it is good to see the Future Science Prize being awarded to a female scientist, Wang Xiaoyun, for the first time. Scientific research should be a global undertaking without borders, without gender bias. Still, only a few female scientists have been awarded science prizes. Among the 604 Nobel Prize winners for Physics, Chemistry and Medicine, only 19 have been women, accounting for only 3.1 percent of the total. So the Future Science Prize committee's decision to award the mathematics and computer science prize to Wang Xiaoyun is a welcome change, which may contribute to gender equality in the field of science.

                Ikea planning to attract more young buyers throughout China
            </a>
            <p>
                Ikea is working to connect better with young consumers in China by becoming nimbler and more digitalized. The Swedish company that sells modern Scandinavian-design ready-to-assemble furniture, kitchen appliances and home accessories has thrived for more than two decades in China on its business model that focused on large brick-and-mortar shopping centers. People paid about 100 million visits per year to the company's Chinese stores.Ikea's fiscal report of 2018 showed that revenue in China was 14.6 billion yuan ($2.1 billion), a growth of 9.3 percent year-on-year. However, the growth rate was 4.7 percentage points lower than that in fiscal year 2017 and 10 percentage points less than that in 2016.Ikea China will make its largest-ever yearly investment - 10 billion yuan - in fiscal year 2020, with more to come in the next two years, aiming to attract younger people in first-tier and smaller cities to its physical stores and digital sites, according to top executives of the company.Ikea China will recruit over 3,000 new employees in the new fiscal year. The company now employs 14,000 people in the country.Last October, Ikea China launched its website and delivery services and also smaller-sized stores at places where urban dwellers love to meet.Anna Pawlak-Kuliga, CEO and president of Ikea China, said the plan has been adjusted based on the dynamics in the local market. "The home furnishings market in China is now in a phase of stable growth. In addition, urbanization, digitalization and people's increasing disposable income are changing the way people live and consume."That is why we have a full confidence in the market and strongly believe that the new strategy will help us to create a better everyday life for even more of the many people in China." Many innovations and initiatives that have been created in China are expected to be expanded to Ikea's operations globally, she said.To offer easier consuming experience both online and offline, Ikea will upgrade its existing stores, with Ikea Shanghai Xuhui store as the company's first "store of tomorrow "in the world.The company is accelerating its expansion in China by opening four new stores in the next four months and expanding the coverage of e-commerce to make Ikea's products and home furnishing knowledge accessible for more Chinese consumers.Ikea will also create more smaller scale "meeting places" close to consumers, with the first small-size store, at 8,500 square meters, to be opened in Shanghai before Chinese New Year 2020.IKEA also plans to provide a good shopping experience through the development of digitalization, including providing digital tools offline to simplify shopping and an equally inspiring and convenient shopping experience online.The online and offline coverage is expected to help expand Ikea's consumer reach to about 1 billion people, said Francois Brenti, director of expansion at Ikea China. Thanks to the digital and physical coverage, he said the company has expanded to 227 cities and regions, from first-tier to third-tier and even lower-tier cities.To achieve this goal, Ikea Digital Hub China was established in July, as a brand-new business unit with 250 digital experts to enable the digital capabilities across Ikea.Ikea will also launch full-house design services, starting with bedrooms and kitchens, developing more products with the concept "In China, For China and Co-create with China". Pawlak-Kuliga said home furnishing is a complete package of products, design and services. Ikea's full-house design services can help Chinese consumers to best use their home space, she added.The company will also upgrade its business-to-business service to work with commercial real estate companies to furnish move-in ready apartments, long-term rental apartments and offices.

                Sino-Swedish dairy cooperation to boost efficiency
            </a>
            <p>
                Pressured by the shortage for raw milk as well as the rising demand for dairy products, Tetra Pak DeLava, and China Agricultural University recently signed an agreement to improve efficiency in the dairy industry in China.The Agreement on Sino-Swedish Dairy Cooperation Quality and Efficiency Project 2020-2024, is a response to a circular released by the China State Council in 2018 to further revive the milk industry and improve the quality of domestic dairy products, as it defines a goal to increase the yield per cow.As another landmark initiative in Sino-Swedish dairy cooperation, the Quality and Efficiency Project 2020-2024 operates under the agricultural cooperation memorandum of understanding signed between China and Sweden in 2012.China's dairy industry is facing a critical imbalance between supply and demand for raw milk. The demand for dairy products is rising and expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 1.5 percent through 2023, driving demand for raw milk with annual growth of nearly 5 percent. However, domestic cow stocks and raw milk production are decreasing significantly."It is urgent to resolve this challenge at the source by increasing the yield per cow," said Li Shengli, chief scientist at the National Dairy Industry and Technology System and professor at China Agricultural University.In 2018, the average yield per cow in China was 7.4 tons. In accordance with China's plans for the dairy industry, the project will help achieve a change to 9 tons by 2025."This project will ensure a quality supply of raw milk through setting up a collection of model farms, forming strong guidelines, and then driving more farms to increase production," said Li.The Talent Development Project 2015-2019, a former Sino-Swedish cooperation project, has trained more than 130 senior management at China's modern dairy farms in the past five years. The project is widely considered a boost to improve the quality of the dairy industry and has laid a strong foundation to further develop the industry's talent resources.Paul Zhu, managing director China of Tetra Pak, the world's leading food processing and packaging solutions provider, said the company has been committed to growing with China's dairy industry and has been actively participating in and strongly supporting its development, addressing different needs at each stage."We are now working together on the new five-year project to help achieve China's goal of increasing the yield per cow to ensure raw milk supply," said Zhu.Tetra Pak is one of three companies in the Tetra Laval Group – a private group that started in Sweden. The other two companies are DeLaval and Sidel. Tetra Laval is headquartered in Switzerland.

                Activist should brush up on history
            </a>
            <p>
                With his innocent schoolboy look, student activist Joshua Wong is attempting to woo the world into believing that Hong Kong is a city where the basic rights as stipulated in the Basic Law are eroding as fast as global warming is causing the ice caps to melt.In New York and Washington, he is competing with Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg, who in the same week is trying to get the attention of members of the US Congress. Considering her quick wit, I somehow think she will win the battle for Congress' attention.Prior to his Washington trip, Wong, recently granted bail, flew to Germany to rally support for his tale. He told German media that Hong Kong was "like Berlin in a new Cold War". Clearly history was not his forte at school.Following the end of World War II, Berlin－which had been the capital of the kingdom of Prussia and subsequently of the German Empire－was divided between the different occupying forces. The Battle for Berlin had been won by the Soviet forces, who initially occupied the whole city, but subsequently handed control of zones to their (then) allies France, Britain and the United States. This evolved into the city being divided into East Berlin occupied by the Soviets, and West Berlin by the US, Britain and France, which fused their zones in the whole country to create the Federal Republic of Germany.The changing geopolitical alliances led to the Soviets attempting to regain control of all of Berlin by implementing an economic blockade of West Berlin leading to the famous Air Bridge operation, whereby West Berliners received food through airlifts. The Cold War had begun, and in 1963, US President John F. Kennedy made his landmark speech while visiting the city, with the pronouncement, "Ich bin ein Berliner" (I am a Berliner).Hong Kong has been a Chinese city for centuries, except for the British colonial period, which ended in 1997, after which Hong Kong returned to the motherland. Hong Kong was never the capital of China, was occupied by the Japanese during World War II, was a British colony for over 150 years, and currently has a unique status under the "one country, two systems" policy. How this is comparable to Berlin during the Cold War escapes me.The attempts by protesters to drag the US and UK governments into their orbit is becoming absurd. This must be the only occasion in post-colonial history where, 22 years after the ending of colonial rule, people are waving old colonial flags while demonstrating, and acting as if a return to colonial rule would be in the interest of Hong Kong people.The fact that the demonstrations are possible in Hong Kong, and even tolerated despite protesters having no permit to do so, is ample proof that the rights guaranteed under the Basic Law are being upheld. As for London lending them support for their democratic cause, I rather doubt that the Royal Navy will return to Repulse Bay anytime soon.The reason for the US roadshow that Joshua has embarked on is to attempt to persuade the US Congress to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which aims to amend the existing Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. Of course, any resolution that contains the words human rights and democracy sounds as if it must be reasonable, and who could possibly oppose it? However, the main body of the act seems prompted by the possible consequences of the now withdrawn amendments to Hong Kong's Fugitive Ordinance, so the raison d'etre is considerably weakened.The draft act also stipulates that protesters' visas to enter the US won't be negatively affected by their having participated in "nonviolent protest activities".Sadly, in view of the protesters' relentless campaign of wanton destruction－the vandalizing of subway stations, the gasoline bomb attacks and the assaults on citizens with different viewpoints－this visa issue will obviously become more challenging for the protesters. The foreign governments should ask themselves if they in similar situations would respond with the extraordinarily measured response of the Hong Kong police.Time and time again, the demonstrations veer off into acts of violence, which do not do anyone any good.Sadly, Joshua Wong has not used even a second of his international airtime to condemn the destruction and descent into uncontrollable chaos initiated by his followers. This shouldn't go unnoticed by those he is attempting to woo, especially if they stand on a high moral pedestal.The author is an adviser on China-related matters to both the private and public sectors, and was the first non-Chinese CEO of a Chinese State-owned finance company. The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.
