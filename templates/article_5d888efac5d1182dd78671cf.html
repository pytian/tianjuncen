                Celebrity chef helps bite back at food poverty
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                British-Chinese celebrity chef Jeremy Pang served up a feast this week in London's Borough Market, where volunteers cooked more than 1,000 meals for people in need.Under Pang's direction, the fourth annual Wok for 1,000 charity event saw 150 amateur cooks whip up vats of Asian curry, mounds of spring rolls, and more than 3,000 dumplings, all made with surplus ingredients from businesses at the popular food market.The meals were then packed up and distributed to 10 charities around London that help feed the homeless and other people battling food insecurity."We came up with this idea four years ago, and it's grown a lot since then, with sponsors and other businesses getting involved," Pang said. "It's about pooling together to help the community."Much of the ingredients at the event were sourced from surplus food destined for landfill, and, as they cooked, the volunteers learned helpful tips on how to cut down on food waste at home.Pang, who is the founder of London-based Chinese and Asian cookery academy School of Wok, says Chinese cuisine is well-suited for home cooks looking to make the most out of their pantries."Chinese culture lends itself to less waste, because we've been brought up in our culture and in our families to never leave anything on the table, we see it as rude to waste food," said Pang, who has authored several cookbooks including Chinese Unchopped and The Hong Kong Diner. "Chinese food is made for using up everything in your fridge or your pantry. Chop everything up fine, season it, and put it in a spring roll or a dumpling. That's what this food is about."This year's event was sponsored by Hong Kong-based life insurance company AIA Group and coorganized by United Kingdom charity Plan Zheroes, which helps businesses redistribute surplus food and reduce waste.Each year, around 10 million metric tons of edible food goes to waste in the UK, according to the UK Waste and Resources Action Programme, or WRAP. Despite this surplus, many people are still going hungry in Britain.A recent report commissioned by the UK government environmental audit committee found that the level of food insecurity in the UK is among the highest in Europe. The report estimates that nearly one in five UK children under the age of 15 lives in a home where parents cannot afford to put food on the table.Food waste incurs significant economic, environmental and ethical costs. Globally, around 1.3 billion tons of food valued at $940 billion goes uneaten each year, according to WRAP, while, in contrast, 815 million people around the world struggle with undernourishment. And food waste accounts for 8 percent of global emissions, when factoring in greenhouse gases produced along the supply chain."This is a really important issue, there are so many people that face food poverty every day," said Dee Vadukul, business development manager at Plan Zheroes. "There is food that is being wasted, and there are people that need it, and that is what we are trying to fix."Last year, Wok for 1,000 raised more than 7,000 pounds ($8,720) for Plan Zheroes through tickets sold to the volunteer cooks and other donations.

                    Farmers, chefs fight to save classic ingredients in Mexican cuisine
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                SAN ANDRES CALPAN, Mexico-Speaking against a backdrop of two soaring, snow-capped volcanoes, Asuncion Diaz explains his fight to save the original poblano chili, one of the most important ingredients in Mexican cuisine, from climate change and other threats.The pristine panorama notwithstanding, Diaz and other producers in Puebla say climate change is stalking this mountainous region in central Mexico and threatening the dark green chili pepper for which it is famous."The chilies get burned by the sun, and if it rains they go bad," says Diaz, a 55-year-old agricultural engineer, taking a break from work on his plantation outside San Andres Calpan, a village nestled in the skirts of the region's twin volcanoes, Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl.Looking up at the first volcano, which locals affectionately call "Popo", fellow farmer Hilda Cruz concurs that the region is heating up."When I was a little girl, Popocatepetl had snow year-round. I was 35 when I saw it without snow for the first time. It made me cry," says Cruz, now 64.The disappearing snow has been caused in part by increased volcanic activity inside Popo's crater. But Mexico's environment ministry says climate change is also wreaking havoc on the region, causing droughts, frost and heavy precipitation.Climate change is just one of the threats facing the ingredients of Mexico's renowned cuisine, which was named an essential part of the world's cultural heritage by UNESCO in 2010.Hybrid seeds, globalization and consumers' demand for immaculate produce are also taking their toll on ingredients like the poblano, which is used in Puebla's luscious mole dish - a spicy, chocolatey sauce - as well as in chiles en nogada, an iconic dish associated with Mexican Independence Day, September 16.Some farmers and chefs now are fighting back to save Mexico's indigenous chilies, beans, tomatoes, gourds, maize and more.They include star chef Ricardo Munoz Zurita, the man behind Azul, one of Mexico City's top restaurants.Every year in August and September, which is chile en nogada season, he regales customers with his lavish take on the traditional dish. Munoz buys his chilies from Diaz's plantation, which meticulously protects its crop from hybrid seeds."They are saving the poblano chili," says the chef.But he is worried about many of the other 31 ingredients in the traditional chile en nogada, which is stuffed with a mixture of ground meat and fruits."The fruits in the stuffing are in serious trouble: panochera apples, San Juan pears, creole peaches, pink pine nuts and fresh walnuts," he says.Agence France-Presse

                    Firmenich sets up fragrance workshop in Shanghai
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Move expected to bring company closer to the world's fastest growing marketThe world's largest privately owned fragrance and taste company, Firmenich, has launched an fine fragrance workshop in downtown Shanghai by offering dedicated models that provide easy access to all fragrance capabilities under one roof.The firm expects the workshop to bring it closer to the world's fastest growing but under exploited fragrance market.As the world's second largest economy, China saw the fine fragrance market increase 15 percent last year, according to data from Euromonitor International."Fragrance consumers in China are expanding rapidly from women to both men and women, and the market scale is projected to reach 23.3 billion yuan ($3.28 billion) in 2018," said Cai Zhihao, a researcher with the Shenzhen-based Qianzhan Industry Research Institute."China is really becoming a dynamic market and both local players and international brands are now beginning to define a unique Chinese fragrance landscape," Luc Berriet, the fragrance development director with Firmenich China, explained.Fine fragrance products are gaining traction across the country among Chinese consumers looking for quality products. Between 2015 and 2020, the middle-income group in China will have doubled, and by 2025, people born in the 2000s will represent 21 percent, or more than a fifth, of China's population, according to data from the World Bank.With the rise of the Chinese middle-income, millennium generation and generation Z groups, new domestic fine fragrance brands are booming as a result, providing additional customers for international brands."Chinese consumption for fine fragrance is still at its early stage. It may take another five to 10 years for the Chinese market to become mature enough, which in turn provides many opportunities for Chinese and international brands to exploit," Cai said.Jerry Vittoria, president of Fine Fragrance Worldwide with Firmenich, called the investment move in China came at the right time.He said the Chinese are dominant luxury customers and perfume and home fragrances are rapidly gaining a significant foothold in the country. At this time, international brands focus more on the China market's tailor-made business strategy, while local brands are becoming conscious of the potency of the Made-in-China label, he explained."We established our first office in China over 30 years ago, and after opening our Zhangjiagang manufacturing site earlier this year, this new investment in the heart of the fine fragrance community in Shanghai further reinforces our strong commitment to China, our second largest market worldwide," said Paul Andersson, president of Firmenich China.Firmenich opened its largest flavor manufacturing plant in the Zhangjiagang Free Trade Zone in Jiangsu province in March, with an initial outlay of $75 million making up the first phase of its investment. The brand looks to offer Chinese consumers a broad range of local flavors in products that include dairy drinks, tea and noodles."Firmenich's new Shanghai Fine Fragrance Atelier embodies the passion of perfumery and embraces the growth of Fine Fragrance in China. Our new, one-of-a-kind Fine Fragrance Atelier will help us better collaborate and co-create with our customers to deliver quality, creativity, value and growth," said Vittoria.The atelier has a cross-functional team that include sales, development, marketing and creation. The creation team has a full-time fine fragrance perfumer, and will leverage global fine fragrance perfumers for all local creations. The marketing team focuses on understanding both local market preferences and consumer insights.Daisy Shi, marketing manager of Firmenich China said: "We analyze consumer behaviors, and we identify emerging trends, and generate innovative and inspiring ideas.""When I'm in China, I'm touched by both its tradition and modernity. China is a huge source of inspiration. It is a country of contrasts, with a rich history of perfumery in ceremonies, rituals, performances and cuisine. Yet China also exemplifies innovation through its consumers, cities and culture," the company's Paris-based master perfumer Nathalie Lorson said.During the opening, Firmenich presented a multi-sensorial, fragrance experience called Aesthetics of China.The experience showcases Firmenich's imagination and creativity through music (sound), movies (sight), food (taste), fragrance (smell) and textures (touch), across four areas combining traditional Chinese aesthetics with modern Chinese beauty. They are called Serene Utopia, Multifaceted Me, Poetic Data and Root in Five.
