                London Stock Exchange rejects Hong Kong takeover
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                London Stock Exchange has formally rejected a 32-billion-pound ($40bn) takeover bid by rival Hong Kong Stock Exchange (or HKEX), citing "fundamental concerns" about the offer.In a statement to the stock market, the LSE says it has considered the proposal made on Wednesday, and concluded it is fundamentally flawed.It said: "The board has fundamental concerns about the key aspects of the conditional proposal: strategy, deliverability, form of consideration and value. Accordingly, the board unanimously rejects the conditional proposal and, given its fundamental flaws, sees no merit in further engagement."It adds that the LSE remains committed to its takeover of financial data service Refinitiv – a deal which is meant to turn the exchange into a challenger to Bloomberg.The LSE has also sent a highly critical letter to the HKEX, explaining why its approach has been soundly rejected.The LSE's chair, Don Robert, criticizes HKEX's chairman, Laura Cha, and CEO Li Xiaojia, for going public with their proposed merger, saying:"We were very surprised and disappointed that you decided to publish your unsolicited proposal within two days of our receiving it."Robert explains further that there is no strategic merit for the LSE group in combining with the HKEX:"The high geographic concentration and heavy exposure to market transaction volumes in your business would represent a significant backward step for LSEG strategically."

                    Board gamers set for one smart move ahead
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Appeal of non-electronic entertainment grows as more people realize its benefits, Xu Lin reports.Board games seem a throwback to a different era. A pre-mobile phone era. An era of dice and not a computer mouse. An era not of virtual reality but of imagination when you could be either a rich merchant, an awe-inspiring general, or a successful politician.The Dice Con 2019, an annual board game convention in Beijing, is a gathering allowing fans to experience the thrill of games that are not electronic and are actually making a strong comeback.With more than 152 exhibitors from home and abroad, the convention over Aug 23-25 covered an area of 6,400 square meters, two halls of National Agricultural Exhibition Center, and received over 30,000 visitors. There they were able to play various board games at tables before making up their minds whether to buy or not. Some parents took their children to enjoy the board games especially designed for kids and possibly rekindle some of their own childhood memories.According to market research store Research and Markets, the global board games' market is expected to be worth $12 billion by 2023, growing at a compound annual rate of more than 9 percent over 2017-23."Playing board games either with friends or the family is excellent entertainment. It also strengthens mutual understanding," says Beijinger Sun Yumiao, 32, who visited the convention with her friends. She bought two imported board games for about 1,000 yuan ($140).When she was a child, she fell in love with the Monopoly board game where players trade property. Board games have an added educational aspect as players have to think quickly and they are better at brain development than computer games or just watching TV.Vincent Dutrait, a veteran French board game illustrator, was one of the keynote speakers in Dice Con 2019. He says: "Illustration for books is generally about decoration, but illustrations for board games are different. They must be functional-to transmit the essence of the game and help players understand the mechanism."He visited China several times in the 1980s and 1990s, and was surprised by the country's great changes. He attributes his interest in Asian culture and history to his family. His father is a Sinologist and his mother is a reporter, and they've worked together to translate Chinese novels into French."To draw illustrations for board games is a unique experience. Because accessories for different games are unique-they vary in shapes and sizes, and some are designed in 3D," he says.

                    Xi Focus: Strengthening the rank of teachers
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                BEIJING -- Tuesday marks Teachers' Day in China.Education is an area which Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, has paid close attention to.He considers education as key to the long-term development of the cause of the Party and the country and has made clear instructions on strengthening the rank of teachers since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012.The following is a summary of efforts and achievements in this regard.ATTENTION, INSTRUCTIONSIt appears to be a ritual for the country's over 16 million teachers to receive greetings from Xi on Teachers' Day in recent years.Amid a tight schedule, Xi over the years has managed to find time to visit various school campuses, chat with educators and write to them, expressing his attention and expectations on education.In September 2014, during his visit to Beijing Normal University, Xi urged Party committees and governments at all levels to attach utmost importance to the work on nurturing teachers.He called for fostering a social atmosphere in which teachers are well respected and the importance of education is well understood.In February 2015, Xi visited the faculty of a primary school in Yan'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province. He said that education is very important to developing old revolutionary bases and poor areas.Later in September 2015, Xi encouraged teachers to contribute more to education in poor areas in a reply letter to teachers from southwest China's Guizhou Province.In September 2018, at a national education conference, Xi called on the Party and society to promote the social norms of respecting teachers and stressed enhancing the political, social and professional status of teachers.In March 2019, Xi emphasized the role of ideological and political theory teachers who, he said, "should plant a good seed in the heart of their students and help them rightly 'do up their button' from the beginning."ACTIONS, ACHIEVEMENTSA series of measures were taken following Xi's instructions.-- The opinions on strengthening Party building in primary and middle schools as well as institutions of higher education were promulgated.-- The long-term mechanism for improving and supervising teachers' moral standards was put in place.-- More exemplary teachers were picked through the selection of model educators, including late geophysicist Huang Danian, a professor at Jilin University who helped China make advances in deep earth exploration.-- From 2013 to 2019, the central government's budgetary spending amounted to 13.5 billion yuan ($1.9 billion) on a teachers' training program. During this period, 19.8 billion yuan in grants and subsidies was provided to rural teachers.-- Overall reforms were being pursued in the system of training teachers.-- The number of full-time teachers in China has kept rising, reaching 16.7 million in 2018. The number of schools topped 518,800 in 2018."Today's students are the major driving force that will realize our great Chinese dream: the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Teachers are dream builders, undertaking their mission to forge a 'dream team'," Xi said.
