                Huawei still waiting on US for promise to be kept
            </p>
            <p>
                Firm plans more investments to ensure cybersecurity, protect users' privacyHuawei Technologies Co said on Friday that it has yet to see any benefit from the US government's promise to relax restrictions on it and called for a direct removal of the company from a security blacklist."So far, no concrete changes have happened (to supplier issues)," said Liang Hua, chairman of Huawei, in a news conference in Shenzhen, Guangdong province. "If the US companies obtain licenses to continue selling products to Huawei, we will cooperate with them. But we hope there is some certainty in the licenses so that businesses can be controllable."Liang's comments came after the US Department of Commerce said it would issue licenses to US companies seeking to sell products to Huawei when there is no threat to national security.Huawei was put on the US Entity List in May, which banned it from buying technologies originating in the US without special government approval.Liang said despite the US government "crackdown", Huawei has achieved growth in the first half of this year and specific financial data will be released by month's end.The senior executive also explained that the company's self-developed operating system Hong-Meng is designed to power internet of things applications such as self-driving vehicles and remote medical services."When it comes to operating systems for smartphones, Android and its open ecosystem is still the top choice. It is undecided yet whether to use HongMeng for smartphones," Liang said.According to Huawei, the company will step up investments to ensure cybersecurity and protect users' privacy.In 2018, Huawei has evaluated 2,778 of its mainstream suppliers for cybersecurity risks, and verified the progress of related corrective action plans. It also signed a data protection agreement with 582 suppliers for privacy protection, and performed due diligence on these suppliers, said the 2018 Sustainability Report which Huawei unveiled on Friday.Lyu Tingjie, a professor at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, said Huawei has demonstrated strong resilience toward all the geopolitical pressure, and its consistent research and development input will help it overcome all the challenges."But the US government has become the biggest source of uncertainty for the global electronics industry. It constantly changes its attitude and failed to clarify what products can be resumed to sell to Huawei," Lyu said.On Friday, Liang also highlighted Huawei's determination to pursue green development by achieving innovation in the course of its 5G research, product development, and engineering.Huawei has managed to reduce the power consumption per 5G site to 20 percent less than the industry average. This has been made possible by the new Huawei chipsets, system software, professional services, and advanced hardware and heat dissipation technologies."These innovative technologies have made Huawei's 5G more energy-efficient. With the right solutions, Huawei's 5G will be a green technology," Liang said.

                China: Copycat or leader in innovation?
            </a>
            <p>
                The world is holding its breath as United States President Donald Trump decides, depending on the results of the trade talks, whether to impose further tariffs on imports from China. There are many intertwined issues between China and the US (and the West in general) but the core issue is how the world (including China itself) should comprehend and cope with the rise of China and its technological giants.On the US' long list of demands, one of the most prominent relates to intellectual property protection and technology transfers. In the heated debate on the subject, Chinese technology giants including Huawei are often depicted as villains, constantly stealing technologies from Western counterparts and competing unfairly, with the backing of the Chinese government's forced technology transfer policy. Of course, there are villains in China, just like anywhere else — but those who argue that China's giants have only risen on the back of foreign technology are like ostriches, burying their heads in the sand and refusing to accept reality.Learning from the WestChina's recent advances in innovation are indeed partly the result of the globalization of innovation. After China's reform and opening-up in the late 1970s, newly arrived Western companies brought with them sophisticated and relevant technologies, presenting domestic Chinese companies with plenty of opportunities for learning by doing, reverse engineering and technological diffusion via talent mobility. Over time the Chinese market became more sophisticated and skills of Chinese labor upgraded, triggering the establishment of R&D centers by Western multinationals, which in turn resulted in more and deeper learning opportunities for China (but also for the Western multinationals as they started to learn new innovation approaches such as 'frugal innovation' and business model innovation).Perseverance in innovationHowever, it would be foolish to believe that Chinese technology giants rose purely because of learning from the West. The other part of the story is their R&D which became more apparent in the last decade. At the beginning of the 21st century, only a handful of Chinese companies could afford a large R&D budget. Today, according to the 2018 European Union Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard, among the 2,500 companies that invest the largest sums in R&D in the world, 438 are Chinese, with Huawei ranking fifth, spending a staggering 11.3 billion euros ($12.7 billion) on R&D in 2017/2018. Given this huge investment plus Chinese' entrepreneurial spirit and work ethic, it should not really be a surprise to see China becoming a global leader in e-commerce, high-speed railway, nuclear power generation, telecommunications, quantum cryptography communication, and many other fields.What has perhaps taken aback many in the West is the sheer speed and scale of the rise of China as a global innovation leader; a non-Western country leading the world is unprecedented in recent human history and the West does not know how to deal with it. Some see China as a strategic threat. I would argue that China is not, as China does not export ideology.Intellectual property protectionTo many people in the West, China's rapid rise is a source of unease purely because China is so different and they were often told China encourages a weak intellectual property regime. Sure, China is different, but this does not mean that the West cannot work with it. And yes, China's IP protection system is still young. However, we should recognize the huge strides that China has made in the last few decades. Today it is in China's interest to further improve its IP protection system as they need to attract foreign direct investment and protect their own innovators. And it is certainly encouraging to see the recent move by China's National People's Congress to strengthen legislation that would create an Intellectual Property Court.Moving up the value chainWhile Western observers should keep pressing and helping China to further improve IP protection, they must also recognize and appreciate the legitimate concerns of China, and developing countries in general, in upgrading themselves in global value chains. It is morally unacceptable that developing countries should always be constrained to the lower end of global value chains such as simple assembling tasks. Here even the political elite in Washington has a moral deficit (Obama's 2015 statement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership springs to mind — "we can't let countries like China write the rules of the global economy").Instead of ignoring and dismissing China and other developing countries' concern in upgrading, the West should appreciate their pursuit of higher-end value chain activities such as R&D. In fact, there is a good reason that they should welcome such a move: recent research by my team at the University of Northampton indicated that the latest stages of globalization of innovation actually involved Chinese companies investing in developed countries for R&D and, perhaps counter-intuitively, they have things to teach their partners in the West, therefore also helping the latter to further upgrade their capabilities.We do not know what future globalization will entail. Whatever it is, the world must address the concerns of both developing and developed countries, and it is only via healthy competition, instead of protection, that we can properly address these two concerns together.The author of this article: He Shaowei, China and Emerging Economies Centre, University of Northampton

                Chinese smartphones reconnect with Iraqi consumers
            </a>
            <p>
                BAGHDAD - Over the past seven years, Iraqi consumers have gradually been attracted to the Chinese smartphones for their usability, affordability and advanced technologies.In 2008, Chinese-made phones from little known manufacturers first entered the Iraqi market, but found a foothold due to their considerably low prices, new technologies such as touch-screen, hi-fidelity speakers, and attractive designs.However, poor performance besmirched the image of Chinese phones relative to devices of Nokia and Samsung.Now, a new class of Chinese smartphone manufacturers have quickly risen as tech giants in the world markets. Many of them found profitable niches in the Iraqi markets as well as in the world markets.The crowded thoroughfare of al-Rubaie in eastern Baghdad has become the hot spot of wholesalers of cellphones, accessories, and spare parts. The shops there are also supplying other smartphone markets in Baghdad's other districts and across Iraq as well.The Chinese smartphones are widely spread in the thoroughfare. In 2013, Huawei was the first Chinese smartphone manufacturer that played an instrumental role in changing the stereotype of the Chinese smartphones among Iraqi consumers.The company introduced competitively priced devices with modern technology. It has slowly built its base in the country over the past seven years, and is now reaping the benefits.Ahmed Hashim, sales manager of Huawei for central and south of Iraq, said his office managed to penetrate the market and gained customer trust gradually.Huawei has surpassed Apple in the local market and is second only to Samsung. The company's market share is growing steadily year after year, powered by its cutting-edge technology.According to Hashim, Huawei sold between 1.4 million to 1.6 million devices valued at $280 million in 2018. This made Huawei the second largest phone vendor in Iraq. Huawei sells no less than 150,000 devices a month all over Iraq now.Hashim said: "We were No 1 in the world in selling the Huawei P Smart with 1,800 devices sold on the first day."Huawei phones are increasingly getting more attention and earning the trust of Iraqi consumers because of its reliable hardware, modern technologies, reasonable value, and cheap spare parts, compared to other phone manufacturers."Huawei, like many other companies in the Iraqi market, faces two major problems, unstable customs procedures and tariffs that lead to a fluctuation in the market."The Iraqi customers also knew Honor, which is the sub-brand of Huawei group, since it is part of Huawei production line. Honor entered the Iraqi market about a year ago.Ali Abbas, marketing manager of Honor for central and south of Iraq, said: "In one year, Honor smartphones reached a market share of 11 percent and are going up steadily."The high demand on Honor phones is due to the marketing plan, high quality of devices and state-of-the-art designs.""We have got the first place in the Middle East for selling the 8X midrange device and we surpassed Samsung sales in Iraq in the first quarter of 2019."Iraqi consumers came to know of Oppo smartphones through graymarket traders (with no official supplier authorization) in 2016. It was having a weak presence in the Iraqi market, but after Oppo managed to get global attention in mid-2018 with its unique and innovative Find X phone model, the Iraqi consumers warmed to the brand.Ayman al-Badri, sales manager of Oppo Iraq, said: "Oppo phones have done exceptionally well in the still-developing markets of India and Southeast Asia, where it shoved aside the former leader Samsung with low-cost, high-quality phones that look much more expensive than they are."We believe it will do the same in Iraq in the foreseeable future. Oppo will open a regional office in Iraq soon in order to promote its products and assist the authorized distributor."Opening the office "reflects the importance and potential of the Iraqi market to Oppo".Al-Badri also said that in the first quarter of this year, Oppo's market share in Iraq went up from 3 percent to 5 percent."We currently sell about 10,000 devices a month, and that's only the beginning. The Iraqi market is so active and the purchasing power is high, a recent statistic shows that 350,000 devices are sold and activated every month all over Iraq. The number of retail shops in Baghdad alone increased 12 percent from 1,200 to 1,350."Samsung, whose success led to Nokia's exit from the Iraqi market about a decade ago, remains No 1, but is feeling the heat of the Chinese phones. Its market share is decreasing bit by bit.Mahmoud al-Anbagi, a retail shop owner in al-Mansour, an upscale neighborhood, said: "Chinese phones have become a powerhouse nowadays. A lot of Iraqi consumers prefer them over other expensive devices because of their beautiful designs, up-to-date technology, and reasonable prices."Xinhua

                Ambassador Liu Xiaoming contributes an article to The Sunday Telegraph entitled Britain can and must work with Huawei on 5G
            </a>
            <p>
                On 28 April 2019, The Sunday Telegraph and its website published an article by Ambassador Liu Xiaoming entitled Britain can and must work with Huawei on 5G. The full text is as follows:Huawei is again making headlines in the UK. This week has seen the start of a heated debate over what decision to make with regard to the development of the UK's 5G network and whether the company represents a security threat. But what seems like a simple choice between different 5G suppliers actually hinges on three, very important, binary decisions that face the UK.First, will the UK choose independent decision making or not? Countries of global influence, like the UK, make decisions independently and in accordance with their national interests. With regards to Britain's relationship with China, this has been best illustrated by the UK's decision to be the first to issue the Renminbi sovereign bond, the first major Western country to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the first to contribute to the AIIB special fund, the first to sign the Guiding Principles on Financing the Development of the Belt and Road, and the first to appoint a special envoy and set up an expert board for the Belt and Road Initiative.When it comes to the establishment of the new 5G network, the UK is in the position to do the same again by resisting pressure, working to avoid interruptions and making the right decision independently based on its national interests and in line with its need for long-term development.Second, will the UK choose open and free trade and investment or not? As protectionism spreads from trade to investment and cyber space, the world follows closely the direction in which a post-Brexit UK, the standard-bearer of free trade, will be heading. The UK carries on its shoulders the responsibility for safeguarding free trade and opposing protectionism. So does China, which is working to deepen reform and open its market more widely to the world. The last thing the world needs is the introduction of any sort of discriminatory measures towards companies involved in 5G network development. The last thing China expects from a truly open and fair "global Britain" is a playing field that is not level.Third, will the UK choose win-win cooperation or not? In an age of globalisation, no country can achieve development behind closed doors. Win-win cooperation is the only way forward.In the development of 5G networks, security concerns are understandable. This is because 5G, as a representative of an entirely new generation of communications technology, is not perfect and does still need improvements. The risks should be taken seriously but risks must not be allowed to incite fear. They can be managed, provided countries and companies work together.Huawei has had a good track record on security over the years, having taken the initiative to invest in a Cyber Security Evaluation Centre which employs an all-British monitoring team. The company has been working hard to improve its technology and to enhance the security and reliability of its equipment.In Britain, Huawei has contributed £2billion to the economy over the past five years through investment and procurement, and created more than 7,500 jobs in this country. Across the world, it has built more than 1,500 communications networks, works in more than 170 countries and regions and provides services to more than one third of the world's population.This not just showcases the progress of a single company but bears testimony to the success of win-win cooperation.George Herbert said, "To a crazy ship, all winds are contrary." In this new round of technological revolution, one must take care to find the right direction to choose, one that leads to a bright future and real prosperity.If China and the UK can keep the long-term goal in mind, follow the trend of globalisation and stick to independent decision-making, openness and cooperation, they can work together to build a future of win-win results.

                He quits high-paying job, turns snow leopard savior
            </a>
            <p>
                Guardian helps preserve endangered species, urges raising local awareness on protection Editor's Note: This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This is part of a series looking at significant developments in various fields as China increases its interaction with the world. Liang Xuchang was looking for snow leopards, one of "world's rarest species", in the Tibetan autonomous region when he was chased by a bear. "I managed to escape without any physical harm," he said, recalling his terrifying encounter. Liang, nicknamed Liangzi, works for the Wildlife Conservation Society, an organization founded in 1895 and operating in China since 1996 to combat illegal trade of endangered species, and to encourage coexistence of wildlife and local residents in the Tibetan Plateau. As a member of the WCS, which he joined eight years ago after giving up a high-paying job at Huawei, a top Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturer, he is now a snow leopard guardian. A graduate of the Imperial College London, Liang works to protect this species despite extreme weather conditions, including snowstorms, gales, heavy rain and scorching heat, in Changthang, a vast area known for its wildlife. Since the 1980s, the Tibet regional government has been making all efforts to protect snow leopards, a Class A protected animal in China. They have been classified as "vulnerable" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, an organization that works in the field of nature conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. The efforts seem to be paying off. "In one way, the increasing number of snow leopard images captured by camera traps over the years could imply their numbers are increasing under protection," said Liang. He, however, said without adequate research evidence of the species in the past, it is hard to say whether their number has increased or decreased. "But in recent decades, there are abundant incidents of the species' activities." George Schaller, a senior conservationist at the WCS, has a different take on the snow leopard population. "There were fewer traces of snow leopards in the 1980s than in recent days. Maybe that can explain the contribution of protection; or is it because of advanced research tools?" According to the Status of Snow Leopard Survey and Conservation China 2018, a study conducted by China Snow Leopard Protection Network - a conservation alliance made up of leading nature conservation agencies, research institutions and universities - snow leopard habitats exist in 12 countries. These include Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. In China, snow leopard habitats are mainly found in the provinces of Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan and Qinghai, and the Tibet, Xinjiang Uygur and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions. "China accounts for 60 percent of world's snow leopard habitat, with Tibet accounting for half of it," said Liang. He said the habitat range of snow leopards in Tibet is huge. Currently, surveys cover only 0.68 percent of the habitat; studies are required in the region's southern areas, the Himalayas, Genghis and the Nyangchen Thanglha Mountains. Experts have often voiced concerns over revenge attacks on snow leopards. When these animals attack the livestock of the locals, they target them. WCS survey has found a high rate of conflict between snow leopards and people in Tibet. For example, more than 14 percent of livestock of a Tibetan herder were killed by snow leopards. Yet, there have been no incidents of revenge attacks in Tibet, said Liang. "However, there is potential risk to the lives of snow leopards. Preventive steps are necessary." The WCS feels snow leopards are increasingly under threat due to human activity. Awang, founder and general secretary of Plateau Nature Conservancy, however, ruled out human conflict with snow leopards in Sanjiangyuan - the source of the Yellow, the Yangtze and the Lancang rivers - in Qinghai province. Liang's team provides technical support to the government, such as project needs assessment, enhancing the effectiveness of nature reserves, prevention of people-animal conflict, funding, training, and project implementation. His team works with a local wildlife protection team - a group of six people. Armed with infrared cameras, they cover an area spanning 2,000 square kilometers. "It is not easy to carry out work in areas located at an altitude of above 4,500 meters from the sea level. Sometimes, it is better to spend the night in a sheep pen," he said. Liang feels it is important to raise awareness among the local people about animal protection. "Locals must take responsibility and volunteer to perform this role. Residents should become conservationists because they are the real protectors." palden_nyima@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 05/28/2019 page3)

                China-US trade dispute: What do you think?
            </a>
            <p>
                Editor's note: The trade conflict between the world's two biggest economies – the US and China –- that began last year has triggered heated discussions about how the disputes can be resolved. China Daily website readers share their opinions.sfphoto (US)Continuing the trade war by hiking the tariffs will kill the US economic recovery which Trump needs to win reelectionre-election. Trump knows that he can’t afford to lose the elections due to an economic downturn which is the likely result of a prolonged trade war.China is already moving away from export-oriented manufacturing industries to a domestic -market focused on technology and the services economy, making the old complaints about technology transfers effectively moot and academic as indigenous innovations become the engine of growth for China’s economy.

                Huawei welcomes remarkable graduates with competitive salaries
            </a>
            <p>
                News of Huawei’s enviable annual salaries to be offered to eight newly-recruited graduates with distinguished performances at school sparked heated debates on the internet, youth.cn reported.Huawei announced its decision in a statement outlining plans to apply an annual salary management mechanism to certain outstanding graduates in 2019.The eight fortunate students have mostly majored in cutting-edge fields related to artificial intelligence, and are given an annual salary spanning between 896,000 yuan ($130,000) to a staggering 2.01 million ($290,000).The notification said that Huawei must win the technology and business war in the future, with its core motives rooted in innovation. Global talents must therefore be brought in to confront the toughest challenges while earning the highest salaries in order to provide the innovative soil.Among the eight new employees, the highest salary goes to Zhong Zhao, Ph. D from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.Zhong majored in pattern recognition and intelligent systems both in his post-graduate and doctoral studies, according to Liu Chenglin, Zhong’s doctoral supervisor and deputy head of Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences.Liu attributed the high salary to Zhong’s research direction, which is a new trend some believe to be very practical.“His research focuses on automated designs of in-depth neural network structures, which means developing how to make the machine learn neural network structures automatically. The AI designs may have better performance than human designs, with a promising future. Few are doing this research in the current stage, which I think pushes Huawei to value it so much,” said Liu.He Rui, another graduate in the lucky list from the same university as Zhong, majored in computational mathematics.Guo Tiande, deputy head of the School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, said in the interview that “Huawei recruiting Ph.D graduates with fat salaries shows the eagerness for high level talents in China’s science and technology industry field, and is a symbol of the advancement of Chinese science and technology standards.”Huawei’s CEO Ren Zhengfei highlighted last month that the company planned to bring in 20 to 30 young talents across the world, and was considering attracting another 200 to 300 in the next year.Huawei’s move will possibly influence college students while choosing their research areas, said Liu, although career success is nevertheless determined by multiple personal as well as professional qualities.These lucky students should keep their past glories in mind. The school is expecting to see them doing a great job at work and make great contributions for the country’s technological development, Guo added.

                Vivo launches most affordable 5G smartphone
            </a>
            <p>
                Chinese smartphone vendor Vivo has unveiled the most affordable 5G smartphone so far on Thursday night in Beijing, starting from just 3,798 yuan ($536), as it adopts an aggressive pricing strategy to attract early adopters.The price is about 1,000 to 2,000 yuan lower than 5G alternatives unveiled by rivals including Huawei Technologies Co and ZTE Corp, and falls in the same price range as some of 4G handsets.One of the key hurdles in 5G adoption, aside from having 5G network support, is the price of 5G smartphones. So the cheaper they get, the easier it will be to convince people to buy them.As the first 5G model of Vivo, the iQOO Pro is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset, along with an Adreno 640 graphic processing unit. It has a 91.7 percent screen-to-body ratio.The smartphone comes with a liquid cooling feature, along with superconducting carbon fiber and temperature equalizing plate for improved heat dissipation. Currently, how to properly address the overheating problem is a major hurdle for the development of 5G smartphones.The iQOO Pro 5G packed a 4500mAh battery with fast charging capabilities. For the camera specifications, the phones sports a 48-megapixel primary rear camera, secondary 13-megapixel 120-degree ultra-wide lens and a 2-megapixel sensor for portrait shots. On the front of the device is a 12-megapixel camera on the front.Zeng Kunpeng, general manager of the iQOO product series of Vivo, said the company has applied for more than 2,000 5G patent applications, as it works hard to beef up its technological capabilities.
