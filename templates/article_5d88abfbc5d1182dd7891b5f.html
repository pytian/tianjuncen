                    Heir to British throne says he won't be a 'meddling king'
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                LONDON - The heir to the British throne, Prince Charles, has said in a birthday interview he won't be a meddling king when he replaces his mom, Queen Elizabeth II.Charles, who as the monarch's eldest son is the Prince of Wales, is about to celebrate his 70th birthday on Nov 14, and made the comment in a media interview.He has a reputation of making his views known on a range of subjects ranging from architecture, the environment, climate change to natural health remedies such as homeopathy.In a documentary for the BBC, the prince said he will stop speaking out on topics he feels strongly about when he becomes king, adding that "he is not that stupid".Prince Charles said the idea he would continue making interventions as king was nonsense, adding he would have to operate within constitutional parameters.Queen Elizabeth never comments on political matters, though what she says at her regular meetings with serving prime ministers is never reported or publicly disclosed.According to the BBC, in the documentary, Prince Charles was asked about his campaigning, which some people described as "meddling".Documentary film-maker John Bridcut, who followed the prince for 12 months, said Prince Charles "bridled a bit" at the use of the word "meddling" and instead preferred to think of his interventions as "motivating".The heir to the throne said: "If it's meddling to worry about the inner cities as I did 40 years ago, then if that's meddling I'm proud of it."He added the roles of Prince of Wales and king were completely separate.There is media speculation in Britain that at some time in the next year or so Queen Elizabeth, 93 next birthday, will retire from public duty, with her son taking over as Prince Region. That would give him all of the powers of a monarch, but not the title of king while his mom is still alive.The Queen's husband, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, has already retired from public life.Royal watchers say Queen Elizabeth will never abdicate, and would retain the title of Queen should she hand over to Charles.Bridcut told the BBC: "People who think he's hanging around, longing to be king, are very mistaken. It's not something he's dying to assume because inevitably it will only arise after the death of his mother."As the Queen reduces her workload, more of her official duties are being carried out by her grandchildren and their wives, William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and newly-weds Harry and US actress Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

                    UK's Prince Charles parties as he celebrates 70th birthday
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                LONDON - Prince Charles celebrates his 70th birthday on Wednesday by attending public and private parties, while his office has released new photographs of the heir to the British throne with his close family.The Prince of Wales and Queen Elizabeth's eldest son, Charles was born at Buckingham Palace on Nov 14, 1948, four years before his now 92-year-old mother ascended to the throne following the death of her father George VI.To mark his birthday, he will attend a special tea party heralding 70 inspirational people who also turned 70 this year, before heading to a private function for friends and family hosted by the queen.As Britain's heir apparent, Charles has waited longer than any of his predecessors to become monarch and would be the oldest king in a lineage that dates back 1,000 years.Charles has used his position to campaign on issues including climate change, architecture and farming, often raising prescient concerns about the environment, his supporters say."When my mama succeeded and became queen and my grandfather died so young, aged 57, I ended up becoming heir to the throne aged four," Charles said in a BBC documentary aired last week."You have to make of it what you feel is right - there's nothing laid down so that's what makes it so interesting, challenging and of course complicated."However, critics have accused him of inappropriate interfering because British monarchs are bound by Britain's unwritten constitution to stay out of politics.In last week's documentary, Charles said he would stop "meddling" in campaigns which he felt strongly about."I'm not that stupid," he said. "I do realise that it is a separate exercise being sovereign."The new photographs show Charles in the garden of his London home Clarence House together with his second wife Camilla, sons William and Harry, their wives Kate and Meghan along with William and Kate's children, George, Charlotte and Louis.In the BBC film, William said he hoped his hard-working father would spend more time with his grandchildren."Now he's reached his 70th year, it's a perfect time to consolidate a little bit as most families would do; you are worried about having them around, making sure their health's OK," he said. "He's the fittest man I know but equally I want him to be fit so he's 95 going on, so having more time with him at home would be lovely."However, William acknowledged that Charles still believed he had much to achieve."He hasn't even reached the point that his natural progression should do - ie being monarch - so he's still got his job to do," he said.Reuters

                    Britain's Prince Philip misses Christmas Day church service
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                SANDRINGHAM - Britain's Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth's husband, missed a traditional Christmas Day church service on Tuesday, though a royal source said that the 97-year old was in good health and just wanted to spend the day in private.Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, married Elizabeth in 1947 and has been by his wife's side throughout her reign, the longest in British history."The duke is in perfectly good health, he is just spending the day privately," the royal source said.Former naval officer Philip, who had successful hip replacement surgery earlier this year, retired from public life last year, quipping at the time that he was no longer able to "stand up much".Senior members of the royal family traditionally attend a Christmas service at the St Mary Magdalene church in Sandringham, eastern England.Elizabeth attended, as did Charles, Prince of Wales, heir to the throne. Charles' wife, Camilla, did not attend, according to a Reuters photographer at the church.Charles' sons, Princes William and Harry, also went to the service with their wives, Kate and Meghan.The US born actress, who is pregnant, exchanged a smile with Kate as they walked to church.Elizabeth will say in her Christmas message that the traditions of peace and goodwill need to be heeded as much as ever, and people should respect each other even when they harbour the most deeply held differences.According to excerpts released by Buckingham Palace, the 92-year-old monarch will also speak of family and friendship following a year in which her grandson Harry married Meghan at a dazzling ceremony.The queen has avoided commenting in public on contentious issues, and the excerpts make no mention of the visit in July by US President Donald Trump or the turmoil over Britain's departure from the European Union.Speaking about the birth of Jesus, she will say: "I believe his message of peace on earth and goodwill to all is never out of date. It can be heeded by everyone; it's needed as much as ever.""Even with the most deeply held differences, treating the other person with respect and as a fellow human being is always a good step towards greater understanding."Reuters

                    British public not keen on Charles assuming throne
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Nearly half of the British public is opposed to Prince Charles succeeding the queen as monarch, according to a survey published in The Independent newspaper on Wednesday.The online poll conducted by BMG Research sought the opinions of 1,508 British adults last month. Results show 46 percent of respondents believe Charles should abdicate if he becomes king. And some 27 percent showed "strong support" for the crown passing directly to Charles's oldest son, William, after the queen's reign ends. Another 19 percent said they "somewhat support" that idea.Only 13 percent of those polled said they would "strongly oppose" Charles abdicating immediately after assuming the throne, with 11 percent saying they would "somewhat oppose"such a move. Twenty-nine percent of those asked expressed no opinion on the matter.People aged between 18 and 24 were the most likely to want Charles to step aside in favor of his son.BMG Research also asked respondents whether taxpayers should continue to fund the royal family. Thirty-eight percent said they thought royals immediately in the line of succession should receive funding, while 35 percent said the royal family should be self-funding. Only 12 percent thought all royals should be funded by the taxpayer.Prince Charles is the longest-serving heir in British history. He became first in line to the throne 67 years ago, when his grandfather George VI died in 1952.Born on Nov 14, 1948, 70-year-old Charles told the BBC in November he will not meddle in politics if he becomes king, and conceded he will not be "able to do the same things I've done as heir". Charles has faced criticism for airing his personal views on political issues, something that is in contrast to the queen's neutrality.According to the poll, the British people are not keen to see Camilla, Charles's wife, become queen. Only 20 percent believed she should take the title of queen if Charles becomes king. People aged 65 and over were the most likely to oppose the idea, with 62 percent saying they did.Last year, the queen formally nominated Charles as her preferred successor to become head of the commonwealth, something that won support among the leaders of the 53 members of the organization.

                    Trump's comments cast shadow over visit
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                US president makes his views known on several issues ahead of trip to UKUnited States President Donald Trump prepared for his state visit to the United Kingdom by unleashing a torrent of advice and criticism that will surely have embarrassed outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May at the start of one of her last major assignments as the UK's leader.Before touching down in the British Isles, Trump, who has never been shy about sharing his opinions in apparently undiplomatic outbursts, told the Sunday Times newspaper that the British government's Brexit negotiations had left the European Union "with all the cards". And he said May's nemesis, Nigel Farage, the man who led the charge to persuade the UK's voters to want to leave the EU, should now be involved in the UK government's negotiations. He added that, if the UK doesn't get everything it wants from divorce talks, it should be prepared to leave the bloc without a deal — the so-called no-deal Brexit that May has been cautioning against for the past three years."Think how well they would do if they did," Trump said of such a strategy.And he rubbed salt into May's wounds by saying in an interview with Britain's tabloid Sun newspaper that former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, one of those who engineered her ousting from office, would make a great replacement prime minister."I think Boris would do a very good job," he said. "I think he would be excellent."In the same interview, he described US citizen Meghan, the duchess of Sussex, as "nasty", something that is likely to enrage the large section of the British public that dotes on the new royal.Trump took to Twitter on Sunday to deny he had insulted Meghan."I never called Meghan Markle 'nasty.' Made up by the Fake News Media, and they got caught cold!"  he tweeted.Even before Trump's comments, the trip was shaping up to be far from smooth.With May heading for the door of 10 Downing Street, builders renovating Buckingham Palace, a ban on addressing Parliament imposed by the speaker of the House of Commons, and UK citizens more interested in the nation's relationship with the EU, the visit, which runs from Monday to Wednesday, was likely to be difficult. When you add in the fact that the duchess of Sussex was not expected to meet the president, having recently given birth to the queen's newest great-grandchild, it had more than its fair share of challenges.Meghan described Trump in a 2016 interview with a US television station as "misogynistic" and "divisive" and is believed to have a low opinion of him, so some will see her anticipated absence as a snub, especially in light of Trump apparently responding with the "nasty" comment.Thousands of anti-Trump protesters are likely to follow him wherever he goes, just as they did when he visited in 2018 for a normal official visit. On that occasion, they unveiled a 6-meter inflatable effigy of him as an angry, orange, nappy-wearing baby, something that is understood to have infuriated him.

                WELLINGTON - Britain's Prince Charles and his wife Camilla will visit New Zealand in November, the South Pacific nation's prime minister said on Friday.It would be the pair's third joint trip to the country, having last visited in November 2015."The Prince of Wales has been a strong advocate for the environment, conservation and sustainability for many years," Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement."This visit will provide opportunities for him to engage with New Zealanders on those subjects, and to learn more about the ways in which New Zealand is preparing for the future," she added.Ardern said that the visit was still in the planning stage and further information on dates and itinerary would be released closer to the time.Charles's son Prince William visited New Zealand in April to honor the victims of mass shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, while Prince Harry and his wife Meghan visited the country during a tour of the Pacific in late 2018.Reuters
