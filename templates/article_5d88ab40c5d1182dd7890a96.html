                LONDON - English Football League club Bury have been expelled from the competition over financial issues.The League One club (third division) from the northwest of England, which was founded in 1885 and won the FA Cup on two occasions, had been unable to fulfil their first five games of the season and are the first team to be expelled from the competition since Maidstone United in 1992.The news happened after C&N Sporting Risk pulled out of a deal to buy the club from owner Steve Dale 90 minutes before Tuesday's revised 5 pm deadline.The Football League (EFL) issued a statement to confirm their decision which read: "The EFL Board met earlier this evening and, after a long and detailed discussion, determined that Bury FC's membership of the English Football League be withdrawn after the deadline passed at 5 pm today [Tuesday, August 27] without a successful resolution.""At its meeting on August 24, 2019, the board agreed a short extension to 5 pm today to enable Mr Dale and the club to explore the possibility of a proposed sale with C&N Sporting Risk Limited, with Mr Dale having accepted their offer. Following due diligence, C&N Sporting Risk Limited opted not to pursue its interest.""Therefore, having fully considered all available options, including a number of late expressions of interest provided to the EFL, the EFL Board has unanimously determined with enormous regret that Bury's membership be withdrawn."League One will now contain 23 rather than 24 teams for the 2019-20 season.The EFL have given another League One club, Bolton Wanderers (one of the founding members of the Football League in 1888), 14 days to find a buyer or face a similar fate.

                    Trump fires national security adviser John Bolton
                </p>

            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Tuesday he fired national security adviser John Bolton, citing strong disagreements on a number of policy issues.Trump tweeted that he told Bolton Monday night his services were no longer needed at the White House and said Bolton submitted his resignation on Tuesday morning. Trump said that he "disagreed strongly" with many of Bolton's suggestions, "as did others in the administration."Bolton responded in a tweet of his own that he offered to resign Monday and President Trump said, "Let's talk about it tomorrow." Bolton's ouster came as a surprise to many in the White House. Just an hour before Trump's tweet, the press office announced that Bolton would join Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a briefing.Bolton was always an unlikely pick to be Trump's third national security adviser, with a world view seemingly ill-fit to the president's isolationist "America First" pronouncements.He's espoused hawkish foreign policy views dating back to the Reagan administration and became a household name over his vociferous support for the Iraq War as the US ambassador to the UN under George W. Bush. Bolton even briefly considered running for president in 2016, in part to make the case against the isolationism that Trump would come to embody.Inside the administration he advocated caution on the president's whirlwind rapprochement with North Korea and against Trump's decision last year to pull US troops out of Syria. He masterminded a quiet campaign inside the administration and with allies abroad to convince Trump to keep US forces in Syria to counter the remnants of the Islamic State and Iranian influence in the region.Bolton was named Trump's third national security adviser in April 2018 after the departure of Army Gen. H.R. McMaster.AP

                The broad outlines of US foreign policy are unlikely to change following the abrupt departure of John Bolton, the third national security adviser to leave the White House post in three years, analysts and officials have said.US President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he had fired Bolton amid "strong" disagreement with the man he tapped 17 months ago to replace H.R. McMaster, who was brought in after Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was ousted after less than one month in office."I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House," the president tweeted. "I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration, and therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service."Bolton offered an opposing account on his departure, saying on his own Twitter account moments after the president's post that "I offered to resign last night and President Trump said, 'Let's talk about it tomorrow.'"Trump said he would name Bolton's successor next week. The White House said Charles Kupperman, the deputy national security adviser, would fill Bolton's role on an acting basis.Just an hour before the president's tweet, the media corps in Washington had received an update from the White House press office that Bolton would join Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in the afternoon for a briefing on an executive order expanding ways to counter terrorism."I don't think any leader around the world should make any assumption that because some one of us departs, that President Trump's foreign policy will change in a material way," Pompeo said at the news conference, where Bolton was absent.Asked if Bolton's departure would make it easier for him to do his job and for the administration to implement the president's foreign policy agenda, Pompeo said, "I don't talk about the inner workings of how this all goes. There were many times Ambassador Bolton and I disagreed; that's to be sure. But that's true for lots of people with whom I interact."Mnuchin also said the president's view of the Iraq war and Bolton's was "very different".Cal Jillson, a political scientist and historian at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said Bolton's influence had been declining for some time, even as, or perhaps because, Pompeo's influence had been rising."Bolton and Pompeo did not differ greatly on policy, but Bolton's more aggressive and uncompromising personality likely came to grate on President Trump," Jillson said.The New York Times also reported Tuesday that the rift between the president and his national security adviser "owed as much to personality as to policy".A former under-secretary of state and ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, Bolton had been a foreign policy hawk who had fundamental disagreements with the president on Iran, Afghanistan and a slew of other global challenges, The Associated Press reported Tuesday.But even with Bolton sidelined, "the broad outlines of American foreign policy are not likely to change much. Pompeo will continue to take great care to be seen as faithfully implementing Trump's policies rather than be seen as resisting or even steering them," Jillson told China Daily.He said Bolton saw rebalancing the China-US economic relationship as a "critical" foreign policy issue, which will not change in the wake of Bolton's dismissal. "President Trump's principal requirement for his next national security adviser will be that he or she agree with him on most, ideally all, major issues," Jillson said.Pompeo also said the president is entitled to the staff that he wants at any moment.Stanley Renshon, a political science professor at City University of New York, said Tuesday's sudden shake-up was just one more of many illustrations that Trump is a "demanding boss" who is not afraid to make changes."I think he is still searching for the right foreign policy adviser mix," Renshon told China Daily.The succcessor could be someone on the "tough" end of the policy options scale, but someone who can be creative and thoughtful within one's own framework, he said."It has been brewing for a while, and Bolton is too ready to use American force, if he feels it necessary. Trump, for all his verbal bluster, is cautious on that score," Renshon added.

                After national security adviser's departure, Trump says to name successor next week The broad outlines of United States foreign policy are unlikely to change following the abrupt departure of John Bolton, the third national security adviser to leave the White House post in three years, analysts and officials said.

Trump said he would name Bolton's successor next week. The White House said Charles Kupperman, the deputy national security adviser, would fill Bolton's role on an acting basis. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying did not make any comment on Wednesday regarding the resignation of John Bolton, saying it is a matter of US domestic affairs. Stable development of Sino-US ties is in line with the fundamental interests of people of both countries, and is a common expectation of the international community, Hua said, adding that China hopes that whoever eventually assumes the post will play a constructive role in promoting such development. Just an hour before the president's tweet, the media in Washington had received an update from the White House press office that Bolton would join Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in the afternoon for a briefing on an executive order expanding ways to counter terrorism.

                    Trump names Robert O'Brien as US National Security Advisor

            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he will name Robert O'Brien, a senior hostage affairs official at the State Department, as his next national security advisor."I am pleased to announce that I will name Robert C. O'Brien, currently serving as the very successful Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs at the State Department, as our new National Security Advisor," Trump said in a morning tweet.O'Brien will replace John Bolton, the third US national security advisor during the Trump administration, who ended his tenure over a week ago, as his relationship with Trump frayed over policy differences."I have worked long & hard with Robert. He will do a great job!" Trump added in the tweet.O'Brien, a long-time lawyer before taking various government posts in the past administrations, was among the five finalists Trump revealed on Tuesday.He takes the job as the Trump administration is facing a number of foreign-policy challenges, including its increasingly tense relations with Iran.The position of national security advisor does not require Senate confirmation.
