                             In particular, since a large part of Johnson's leadership campaign focused on the possible post-Brexit deals with non-EU economies, it is possible that under his prime ministership, Britain will become the first European country to sign a free trade agreement with China.As an ideal opposition party leader, Corbyn didn't waste time in reminding the members of Parliament on Thursday that Johnson backed May's Brexit deal, saying: "Can he explain this flip-flopping?" And quoting US President Donald Trump's remark that Johnson was "Britain's Trump", Corbyn said that the failure to "take back control" ("Vote Leave" slogan during the Brexit referendum) could make the United Kingdom "a vassal state of Trump's America". "In the 98 days that remain to us, we must turbo-charge our preparations to make sure there is as little disruption as possible to our national life," Johnson said, referring to the Brexit deadline of Oct 31

Plus, the failure of May's initial Brexit plan meant the deal with the EU would face strong resistance from British members of parliament. Ironically, it also means Britain which decided to leave the EU has to take part in the European Parliament elections on May 23

                            A maritime expert said it's unlikely a judge would grant a petition by the owners of a dive boat to limit their financial liability for a Labor Day fire on board that resulted in the loss of 34 lives. Second, the court must determine whether the owner of the vessel had knowledge or privity of those same acts of negligence or conditions of unseaworthiness," he said.Martin Davies, a martime law professor from Tulane University, told China Daily that "on average, petitions for limitation succeed about 50 percent of the time in the US, but averages are of little help – everything depends on the facts of the case, and it's too early to say in the present case"
