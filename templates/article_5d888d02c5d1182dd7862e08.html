                Israeli president to start coalition consultations
            </p>
            <p>
                Israeli President Reuven Rivlin will on Sunday start consultations with the parties about choosing a leader to put together a coalition, after right-win Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed for the second time in five months to secure a clear election victory in the parliament.Netanyahu faced Israeli media headlines on Friday suggesting power is slipping from his grasp after an election in which he trails his main rival with nearly all votes counted.The centrist Blue and White party led by ex-armed forces chief Benny Gantz rebuffed his calls to join a unity government on Thursday.Near-final results released on Friday by the Knesset's election committee showed Blue and White will be the largest single party in the new parliament with 33 of the 120 seats, with Netanyahu's Likud winning 31 seats, three less than it had before.Israeli newspapers and commentators depicted the 69-year-old leader as in a weakened position, with headlines such as: "Himself Alone" and "Political Death Spasms."Netanyahu and Gantz will now seek potential coalition allies, prominent among whom is the far-right former defense minister Avigdor Lieberman. He secured eight seats for his Yisrael Beitenu party, making him a potential kingmaker.Increased turnout by Israel's 21-percent Arab minority saw the Arab-dominated Joint List coalition grouping win 13 seats, making it the third largest grouping.The religious parties representing Israel's Ultra-Orthodox communities, known as Haredim, remain a significant force, with Shas winning nine seats and United Torah Judaism eight seats.The right-wing Yamina won seven seats, the leftist Labor-Gesher six, and the Democratic Union five. The full official results will be published next Wednesday.

            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - China on Sunday published a white paper on its progress in the field of human rights over the past 70 years.The white paper, titled "Seeking Happiness for People: 70 Years of Progress on Human Rights in China", was released by the State Council Information Office."Living a happy life is the primary human right," the document said, adding that China regards the rights to subsistence and development as the primary and basic human rights and has been improving the rights of its people in a coordinated manner since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, especially after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 2012.Seventy years ago, under the leadership of the CPC, the people of China were emancipated and became masters of

                Experts want US, China to rebuild trust
            </a>
            <p>
                Business leaders call on both countries to avoid harm to trade brought by tariffs The United States and China can resolve their disagreements by rebuilding trust and avoiding the harm to trade brought by tariffs, experts and business leaders said after the two countries concluded two days of talks in Washington on Friday. Talks between Vice-Minister of Finance Liao Min and the US officials ended on a good note, as discussion on both sides was "constructive", according to a statement by the Ministry of Commerce on Saturday. Officials from both sides also discussed arrangements for further talks in Washington in October, the 13th round of China-US high-level economic and trade consultations, the statement said. Rebuilding trust and eliminating negative factors are helpful in removing tariffs, stimulating the flow of foreign direct investment, saving consumers' money and enhancing the power of international institutions, including the World Trade Organization, said Chen Wenling, chief economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing. Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing-based think tank, said that both sides must be aware that reaching an agreement is only the beginning of the process. The two sides must continue to seek pragmatic solutions to end the prolonged dispute, Wang said. Patrick Zhao, senior vice-president for Asia Pacific of BASF Coatings Solutions, said that for a global company like BASF, which has integrated global value chains, minimizing the impact of trade barriers and tariffs is essential to operations. The company and its customers benefit from free trade, since any kind of tariff represents an indirect tax, he said. "We are therefore concerned about the recent US announcements, and the response of several US trading partners, including China, to impose import tariffs on a wide range of products that could affect the chemical industry and its numerous customer industries, including the automotive industry," Zhao said. He said the BASF believes deeply in the value of open markets and a rules-based global order. The company hopes governments will eventually resolve trade differences via sustained multilateral dialogue and within the boundaries of the WTO rules, he said. According to analysts, the US was sending positive signals about the next round of consultations. For example, the Office of the United States Trade Representative announced on Tuesday that it would temporarily exempt 437 categories of Chinese products from tariffs that the US government imposed in 2018. The announcement came after companies and other entities submitted more than 1,100 requests for relief. Yin Zheng, executive vice-president of Schneider Electric SA, said globalization is a positive economic trend that brings new opportunities everywhere in the world and improves cross-border partnerships. Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Renmin University of China in Beijing, said it's possible for China and the US to reach a temporary bilateral agreement during the annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in November in Chile if they can make breakthroughs in the coming high-level talks. This would be consistent with both nations' interests, Wang said. zhongnan@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 09/23/2019 page3)
