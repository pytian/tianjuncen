                ’Trilateral diplomacy’ prevails at China-Pakistan-Afghanistan meeting
            </p>
            <p>
                At a critical moment when the US canceled the “peace process” in Afghanistan, a trilateral meeting was held between Afghanistan, China and Pakistan, on Sept 7 in Islamabad. It is the third round of trilateral talks focusing on regional peace, cooperation, stability and friendship between the three countries, all of which share borders.Foreign Minister of Pakistan Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Foreign Minister of Afghanistan Salahuddin Rabbani and State Councilor and Foreign Minister of China Wang Yi came together to discuss regional issues and challenges. They worked hard to reach a common strategy to face challenges jointly.While closely following recent developments in the region, the three reiterated their support for a politically negotiated settlement of the prolonged conflict in Afghanistan, to take war off the talbe. All took note of the cancellation of peace talks between the US and the Taliban. They expressed hope intra-Afghan negotiations would begin soon and lead to full cessation of violence. They underlined the need for an inclusive, pure, Afghan-led peace process leading to a comprehensive agreement for durable and sustainable peace and stability.Their commitment to further strengthening relations was confirmed by advancing connectivity under the Belt and Road Initiative, the Regional Economic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan and other regional common economic initiatives. It was agreed to explore “China-Afghanistan-Pakistan plus” cooperation, as well as working toward promoting trade and connectivity projects between Afghanistan and Pakistan, such as the Kabul-Peshawar Motorway. In the future Afghanistan may be included in CPEC, becoming a beneficiary of BRI. It may also be granted membership in SCO.China, under the Belt and Road Initiative, is ready to support the construction of refrigeration storage, clinic centers, drinking water supply schemes and immigration reception centers at checkpoints between Afghanistan and Pakistan to facilitate the movement of people and trade activity among the two countries. It will generate great opportunities for people-to-people contact and help promote understanding and eliminate mistrust.Games and sports will be promoted among the three, and bring the countries close to each other. Public diplomacy will be promoted. An Archaeologists' Exchange Program will be organized to explore cooperation among Red Crescent Societies of the three countries, along with regularly undertaken exchange projects in other areas.China, Afghanistan and Pakistan reiterated their strong resolve to fight common enemy — terrorism and extremism in all its forms. They reaffirmed the commitment of not letting any terrorist organization, element or individual use their soil. It was also decided the countries would work toward effectively implementing the trilateral Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in Counter-terrorism, signed at the second round of Trilateral Foreign Minister Dialogue held in Kabul. The three also agreed on a list of initial projects of enhancing counter-terrorism cooperation, recognized the need to continue their joint fight against the “East Turkestan” Islamic Movement and stayed committed to countering terrorists’ logistical capabilities.It was decided to hold the fourth round of this dialogue in Beijing next year in 2020. The first was held in Beijing in 2017, the second in Kabul in 2018 and the third was in Islamabad this year. It seems it will become a routine feature to promote close contacts among three friendly nations.Zamir Ahmed Awan is a sinologist and non-resident fellow at the Center for China and Globalization.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                Trump says peace talks with Taliban are now 'dead'
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - Peace talks between the United States and the Taliban are now "dead", US President Donald Trump declared Monday, two days after he abruptly canceled a secret US meeting he had arranged with Taliban and Afghan leaders aimed at ending Washington's longest war. Trump's remark to reporters at the White House suggested he sees no point in resuming a nearly yearlong effort to reach a political settlement with the Taliban, whose protection of al-Qaida extremists in Afghanistan prompted the US to invade after the Sept 11, 2001, plane attacks on the US. Asked about the peace talks, Trump said: "They're dead. They're dead. As far as I'm concerned, they're dead." It's unclear whether Trump will go ahead with planned US troop cuts and how the collapse of his talks will play out in deeply divided Afghanistan. Trump said his administration is "looking at" whether to proceed with troop reductions that had been one element of the preliminary deal with the Taliban struck by US presidential envoy Zalmay Khalilzad. "We'd like to get out, but we'll get out at the right time," Trump said. The Taliban on Tuesday vowed to continue fighting against US forces in Afghanistan, saying the US would regret abandoning negotiations. "We had two ways to end occupation in Afghanistan, one was jihad and fighting, the other was talks and negotiations," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said. "If Trump wants to stop talks, we will take the first way and they will soon regret it." What had seemed like a potential deal to end Washington's longest war unraveled, with Trump and the Taliban blaming each other for the collapse of nearly a year of US-Taliban negotiations in Doha, Qatar. The insurgents are now promising more bloodshed, and US advocates of withdrawing from the battlefield questioned on Monday whether Trump's decision to cancel what he called plans for a secret meeting with Taliban and Afghan leaders at the Camp David, Maryland, presidential retreat over the weekend had poisoned the prospects for peace. "The Camp David ploy appears to have been an attempt to satisfy Trump's obsession with carefully curated public spectacles - to seal the deal, largely produced by special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban negotiators, with the president's imprimatur," said John Glaser, director of foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, a think tank. Trump has been talking of a need to withdraw US troops from the "endless war" in Afghanistan since his 2016 presidential campaign. And he said anew in a tweet on Monday: "We have been serving as policemen in Afghanistan, and that was not meant to be the job of our Great Soldiers, the finest on earth." He added, without explanation: "Over the last four days, we have been hitting our Enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years." US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Trump's weekend moves. "When the Taliban tried to gain negotiating advantage by conducting terror attacks inside of the country, President Trump made the right decision to say that's not going to work," Pompeo said on Sunday. Trump said he called off negotiations because of a recent Taliban bombing in Kabul that killed a US service member, even though nine other US citizens have died since June 25 in Taliban-orchestrated violence. But the emerging agreement had started unraveling days earlier after Afghan President Ashraf Ghani postponed his trip to Washington and the Taliban refused to travel to the US before a deal was signed, according to a former senior Afghan official. As Trump's reelection campaign heats up, his quest to withdraw the remaining 13,000 to 14,000 US troops from Afghanistan remains unfulfilled - so far.

                Bolton's exit doesn't signify policy change: China Daily editorial
            </a>
            <p>
                The dice were loaded against him, for he was not only opposed to letting up the pressure on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and against the US president's suggestion of a possible meeting with the Iranian leadership, but also a likely cause of the failure of Washington-Taliban talks.But that he would be fired for being a foreign policy hawk, a trait for which he was made the US national security adviser, is something very few imagined.So does John Bolton's departure from the White House suggest a change in US foreign policy?No matter what the answer is, the United States should reflect on its "America first" foreign policy over the past couple of years, which has heightened tensions and sparked frictions in many parts of the world.In June 2017, Washington withdrew from the Paris climate accord, undermining the global efforts to fight climate change. In May 2018, it pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal, which was reached after intensive talks among major world powers to ease tensions in the Middle East. The heightened tensions that followed the US' decision almost sparked a war.And last year, it unilaterally imposed additional tariffs on imports from various countries, especially China. Accusing China of forced technology transfer, it refuses to see reason and has instead intensified the trade row.Worse, in violation of the three Sino-US communiqués, Washington has continued to sell arms to Taiwan, increasing uncertainties across the Straits. It has also beefed up its forces in the Asia-Pacific region, with its navy frequently transgressing Chinese waters in the name of freedom of navigation.In its desperate attempts to "make America great again", the US administration has resorted to trade protectionism, throwing the world economy out of gear. And Washington's "maximum pressure" and unilateral actions, from sanctions against Iran to tariffs on Chinese goods, are threatening overall global stability.Because by the time Bolton became national security adviser — on April 9, 2018 — the US administration was already pushing ahead with its "America first" strategy, his departure is not likely to bring about any major changes in the US foreign policy. Let us be clear: Bolton was fired not for being a foreign policy hawk, but because of his disagreements with the US president on some major issues.That the US administration will realize the harm it has caused to the world and change its ways is a welcome thought but too good to be true.

                Doubt casts on Afghan election as insecurity intensifies
            </a>
            <p>
                KABUL -- The increased Taliban onslaught and deteriorating security have spelled fear among the war-weary Afghans ahead of presidential polls.An Afghan presidential election hopeful has asked for postponement of the upcoming presidential election, believing people would not attend the process due to the harsh security situation.The Sept 28 poll will be the fourth presidential election in Afghanistan since 2001, when the United States invaded the country following the Sept 11 attacks, ousting the Taliban regime.Addressing a gathering of his election campaign, Ibrahim Alokozay citing the critical security situation, said that "holding an inclusive and transparent election was impossible under the current deteriorating security."According to him, the poll results would not eventually be acceptable if the process was held under the current circumstances.The countdown for the upcoming poll has already begun, particularly when the United States canceled the talks with the Taliban, after the militants' claimed suicide car bombing that killed two foreign soldiers, including an American, and 11 others in the Afghan capital Kabul.The Taliban militants intensified fighting across the country after US President Donald Trump tweeted that he has called off negotiations with the Taliban group, blaming it for having no power to continue the peace process.Some Afghan citizens cast doubt on the election process and say people would not dare to join the polling centers for tough security reasons."We are facing growing insecurity, everywhere is fighting, people will not dare to go to the voting centers and I will not attend the process," Daud Nejrabi, a Kabul resident told Xinhua, adding that the peace process must be resumed to have a possible peaceful and inclusive presidential election in the country.Another Kabul resident and a government employee, Suraya Raiszada said she dares not to go to the election polls as Taliban militants have warned to target anyone who goes to vote."We are receiving death threats on a daily basis, from the militants in big cities and districts as well, in case we attend the presidential election. The security must be strengthened and the security of polling stations must be guaranteed before the polls," she said, hoping the security forces could remove all security challenges for the people to attend the election.Taliban militants have boycotted the election, warning they will disrupt the process.The extremist group has attacked three provincial capitals and overrun several districts within the past two weeks, causing heavy casualties on security forces and civilians.Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani and election commission officials are consistently emphasizing that the vote would be held on the scheduled date and that the militants did not have the ability to disrupt the process.Meanwhile, Afghanistan's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Adela Raz has recently said that the Afghan government was committed to holding a transparent, free, credible and inclusive election.Some 9.6 million eligible registered voters are expected to cast ballots in more than 5,300 polling centers across the country.
