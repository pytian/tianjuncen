                Harvey Weinstein pleads not guilty, rape trial delayed to January
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                 NEW YORK -- Former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein pleaded not guilty on Monday to a new indictment as his upcoming criminal trial was pushed back to January, in a case where prosecutors have accused him of rape and predatory sexual assault.Weinstein, 67, entered his plea in a New York state court in Manhattan, where his trial was delayed by four months, to Jan 6, 2020. He had faced a Sept 9 trial date.The new indictment accuses Weinstein of two counts of predatory sexual assault, stemming from alleged assaults against two women, in 2006 and 2013. Those charges are essentially the same as those in the previous indictment against Weinstein, and prosecutors moved Monday to consolidate the two cases.However, the new indictment also comes with a disclosure that a third woman will be called to testify that Weinstein raped her in 1993 to bolster the prosecutors' case. Weinstein cannot be charged directly with raping that woman, actress Annabella Sciorra, because the statute of limitations has run out.New York Supreme Court Justice James Burke, who is presiding over the case, had previously ruled that Sciorra could not testify because the grand jury that returned the earlier indictment had not heard any evidence about her alleged rape."I commend Annabella for her willingness to take the stand and answer questions under oath," Sciorra's lawyer, Gloria Allred, said in a statement on Monday.Donna Rotunno, one of Weinstein's lawyers, said after the hearing that Weinstein would seek to dismiss the new indictment, calling the case "weak."Once among Hollywood's most powerful producers, he has pleaded not guilty to five criminal charges in the earlier indictment, including rape and predatory sexual assault. He could face a life sentence if convicted.The two women in the earlier indictment are among roughly 70 who have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct dating back decades. Weinstein has denied the allegations and said any sexual encounters were consensual.Lawyers for Weinstein have asked that the trial be moved, perhaps to Suffolk County on Long Island or to Albany County upstate, because intense media scrutiny in New York City would make it impossible for him to get a fair trial there, according to a court filing.REUTERS

                    US bringing back death penalty
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                After a gunman killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, synagogue last year, US President Donald Trump told reporters that the perpetrator "should really suffer the ultimate price. I think they should very much bring the death penalty into vogue."Now the federal government is reinstating the death penalty after it was dormant for 16 years following authorization from Congress and signing by Trump.US Attorney General Bill Barr made the announcement on Thursday: "The Justice Department upholds the rule of law — and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system."He didn't say why executions were resuming, but Trump has been a vocal supporter of the death penalty.For 16 years, a combination of successful appeals, limited access to lethal-injection drugs and an effective moratorium during the Obama administration prevented new executions by the federal government. During that time, states carried out executions, as they do now.The US Department of Justice (DOJ) said the decision was made related to "five death-row inmates convicted of murdering, and in some cases torturing and raping, the most vulnerable in our society — children and the elderly".DOJ said the executions of five men have been scheduled for December and early 2020, by lethal injection at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana.All five to be executed have exhausted appeals and have no legal obstacles to prevent their deaths.Barr also directed the government to change the mixture of three drugs used for federal executions to just a single drug — phenobarbital — a barbiturate that in high doses causes respiratory arrest.The use of the drug has been upheld by the Supreme Court and has been used in the executions of 200 inmates in 14 states since 2010.Barr's announcement comes as the number of executions in the US has declined over the last decade amid concerns about whether capital punishment disproportionately affects black people.According to the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), currently 42 percent of death row inmates are white, 41.5 percent are black, 13.5 percent are Latino, and about 3 percent are listed as other.US Census Bureau data show that as of July 2018, the US black population was 13.4 percent.Ruth Friedman, the director of the Federal Capital Habeas Project, called the federal death penalty "arbitrary, racially biased, and rife with poor lawyering and junk science".Democratic presidential hopefuls denounced Barr's order.US Senator Kamala Harris, a former California prosecutor, tweeted that "capital punishment is immoral and deeply flawed''.US Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said "the death penalty is not only ineffective and immoral, but also fraught with biases against people of color, low-income individuals and those with mental illness. It is a waste of taxpayer dollars and does nothing to improve public safety.''US Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts tweeted: "Our criminal justice system has a long history of mistakes when it comes to capital punishment — especially when it comes to Black and Brown people. We cannot let a broken system decide the fate of incarcerated Americans. I oppose the death penalty."Bernie Sanders, US senator from Vermont, also spoke out against the decision, tweeting: "There's enough violence in the world. The government shouldn't add to it."Public support for the death penalty, which reached a four-decade low in 2016, has increased somewhat. Today, 54 percent of Americans favor the death penalty for people convicted of murder, while 39 percent are opposed, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in April and May 2018.Two years ago, 49 percent favored the death penalty for those convicted of murder, the lowest level of support for capital punishment in surveys dating to the early 1970s.In 1972, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling, halted all executions in the US, ruling that state death-penalty statutes were too arbitrary, but then reinstated it in 1976. The justices further narrowed the situations where capital punishment could be used in 1977.The government has put to death three defendants since restoring the federal death penalty in 1988, most recently in 2003, when Louis Jones was executed for the 1995 kidnapping, rape and murder of a young female soldier.There are at least 60 federal prisoners on death row, including Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who gunned down nine black parishioners in a Charleston, South Carolina church in 2015, according to the Justice Department and the DPIC.

                    S.Korea's top court orders review of ruling on ousted president Park's bribery case
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                SEOUL - South Korea's top court on Thursday ordered the review of the appellate court's rulings on the bribery case of impeached and ousted President Park Geun-hye, involving Park's longtime friend Choi Soon-sil and Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong.The Supreme Court returned the case to the appeals court, saying the bribery case, involving Park, should be ruled separately from other charges, including abuse of power and coercion, under the election law.The separate rulings raise a possibility for the impeached president to face a heavier punishment.Park was sentenced to 25 years in prison and fined 20 billion won (17 million US dollars) in August last year by an appeals court, which raised the lower court's sentence of the 24-year imprisonment.The appeals court condemned Choi, Park's decades-long confidante, to 20 years in jail, upholding the district court's ruling.The 13-justice bench also ordered the appellate court to review the case of Lee, an heir apparent of Samsung Group, South Korea's biggest family-controlled conglomerate.The top court convicted the Samsung heir of more bribery charges, increasing the acknowledged amount of bribes Lee offered to Park and Choi from 3.6 billion won (three million US dollars) to five billion won (4.1 million US dollars).The increased amount of bribe raises a possibility for Lee to be jailed as the jail term of three years or longer bans the suspended sentence. By law, offering at least five billion won (4.1 million US dollars) in bribery faces at least five years in prison.Lee was sentenced by a district court in August 2017 to five years in prison over bribery, but he was released from prison in February 2018 as the appellate court reduced his sentence to two and a half years in prison with a stay of execution for four years.The Supreme Court ruled that the Samsung heir offered bribes in return for illicit favors relevant to the inheritance of management control over Samsung Group from his father. Chairman Lee Kun-hee who has been hospitalized for more than five years.The country's national pension fund voted in favor of the 2015 merger between Cheil Industries and Samsung C&T, the two Samsung units merged to create Samsung's de-facto holding company. The merger helped Lee strengthen his management control over the entire conglomerate.The corruption scandal disclosed the country's inveterate collusive ties between politicians and businessmen, under which large conglomerates grew rapidly but distorted order of the market economy, eventually causing loss to the entire economy.All the defendants did not appear in court for the rulings. Park refused to attend any court hearings since October 2017, calling the trial a political revenge.Park was impeached by lawmakers in December 2016. The Constitutional Court upheld the parliament's decision in March 2017, making her the first South Korean leader to be impeached by the National Assembly.
