                China's monetary policy seen in 70-year perspective
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                 Reflections of Monetary Reform Challenges in PerspectiveI will never forget the day I arrived in China in 1981 in late spring. On that first moment on a hot spring day, the equation of China's future currency evolution and monetary policy would be spelled out in a single equation of simple events that would occur that afternoon.Beijing airport seemed empty. In those days the only airport terminal was T1 and there were no direct flights coming from the US. We had to transit in Tokyo overnight, arriving by Japan Airlines, which only ran a few times a week to Beijing. That is how little international communication China had in 1981.My first clear memory from leaving Beijing was taking a long drive into Beijing on a narrow road lined with poplar trees, and stopping at the Friendship Store. There I changed my U.S. dollars for something called the "FEC", Foreign Exchange Certificates, then valued nearly 1 to 1 with the U.S. dollar. Of course, given China's low foreign exchange reserves at that time, it was an artificial valuation, based on an old, Soviet style trading system that was restricted and buffered by having two currencies instead of one. Basically the yuan was a local currency used domestically for local goods and services. The FEC was a semi-convertible intermediary currency between the RMB and foreign currencies that was convertible with conditions.That afternoon, I spent $1 to purchase a Coca-Cola. By teachers criticized me, being from a capitalist country like United States, I'm spending so much money, maybe a large portion of their month's salary on a mere soft drink. Most Chinese in those days had access to only one kind of soft drink called "QISHUI". It came in all colors, from Miami pink to purple to golf course green, which looked more like the colors some punk rock singers might dye their hair with rather than a drink one might wish to consume.In that tin of Coke that day lay the dilemma of China's entire foreign exchange and currency reform challenge that would play out over the next 40 years.As I left the Friendship Store, I saw many Chinese standing outside, wearing white thin shirts. So thin, you could even see their undershirts. They either wore green or blue pants, depending on they either wanted to associate with army or worker. Everyone outside was trying to figure out how to get inside. They wanted to obtain the Foreign Exchange Certificates to allow them to purchase imported items that were only available in the Friendship Store, primarily for the diplomatic community as most of the embassies were nearby.There was suddenly an unofficial market between the US dollar or other foreign currencies, and the yuan itself. There was also another informal price differential between the foreign currency and the foreign exchange certificate, as the value of the certificate did not represent the value of the yuan on the actual market. Moreover, the Foreign Exchange Certificate served as an access pass that allowed one to enter the Friendship Store to purchase foreign goods. Therefore, the FEC had a higher value than the currency value itself.The experience in 1981 gave me at least a foundation understanding of the dilemma that China faced, stepping out from a central-planned system and moving toward a market economy, then a globalized economy. To understand the future direction of China's globalization of the yuan currency, one must keep in perspective the situation from which China came out of in the 1980s and the broader perspective of overall stability required to have an effective and sustainable reform opening and eventual influence on the global stage.Birth of the renminbi as a new nation’s currencyOn the day that the People's Bank of China was founded, Dec 1, 1948, the renminbi, or yuan, was issued as China's legal tender. After 1949, the People's Bank of China began to fix renminbi exchange rates against foreign currencies to promote foreign trade and investment. Nevertheless, price levels continued to vary from region to region: Branches of the PBOC were setting their own exchange rates without regard to the fledgling central monetary policy of the time.On July 8, 1950, the head office of the PBOC was authorized to publish national exchange rates; this was China's first real attempt to establish a unified monetary system. The State-owned foreign trade corporations were soon established, and foreign trade began to be conducted through these entities. In line with the command economics of the time, the exchange rate was then fixed based on a weighted average of three apparently unrelated and irrelevant factors: The costs of major export goods traded in volume, a profit margin for private traders and an index of daily essentials for a family of four. The result was that exchange rates were adjusted whenever it was felt necessary, and large fluctuations were frequent.In an economy of past scarcity, the fact that the yuan was not convertible was due to an established trade system that was largely structured to control both commodity and cash flows. From 1980, the Foreign Exchange Certificate was issued as a partially convertible currency principally for foreign use. During the 1980s, it became a tool for rationing consumer commodities – particularly imports – and providing a means of stopping the drain on China's foreign exchange reserves.China's need for both raw materials and technology imports, combined with growing domestic consumer demand for foreign products, eventually made the FEC a part of the demand for foreign products and a part of the regulatory mechanism, until its abolition in 1993.That China has brought its currency to the threshold of convertibility illustrates the success of a series of carefully planned moves involving experimentation and re-evaluation of policy. The emergence of a freely convertible renminbi will clearly mark China's entry into the community of world economic and trading powers.The renminbi's past non-convertibility must be viewed in conjunction with the Government's concern over the control of domestic resources and its fear of the depletion of national foreign exchange reserves, future renminbi devaluations, and the acquisition of external debt. Consequently, the policy of allowing the Renminbi to become a convertible currency was considered in the light of China's economic reforms, its trade surpluses linked to a successful export promotion policy, and its determination to open up economically to the outside world.To some extent, China may have perceived the problem as being partially resolved by the return of Hong Kong in 1997, an event which in itself would make China the first socialist country in the world to have inherited an international traded convertible currency - the Hong Kong Dollar.1997 Asian financial crisis envisions a new global monetary policyThe idea of creating financial resilience to the volatility of the USA-manipulated financial system emerged during the 1997 Asian financial crisis lessons. China refused to devalue the yuan against IMF advice and moreover challenged the hedge funds in the HK market. China's firm resilience to devaluation pressures in turn stabilized the region and led to the eventual revitalization of Asia.A decade later, in 2008 the cards were reversed as the American sub-prime crisis imploded into a global financial crisis due to the deregulation and hyper leveraging policies of the then Bush administration. The response, quantitative easing, a policy of purchasing debt to issue more currency against debt – cementing the debt conundrum – would become the hallmark of American monetary and debt policy for the next decade. It was clear that such an approach could create further global volatility.In 2008 Asian countries convened with China the Chiang Mai Initiative calling for an Asian monetary fund to resist speculation. By 2012 the BRICS countries at their annual meeting in its Delhi Declaration noted the irresponsibility of the USA Fed and quantitative easing, and called for new institutions to establish resilience against the old economic order. 2015 AIIB and BRICS Development Bank were formed.The vision was a new financial architecture that is South-South supported financially, and sensitive to issues of development and resilience. The policies of these institutions are made by those nations that have come out from underdevelopment for those nations about to undergo the same experience. So experiences are relevant. China did not believe in political conditions or imposition of cultural values. It has been more concerned with financing the infrastructure and connectivity to get people out from underdevelopment, end poverty, and make nations competitive.Critical is the emergence of a new global order, comprising the nations of the developing south, whose collective experience and challenges can be overcome through exchanges of experience, collaborative infrastructure investment, and coordinated financial policy.The success of such a vision of a new global monetary policy approach lies in the eventual globalization of the yuan currency and the emergence of the yuan as a reserve currency for the global south. That reserve currency can take one or two forms, either Yuan as an actual reserve currency; two, the Yuan as a major weighed currency in the basket of currencies of denominated currency that could be issued by the new development bank. Or it is the combination of these with the alignment of countries creating a regional Belt and Road Currency. Any of these options are not exclusive of each other and they can all come to play.The key of success to this is that once the yuan is a reserve currency, the ability of the US to control global finance will have ended. It would be effectively the liberation of the global south from the controls of Washington and Wall Street. This may offer temporary chaos in the markets of America. In a long term, it will be globally stabilizing for all markets by creating diversity and democratization for our financial system.The history of the yuan's evolution from a highly restricted, fixed currency of an old, state-planned system to its emergence as a potential global reserve currency has been a process consistent with China's approach to development: gradual, systematic and sustained, rather than shocking or a sudden. The entire process is counterintuitive to western economic and political mindsets. That is why they continue to question it, because they cannot understand it.The author is the founding director of the Himalayan Consensus and a senior international fellow at the Center for China and Globalization.

                    IMF needs reforms to meet new challenges
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                As a significant multilateral organization, the International Monetary Fund has played an effective role in promoting economic globalization. To begin with, the IMF has helped advance globalization and international trade. It is committed to boosting and better balancing global trade, while helping IMF member states establish a multilateral payment system with the aim of removing the foreign exchange limits that impede the development of global trade. In particular, the IMF has opposed trade protectionism since the China-US trade conflict intensified, and warned that the rise of protectionism is harmful to global economic growth. In fact, Christine Lagarde, the outgoing managing director of the IMF, called on countries to make efforts to build an open and rule-based multilateral trading system. The IMF has facilitated the orderly flow of state-owned capital, while encouraging member states, especially developing countries, to promote capital account openness. But after the 2008 global financial crisis, the IMF's attitude toward capital flow has changed; it has begun focusing more on management of capital flow. On the whole, the IMF still emphasizes the free flow of capital as long as the extent of the flow does not exceed the financial capacity of a country, saying that once a country's capital flow exceeds its capacity, the IMF would be forced to regulate the capital flow, even impose capital control. Which means countries can enjoy the benefits of the globalization of capital, but have to take measures to reduce its negative effects. The IMF has also helped stabilize globalization. For example, to minimize risks at the international and national levels, the IMF put forward policies and suggestions aimed at guaranteeing global financial and economic stability, so as to boost the movement of goods, services and capital among different countries. It has also issued reports to assess and analyze the potential financial risks and vulnerability of major economies. Moreover, the IMF helps crisis-stricken countries recover and return to the growth track. For instance, it offers credit instruments which can provide financial support for member states, including standby credit facility, to balance their international payments in the short term, extended financing facility in the long run, and rapid financing instruments to meet the international payment demand. It also offers precautionary financing to prevent and deal with economic crises. But the IMF faces challenges, too, because of the decline of multilateralism. As the largest shareholder of the IMF, the United States is critical to its funding. But that the US has taken advantage of the bilateral currency swap agreement to maintain its financial stability suggests the US is now less interested in multilateralism in international financing. With the US administration turning its back on multilateral mechanisms, the IMF's problems are likely to increase. To some extent, the IMF has encountered difficulties due to a lack of financial resources. For example, its lending capacity has lowered, and as the new borrowing arrangement will expire by the end of 2022, its financial resources could shrink to half their present size if a new arrangement is not put in place. Plus, the lack of financial resources will undermine the IMF's capacity to defend globalization. The delay in reform has weakened the IMF's governance structure. Emerging economies have become more important for global economic development. Yet the IMF's governance structure is not fully adaptive to the new changes to promote global economic development, especially because there is a huge gap between the share of emerging markets in the world economy and their voting rights in global financial institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. With Lagarde scheduled to leave office on Sept 12, the new IMF chief needs to be aware of the potential challenges, and make strenuous efforts to maintain the IMF's position at the core of the global financial system, by enhancing the solidarity of member states and strengthening the IMF's financial resources, in order to prevent the global financial security system from weakening. The new chief also has to continue promoting structural reforms in the IMF in accordance with the current global economic trend, and optimize the organization's functions in order to better promote global economic development.

                IMF: Global GDP expected to rise 3.2 percent in 2019, 3.5 percent next yearChina's economic prospects remain robust despite sluggish global growth and the ongoing trade friction with the United States, officials and economists said on Friday."The country's positive economic fundamentals and long-term trajectory remain unchanged," Ning Jizhe, deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission, said at the China Development Forum Special Session in Beijing on Friday.China has all the confidence as well as capability to meet projected targets for economic and social development as the economy has strong resilience, great potential and ample room to maneuver, Ning said.The world's second-largest economy expanded by 6.3 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2019, the fastest growth among all major economies worldwide, he said.Global growth remains sluggish, with trade tensions being the biggest downside risk, said Gita Gopinath, director of the Research Department at the International Monetary Fund.Additional tariffs between China and the US, including those already implemented and those announced－if they take effect－could cause a "quite significant" impact on global growth by reducing global GDP by 0.8 percent in 2020, Gopinath said at the session.Global GDP growth is forecast at 3.2 percent in 2019 and is expected to improve to 3.5 percent next year, according to the IMF's World Economic Outlook released in July. Some analysts believe the IMF may downgrade forecasts in an updated outlook due out next month after some major economies reported softer growth for the second quarter.China's growth is slowing down but remains "relatively robust", with HSBC's latest forecast for China's growth standing at 6.2 percent this year and 5.8 percent next year, Stephen King, a senior economic adviser at the bank, said on the sidelines of the session."By the standards of other countries, it (China's growth) is still very impressive," King said, adding that supply-side reforms and monetary and fiscal stimuli are expected to be stepped up over the next 12 months and partially offset impacts of the trade friction.Over the long run, multiple factors should continue to drive China's growth, including closer connections between inland regions and the rest of the country as well as with Asia as a whole, and these will play "a big part" as the Belt and Road Initiative bears more fruit, he added.In the face of downside pressure from abroad and at home, China will take stronger countercyclical measures including accelerating the issuance of special local government bonds and promoting a reduction in actual interest rates, Ning said.The People's Bank of China will cut the required reserve ratio for financial institutions by 0.5 percentage point starting Sept 16, injecting more liquidity into the economy, the central bank announced on Friday.Ning added that China will continue to pursue higher-quality opening-up to accelerate reforms and development.Specifically, China is aiming to deepen practical international cooperation, expand access for foreign investment and create a world-class business-friendly environment.He said the country will eliminate all remaining restrictions outside of negative lists for the access of foreign investment. And it will expedite drafting of supportive rules and regulations for the Foreign Investment Law, which will take effect on Jan 1.Pascal Soriot, CEO of global biopharmaceutical giant Astra-Zeneca, spoke highly of China's key opening-up moves, saying, "It will stimulate investment from overseas to China and boost innovation in the country."Soriot said he thinks innovation remains the most resilient part of the Chinese economy as the country transitions from making low-cost items to focusing on innovation and new technologies."The economy in China will still be robust this year," he added. " (Growth) will be a little bit less than expected, but it will still be more than 6 percent. We are constantly increasing our investment in China and expanding our presence to more regions of China."

                    IMF to consider sole candidate Kristalina Georgieva for managing director
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                WASHINGTON - The executive board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced on Monday that it will consider the nomination of Bulgaria's Kristalina Georgieva, currently chief executive officer of the World Bank, for the position of IMF managing director.Georgieva, selected by the European Union to lead the IMF, has become the only nominee for the position, as the period for submitting nominations closed on Friday. She served on the European Commission and has been chief executive officer of the World Bank since January 2017.The IMF approved the removal of the age limit for the position of managing director last week, paving the way for 66-year-old Georgieva to head the multilateral lender.Previously, the IMF's bylaws had prohibited the appointment of a candidate aged 65 or over as managing director and had also prohibited the managing director from serving past his/her 70th birthday.In July, Christine Lagarde announced her resignation as IMF chief from Sept. 12 shortly after she was nominated for the presidency of the European Central Bank (ECB), triggering a selection process for the global lender's next managing director.In early August, Georgieva narrowly defeated former Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem and emerged as EU's choice to lead the IMF, after EU countries failed to reach a consensus on a single candidate.Britain had actively promoted its former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne for the post, but later decided to support Georgieva as it didn't manage to garner enough support for Osborne, according to media reports.Georgieva, who would become the first eastern European national to head the IMF, "has confirmed willingness to be considered as a candidate," the executive board said in the statement. The board's goal is to complete the selection process "as soon as possible," at the latest by Oct 4.The position of IMF chief has always been held by Europeans while the top job at the World Bank has traditionally been American, an informal arrangement that has stayed in place for over seven decades.Earlier this year, David Malpass, former undersecretary for international affairs at the US Treasury Department, was chosen by US President Donald Trump as a candidate to lead the World Bank, and he took office in April after a campaign without competition.

                    US agenda shouldn't be driven by irrationality: China Daily editorial

                With Chinese and US trade negotiators preparing to hold their next round of talks in early October in Washington, hopes are high that substantial progress would be made to at least de-escalate tensions, if not resolve all bilateral trade disputes.The trade war launched by the United States on China, which has already stretched into a second year, has dealt a blow to not only the two economies but also the world economy as a whole.The International Monetary Fund has forecast "sluggish" global growth for 2020, citing the Sino-US trade tensions as a major factor. "We are seeing the effects of the trade tensions more starkly on global trade and on industrial production and manufacturing," said IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath.But despite this, there is cacophony in Washington, which sounds even more disruptive at the moment, raising doubts over how serious the White House is about cutting a deal with China.Peter Navarro, director of the White House National Trade Council, recently resorted to his favorite pastime of China bashing while talking to the media. He claimed that China had committed the "seven deadly sins", ranging from forced technology transfer to currency manipulation.Anyone with even the basic knowledge about trade and economics can tell that Navarro is talking nonsense. The author of Death by China lets his emotions run wild when it comes to anything related with China. For instance, he believes that tariffs on Chinese imports are not causing a rise in the prices of US consumer goods, even though statistics from many organizations such as the Consumer Technology Association suggest otherwise.He also believes China, not the US, is the only one suffering the pains caused by the trade war, even though Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has said "26 times" that he's cutting interest rates because of trade difficulties with China.Given that he is prone to directing his bile at China, people wonder what kind of advice he has for the US negotiating team heading into the next round of trade talks with its Chinese counterpart.Trade talks are all about give and take. Whenever possible, China has been willing to do whatever it can to find a way out of the current stalemate because that serves both sides' interest.But that would happen only when both sides talk reason. If the US negotiating team lets irrational minds like Navarro's hijack its agenda to take on China, the opportunities to resolve the trade disputes will become even more elusive.

                Gestures seen as prelude to 'productive' talksLeading US business groups have said they expect that the latest goodwill gestures demonstrated by the governments of the two countries locked in a protracted trade war would usher in "productive" talks and put an end to tariff increases.US President Donald Trump announced plans Wednesday to delay a planned tariff increase on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports by two weeks, until Oct 15. China also said earlier in the day that it was exempting 16 types of US products from duties.This was followed by reports that Chinese firms bought at least 10 boatloads of US soybeans on Thursday, the country's most significant purchases since at least June, Reuters reported."We hope this announcement, combined with other confidence-building measures from both governments, will create the conditions necessary for productive trade negotiations and end the cycle of tit-for-tat retaliatory actions," the Washington-based US-China Business Council (USCBC) said in a statement on Thursday.Late Thursday afternoon, Trump said he doesn't want an interim deal."I'd rather get the whole deal done," he told reporters.Earlier Thursday in Beijing, Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He said in a meeting with USCBC Chairman Evan Greenberg that the entire world looks forward to seeing progress in trade consultations between China and the United States.The USCBC represents about 200 American companies that do business with China, including some of the world's best-known brands.Liu said that working groups of both sides will meet next week and have "earnest discussions" on the trade balance, market access, protection of investors and other issues of common concern, according to a Xinhua report.Greenberg said the US business sector does not want to see a rise in tariffs, and hopes that the two countries will solve their differences through consultations and bring bilateral trade back to normal.The remarks were echoed by USCBC President Craig Allen in Washington."Tariffs are a tax on our businesses and consumers — the impact on supply chains and company confidence is clearly hurting the economy," Allen said, adding that unilateral imposition of tariffs makes US companies less competitive in the global arena."We urge both sides to work toward eliminating tariffs, realize the concrete progress that is possible today, and build momentum for longer-term negotiations on the most challenging issues," he said.Jennifer Safavian, executive vice-president of government affairs of the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), said leading US retailers are hopeful the president's gesture of goodwill in delaying the tariff increases will lead to productive talks between the two countries next month."A resolution is sorely needed that puts an end to the tariff increases," Safavian said.RILA represents more than 200 retailers, product manufacturers and service suppliers, which together account for more than $1.5 trillion in annual sales, millions of American jobs and more than 100,000 stores."Consumer confidence is the one pillar of strength in the US economy, and the president's tariff strategy is threatening that, as higher prices will be imposed on consumer goods with increased tariffs," Safavian said."Negotiating a path forward that puts an end to the erratic tariff increases and provides some dose of certainty to businesses should be the goal for the October trade discussions," she said.The International Monetary Fund said Thursday that the rising trade and geopolitical tensions have increased uncertainty, taking a toll on business confidence, investment and global trade."Our latest estimate is that … the US-China tariffs, including those implemented and announced, could potentially reduce the level of global GDP by 0.8 percent in 2020, with additional losses in future years," IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said at a briefing.Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, also said in a statement Wednesday that increasing tariffs are giving the stock market whiplash, and consumers are getting worried — last month consumer sentiment dropped almost 10 percentage points.
