                             In an interview with China Daily in Beijing, Manele said such claims "are not true" and that the decision to establish diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China is based on international law and national interests. "As the international consensus and international law has laid the foundation, and China's development has brought opportunities, it has become an inevitable choice for these countries to independently and unconditionally establish diplomatic ties with China," she said. Noting that there are only a handful of countries that have not established diplomatic relations with China, Wang said visionary people in those countries will increasingly speak up for justice in keeping with the trend of the times

Over the past seven decades, the Chinese nation has stood up and grown prosperous and is becoming strong; all basic rights of the people are better respected and protected; and China has made regular contribution to the international cause of human rights, the white paper said. "Living a happy life is the primary human right," the document said, adding that China regards the rights to subsistence and development as the primary and basic human rights and has been improving the rights of its people in a coordinated manner since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, especially after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012

                            Business leaders call on both countries to avoid harm to trade brought by tariffs The United States and China can resolve their disagreements by rebuilding trust and avoiding the harm to trade brought by tariffs, experts and business leaders said after the two countries concluded two days of talks in Washington on Friday. Officials from both sides also discussed arrangements for further talks in Washington in October, the 13th round of China-US high-level economic and trade consultations, the statement said. Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing-based think tank, said that both sides must be aware that reaching an agreement is only the beginning of the process

China was called a "thuggish regime" for even bringing this up — naturally, the "free press" was all crickets when it came time to do their purported jobs and speak a little truth to power. Because the US has the largest economy and military many times over, however, leaders who might otherwise speak out against this treatment stay silent.

Could these people have been Jun's ancestors?Later, when searching for online information about the site, we learned that archaeologists had discovered a cache of broken pieces of ancient pottery there, including the legs of ding caldrons.But I didn't mind that our site would never make headlines or rank as one of the greatest finds of the century, because it held a different kind of magic

In his meeting with Ceausescu next day, Nixon said that, even short of the ultimate goal of re-establishing full diplomatic relations with China, there could be an exchange of high-level personal representatives. In October 1971, Kissinger returned to China for a publicly announced six-day visit to prepare an agenda for the meetings between Nixon and Chinese leaders and to work out the basic language for the communique that would be issued at the end of the president's trip

                             In more recent times, hostile forces in and outside of China, especially separatists, religious extremists and terrorists, have tried to split China and break it apart by distorting history and facts, according to the document titled "Historical Matters Concerning Xinjiang".The Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region has never been a state called "East Turkistan", so the separatist forces' attempts to incite the Uygurs seeking independence in the name of "East Turkistan" is just a political move to split China, according to a white paper released on Sunday. The paper also stated that at the turn of the 20th century, as "Pan-Turkism" and "Pan-Islamism" made inroads into Xinjiang, separatists in and outside China politicized the geographical concept and manipulated its meaning, inciting all ethnic groups speaking Turkic languages and using Islam to create the theocratic state of "East Turkistan"

On Saturday, China said FedEx was put under investigation after Huawei Technologies claimed the company, without offering any explanation, diverted two parcels destined for addresses in China to the US. The Chinese telecommunications equipment maker said FedEx tried to reroute two other packages sent from Vietnam to Huawei addresses elsewhere in Asia without authorization

Maybe that can explain the contribution of protection; or is it because of advanced research tools?"

                             "These five aspects, taken together, constitute the overall approach to creating a community with a shared future for mankind, depict a bright future for the progress of international relations and represent a major innovation in the theory of major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics," wrote Wang Yi, state councilor and foreign minister, in an article posted on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind, together with the idea of building a new type of international relations featuring fairness, justice and win-win cooperation, is the overarching goal of the nation's major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics. Jin Canrong, a professor of international studies at Renmin University of China, wrote in an article that common development, universal security and shared governance are key elements of the new type of international relations, while a community with a shared future calls for equality, mutual respect, mutual benefit and win-win cooperation among nations

                             US President Donald Trump has said he would like to see a next generation arms control deal with Russia and China to cover all types of nuclear weapons, according to US media reports. Representatives from Russia and the US were to meet in Geneva on Wednesday to explore a new accord to limit nuclear arms that could eventually include China, according to Reuters, which cited senior US officials who requested anonymity. Russia does not plan to deploy new weapon systems on the European part of its territory after the US withdrawal from the INF Treaty, unless new US missiles are installed in Europe, the Russian Permanent Mission to NATO announced after a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council in Brussels on July 5

                             Investments in agricultural research need to be significantly increased to ensure food sustainability and growth of Africa's agricultural research output, he said. He said low investment in agricultural research and development in Africa has resulted a huge domestic resource gap in generating agricultural investments, weakening the continent's chances of reducing the number of undernourished people by 2030. "The African Union should consider establishing a continental agricultural research and development facility which will lobby foreign investment on behalf of African farmers and producers and also assist in exploiting and enhancing Africa's sustainable agricultural potential," he said

Smith, senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a blog that the pomp and circumstance planned for this visit by Trump to Japan shows how important the leader-to-leader approach has been to Abe

An editorial in the Japan Times said the US and Iran are too entrenched and the changes demanded are too great. The newspaper continued that both Iran and the US have given Abe an opportunity to make the case for direct engagement, but all he can propose are general principles and vouch for the other side's good will
