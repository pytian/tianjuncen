                党的十八大以来，以习近平同志为核心的党中央深刻洞察人类前途命运与时代发展大势，紧紧围绕实现“两个一百年”奋斗目标和实现中华民族伟大复兴中国梦，统筹国内国际两个大局，统筹发展安全两件大事，积极推进外交理论和实践创新，为民族复兴尽责，为人类进步担当，谱写了中国特色大国外交新篇章。我们在这里简要回顾一下党的十八大以来，我国在外交领域取得的一些成就。建立多种伙伴关系中国已经与100多个国家和国际组织建立了伙伴关系，其中包括：中拉全面合作伙伴关系（China-Latin America comprehensive cooperative partnership）：2014年7月17日，中国－拉美和加勒比国家领导人会晤在巴西利亚举行。习近平主席同与会各国领导人一致决定建立平等互利、共同发展的中拉全面合作伙伴关系，共同宣布成立中国－拉共体论坛。中美新型大国关系（new type of major-country relationship between the US and China）：2015年9月17日，习近平主席在会见出席第七轮中美工商领袖和前高官对话的美方代表时表示，中国将致力于同美方共同构建中美新型大国关系。新型大国关系（new model/type of major power relationship）是以相互尊重（mutual respect）、互利共赢（mutual benefit and win-win）的合作伙伴关系为核心特征的大国关系，是崛起国（developing country）和既成大国（developed country）之间处理冲突和矛盾的新方式。中英全面战略伙伴关系（China-UK comprehensive strategic partnership）：2015年10月，习近平主席访问英国时，双方就双边关系（bilateral relations）及重大国际和地区热点问题深入交换意见，并达成重要共识（important consensus），决定开启持久（enduring）、开放（inclusive）、共赢（win-win）的中英关系“黄金时代”（a golden era）。中巴全天候战略合作伙伴关系（China-Pakistan all-weather strategic partnership of cooperation）：2015年4月20日，习近平主席在伊斯兰堡同巴基斯坦总理谢里夫举行会谈。双方一致同意将中巴关系提升为全天候战略合作伙伴关系，不断充实中巴命运共同体内涵，致力于中巴世代友好。中沙全面战略伙伴关系（China-Saudi Arabia comprehensive strategic partnership）：2016年1月19日，习近平主席在利雅得同沙特阿拉伯国王萨勒曼举行会谈。两国元首积极评价中沙关系发展，就双边关系和共同关心的国际和地区问题深入交换意见，达成广泛共识，共同宣布建立中沙全面战略伙伴关系，推动双边关系深入发展，取得更大合作成果。中瑞创新战略伙伴关系（China-Switzerland innovative strategic partnership）：2016年4月8日，习近平主席在人民大会堂同瑞士联邦主席施奈德•阿曼举行会谈，两国元首一致决定建立中瑞创新战略伙伴关系，瑞士成为中国首个创新战略伙伴关系国。这是对中瑞双边关系具有丰富而深刻内涵以及重要意义的肯定，开拓创新精神是中瑞关系发展的突出特点（the pioneering and innovative spirit is a distinct feature of China-Switzerland relations）。中以创新全面伙伴关系（China-Israel innovative comprehensive partnership）：2017年3月21日，习近平主席会见以色列总理内塔尼亚胡，宣布双方建立创新全面伙伴关系。中国作为世界经济大国，正在实施创新驱动发展战略（the innovation-driven development strategy），以色列在创新、研发领域具有全球公认的领先地位（world-renowned and leading country in innovation, research and development）。继续深化中以合作仍有巨大潜力，双方在相互尊重和平等基础上致力于开拓和深化创新合作符合两国和两国人民的根本利益，对两国发展具有深远意义。中俄全面战略协作伙伴关系（China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination）：2017年7月4日，习近平主席在莫斯科克里姆林宫同俄罗斯总统普京举行会谈。两国元首决定携手努力，巩固和发展平等信任、相互支持、共同繁荣、世代友好的中俄全面战略协作伙伴关系，更好惠及两国人民和各国人民。中俄关系进入新阶段President Xi Jinping meets with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Sept 3, 2017, in Xiamen, Fujian province. [Photo/Xinhua]In the past five years, President Xi Jinping has visited Russia six times, bringing the number of meetings between the heads of state to more than 20.过去5年间，习近平主席6次出访俄罗斯，两国元首会晤超过20次。China and Russia also made breakthroughs in cooperation on natural gas pipelines, high-speed railways, aerospace and other major projects, in addition to coordination in multilateral mechanisms.两国在多边机制方面协调合同的同时，还在天然气管道、高铁、航空以及其他重点项目合作有突破性进展。The strategic coordination between China and Russia has contributed to regional stability and world peace.中俄两国的战略协作为地区稳定和世界和平作出了贡献。中美关系稳步推进2013年中美元首在美国安纳伯格庄园会晤、2014年在北京会晤。2015年9月22日至25日，习近平主席应时任美国总统奥巴马的邀请对美国进行国事访问。双方达成广泛共识，取得了一系列重要成果，其中包括，积极发展中美新型大国关系（the new model of major-country relationship between China and the United States）、在多个领域进行双边务实合作（bilateral practical cooperation）、在不同层级上深化亚太事务对话，努力构建双方在亚太积极互动、包容合作的关系（deepen dialogue on Asia-Pacific affairs at various levels, endeavor to build a relationship of positive interaction and inclusive cooperation in the Asia-Pacific）等。2017年4月6日，习近平主席与美国总统特朗普在加州海湖庄园（Mar-a-Lago）会晤。会晤期间，中美建立了外交安全对话（Diplomatic and Security Dialogue）、全面经济对话（Comprehensive Economic Dialogue）、执法及网络安全对话（Law Enforcement and Cyber Security Dialogue）、社会和人文对话（Social and Cultural Dialogue）4个高级别对话合作机制。海湖庄园会晤后仅1个月时间，中美双方宣布，已就经济合作百日计划（100-day plan in economic cooperation）早期收获达成10项共识，涉及农业、金融、能源等多个领域（sectors of agriculture, finance and energy）；2017年6月，首轮中美外交安全对话在华盛顿举行；7月，首轮中美全面经济对话举行。“一带一路”倡议广受支持Over 100 countries and international organizations have supported and got involved in this initiative. Important resolutions passed by the UN General Assembly and Security Council contain reference to it.全球100多个国家和国际组织积极支持和参与“一带一路”建设，联合国大会、联合国安理会等重要决议也纳入“一带一路”建设内容。China has signed cooperation agreements with over 40 countries and international organizations and carried out framework cooperation on production capacity with more than 30 countries.中国同40多个国家和国际组织签署了合作协议，同30多个国家开展机制化产能合作。China's investment in other Belt and Road countries has surpassed US$50 billion. Chinese companies have set up 56 economic cooperation zones in over 20 countries, generating some US$1.1 billion of tax revenue and 180,000 jobs for them.中国对“一带一路”沿线国家投资累计超过500亿美元。中国企业已经在20多个国家建设56个经贸合作区，为有关国家创造近11亿美元税收和18万个就业岗位。China has engaged in multiple forms of financial cooperation with countries and organizations involved in the Belt and Road Initiative. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has provided US$1.7 billion of loans for 9 projects in Belt and Road participating countries. The Silk Road Fund has made US$4 billion of investment, and the 16+1 financial holding company between China and Central and Eastern European countries has been inaugurated.中国同“一带一路”建设参与国和组织开展了多种形式的金融合作。亚洲基础设施投资银行已经为“一带一路”建设参与国的9个项目提供17亿美元贷款，“丝路基金”投资达40亿美元，中国同中东欧“16+1”金融控股公司正式成立。Every year, the Chinese government provides 10,000 government scholarships to the relevant countries. China's local governments have also set up special Silk Road scholarships to encourage international cultural and educational exchanges.中国政府每年向相关国家提供1万个政府奖学金名额，地方政府也设立了丝绸之路专项奖学金，鼓励国际文教交流。中国护照含金量提高中国公民护照 （图片来源：新华网）A total of 131 countries have, by the end of July 2017, signed agreements with China on various kinds of mutual visa exemptions. Chinese citizens holding national passports in overseas trips can enjoy visa exemption or visa upon arrival in 64 countries and regions.截止到2017年7月底，已有131个国家与中国签订各种形式的签证互免协议。持有中国护照的公民出境游时可以在64个国家和地区享受免签证或者落地签。积极参与地区合作China has actively participated in regional cooperation mechanisms including the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO); ASEAN-China dialogue; ASEAN-China, Japan and Republic of Korea (ROK) (10+3) dialogue; East Asia Summit; China-Japan-ROK cooperation and Lancang-Mekong Cooperation.中国积极参与地区合作，包括上海合作组织、东盟－中国对话、东盟与中日韩(10+3)对话、东亚峰会、中日韩合作以及澜沧江－湄公河合作。对外援助与维和不含糊China provided $120 million worth of materials and funding and dispatched more than 1,200 medical personnel and public health specialists to the areas affected by Ebola.中国向埃博拉病毒疫情感染地区提供了价值1.2亿美元的物资和资金支持，同时派遣1200多名医护人员和公共卫生领域专家前往疫情感染地区。Currently there are some 2,500 Chinese peacekeepers serving in 10 UN missions across the globe, making China the top contributor of peacekeepers to the UN. China is also the second largest contributor to UN peacekeeping funds.目前，全球各地的10个维和任务点共有2500名中国维和人员，使得中国成为联合国维和外派人员最多的国家。同时，中国向联合国提供的维和资金支持位列全球第二。朝鲜半岛问题很上心In view of recent developments on the Korean Peninsula, China has put forward the proposal of "suspension for suspension", which builds on the "dual-track" approach we proposed earlier. The "dual-track" approach aims to promote parallel progress in denuclearization and the establishment of a peace mechanism on the Peninsula in a synchronized and reciprocal manner, ultimately achieving both goals simultaneously. The "suspension for suspension" proposal, which calls for the suspension of nuclear and missile activities by the DPRK and the suspension of massive military exercises by the US and the ROK, seeks to bring the two sides back to the negotiating table, thus initiating the first step of the "dual-track" approach.中方根据半岛形势的发展，在此前提出“双轨并行”思路以外，又提出了“双暂停”倡议。“双轨并行”旨在按照同步对等原则，并行推进实现半岛无核化和建立半岛和平机制两条轨道，最终予以一并解决。“双暂停”倡议则是通过朝鲜暂停核导活动，美韩暂停大规模军演，推动双方回到谈判桌前，启动“双轨并行”的第一步。综合新华网、中国日报网、外交部官网报道（中国日报网英语点津 马文英）

                Dalian institute is seeking important breakthroughs that can benefit industry immediately, says deputy directorCai Rui believes China is catching up with the West in the technology race.The 41-year-old deputy director of the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, one of China's national-level science institutes, says the country is now making major progress."We are getting closer and closer to the US and countries like the UK. China is moving forward in all areas of research," he says.Cai Rui, deputy director of the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, believes China is catching up with the West in the technology race. Provided to China DailyA report published in December by the European Commission, "The 2017 EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard", pointed to an 18.8 percent increase in research and development spending by some of China's top companies in 2016."We are seeing within our institutions an annual increase in our budget of about 10 percent. We also getting a lot of support from industry as well, since everyone has an interest in investing in technology," he says.General Secretary Xi Jinping, in his report to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October, set the objective for China to become a global technological leader by 2035.With its Made in China 2025 strategy, China also has the more immediate goal of making breakthroughs in such areas as artificial intelligence and robotics.Cai, speaking in a meeting room at the institute's Xinghai campus in Dalian, Liaoning province, says the goals have created a lot of energy, adding that turning them into reality is now part of a general national effort.Cai says that when he returned from the United States in 2010 and "went to the city government and talked to them about supporting ideas, the response was often quite slow. Now they just come to us and ask for our ideas."The Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics is the obvious place to go. It is by far the biggest research institute in Dalian and one of 104 national research institutes under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the country's largest research and development institute.The institute, which was established in 1949, has four campuses where 2,500 people work and study, including 14 members of the CAS and the Chinese Academy of Engineering; 213 professors; 437 associate professors; and around 600 students pursuing PhDs.It attracts 1 billion yuan ($158.9 million; 129.7 million euros; ￡114.9 million) in research funding each year and has 10 international research centers on its campuses in which it collaborates with international partners.Two of its most important collaborations are with British oil conglomerate BP and Saudi Arabian chemicals giant SABIC.With BP, it set up an Energy Innovation Lab in 2008, and with SABIC, it founded the Research Center for Advanced Chemicals Production Technology in 2013."With BP, we have the longest history ... setting up an office here with just one person in 2000. They have about 10 people on campus right now. We have learned a lot from them, particularly in areas like protecting intellectual property and how to negotiate - areas in which scientists often don't have enough knowledge."The SABIC research center is involved in research in a number of areas, including new, fossil and alternative energy as well as fine chemicals and new materials."SABIC is one of the largest chemical companies in the world. The collaboration fits in with the government's Belt and Road policies," adds Cai.Cai says Chinese institutes such as the DICP are often more open to foreigners than their counterparts in the West, particularly in the US."There is research going on here related to national security activities and to spacecraft technology, yet we allow foreigners to join us here. We regard this as perfectly normal, but to work in such a national laboratory in the US, you would probably need a green card at least to do so," he says.The institute is ranked first among CAS institutes for the number of patents it has granted over the past five years and third in terms of the number of academic publications it has published, after the Beijing-based Institute of Chemistry and the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry.Cai admits the institute's strength is in applied research, coming up with breakthroughs that can be of immediate benefit to industry."Our strength is in doing applied research for commercialization. Within the CAS system, we do have a lot of prestigious institutes working on fundamental or blue-sky research. If you go to Beijing to the Institute of Chemistry or the Institute of Physics, 95 percent of the people there will be working on fundamental research. There is a lot of support from government and also the CAS headquarters for this kind of research," he says."At the CPC's 19th National Congress last year Xi Jinping mentioned that fundamental research was the key to China achieving its national goals."Cai, who was appointed deputy director of the institute last year, presents a youthful modern face for the DICP.Fluent in English, he is not a native of Dalian but is from Zhenjiang, Jiangsu province.He studied chemistry at Nanjing University and then moved to Liaoning to get his PhD in physical chemistry at the DICP.However, he has experience in both Chinese and Western scientific academia after spending five years as a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Riverside, before returning to the DICP in 2010 as an associate professor.Cai believes that Chinese academic institutions do not lag behind their Western counterparts in the quality of scientific education. One of the criticisms of the Chinese system is that the quality of teaching at PhD level in China is poorer and more limited and that the thinking is more rigid than at Western universities."I just don't think this is true," says Cai. "China is a big country, and we have many different universities. I think people here are often more diligent and devoted to their studies. Certainly that was my experience when I was at Riverside in California, which is a middle-ranking university in the US," says Cai."It does, however, depend on the institution. While in California I also spent some time at Caltech (the California Institute of Technology), which was a totally different story. Clearly at places like Harvard also, students work very hard."A key effort of the institute is to address China's energy needs. One of the country's major problems is that it has to import most of its oil, much of which has to be shipped through the Strait of Malacca, the narrow shipping lane that connects the Pacific and Indian oceans.Last year, the DICP put into operation the world's first plant capable of producing ethanol from coal. Launched in conjunction with Shaanxi Yanchang Petroleum Group in January last year, it has the capacity to produce 100,000 metric tons of anhydrous ethanol annually."We have to focus on coal in China because we don't have any choice," adds Cai. "We import 60 percent of our oil from overseas and last year probably 65 percent. If our oil supplies had been cut off, what can we do?"The work of the institute is aligned with China's Energy Innovation Action Plan (2016-30) as well as President's Xi's call for an "energy revolution" in terms of consumption, production, technology, policy and international cooperation."Most of us are doing energy-related research. We are trying to develop technologies that are more efficient and produce less pollution. We also have a team working on fuel cells and battery technologies as well as new energy, solar energy and a broad range of other technologies," he says.Cai says it is wrong to see Northeast China, built on traditional heavy industries, as an area of inevitable decline, since these industries can be modernized and play a major role in the country's modernization."These industries are very important and they are the base of this area. We have a lot of existing infrastructure, let alone a lot of workers in these industries. The challenge is to remodel this whole sector and bring in new industries. This really should be the blueprint for the development of Northeast China," he says.Contact the writers at andrewmoody@chinadaily.com.cn( China Daily Africa Weekly 02/16/2018 page8)

                    Britain rolls out red carpet for Saudi prince
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Theresa May have welcomed Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the United Kingdom. While the nation rolled out the red carpet as his three-day visit began on Wednesday, protesters took to the streets to draw attention to the kingdom's involvement in the conflict in Yemen, and to highlight human rights issues. May had said she would raise concerns about human rights and the situation in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has battled Iran-allied rebels since 2015 in a conflict that has claimed 10,000 lives. But May also praised economic and social reforms introduced by the 32-year-old since he became heir apparent to 82-year-old King Salman last year. Changes include allowing women to drive, and lifting a ban on movie theaters. "We want to work together to explore ways we can support the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to progress and intensify these reforms," The Associated Press reported May as saying. "We will also discuss how we can enhance our cooperation in tackling international challenges, including the conflict and humanitarian crisis in Yemen." The BBC said the crown prince noted there were "huge opportunities" to boost trade with Britain and he insisted the nations must cooperate to deal with "failed states ...terrorist and extremist organizations". The UK is hoping to capitalize on Saudi plans to open up and diversify its economy and anticipates 65 billion pounds ($90 billion) of mutual trade and investment opportunities during the next decade, something that will be especially important after the UK leaves the European Union. Metro newspaper reported on Thursday that both supporters of the crown prince and opponents took to the streets as the visit began. In addition to meeting May in Downing Street, the crown prince was meeting her at a summit on Thursday. He had lunch with the queen at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday and dined with Prince Charles and Prince William. He was also set to meet Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson. earle@mail.chinadailyuk.com (China Daily 03/09/2018 page12)

                    British tobacco company looks to China for smoke-free future

                Electronic smoking devices present new opportunitiesLondon-based British American Tobacco has invested an undisclosed amount in China Materialia, a Shanghai-based venture capital fund which will help the cigarette company develop smoking alternatives that do not burn tobacco.British American Tobacco, which is also known as BAT, is the second-largest tobacco company in the world and owns popular cigarette brands including Dunhill, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall. This is the first time BAT has invested in a venture capital fund as part of research and development activity.As the damaging effects of cigarette smoke have become widely accepted, several cigarette companies and dozens of technology firms have developed new devices, including electronic cigarettes, known as e-cigarettes, and vape kits, that deliver nicotine without burning tobacco.“We are excited to be working with China Materialia,” a BAT spokeswoman told China Daily. “It’s still very early days and so we’re limited as to what we can say, however we’re excited about the potential benefits our investment may bring. China is an increasingly important center for technology and innovation – our investment in the fund allows us to tap into this.”The invention of the e-cigarette is often attributed to Chinese medical researcher Hon Lik, and the vast majority of the world’s e-cigarette and vaping hardware is produced in China.Vaping and e-cigarette devices have become popular in the UK, where sales of products reached 1 billion pounds ($1.34 billion) last year. Nine million users in the United States spent $3.7 billion on vape products in 2017.E-cigarettes have yet to catch on in China as they have in the West, and the market has massive potential for growth, according to recent research.A 2017 study by Dublin-based analysts Research and Markets valued China’s domestic e-cigarette industry at $175 million, with an estimated 1 million regular vapers in the country, versus 350 million smokers.Barriers to growth for the e-cigarette industry in China include the relative cost of products when compared to tobacco, and lack of availability of products in bricks-and-mortar stores. Around 80 percent of e-cigarette sales in China occur online, according to Research and Markets.BAT said that the investment in China Materialia will provide the company with access to new and emerging technologies and help with the development of “next generation products”. BAT already owns several vape brands, including Vype, Vuse, Ten Motives and Chic. This year the company will launch Glo, a tobacco-heating device that produces a nicotine-containing aerosol instead of smoke.The company made 500 million pounds from worldwide sales of vaping products last year and estimates that figure will reach 5 billion pounds in the next four years.BAT is one of five corporations to invest in China Materialia in recent funding rounds, including United States-based chemical company BASF, California-based venture capital company GE Ventures, South Korean technology firm Samsung, and Saudi Arabian manufacturing firm Saudi Basic Industries Corporation.“We are absolutely delighted to have five great corporate strategic investors joining China Materialia,” said Min Zhou, chief executive of China Materialia. “Partnership with these corporates can bring tremendous value to our portfolio companies and accelerate their path to commercial scale and global market.”

                    Reflections on the Belt and Road Initiative
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Whenever I hear One Belt, One Road, like many others, I think of the famous ancient Silk Road which developed over many centuries, with one form of it dating back to the Han Dynasty (206 BC to 220 AD) and further developed in the Tang Dynasty (618- 907 AD).This reflected the period in which today’s Xi’an was the capital of China and on my regular visits to Xi’an in the last 10 years, I wondered what it would have been like to head west from there all those centuries ago. However, the term Silk Road (reflecting trade in silk, horses and other items) was only commonly used to describe that route from the 19th Century.A famous city at the Western end of the Asian continent and a city partly in Asia and partly in Europe was, and is, Istanbul in Turkey (thinking back to the Ottoman Empire), which I have also visited - but by plane. In the ancient days, ships had to be used to cross into Europe once in Istanbul, but since 1973 when the first of three bridges were opened across the Bosphorus Straits that separate Europe from Asia, there has been a land route into Europe through Turkey. More recently a train tunnel under the Bosphorus was opened in October 2013, with Turkey’s President Recep Erdogan saying that this “Iron Silk Road” would “link London to Beijing”. Further adding to the connectivity, in December 2016, the first road tunnel under the Bosphorus was opened. In 2017 a freight train loaded with goods from Yiwu in China’s Zhejiang province traveled all the way to Stratford in East London – a journey of 10 days reflecting the reach of the modern-day Silk Road and passing through nine countries, including crossing from France to the UK using the Channel Tunnel.Of course, the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 has both a land and a maritime element, and it not just about reach but also about depth, improving infrastructure in key cities and areas in the many countries to be linked by the project. This infrastructure will include fast train links, highways, new ports, energy supply and transfer and will support trade, commerce, tourism, cultural exchange and interaction and financial investment in a win-win opportunity. Indeed, as President Xi stated in May 2017, at China’s first Belt and Road Summit hosted in Beijing, the BRI is for everyone regardless of geographical location, as any interested country is welcome to join in the investment in the project and supply their expertise. From South-east Asia to Eastern Europe and Africa, BRI currently includes at least 71 countries that account for half the world’s population and a quarter of global GDP. The project may well involve expenditures of over $1 trillion with China contributing over $200 billion – the rational for China’s huge investment is that it will open up many new export markets and help Chinese manufacturers move up the value chain. It is estimated that Chinese companies have secured more than $340 billion in construction contracts along the Belt and Road.A strong “partner” of the BRI is the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), launched by China in January 2016 and headquartered in Beijing but with as many as 84 member countries at the end of 2017, contributing funds to support quality (at affordable cost) infrastructure development and improved connectivity in Asia. The AIIB has a goal of lending between $10 billion and $15 billion a year for the first five or six years of operation. Notable member countries include 42 from the Asia and Pacific (including Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam) and non-regional members including Austria, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and UK. This truly represents a global involvement with the US remaining a noticeable absentee.Many observers consider the 21stCentury to be “Asia’s Century” and the BRI seems certain to strengthen that claim and have a significant impact on economic realignment and progress in the coming decades, BRI also seems to be one of the forces for the further development of globalization in contrast to the pulling back from free trade and investment that Washington has set itself on in the last two years. Personally, I look forward to the next stage of the BRI developments and encouraging American students to familiarize themselves with the initiative.Colin Speakman is at economist and director of programs in Shanghai for CAPA The Global Education Network, a US-based International Education Organization that cooperates with East China Normal University in Shanghai.The opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.

                    Khan's visit an important step forward in China-Pakistan relations
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan recently completed an historic four-day state visit to China where he, alongside his counterpart Premier Li Keqiang, oversaw the signing of 15 memoranda of understanding in different fields. This was Khan’s second state visit to any country since the formation of the new government.After the visit, both countries issued a joint statement announcing the visit a success and a step forward in moving bilateral relations toward a new era of cooperation. The PM visited during a time when Pakistan is facing an imbalance between import payments and is seeking a bailout package from Beijing.During the visit, the Chinese leadership made assurances to Khan they would assist with the current fiscal deficit. China has also agreed to increase imports from Pakistan from the existing level of $1.2 billion to $2.2 billion by the end of 2018-19 and to $3.2 billion by the end of the next fiscal year, underscoring the depth of cooperation between the two nations. This can be considered a huge success for Pakistan amidst the current fiscal deficit and current account deficit. In his meeting with Khan, President Xi Jinping reiterated Pakistan is always a "diplomatic priority" for China, he said this was the beginning of a new era of "stronger" and "deeper" relations between both countries.The importance of this visit can also be understood through the lens of the current situation, where there is skepticism in some parts of international society about China’s alleged "debt trap diplomacy". During the China International Import Expo in Shanghai, Pakistan's finance minister, in an interview with China Global Television Network, stated it was wrong to blame CPEC for Pakistan's debt problem. Pakistan does have a debt problem, he said, but "Pakistan does not have a China debt problem."The current government has inherited a very difficult economic situation and Khan has expressed his intention to seek assistance from friendly countries in order to negotiate a reasonable package to redress the current trade imbalance, rather than seeking International Monetary Fund loans which would place strict terms and conditions on Pakistan’s policymaking. Beijing has been one of the closest allies to Islamabad, and has helped Pakistan through difficult times. Both sides believe their relations have experienced the test of time, despite changes in the geopolitical situation in the region. Their ties have gotten stronger and are constantly moving forward.Khan was accompanied by Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Finance Minister Assad Umer, commerce and trade advisor Abdul Razzak Dawood and Minister of Railways Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad. At the end of the trip, both countries issued a joint statement with the details of the tour. For Pakistan, the tour has been a huge success; Pakistan was looking for an immediate bailout package from Beijing in order to provide breathing space for its economy. Saudi Arabia has already helped Pakistan with $6 billion to stabilize its looming debt crisis, which has helped alleviate immediate concerns. Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi termed the visit “productive and successful”.According to Qureshi, four major areas were discussed during bilateral meetings with their Chinese counterparts. As China and Pakistan enjoy deep strategic relations, an emphasis was made on accelerating multi-dimensional economic footprints. Specifically, the Pakistani government seeks China’s assistance in focusing more on the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor which aims to build special economic zones that directly benefit the population by alleviating poverty in Pakistan and China.Pakistan is looking forward to China's assistance in the agricultural sector especially, in order to adopt more advanced scientific methods for efficiency, and both countries agreed to the transfer of technology in this field. During Imran Khan’s address to students in China's Liberty School, he emphasized he is here to learn from China's experience to curb the challenges of corruption, poverty and urbanization. Khan's current goal with China is to reiterate bilateral relations, and Islamabad is keen to enhance the scope of cooperation and pave the way for fresh investments under CPEC.At the same time, China has made assurances it will assist Pakistan in coping with the challenges it currently faces. Hence, this tour is also important as a way to discuss and cope with the security, geo-strategic and geopolitical challenges that China and Pakistan are facing in the region. China is also keen to be a peace-broker in Afghanistan, and both sides have agreed to hold a trilateral meeting in Kabul to find a way forward building a lasting peace in Afghanistan.In conclusion, cooperation between Beijing and Islamabad is likely to increase under the umbrella of CPEC, which forms part of Xi's Belt and Road Initiative. The times require a maximization in relations, leading to an outcome that directly benefits the masses on both sides. Pakistan needs China's direct assistance in order to lift its population out of poverty, and as Khan said: "Pakistan wants to learn from China’s experience." The success of CPEC can be an example for the international society to join in the vision of the Belt and Road that is destined to create a "community of shared interests".Asif Amin is a doctoral candidate at the School of International and Public Affairs at Jilin University in Changchun, China.

It's the fourth-largest corn producer and the largest exporter of beef and chicken.Last year, China was Brazil's largest export destination and import-source country. Brazil's exports to China amounted to $58.58 billion last year and imports were $28.96 billion. Among the Brazilian exports to China, 43 percent were soybeans and other agricultural products, 22 percent was iron ore, and crude oil accounted for 15 percent.A delegation of 92 Brazilian companies, including the Ronaldo Academy, a franchise of soccer schools established by Brazilian soccer legend Ronaldo Nazario, participate in the CIIE.

                Economic issues, other global concerns on agenda in OsakaEvery year, leaders of the world's 20 largest economies gather to discuss economic and financial matters and coordinate policies on other issues of global significance.Jim O'Neill, chairman of Chatham House, a London-based international affairs think tank, said improved efficiency might be put on the agenda of this year's G20 Summit, which will be held in Osaka, Japan, on Friday and Saturday.O'Neill, who coined the term BRIC for the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China when he was Goldman Sachs' chief economist in 2001 — since expanded to BRICS with the addition of South Africa — said improving efficiency is not easy, but the challenges are not insurmountable.It could be argued that all international bodies frequently struggle to be effective, never mind efficient, he said.The scale of the 2007-08 financial crisis seemed to bring the best out of the G20, O'Neill said. Many countries were happy to try to frame their monetary and fiscal policy response in a collective way, which allowed observers to comprehend the massive scale of their effort, he said."However, what to do when there is no imminent crisis making headlines all over the world?" O'Neill asked.The G20, formed in 1999, brings together the most important industrialized and developing economies to discuss international economic and financial stability. Its annual summit, a gathering of G20 leaders that debuted in 2008, has evolved into a major forum for deliberating economic issues and other pressing global concerns. Bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit have occasionally led to major international agreements or underscored existing hostilities.It comprises 19 countries and the European Union. The countries are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Republic of Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.Because of their size, the countries' policies play a big role in determining the health of the global economy.Together, the nations of the G20 account for around 80 percent of global economic output, nearly 75 percent of all global trade and about 66 percent of the world's population.These figures have remained relatively stable, while the corresponding contributions for the G7, a smaller group of advanced economies, have shrunk as emerging markets take up a relatively greater share of the world's economy, Council of Foreign Relations staff members James McBride and Andrew Chatzky wrote in a backgrounder published recently on the website of the US think tank.While some are skeptical about the G20's usefulness, they said, many observers point out that its membership is more representative of the current international balance of power than other blocs formed earlier like the G7, which came into being in 1976.The G20 initially focused on broad macroeconomic policy, but has expanded its ambit, McBride and Chatzky wrote. Last year's summit in Argentina focused on fair and sustainable development, while the previous one in Germany addressed issues including corruption, money laundering, and international tax havens. At the 2016 summit in China, President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama formally announced their countries' accession to the Paris Agreement on combating climate change.As part of the preparations for the Osaka G20 summit, the world's leading think tanks held a meeting in Tokyo on May 26-27 to work out policy recommendations for the leaders.The meeting, known as the Think 20 or T20, is the research and policy advice network for G20 countries. More than 400 think tank experts from the 20 countries sent a message in Tokyo that political leaders must adhere to the principles of multilateralism despite currents of anti-globalism and economic uncertainty.Naoyuki Yoshino, chairman of T20 Japan and dean of the Asian Development Bank Institute, said the recommendations of the policy experts were based on theoretical and empirical analysis, ensuring that G20 leaders received the most accurate advice."The G20 countries have taken steps closer to the new global goal of a sustainable, inclusive and resilient society with the Paris Agreement and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development but still face challenges on the way ahead," Yoshino said in the T20 Japan statement.He said T20 Japan, through the work of its 10 policy task forces, had produced innovative and evidence-based recommendations to guide the way forward for the global community.In a message posted on the G20's website, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan is determined to lead global economic growth at the Osaka summit by promoting free trade and innovation, achieving both economic growth and the reduction of disparities, and contributing to the development agenda and other global issues with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals at its core.He said Japan will lead discussions on the supply of global commons such as quality infrastructure and healthcare for realizing economic growth around the world, adding that ways to resolve issues such as climate change and the amount of plastic waste in oceans will also be discussed.Wise investmentsThe summit is also expected to address the digital economy and issues that arise from an aging society.Nicholas Stern, chairman of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, said the most important issue for G20 leaders in Osaka is how to generate sustainable and inclusive economic development and growth across the world over the coming decades.Stern, who is also co-chair of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, said G20 nations can safeguard against one potentially important element in future financial crises by prioritizing wise investments in the transition to zero-carbon and climate-resilient growth and development, adding that an inadequate, slow or badly managed transition could destabilize economies, slow or reverse growth, and severely damage the environment.A report published by the World Bank early this year highlighted the huge need for infrastructure to eliminate poverty and raise living standards, with 940 million people living without electricity, 663 million lacking adequate sources of drinking water, 2.4 billion lacking decent sanitation facilities, 1 billion living more than 2 kilometers from an all-season road, and 4 billion people lacking internet access.It found that the spending of developing countries on infrastructure was mostly in the range of 3.5 percent to 5 percent of GDP, and they should be able to build the infrastructure necessary to realize the SDGs through investment equivalent to about 4.5 percent of GDP."Such investments will be of profound importance in our cities, where more than half the world's population now lives and 70 percent of GDP is created, to ensure they are places where we can live, breathe, move safely and be productive," Stern said.The G20 nations must lead by example on this imperative, Stern said, and especially the world's two biggest economies, the US and China."China is demonstrating leadership through its significant investments in zero-carbon energy, particularly renewable power," he said. "China's support for solar power has directly contributed to the astonishingly rapid fall in the production costs of panel units, making it now the cheapest source of electricity in many parts of the world."Stern also noted that China can provide even greater leadership through the Belt and Road Initiative if it encourages the application of robust sustainability tests to investments in new infrastructure in partner countries.He added that G20 nations should be wise with their investments within their own countries and abroad. They should promote the role of international financial institutions, and multilateral development banks in particular, in lowering the cost of capital for sustainable infrastructure."The necessary pace and scale of transition requires a substantial expansion of that role," he said.Stern, a member of the international advisory panel for the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, said that on the back of good management, a strong portfolio and a clear strategy, the AIIB successfully issued its first global bond last month, raising $2.5 billion to support sustainable infrastructure, cross-border connectivity, and environmental, social and governance-related investment practices in emerging economies in Asia.The AIIB's inaugural report on Asian infrastructure finance, published early this year, concluded there has been no significant breakthrough in Asia in mobilizing private capital for infrastructure. It urged more efforts to attract private capital to sustainable infrastructure, and called on multilateral development banks to contribute more toward improving project preparation and country policy frameworks and maintaining supportive conditions by, for instance, providing better information for market players.Stern said the G20 nations can promote sustainable economic growth and development, reduce poverty and improve living standards across the world."But they must move quickly and on scale," he said. "The climate crisis is real and now; delay will be profoundly dangerous."Kevin Gallagher, director of the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University, and Richard Kozul-Wright, director of the Division on Globalization and Development Strategies at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, have appealed to G20 leaders to call for a new multilateralism that combines mission-oriented rules with a commitment to shared prosperity and environmental recovery and that leads by example, with or without the US."A new multilateralism must prioritize the role of global public goods needed to deliver shared prosperity and a healthy planet, promote cooperation and collective action to bring fairness and balance to market outcomes, coordinate policy initiatives to mitigate common risks, and ensure that no nation's pursuit of these broader goals infringes on the ability of other nations to pursue them," they said in a report published at a forum in Osaka on Tuesday organized by China Daily. "In short, we need a global green 'new deal' to reclaim multilateralism."With the US having signaled its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, other countries such as China, Germany and the UK are leading the way by phasing out fossil fuels, investing in clean technologies and advancing green industrial policies, they said. "But actions at home must be globalized."Stephen Roach, a faculty member at Yale University and a former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, warned that if the US and China, which have accounted for fully 44 percent of world GDP growth since 2008, opt for a superficial resolution or fail to come to terms on their trade conflict, the global economy could well falter.Bipartisan political support for China bashing in the savings-short US threatens to turn a trade war into a protracted and destructive economic cold war, Roach said."Now, more than ever, a fragile world is in desperate need of political will and wisdom," he said.Xiong Aizong, assistant researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of World Economics and Politics, agreed that multilateral mechanisms are the best solution to tackle global issues.Most of the current multilateral mechanisms were established after World War II and have long played a positive role in addressing global issues and ensuring the world's economic stability and development, he said. But as time has passed, some of the mechanisms have run into challenges.Take the World Trade Organization. Xiong said it is in unprecedented crisis as its dispute-solving mechanism is challenged, its clauses on security exceptions and unilateral measures are abused, and negotiations on some agendas progress slowly."To solve such problems, we need to improve and consolidate multilateral mechanisms as soon as possible," he said. "As countries become more domestic-focused, and unilateralism as well as protectionism are rising, China's support for, and promotion of, multilateralism is more important than ever."China has been working with G20 countries on macroeconomic policy coordination, global financial governance and sustainable development, and held a successful G20 summit in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, in 2016 where it contributed Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to global economic governance, Xiong said.Governance reformChina supports highly professional, representative and influential international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the WTO, as they are important pillars of the world's economic stability and development, he said, and also supports their efforts to reform their governance structures and improve their capabilities to play a more positive role in the global economy.Olav Kjorven, chief strategy officer at EAT, an NGO based in Stockholm that advocates a fair, healthy and sustainable global food system, warned that alarm bells are now ringing loudly on behalf of planet Earth."We are rapidly running out of time to secure a safe future for humanity; we have a climate crisis on our hands, and we have entered an era of mass extinction of species with grave consequences for humanity," he said."With leadership from the right places and with a sharp focus on the most strategic levers of change, humanity can turn this crisis into an opportunity."Kjorven said that after several decades of uninterrupted high-speed development, unmatched in human history, that lifted 800 million people out of poverty, China is today an example for the world when it comes to effective economic policymaking, mobilization of capital at home and abroad for productive purposes, and investment in its people."China can show the way to a safer, healthier and more sustainable food future, by taking bold action at home and inspiring and engaging the rest of the world," he said. "Chinese President Xi Jinping's call for 'building a community with a shared future for mankind' can and should involve getting it right on food, guided both by what science is now telling us loud and clear and the wisdom inherent in Chinese food culture and traditions."For an efficient G20 summit, O'Neill, from Chatham House, recommended that each G20 country gives itself some kind of score card for the progress made toward initiatives that featured in past G20 statements.He said such a system could really test countries, often the hosts, that want to put a new issue on the G20 agenda.This year, O'Neill said, it looks as if Japan is going to try to feature the issue of global governance of technology in terms of some common rules. He said it, and other countries that have ideas for new areas of focus in the future, need to be pushed to explain precisely what they want to achieve in doing so."It is all very well to make very general grand statements, but unless anything specific occurs between and across G20 countries, what is really the point?" O'Neill said. "This must surely become a prerequisite for the G20 at this year's meeting and into the future."Zhu Qiwen and Liu Yi contributed to this story.
