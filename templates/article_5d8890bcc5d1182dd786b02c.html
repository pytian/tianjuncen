                Another opioid giant reportedly looks to settle
            </p>
            <p>
                A major US opioid manufacturer is offering to pay $10 billion to $12 billion to settle more than 2,000 lawsuits brought by states, counties and cities across the United States, according to a media report.NBC News reported on Tuesday that the potential settlement by OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family, was part of confidential conversations discussed by Purdue's lawyers at a meeting in Cleveland on Aug 20.At least 10 state attorneys general and the plaintiffs' attorneys attended the meeting, where David Sackler represented the Sackler family, NBC reported.Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family have denied allegations in lawsuits that Purdue's sales practices were deceptive and at least partly responsible for the opioid crisis.But Purdue said it was actively working with the states and other plaintiffs to reach a resolution, without specifying a settlement amount."While Purdue Pharma is prepared to defend itself vigorously in the opioid litigation, the company has made clear that it sees little good coming from years of wasteful litigation and appeals," it said in a statement to NBC News. "Purdue believes a constructive global resolution is the best path forward, and the company is actively working with the state attorneys general and other plaintiffs to achieve this outcome."News of the potential settlement follows a ruling on Monday by an Oklahoma judge ordering that the drug giant Johnson & Johnson pay $572 million for its role in the state's opioid crisis.Two companies that sold far more opioids-Teva Pharmaceuticals USA and Purdue-had reached settlements in Oklahoma, where they will pay $85 million and $270 million, respectively, but Johnson & Johnson proceeded to trial.Oklahoma prosecutors described Johnson& Johnson as a "kingpin" in an epidemic that has killed more than 400,000 US citizens since 2000.The company contended at trial that it should not shoulder the blame for the opioid epidemic because its opioids had modest sales and because the drugs were regulated by state and federal agencies.Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries sell Duragesic, a pain patch containing the powerful opioid fentanyl, and Nucynta pills. Both carry the US Food and Drug Administration's strongest warnings about risks of addiction, abuse and life-threatening respiratory depression. Johnson & Johnson argues that it marketed the drugs accordingly and didn't mislead doctors about risks.Johnson& Johnson plans to appeal the Oklahoma court ruling. Analysts have said that the Oklahoma sentence was far below a liability that could have been as high as $17 billion. The lower figure probably helped the company's stock to rise almost 2 percent on Tuesday. It earned profits of $22.3 billion last year.Still, Johnson& Johnson has been named in more than 2,000 lawsuits brought by state and local governments related to the marketing of opioids. "The case does not establish a legal precedent for other cases," said Erik Gordon, an analyst and professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business."It is a lower court verdict in one state that doesn't bind other courts. Even in Oklahoma, the verdict may or may not be upheld when J&J appeals to a higher court," he said.Johnson & Johnson appears to have multiple grounds for appeal, he said, arguing it had only a 1 percent share of opioid sales in Oklahoma and in the country as a whole, and that the state didn't prove it caused a public nuisance.In the US, more than 130 people die every day after an opioid overdose, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates.AP contributed to this story.

                US state of Michigan bans flavored vaping products
            </a>
            <p>
                Michigan on Wednesday became the first state in the United States to ban flavored e-cigarettes after more than 200 people in at least 25 states have come down with a lung illness that appears to be linked to e-cigarettes and has caused two deaths. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer ordered the state Department of Health and Human Services to issue emergency rules banning the sale of sweet, fruity and menthol e-cigarettes, which studies say are more likely to get young people hooked on vaping. The vaping ban rule hasn't yet been filed but will be effective immediately once complete in a few weeks. Michigan businesses have 30 days to comply. The initial six-month sales ban could be renewed, Whitmer's spokesperson said.

                Over 49,000 autoworkers strike in US
            </a>
            <p>
                DETROIT, Michigan－More than 49,000 members of the United Auto Workers union walked off General Motors factory floors or set up picket lines early on Monday as contract talks with the company deteriorated into a strike.Workers shut down 33 manufacturing plants in nine states across the United States, as well as 22 parts distribution warehouses.The move to strike, which The Wall Street Journal described as the first major stoppage at GM in more than a decade, came after the manufacturer's four-year contract with workers expired without an agreement on a replacement.Local union leaders met in Detroit "and opted to strike at midnight on Sunday", the UAW said on its Twitter account."This is our last resort," Terry Dittes, the union's lead negotiator with GM, told a news conference after the meeting. "We are standing up for the fundamental rights of working people in this country."UAW officials said the two sides remained far apart in the contract negotiations, with disagreements on wages, healthcare benefits, the status of temporary workers and job security."Our members have spoken. We have taken action; and this is a decision we did not make lightly," Ted Krumm, chair of the UAW's national bargaining committee, said in a statement."We are standing up for what is right," Krumm said.Hours before the strike began, US President Donald Trump tweeted: "Here we go again with General Motors and the United Auto Workers. Get together and make a deal!"GM's last major strike, according to the Journal, was in 2007 when 73,000 workers at more than 89 facilities walked off the job for two days.In a statement, GM said it was "disappointing" that the UAW's leadership had decided to call the strike, saying it had presented a "strong offer" in contract negotiations.The UAW's leadership had previously won overwhelming approval from its rank-and-file for a strike if it became necessary.GM has enjoyed several years of strong sales, posting $11.8 billion in operating profits last year, prompting union officials to argue it is time to share the wealth with workers who have borne the brunt of downturns.But the outlook for GM is less clear, with concerns growing that a recession may be in the offing amid protracted trade tensions.GM announced last November it was effectively shuttering five plants in North America, including facilities in Michigan and Ohio that were "unallocated" for production.Protecting jobs and saving those plants have been key issues in the negotiations.In its response to the strike, GM's management revealed that its offer included a promise of $7 billion in investments that would save or protect 5,400 union jobs and address the issue of the two "unallocated "plants.Agencies
