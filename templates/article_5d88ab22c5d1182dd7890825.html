                World awaits next economic move by China
            </p>
            <p>
                Beijing policymakers expected to follow suit as other global leaders opt for cycle of easing Whether or not China will enact further accommodative monetary policies to maintain growth momentum is a question that has drawn the market's attention, as other major economies have stepped back into a policy-easing cycle in response to negative factors clouding the global outlook. Choosing policies that support growth has become the priority for global leaders, and Chinese policymakers are expected to follow suit in their own way, providing assurances that the economy is on firm footing while striking a macroeconomic balance for long-term stability, analysts said. The aim of supportive policies in China is to prevent a slowdown in growth, rather than boosting growth to a strong level, according to the latest research from Goldman Sachs, which added that policymakers are "highly flexible" in reacting to global conditions. Its research was released before the economic data for August, which will be posted on Monday. Economists had predicted a rebound of growth in August from July's moderate performance. They foresaw strengthened industrial output growth, stabilized fixed-asset investment and accelerated retail sales, as some earlier supportive measures had begun to take effect. "China's macroeconomic policy tools are adequate," Sheng Songcheng, former head of the statistics and analysis department at the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, told China Daily on Sunday. "Proactive fiscal policy will play a major role, while prudent monetary policy will be used to coordinate the fiscal policy." After the market-oriented reform of the loan prime rate mechanism, or LPR, the central bank has more tools to guide the real lending rate, including adjusting the medium-term lending facility interest rate, which is still at a relatively high level. The monetary easing measures by other major central banks have provided more room for China's monetary policy adjustments, Sheng said. "However, the adjustments of interest rates should also take into account both internal and external balances, such as the impacts on domestic asset prices," he said. The European Central Bank launched an aggressive stimulus package on Thursday - the first cut of its deposit rate in more than three years to a record low of - 0.5 percent, from - 0.4 percent, plus a restart of a bond-buying plan, or quantitative easing program. The bank said the moves were a response to the slower global growth and the continued shortfall of inflation domestically. This stimulus provoked criticism by investors, who worry it could trigger more market volatility. All eyes will be on the United States and the Federal Reserve's policymaking meeting on Wednesday. There is broad consensus among economists that the Fed may announce another rate cut. For China, one of the most important challenges ahead is the trade dispute with the United States. Rising risk aversion globally and a reshuffling of supply chains may also affect foreign investment in China, said Alicia Garcia Herrero, Asia-Pacific chief economist for Paris-based Natixis Bank. "China's growth model, despite foreseeable headwinds, has been evolving constantly, including further opening up in attracting international capital and deepening financial market reforms," she said. "We expect China to adapt to current challenges and stabilize growth with corresponding policy supports." Stephen Schwartz, senior director of sovereign ratings at Fitch (Hong Kong), said, "In the face of the external headwinds, we believe the Chinese authorities will stop short of the type of credit-led stimulus policies that could exacerbate medium-term financial and economic imbalances." chenjia@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily Global 09/16/2019 page1)

                Synthetic meat fills mooncake gap
            </a>
            <p>
                Customers fed up with the traditional ingredients of mooncakes, such as mixed nuts and bean paste, now have a new choice - synthetic meat. It is a Chinese tradition to eat mooncakes over Mid-Autumn Festival. A week before the festival, mooncakes stuffed with mock meat made from plant protein went on sale on e-commerce platform Taobao. In less than three days, over half of the limited 3,000 boxes had been sold. The mooncakes came in a box of six, with each weighing 60 grams and having the Chinese character "zhen", or "precious", printed on top, and giving off a special fragrance after being baked.

                Economists: US dollar as top currency set to weaken
            </a>
            <p>
                The US dollar's status as the top global reserve currency is set to weaken, although no currencies will substantially challenge its supremacy in the short term, said economists on Monday."The United States is now facing quite a revolt against its financial hegemony," said Gal Luft, co-director of the Washington, DC-based Institute for the Analysis of Global Security.The hegemony, centered on the dominant role the dollar plays in the global economic and financial system, has affected the interests of other countries and triggered increasing opposition from those countries, said Ding Yifan, deputy head of the China Society of World Economics."The momentum of de-dollarization has been building up for quite a long time and has recently accelerated," he said.They made the remarks at an event to launch the new book De-dollarization: The Revolt Against the Dollar and the Rise of a New Financial World Order, authored by Luft and Anne Korin, who is also a co-director of IAGS. The event was hosted by the International Monetary Institute of the Renmin University of China.Now the dollar accounts for about 80 percent of international payments. But as Luft and Korin have pointed out in their book, "the dollar is facing a challenge by a growing coalition of states and nonstate actors who are fed up with what they believe to be America's overuse of sanctions and other coercive economic measures, its extraterritorial legal outreach and its treatment of the global financial system as its fiefdom".As a result, more and more countries have sought to carry out trade using nondollar currencies and build mechanisms to circumvent the dollar-dominated financial system, leading to the weakening role of the paramount currency."We believe the dollar could lose its status as the world's dominant currency (which could see it depreciate over the medium term) due to structural reasons as well as cyclical impediments," wrote JP Morgan strategist Craig Cohen in a note on July 10.Reflective of that declining importance, the dollar's share in the global currency basket and in international trade has been on the decline, according to the book.According to the US Department of Treasury's Borrowing Advisory Committee, the dollar share of global foreign exchange reserves has steadily come down from 72 percent in 2000 to 62 percent now, according to the book.But the de-dollarization process will be a long-term evolution, Luft said. "We do not believe the yuan or any other single currency will replace the dollar (any time soon)."

                US Fed cuts interest rates for second time this year in divided vote
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON -- US Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered interest rates by 25 basis points amid growing risks and uncertainties stemming from trade tensions and a global economic slowdown, following a rate cut in July that was its first in more than a decade.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed's rate-setting body, trimmed the target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent after concluding its two-day policy meeting, largely in line with market expectation.Despite strong labor market and robust growth in household spending, "business fixed investment and exports have weakened," the FOMC said in a statement."On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent," the central bank's inflation objective, the FOMC said.Noting that trade policy is weighing on the growth outlook, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a press conference Wednesday afternoon that monetary policy can counteract weakness to some extent, but "there's a piece of this that we really can't address.""We need to look through what's a pretty volatile situation," said Powell. "That means, not overreacting quickly, it means not underreacting too. That's what we're trying to do."Three of the 10 members of the committee voted against the quarter-point rate cut decision, highlighting growing split among monetary policymakers. As in July, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren, and Kansas City Fed President Esther George "preferred" to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at the previous level. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, meanwhile, demanded a larger cut, by 50 basis points.When asked about how he viewed the divided opinions, Powell said at the press conference that this is difficult judgement, and such division is "nothing but healthy."US President Donald Trump again lashed out at the central bank shortly after the rate cut announcement, saying in a tweet that "Jay (Jerome) Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No 'guts,' no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!" The president had repeatedly demanded a larger cut.In response to a question regarding Trump's comment, Powell reaffirmed the central bank's independence. "I assure you that my colleagues and I will continue to conduct monetary policy without regard to political considerations. We're going to use our best judgment based on facts, evidence and objective analysis in pursuing our goals," he said.Seven out of the 17 Fed officials expect one more rate cut this year, and the central bank's median forecasts for rates suggested no more cut this year, according to the latest FOMC participants' assessments of appropriate monetary policy, which was also released on Wednesday."Our eyes are open, we're watching the situation," Powell said, without specifying the Fed's next move. "I'd love to be able to articulate a simple, straightforward, stopping rule, but it'll be when we think we've done enough."

                Fed lowers rates, open to another cut
            </a>
            <p>
                Divided FOMC votes to trim key interest rate to 1.75-2%; Trump wanted to see it go to 0%The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates Wednesday by a quarter-point for the second time in two months to ease the disruption of the continuing US-China trade dispute and offset the weight of a global economic slowdown.The Fed suggested that it is open to a third rate cut this year, possibly in October or December.Seven of the 10 members of the Federal Open Market Committee voted to lower the short-term rate to 1.75-2 percent. Two committee members again voted to hold rates steady, and a third wanted a half-point cut."The quarter-point cut is already built into the financial markets and the real economy. It will make no difference to either," Gary Hufbauer, an analyst at the Washington-based Peterson Institute, told China Daily. "The cut will certainly not offset the disruption caused by the trade dispute."Kamal Khan, chief US editor at Investing.com in New York, said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had the difficult task of explaining the need for the rate cut when the Fed doesn't foresee a recession."The quarter-point cut won't be enough to derail a slowdown and more concerns about a US recession if trade relations between the US and China start to sour again," he told China Daily. "But it should help the economic data look even better in the near term."President Donald Trump blasted the Fed's action, tweeting after it was announced: "Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No 'guts,' no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!" Last week, Trump tweeted that "The Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less, and we should then start to refinance our debt."At a news conference Wednesday, Powell said the central bank is "fully committed to pursuing our goals of maximum employment and stable prices". He stressed that it will "act as appropriate to sustain the expansion" of the nation's economy.The unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, near a 50-year low, but hiring has slowed, and low wage growth suggests employers have little difficulty finding workers. Inflation, excluding food and energy because of their volatility, is about 1.5 percent, below the Fed's 2 percent target.The Fed's policy statement outlining the reasons for the rate cut differed little from its July statement. The FOMC again said the "implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures" were the main reasons for the cut.Assessing the nation's economy, the Fed noted that consumer spending is "rising at a strong pace", while business fixed investment and exports have weakened.The Fed said disruptions from the US-China trade dispute have worsened since the July 30-31 FOMC meeting, and the global economic slowdown has not yet bottomed out. US manufacturing also has weakened.Repeating language used in July, the Fed said "it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion"."Economic and financial conditions have changed only modestly since the FOMC met in July, with growth remaining somewhat soft but wage and price measures looking a bit firmer," Jan Hatzius, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said in a research report. "Beyond the September meeting, we continue to expect the FOMC to deliver a third and final (quarter-point) cut to 1.5-1.75 percent in October."Fed: Also adds $75b in liquidity to systemThe Fed pumped $75 billion into the financial system on Monday and Tuesday, the first such action in about 10 years, to alleviate a sudden shortage of cash. The move reflects a divergence between funding needs and cash available.The Federal Reserve is charged with maintaining a stable monetary and financial system. Rate cuts are part of the Fed's effort to maintain a strong economy, full employment and stable prices.In December 2008, as the economy sank, the Fed cut rates to 0.25 percent, the 10th cut in just over year, and didn't begin raising rates until December 2015. Prior to 2008, the lowest fed funds rates was 1 percent in 2003, to combat a recession that began in 2001.The fed funds rate climbed to 20 percent in 1979 and 1980 to curb double-digit inflation. In 1971, President Richard Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard, and inflation soon rose to 9.6 percent from 3.9 percent.In response, the Fed continued to hike rates. In 1979, Fed Chairman Paul Volcker held rates steady at a record high, all the way to 20 percent, leading to a recession that ended inflation.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 200 points, or 0.8 percent, within 30 minutes of the Fed's announcement on Wednesday, but rebounded to close at 27,147.08, up 36.28 points or 0.13 percent.

                No move on Chinese monetary policy after Fed rate cut
            </a>
            <p>
                China did not immediately use the latest United States interest rate cut as an opportunity to ease domestic monetary policy as the current rate level is adequate and liquidity ample following a recent injection of funds, analysts said. But they expect the People's Bank of China, the central bank, to support the market in other ways by possibly lowering the base interest rate of banks' new loans soon to reduce costs for corporate clients. "For China, prudent monetary policy is basically appropriate at present as indicated by major financial data in August, such as improved aggregate social financing and the growth rate of the broad money supply," said Sheng Songcheng, former head of the PBOC statistics and analysis department.
