                Iran displays downed US, British drones
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                TEHRAN - Iran on Saturday displayed the debris of recently downed US and British drones by its air defense system.In the showcase, called Hunting Vultures, Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) displayed the remaining pieces of a US military drone downed by the country's air defense system in June in its southern waters.On June 21, Iran announced that it had downed a US RQ-4 Global Hawk "spy drone" which had violated Iranian airspace near the Strait of Hormuz.The IRGC also displayed the Aerosonde HQ vertical take-off and landing drone belonging to the US Army used for multi-intelligence payloads such as electronic warfare and communications relay in a single flight.Aerosonde has been designed for expeditionary land and sea-based operations and equipped for simultaneous day and night full-motion video.Desert Hawk was another captured American drone showcased in the exhibition. It has a length of 0.86 meters with a weight of 3.2 kg. It has an endurance of about an hour with an electric motor driving a quiet pusher propeller.Besides, a British unmanned aerial vehicle, named Phoenix, seized by the IRGC in the country's territorial region recently, was put on show. Phoenix is an all-weather, day or night, real-time combat surveillance drone.According to Press TV, Iran, in 2015, downed a US RQ-170 Sentinel stealth aircraft with minimal damage. The drone was flying over the Iranian city of Kashmar, near the Afghan border, when it was brought down.During the exhibition on Saturday, IRGC Commander Hossein Salami said Iran will never allow a war on its soil.Iran will follow and destroy any "aggressor" who stages even a limited attack on the country, said Salami."We will hit anyone who violates our borders," he said, adding Iran has so far demonstrated only part of its military capability.

                    Riyadh joins US-led coalition after attack

                Pompeo heads to Saudi Arabia amid fallout from strikes blamed on TeheranDUBAI, United Arab Emirates - Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday it joined a United States-led coalition to secure the Middle East's waterways after an attack targeting its crucial oil industry.Riyadh's decision to enter the International Maritime Security Construct came ahead of a planned visit by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo from Wednesday.Saudi officials separately planned to share information about the weapons used to attack a Saudi oil field and the world's largest crude oil processing plant on Saturday.Yemen's Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack, but the US and Saudi Arabia say they suspect Iran carried out the assault. Iran denies that, though it came amid a summer of heightened tensions between Teheran and Washington over its unraveling nuclear deal with world powers.The state-run Saudi Press Agency carried a statement on Wednesday quoting an unnamed official saying the kingdom had joined the International Maritime Security Construct.Australia, Bahrain and the United Kingdom already have joined the mission."The kingdom's accession to this international alliance comes in support of regional and international efforts to deter and counter threats to maritime navigation and global trade in order to ensure global energy security and the continued flow of energy supplies to the global economy and contribute to maintain the international peace and security," the statement read.US military officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.The coalition aims to secure the broader Persian Gulf region. It includes surveillance of the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of the world's oil travels, and the Bab el-Mandeb, another narrow strait that connects the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden off Yemen and East Africa. Smaller patrol boats and other craft will be available for rapid response. The plan also allows for nations to escort their own ships through the region.The US Navy already has sent Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers to chokepoint positions, like either end of the Strait of Hormuz. There, they observe ship traffic and monitor for anything unusual as drones and other aircraft fly surveillance routes overhead.The US blames Iran for the apparent limpet mine explosions on four vessels in May and a further two in June that were sailing in the Gulf of Oman near the Strait of Hormuz, something Iran denies being behind. Iran also seized a British-flagged oil tanker and another based in the United Arab Emirates.It's unclear what role Saudi Arabia will play in the coalition. Bahrain already serves at the headquarters of the US Navy's 5th Fleet.Wednesday's announcement also came after Saudi Arabia's energy minister said late on Tuesday that more than half of the country's daily crude oil production that was knocked out by the attack had been recovered and that production capacity at its targeted plants would be fully restored by the end of the month."Where would you find a company in this whole world that went through such a devastating attack and came out like a phoenix?" Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said about state-owned Saudi Aramco, which was the target of the attacks. His question to reporters, many of them Saudi, drew applause.Prince Abdulaziz said Aramco will honor its commitments to its customers this month by drawing from its reserves of crude oil and offering additional crude production from other oil fields. He said production capacity would reach up to 11 million barrels a day by the end of September and 12 million barrels in November.He said production at the Abqaiq processing facility is at 2 million barrels per day.Oil prices spiked on Monday, with benchmark Brent crude having the biggest percentage gain since the 1991 Gulf War. Prices dropped on Tuesday around the time of the Saudi announcement. Brent traded on Wednesday morning around the same prices as the day before, with a barrel costing over $64.Pompeo was due to land in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, where he was scheduled to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Pompeo later will travel to the United Arab Emirates on Thursday to meet with Abu Dhabi's crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Both nations are US allies and have been fighting against the Houthis in Yemen since March 2015.Agencies

                    US and Iran should be guided by reason: China Daily editorial

            <p class="style-content">
                Continuing to blame Iran for Saturday's attacks on two Saudi Arabian oil facilities, Washington is mulling imposing fresh sanctions on Teheran. But without foolproof evidence to support its action, the United States would put the cart before the horse if it announced new sanctions against Iran.That the news of the US considering such a move can increase the already high tensions in the Middle East is evident in Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif raising the specter of an "all-out war", and stressing that if the US or Saudi Arabia attacked Iran, it would have to fight to its last soldier.True, the attacks on the major Saudi facilities have shrunk the country's oil production almost by half and hiked global oil prices, sparking grave concerns over global oil supply. But the developments should prompt the US to more seriously consider the possible spillover effects of another punitive action against Iran on the regional situation and the world economy.Ignoring any such rational thinking, however, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the attacks an "act of war" against Saudi Arabia after Riyadh displayed missile and drone wreckage on Wednesday and other evidence claiming the raids were "unquestionably sponsored by Iran".Unfortunately, Pompeo's remark raises the fear of the US using military measures against Iran. Given Iran's pivotal location, that would affect global oil supply, not to mention there is no guarantee the US' move will not ignite, unwittingly or otherwise, the powder keg that the region has become.Judging by US President Donald Trump's remarks, it seems he understands the grave risk Washington would be taking by triggering another war in the Middle East.To be fair to Iran, it is not responsible for the current situation. The main cause of the tensions is the US' withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal despite the International Atomic Energy Agency saying Teheran had fully complied with the multilateral deal.Yet, amid rising tensions, both parties seem to have left some room for reconciliation. While the White House has not ruled out a meeting with Iran's top leader, Zarif said Iran hoped to avoid conflict, adding that Teheran was willing to hold talks with Riyadh, and the possibility of a return to negotiations with the US depends on whether Washington would provide full sanctions relief as promised under the 2015 nuclear deal.In the long run, therefore, keeping the Iranian nuclear deal alive, and ensuring it is implemented both in letter and spirit, is the only viable way of resolving the US-Iran conflict and defusing the tensions in the Middle East.

                WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump said on Friday that his country is imposing sanctions on Iran's national bank following attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities.Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House, claimed that the new sanctions on Tehran are the "highest sanctions ever imposed on a country."The latest punishment came two days after Trump revealed in a tweet that he had instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to "substantially increase Sanctions on the country of Iran."Washington has been indicating that Iran was behind Saturday's drone attacks on oil production facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia, a claim that has been strongly denied by Tehran.

                IranZarif questions 'peace' coalitionIran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Friday questioned US plans for a coalition for a "peaceful resolution" in the Middle East while listing repeated Iranian diplomatic initiatives. "Coalition for Peaceful Resolution?" Zarif said in a statement on Twitter, and listed eight diplomatic initiatives by Iran since 1985, including a peace plan for Yemen in 2015, and a regional nonaggression pact for the Persian Gulf region proposed earlier this year. The United States said on Thursday it was building a coalition to deter Iranian threats following a weekend attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US was seeking to build a "coalition aimed at achieving peace and a peaceful resolution".

                An old Chinese instrument is making its presence felt in many places and is winning hearts.Sit down and listen to her for just a few minutes, and the sweet sound of this lady of uncertain provenance may well strike your heartstrings.In ancient Persia they knew her as santur, among modern-day English speakers she is dulcimer - from the Latin for sweet melody - and when she reached China she became yangqin.The English name's etymology accurately reflects the timbre of the dulcimer, its two hammers striking the strings on its trapezoidal board.Dulcimer players can conjure diverse moods, hence the instrument's frequent appearances in film scores, from portraying scenes of everyday life to creating a sense of mystery in epic fantasies. The instrument's exact origin remains an enigma and can only be roughly traced back to somewhere in the Middle East thousands of years ago. It is believed to have come to China from the Persian Empire through the Silk Road about 400 years ago, in the late Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).In China it was localized and named yangqin, which meant foreign instrument, and gradually took a central role in Chinese folk ensembles, similar to that of the piano in an orchestra. As with pianos, usually only one yangqin is required in a concert, but at the third International Dulcimer Music Festival in Beijing recently the audience was treated to the uncommon presence of more than 30 yangqin on the same stage being played by musicians from around the world.

                    Israeli president to start coalition consultations
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Israeli President Reuven Rivlin will on Sunday start consultations with the parties about choosing a leader to put together a coalition, after right-win Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed for the second time in five months to secure a clear election victory in the parliament.Netanyahu faced Israeli media headlines on Friday suggesting power is slipping from his grasp after an election in which he trails his main rival with nearly all votes counted.The centrist Blue and White party led by ex-armed forces chief Benny Gantz rebuffed his calls to join a unity government on Thursday.Near-final results released on Friday by the Knesset's election committee showed Blue and White will be the largest single party in the new parliament with 33 of the 120 seats, with Netanyahu's Likud winning 31 seats, three less than it had before.Israeli newspapers and commentators depicted the 69-year-old leader as in a weakened position, with headlines such as: "Himself Alone" and "Political Death Spasms."Netanyahu and Gantz will now seek potential coalition allies, prominent among whom is the far-right former defense minister Avigdor Lieberman. He secured eight seats for his Yisrael Beitenu party, making him a potential kingmaker.Increased turnout by Israel's 21-percent Arab minority saw the Arab-dominated Joint List coalition grouping win 13 seats, making it the third largest grouping.The religious parties representing Israel's Ultra-Orthodox communities, known as Haredim, remain a significant force, with Shas winning nine seats and United Torah Judaism eight seats.The right-wing Yamina won seven seats, the leftist Labor-Gesher six, and the Democratic Union five. The full official results will be published next Wednesday.

                TEHRAN - Iran released British oil tanker, the Stena Impero, detained in the Strait of Hormuz in July for "maritime violations," Tasnim news agency reported on Sunday.Allahmorad Afifipour, the general manager of Iran's Hormozgan Maritime and Ports, confirmed the release of British tanker, saying that the vessel will start its voyage from Iran's Bandar Abbas port to the international waters "soon."Although the tanker is allowed to leave Iran's waters, "the legal dossier for its violations is still open in Iran's judiciary," Afifipour was quoted as saying.Iran detained the Stena Impero on July 19, alleging that it had violated the maritime regulations while passing through the Strait of Hormuz two weeks after Britain seized an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar.Earlier, Iran released seven crew members of the oil tanker.The Iranian officials have ruled out any link between Stena Impero's case and British seizure of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 off the coast of Gibraltar.The Grace 1, renamed as Adrian Darya 1, was released by the Gibraltar authorities on Aug 16.

                TEHERAN - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday that his country should lead regional security in the strategic Persian Gulf and criticized the presence of foreign forces, as the country's nuclear deal with world powers appears near collapse and the United States deployed more troops to assist its Arab allies.The US has said Iran is behind a series of attacks on the region's energy infrastructure, including a major drone-and-missile hit on Saudi Arabia's oil industry that shook global energy markets. Iran has denied the allegations and said any retaliatory strikes from the US or Saudi Arabia will lead to "all-out war".Speaking during a military parade, Rouhani warned that the presence of foreign forces in the Persian Gulf region could cause problems for the world's "energy security".He said that Iran extends its "hand of friendship and brotherhood" toward regional nations for overseeing security in the Persian Gulf and its narrowest point, the Strait of Hormuz, where one-fifth of global oil exports passes.Along with boosting troops and equipment levels in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the US is leading a maritime coalition, which includes the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Kingdom and Australia, to secure the area's waterways and vital oil trade routes.The military parade marked the 39th anniversary of the start of the eight-year war with Iraq that began when former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invaded Iran in 1980.Similar parades were held in many major cities across Iran including the port city of Bandar Abbas near the Strait of Hormuz.State TV showed scores of Iranian fast-attack boats, as well as air defense and other military equipment. It also carried images of Iranian Revolutionary Guard naval forces rappelling down the side of a sailing ship.The US navy has often complained about Guard fast boats and naval forces harassing shipping in the Gulf.Tensions escalated between arch-foes Iran and the US after last weekend's attacks on Saudi energy giant Aramco's Abqaiq processing plant and Khurais oilfield halved the kingdom's oil output.Yemen's Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the strikes, but the US said it had concluded the attacks involved cruise missiles from Iran and amounted to "an act of war".US sends more troops Washington approved the deployment of troops to Saudi Arabia at "the kingdom's request", US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said, noting the forces would be "defensive in nature" and focused on air and missile defenses.The commander of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, General Hossein Salami, said on Saturday that Iran was "ready for any type of scenario"."Whoever wants their land to become the main battlefield, go ahead," he told a news conference in Teheran."We will never allow any war to encroach upon Iran's territory."We hope that they don't make a strategic mistake", he said.Saudi Arabia, which has been bogged down in a five-year war across its southern border in Yemen, has said Iran "unquestionably sponsored" the attacks.Riyadh said the weapons used in the attacks were Iranian-made, but it has stopped short of directly blaming its regional rival.Iran has long sought the evacuation of Western and US forces from Arab Gulf countries, seeing it as a potential threat to the Persian nation.Rouhani added on Sunday that he will offer a regional peace plan during his visit to the United Nations General Assembly this week.Fears of a wider regional conflagration have grown, as tensions between Iran and the US remain high over Teheran's failing 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Recently, Iran has broken the deal's limits on enrichment, uranium stockpiles and the use of advanced centrifuges, as it seeks to pressure Europe to offer it a way to sell its crude oil on the international market despite US sanctions.US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the deal over a year ago, and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran.Agencies
