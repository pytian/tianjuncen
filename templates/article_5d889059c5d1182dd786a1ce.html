                Anhui industry and the world
            </p>
            <p>
                Manufacturing does not exist in a vacuum; it is a response to market demand or an innovation intended to create new markets. Industry in Anhui is well-positioned to do both. Anhui, particularly Hefei, is home to a vast research and development capacity with its top-class universities and industrial development facilities, supportive public policies and strategies. When companies approach manufacturers in Anhui, they are ready to respond with proven ability to deliver and innovate, particularly in high-end manufacturing. Studies show that industries of any kind, manufacturing or medical sciences or higher education, thrive in clusters. Anhui province is able to thrive because it has established high-end manufacturing clusters, but more needs to be done. Clusters, like organic beings, need to grow to respond to new opportunities and threats. One strategy to increase high-end manufacturing is to study and promote SWOT in Anhui: Strengths to build on, Weaknesses to address, Opportunities to seize and Threats to be avoided. Careful planning and analysis will help the high-end manufacturing sector to grow. New markets must be continuously developed and this, too, is relatively easy for Anhui. Located in the heart of China, Anhui plays an active role in the Belt and Road Initiative. Products can be shipped expediently to almost anywhere in the world. Emissaries from China can, like the explorers of old, go into the world along the Silk Road to see what is needed by the people, industries and nations. This is supported by national policies that Anhui must engage with. Looking inward with rigorous research and outward with diplomacy and market analysis, manufacturers in China can systematically improve their productivity and engage with world markets. Kathryn Chang Barker, visiting professor at the University of Science and Technology of China Hefei city has achieved tremendous achievements in innovation, science and technology. It is also competing with first-tier cities in China and is considered one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Research showed that the government's "open innovation" policy brought an economic boost to Anhui province. Hefei city is the home for one of the top universities in China - the University of Science and Technology of China, and key branches of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. There is no doubt that the city is a desirable destination for both Chinese and foreign talent. After hosting the first WMC, Anhui is to host the second World Manufacturing Convention. It will show the world its ability to plan and gather top companies and institutions in one place. Smart Hefei has learned a lot from last year's convention. More than 92 percent of the projects signed during last year's convention had finished business registration by the end of July. Hefei city is playing an important role to promote the province's advanced manufacturers to the outside world and engage local manufacturers in a direct international technology transfer with their foreign counterparts. China has unveiled its dream to revive the ancient Silk Road by undertaking massive infrastructure projects. Chinese manufacturers are going global and more foreign direct investment has been attracted to China.
