                Region a key part of Sichuan's opening-up
            </p>
            <p>
                Nanchong in Southwest China has seen fruitful expansion in recent years and aims to become a key city for Sichuan province's opening-up and cooperation, local officials said. The 2019 Western China Silk Expo, which has drawn attention domestically and from countries such as the United States, France, Italy, Thailand and South Korea, will be held in Nanchong from Sept 17 to 22. The expo is aiming to foster exhibition brands for laying a solid opening-up foundation for Nanchong. Other events include a Spring Festival culture expo held in 2018 and 2019 in Langzhong, a county-level city in Nanchong, and the Nanchong International Puppet Art Week. The city is home to 26 Fortune Global 500 enterprises and 55 of China's top 500 companies. It actively participated in investment-attracting events, such as the Western China International Fair held in Chengdu, capital city of Sichuan province. Last year, the fair held in September saw Nanchong sign 62 projects with investors and investment totaled more than 83.59 billion yuan. Beijing-based Macrolink Group signed to invest 10 billion yuan in building an international cultural tourism area in Langzhong. Other projects involve fields including semiconductor device manufacturing, automobile and auto parts, medicine, modern logistics and modern agriculture. Attracting foreign capital is a priority for the city to promote opening-up. It has attracted seven companies, including Singapore-headquartered real estate company Mapletree Investments, to develop in Nanchong since the beginning of last year. During the first half of 2019, foreign direct investment in Nanchong amounted to 549.7 million yuan, a year-on-year rise of 184.6 percent. The city has focused more on international communication and exchange. It invited and received more than 30 batches of foreign officials from government agencies, embassies and consulates and also overseas Chinese groups to discuss project cooperation and exchange cultures. Nanchong plans to have its imports and exports exceed 3.5 billion yuan and the foreign investment in actual use surpass 1 billion yuan by the end of 2023. It wants trade volume in such fields as tourism, education and finance to significantly increase by that time. To achieve the goals, the city will actively guide and encourage foreign companies to invest in transportation construction, environmental protection, culture, education and healthcare. It also plans to attract more than 20 projects invested by noted enterprises annually and promote the development of industrial parks such as the Nanchong Economic Development Zone. It will continue to boost the exhibition economy and host investment promotion events in Europe, the United States, Japan, South Korea and developed regions in China. Cooperation with other domestic areas will be strengthened. Nanchong will actively receive industrial transfer from the Yangtze River Delta region, which involves Shanghai and Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in East China, and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in North China. It will further cooperation with the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Beibu Gulf economic zone in South China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. Nanchong will strengthen partnership with Hong Kong and Macao in fields such as modern finance, international trade, tourism and biopharmaceuticals. It will continue to attract quality projects from Singapore and other countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative to develop in Nanchong. It will join in cooperation between China and ASEAN and launch trade and people-to-people exchanges with Southeast and South Asian countries. It will use its characteristic cultures of silk, Spring Festival, shadow puppets, Sichuan Opera and acrobatics to promote folk art exchange and education cooperation with other countries. songmengxing@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily 09/17/2019 page25)

                Blending culture, history to attract more visitors
            </a>
            <p>
                The city of Nanchong in China's Sichuan province is putting its weight behind its rich history and culture by integrating them with its tourism industry to provide unique experiences for visitors. With a history of more than 2,200 years, Nanchong is known for being the cradle of China's silk industry and the place most associated with culture from the Three Kingdoms period (220-280). In modern times, the city has become renowned in China as a demonstration for promoting local culture and for being home to five national-level intangible culture heritage and 29 provincial-level intangible cultural heritage. "Culture and tourism are complementary," said Peng Qinghua, Party secretary of Sichuan province. "Together they can bring out the best in each other, with culture as the soul of tourism and tourism as the carrier of culture." He added that the government should continue to advance the all-round integration of culture and tourism across various sectors. To date, Nanchong has two national-level demonstration counties for leisure agriculture and rural tourism, two provincial-level tourism resorts, four provincial-level pilot zones for ecological tourism and three provincial-level demonstration counties for rural tourism. The city is integrating cultural tourism into key industries such as agriculture, forestry, irrigation, manufacturing and internet. "By promoting the integrated development of culture and tourism and offering high-quality tourism products and services, we will better provide for visitors, " said Song Chaohua, Party secretary of Nanchong. "With the goal of becoming a vital center for cultural tourism in Sichuan province, Nanchong is building five cultural brands - red culture, Three Kingdoms culture, silk culture, Jialing River green culture and Spring Festival culture," Song said. Zhao Xiuqing, head of the Nanchong culture, radio, television and tourism administration, said that focused cultural tourism practices including tourism around museums, tourism around intangible cultural heritage and tourism around art performances have become a new driving force for the development of Nanchong's tourism industry. And these efforts are paying off in Nanchong. Last year, the city welcomed 57.4 million visits, ranking fourth in the province, up 19.6 percent year-on-year. The overall revenue generated from the cultural and tourism industries surpassed 75 billion yuan ($10.65 billion), up 17 percent year-on-year. Nanchong recorded 3.87 million visits during the four-day Labor Day holiday in May, up 42.3 percent year-on-year with total tourism turnover reaching 1.87 billion yuan. One of the most popular destinations in Nanchong is Langzhong Ancient Town built in 314 BC, which is one of the only ancient towns in China retaining its original name. Although it is a major tourist attraction in Sichuan and is surrounded by a large modern city, the town is very well maintained and has not been spoiled by commercialization. Many tourists come to the town for its traditional architecture, slow pace of life and cultural experiences. Visitors enjoy taking photos with the sculpture of Zhang Fei, a famous military commander during the Three Kingdoms period and walking around the antique examination compound. One of the most famous cultural icons in Langzhong is its Spring Festival tradition. At the town, people could see white-haired old men wear antique costumes and act as Luoxia Hong, an astronomer born in Langzhong during the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 24), sending hongbao, or red envelope, to visitors and to bring best wishes, peace and good fortune for the New Year. Luoxia Hong is renowned as the Spring Festival Old Man as he was the first man to name the first month of the year as Spring Festival in the Chinese lunar calendar. Other experiences in Nanchong include attending traditional folk dances or puppet shows and buying specialties such as Zhang Fei beef, Baoning pancakes and local vinegar. For those who are more interested in historical events can visit the Wanjuan building, where Chen Shou, a historian in the Western Jin Dynasty (265-316), wrote the Record of the Three Kingdoms, a biographical series of the Wei, Shu and Wu dynasties during the Three Kingdoms Period. In the silk museums, visitors can experience the rearing of silkworms and reeling silk. To further boost development in cultural tourism, the government has initiated a series of projects over the past few years. One example is the 10 billion yuan beer town project in the city's Shunqing district, which is a new urban complex combining food, shopping, sightseeing, beer culture and recreational activities. When completed, the project will help to drive development in the local economy, boost related industries and improve the city's influence in the region. Another key project is the 233-hectare Langzhong town, which has attracted investment of 8 billion yuan. Construction on the town started in March and consists of eight sport competition zones, three tourism routes and six recreational centers. Last year, Nanchong carried out 46 key projects on culture and tourism with a total investment of 19.7 billion yuan. By 2021, the city is expected to construct a batch of demonstration zones and tourism spots for cultural tourism with expected annual revenue growth surpassing 15 percent year-on-year. wangjinhui@chinadaily.com.cn (China Daily 09/17/2019 page26)

            <p>
                Editor's note: This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.In September 1987, 13 mobile train ticket offices were set up in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, as seen in this item from China Daily.Although the national rail network has expanded rapidly in the past few decades, buying a train ticket for trips during peak travel seasons such as the National Day holiday and Spring Festival can still be daunting for many travelers.National railway operator China State Railway Group which handles millions of passengers every year during the holidays, has launched more measures to crack down on ticket scalpers and make it easier for passengers to obtain seats.A real-name system for buying train tickets has been adopted nationwide since 2012, and a new system allows passengers to book tickets through the internet or via the phone.Users can buy the tickets at any ticket booth or train station.According to official figures, more than 80 percent of its passengers booked their train tickets online for the Spring Festival travel rush early this year.The 40-day travel rush, has seen over 400 million passenger trips by rail. Also known as chunyun, it often tests the limits of the country's transportation system.Besides ticket booking, the railway authorities have also enhanced the comfort and convenience during passengers' trips.In 2017, an on-demand food delivery service for high-speed trains was launched in major cities.The pilot program's menu varies from station to station, with distinctive local features. In addition to traditional Chinese dishes, Western style fast-food, including KFC, is available on most trains.Passengers are asked to order on China State Railway Group's ticket-booking website or via its app two hours before the train is scheduled to arrive at the selected station.
