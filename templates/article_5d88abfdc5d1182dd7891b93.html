                Yang stresses economic nationalism
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Andrew Yang seems to have an opinion about everything.The New York entrepreneur is doing his best to make a name for himself in the bursting Democratic primary field of US presidential candidates.One of the main tenets of Yang's campaign for the 2020 nomination is his proposal to pay a universal basic income of $1,000 a month, which he calls the "Freedom Dividend", to every US citizen age 18 and over, in response to workplace automation, which he dubbed the "fourth Industrial Revolution"."We automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs in all the swing states ... and we're about to do the same thing to millions of retail jobs, call-center jobs, fastfood jobs, truck-driving jobs, and on and on," Yang told Business Insider in March.Yang, 44, says on his website that he will fund universal basic income with a value-added tax on the companies that most benefit from automation."Our labor participation rate now is only 62.7 percent－lower than it has been in decades, with 1 out of 5 working-age men currently out of the workforce," Yang says. "This will get much worse as self-driving cars and other technologies come online."Yang's other two main policies are Medicare for All and what he calls "human-centered capitalism".Yang has almost 100 planks in his platform, some of which are: Get rid of the penny; limit terms for Supreme Court justices to 18 years; lower the voting age to 16; relocate federal agencies; make the NCAA pay college athletes; establish a local journalism fund; and prevent airlines from removing customers.At a rally at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington on Monday, Yang taunted the media and their take on why Donald Trump was elected president in 2016.He said that the mainstream media insisted that Russia, collusion, racism, sexism, Facebook and the FBI got Trump elected, but it was economic nationalism that was the determining factor.Yang said that "there is a straight line up between the adoption of industrial robots in a voting district and the movement to Donald Trump"."The reason he is our president today is we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri, Iowa－all of the swing states he needed to win and did win," Yang said.Yang's followers online, who operate under the hash tag #Yang-Gang, are crucial to his campaign. The candidate's facility with the internet is also a key reason why he will be on the stage for the first Democratic debates on June 26 and 27 in Miami, Florida.He has surpassed the required number of campaign donations from 65,000 individuals(the standard established by the Democratic National Committee).Small-dollar donorsYang's campaign raised more than $1.7 million in the first quarter, with 99 percent of donations under $200.Yang is the son of immigrants from Taiwan, who met while they were in graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley. His father graduated with a PhD in physics and worked in research labs at IBM and General Electric. His mother has a master's degree in statistics and later became an artist.Yang attended Phillips Exeter Academy, a boarding school in New Hampshire. He went on to Brown University, where he received a bachelor's degree in economics, and later to Columbia Law School, where he earned a law degree.He worked as a lawyer before starting Venture for America in 2011, a fellowship program that matches recent college graduates with startups across the country. He and his wife, Evelyn, have two young sons.Yang is not the first Chinese-American to run for the White House.Hiram Fong, who was one of the first US senators from Hawaii when it was granted statehood in 1959, ran twice as a Republican candidate for president in 1964 and 1968. He also attained the rank of major in the US Army Air Force during World War II.Fong, son of immigrants from Guangdong province, was the first Asian-American to receive delegates for president at a major party convention－from Hawaii and Alaska－in 1964. He died in 2004 at the age of 97.

                    California names building after pioneer March Fong Eu
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                March Fong Eu took a sledgehammer to a toilet on the steps of the California State Capitol in 1969, when she was fighting to ban pay toilets for women in public buildings.Now the trailblazing politician, who broke various gender and racial glass ceilings and shattered election history in California, has become the first Asian-American woman to have a state office building named after her.On Monday, the California Secretary of State/State Archives Building Complex in Sacramento was renamed the March Fong Eu Secretary of State Building.Eu was the first Asian American in the country to serve in a state legislature. A Democrat, she was in the California Assembly for four terms, from 1966 to 1974.When she was elected in 1974 to become California's secretary of state, a position she held for five terms until 1994, Eu became the first person of Chinese ancestry to be elected to statewide office in the United States.She died at age 95 on Dec 21, 2017."Last year, I was honored to join the family and friends of Secretary March Fong Eu in Oakland to remember her extraordinary life. It is an honor again to gather here to solidify her permanent placement in California history. The decision to name this building in honor of the person who ensured its design, construction and completion was an easy decision to make," said California Secretary of State Alex Padilla in a statement to China Daily.Caren Daniels Lagomarsino, who worked as the spokesperson for Eu for almost 20 years, called the renaming of the building after Eu "a proud historical moment".When asked how Eu would have felt knowing the Secretary of State building is named after her, Lagomarsino said that "she would be honored; she would be flattered; she would probably be surprised"."I think there were times when she did not believe that she really had the impact. Looking back from that, I think she probably didn't recognize what a legacy she had left for future generations."Eu was born on March 29, 1922, in the back of a hand-laundry operated by her parents in Oakdale, California.After graduating from the University of California at Berkeley, she earned a master's degree in education from Mills College and a doctorate in education from Stanford University.As California's secretary of state, Eu worked on a number of measures to improve the election process, including voter registration by mail, at-large absentee balloting and the inclusion of candidate statements in ballot pamphlets.Eu continues to be an inspiration and voice for many current politicians.When the California State Assembly adjourned the Feb 20, 2018 floor session in memory of Eu, Assembly member Ed Chau, who represents District 49, said Eu broke many social and gender barriers."March earned a reputation through her fight against civil injustice and discrimination. Despite being one of the few minority women in the Legislature, where she often faced prejudice and sexism, she spoke out against the unfair treatment of women and to advocate for reproductive and equal rights," he said.It was Padilla's idea to name the building after Eu. During a January 2018 memorial service honoring her in Oakland, Padilla said Eu encouraged him, the son of Mexican immigrants, to become secretary of state.Suyin Stein, Eu's daughter, said in a statement, "We are grateful that my mother's legacy will endure and her reputation for paving the way for greater women and minority participation, and integrity and openness in government, continues.  May she inspire generations to pursue their dreams with determination."

                    Pop duo team up for Monster track
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Last summer, pop stars Li Yuchun and Wu Tsing-fong met at a talent show, The Coming One, filmed for the Chinese streaming platform Tencent Video. Along with another coach, the two singer-songwriters were responsible for developing original singer-songwriters on the show.Li and Wu became close friends during the show and their mutual artistic admiration for each other led them to the recording studio, where they collaborated on a new single, As a Monster.Their first creative collaboration, the song is dedicated to the people who pride themselves on being a little "odd"."I liked the lyrics written by Li Geli very much when I first read them," says Li in Beijing, two days ahead of the single's digital release on May 20. "It portrays people who, sometimes, feel out of the place and are often considered as 'monsters'. I am shy and not sociable. I'm like one of those 'monsters' sometimes."One of the biggest pop icons in China, Li rose to fame after winning the popular TV talent show Super Girl in 2005, which attracted millions of viewers.One day in March, Li emailed the lyrics to Wu, who immediately shared her ideas. Not long after, Wu composed a song and sent it back to Li."I was exhausted with the hectic schedule that day. But when I listened to the demo, I felt excited and I knew it was right," Li recalls.The rhythm, as Wu says, just came to him in a flash. And as the title suggests, the song is a playful riff on electronic indie-pop."I believe that everyone has a moment where they are being 'odd'. Sometimes I want to be silent or alone when I am among a crowd. It's a very private and personal feeling. It's about finding yourself and being yourself," says Wu, the former lead vocalist of Taiwan pop-rock band, Sodagreen."Although I have written songs for many people, I have never performed with another singer. This was my first time," adds Wu, who recorded the song with Li in Beijing.

                    Goldfish set to make a splash at Forbidden City century later

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                During the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), several royal concubines resided at the Palace of Prolonging Happiness, or Yanxi Gong, in the eastern wing of the inner court of Beijing's Forbidden City-or Palace Museum, as it's known today.Seemingly cursed, the palace was swallowed up by fire several times over the course of history. In 1909, Empress Dowager Longyu decided to construct a Western-style aquarium or "hall of water "to finally make a break with destiny. But two years later, before the building-the Lingzhao Veranda-could be completed, the Qing reign came to an end, with monarchy itself ending in China.Although the former royals continued to live in the Forbidden City after the republican revolution until 1924, construction of the Lingzhao Veranda never resumed.Perhaps it didn't matter. A new way was devised to realize the former royals' dream of viewing fish there. They used large barrels to raise goldfish in, which they called the "wooden sea".A century later, and this "wooden sea" has made a welcome return to the Yanxi Gong.For the monthlong exhibition Leisurely Bliss: Goldfish-Themed Artifacts from the Palace Museum Collection, which opened on Tuesday, about 200 goldfish in 42 species from around China will be put on display.

                    Weekend sees violence erupt in HK
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                After a relatively calm week, Hong Kong devolved again into violent rioting this weekend with at one point on Sunday a police officer surrounded and being assaulted by protesters firing his service revolver. It was the first time an officer fired his sidearm in the violent protests, which have been a near daily factor since early June. Despite heavy rain from Typhoon Bailu on Sunday afternoon, hundreds of protesters joined a procession in Tsuen Wan, in the southwestern New Territories. Because of the protest, subway operator MTR Corp temporarily closed the Kwai Fong, Tsuen Wan and Tsuen Wan West stations in the Tsuen Wan area in early afternoon. After about 3 pm, radicals deviated from the approved route of the march and started blocking roads, paralyzing traffic. About 10 roads in the area were closed and over 70 bus routes suspended or diverted. Rioters removed railings from roads and used water-filled barriers, bamboo sticks, traffic cones and other objects to set up barriers against the police. They hurled gasoline bombs and bricks dug up from the pavement at police officers, also pointing laser beams at them. Police condemned the violence. After repeated warnings, riot police used tear gas and used minimum force to disperse the protesters after 5 pm. The police also deployed for the first time their new crowd control vehicle: water cannon. At about 7 pm, a China Daily photographer's camera lens was broken by a thrown brick. The crowd gradually dispersed after 7 pm. Police arrested some protesters. As normalcy returned, with public transport service resuming in the eastern Kowloon district of Kwun Tong on Sunday, the scars of the previous day's violent clashes on the streets remained. Train services at various stations resumed along the Kwun Tong Line, including Kwun Tong, Ngau Tau Kok and Kowloon Bay stations, and most local stores reopened. Black, abusive graffiti scrawled on roads and walls of buildings were a grim reminder of Saturday's violence, which had shattered the previous weekend's relative calm. In Kowloon Bay on Sunday, the scene of fierce clashes between demonstrators and police, a sea of refuse left by protesters - including broken umbrellas and dismantled barricades - had been cleared by workers and stood piled on roadsides. Some of the "smart" lampposts on Sheung Yuet Road vandalized on Saturday were now protected by traffic cones. Black-clad, masked protesters had sawed off the new lampposts on Saturday. City officials said each "smart" lamppost cost about HK$140,000 ($17,850). In Kowloon Bay, Tso Tat-ming, a 60-year-old taxi driver, denounced radical protesters who resorted to violence to force the government to meet their demands. He lamented that not only his business had suffered but also retail and tourism industries were badly hit. Tso said he had been earning about HK$5,000 to HK$6,000 less monthly recently. "Some residents are scared seeing the protesters blocking main roads and tunnels with their guerilla-style tactics," he said, adding that some residents who had tried to reason with the protesters had been attacked. "Hong Kong is my home. I hope you (radical protesters) don't put the city in jeopardy," Tso said. China Daily (China Daily Global 08/26/2019 page3)
