                High-level international forum to focus on future of urban areas
            </p>
            <p>
                The third High-Level International Forum on Sustainable Urban Development will be held in Chengdu from today to Wednesday, highlighting the latest challenges and opportunities for cities and regions across the globe. The forum is sponsored by the National Development and Reform Commission and organized by the China Center for Urban Development, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme and Chengdu city government. During the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation held in Beijing in April, the Chinese government and the UN-Habitat signed an agreement on a joint action plan, and the High-Level International Forum on Sustainable Urban Development is listed in that plan. Policymakers, urban administrators, scholars and businesspeople are invited to attend the forum, who will discuss topics including urban development, urban-rural integration, children-friendly cities and green development. The 17 goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted by the United Nations in 2015, will again be a highlight of discussion. During the forum, the National Development and Reform Commission will hold a roundtable conference with the UN-Habitat, the World Health Organization and other international organizations to discuss the possibility of forming a cooperative mechanism to promote sustainable development under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative. The best ideas and practices will be shared at the roundtable meeting. According to Chengdu city's development and reform commission, the UN-Habitat and China Center for Urban Development will release a document entitled the Guiding Principles for Chengdu's Sustainable Development, to offer suggestions for the city's growth. Chengdu city hosted two sessions of the forum in 2017 and 2018, which had achieved positive results. The forum is seen as an important part of implementing the action plans proposed at the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. Delegates from more than 20 countries attended the 2017 forum. The Chengdu Declaration was announced during the event and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme released a list of the first batch of international pilot cities in sustainable development which included Chengdu. The first International Sustainable Urban Development Expo was held during the 2018 forum, exhibiting frontier technologies, innovative services and best practices in the field.

                Yangtze River Delta net zero emissions offer lessons to the world
            </a>
            <p>
                The Yangtze River Delta in East China has made tremendous progress in efforts to achieve net zero carbon emissions and offers lessons that can be applied in other parts of the world, according to a new publication.The efforts are outlined in a new guidebook, Net Zero Carbon Village Planning Guidelines for Yangtze River Delta Region, which was launched on the sidelines of the ongoing UN-Habitat Assembly in Nairobi, Kenya.Vincent Kitio, the chief of the urban energy unit at the UN-Habitat and one of the guidebook's authors, said villages across the globe can emulate and modify the Yangtze River strategies to suit their local conditions.Kitio said in their research, 10 principles were identified that are relevant not just for the Yangtze River Delta, but also to rapidly growing villages across the globe.He said the principles are innovative in capturing strategies that maintain carbon sinks and limits greenhouse gas emissions, directly addressing sustainable development goals.Jointly prepared by UN-Habitat's Urban Lab and Tongji University, Shanghai municipality and the Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences, the guidelines can set an example for zero carbon planning strategies that can be replicated in other relevant towns at the national and international level.To create zero carbon villages in the Yangtze River Delta, the guidelines state that it's key to focus on the relationship between the physical aspects of new developments, climate and energy demands.Additionally, the infrastructure necessary to ensure the closure of the energy, water, waste and food cycles, aiming for a high level of self-sufficiency, must be identified and integrated.This creates a relationship between the physical structures and the form of the built environment and the vital fluxes feeding it, as well as metabolized from it.

                Guangzhou award motivates cities to pursue innovation
            </a>
            <p>
                The Guangzhou International Award for Urban Innovation has become a vital platform for cities across the world to share best practices and learn from each other on localization of new urban agenda or NUA and sustainable development goals or SDGs.In its fourth edition, the competition has intensified over the years as cities embrace innovation to tackle both existing and new challenges. In 2018, a total of 113 initiatives were submitted by 213 cities and regions from over 70 countries.The technical committee identified a list of 45 commendable initiatives, followed by a shortlist of 15 initiatives and finally five award-winning cities.Within the context of the Guangzhou award, urban innovation is defined as the deliberate act of introducing new policies, programs, strategies, business models and types of partnerships to tackle existing and new challenges.According to Nicholas You, the executive director of Guangzhou Institute for Urban Innovation, cities are entering into a new era, where they are taking on roles that were traditionally not within their mandate, perhaps due to inability of the existing institutions to respond effectively to local challenges.While cities are mandated to basically collect garbage, keep streets clean, and manage traffic, You said most of them are currently creating jobs and new institutional frameworks to deal with issues outside the local government mandate."This is an important take away. That implementation of the new urban agenda, and SDGs at the local level, is going to compel many cities to think beyond their traditional mandate," he said.You gave the remarks at a side event in the first UN-Habitat Assembly, where four of the five cities that are the finalists for the 2018 Guangzhou award for Urban Innovation, shared their experiences on localizing NUA and SDGs.Greg Budworth, CEO of Compass Housing based in Australia, shared how Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, became an eco-friendly city where the 3Rs- recycle, reduce and reuse have become normative behaviors.The city promoted the 3R principles to a poorly educated community unfamiliar with the concepts. This was piloted in Kampung, one of the city's informal settlements.Through the 3R concept, the city-owned buses accept plastic bottles as a form of payment. Through this, Surabaya reduced waste by 10 percent per year even as the city population grew by 5 percent annually.

                The United Nations Human Settlements Programme concluded its first session of the UN-Habitat Assembly in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi over the weekend with a pledge to accelerate implementation of the New Urban Agenda, or NUA, and the Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs. More than 3,000 delegates who attended the five-day event adopted ministerial declarations, five resolutions and one decision to promote sustainable urbanization. Speaking during the closing ceremony, Martha Delgado, UN-Habitat Assembly president, said the delegates adopted guidelines on safer cities and a strategic plan for the period 2020-23.

                Go fish if need be! But, please, do so legally
            </a>
            <p>
                Chinese people love fish, and both the demand and consumption of fish are on the rise. Which is good, because fish is high in protein and low in fat, and fish help to feed a hungry world while providing livelihoods for hundreds of millions of people across the Asia-Pacific region. But, ironically, this increase in demand has also created opportunities for criminals to make a profit. While most of the region's fishing fleets operate within the rules, some $5 billion worth of fish are caught either illegally or without being reported, or the fishing boats operate in an unregulated environment. That's bad news on a number of levels. While illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is a global problem, the situation is disproportionately worse in the Asia-Pacific, because the region produces 75 percent of the world's seafood and IUU fishers target countries with poorly developed economies and regulations, which are also home to some of the most vulnerable communities. Of course, IUU fishing leads to over-exploitation of fish stocks and has a devastating impact on biodiversity and habitat. But it also hits honest people and communities dependent upon fishing right in the pocket, including buyers, sellers and legitimate industrial operators. In fact, evidence is mounting that IUU fishing is often associated with other transnational crimes including the exploitation of migrant workers enduring slavelike conditions on fishing boats at sea. In short, IUU fishing is a widespread and serious problem across the Asia-Pacific, and resolving it will require long-term and unified regional commitment. A good day's catch-reeling in the bad guys The good news is that many countries have recognized the need to take action on IUU and are doing so, by signing the Port State Measures Agreement, a legally binding treaty that works like a giant worldwide net that's closing in around IUU fishers. Introduced by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization in 2009, the PSMA is the first international agreement to set minimum standards for countries to prevent IUU seafood products from entering ports. Now fully enforceable, it provides a regulatory framework for countries to refuse entry of vessels suspected of participating in or facilitating IUU fishing activities and allows for enforced inspection of vessels if entry is granted. Once a fishing boat is identified as one operating in contravention of the PSMA, the information can be shared with the maritime and fishing authorities of other countries - making it more difficult for the particular boat and its captain to continue profiting from IUU fishing. The effectiveness of this instrument in the region is clear with vessels being seized and fishers being prosecuted by countries that have inked the PSMA. Thailand and Indonesia are two such countries. So far, 19 countries and territories in the Asia-Pacific region have acceded to the PSMA and several more are in the process of doing so. The PSMA is complemented by other regional initiatives that are setting seafood traceability standards so that buyers of seafood from Asia-Pacific countries can be sure the products do not come from IUU fishing practices. Such guarantees are opening up international markets for Asia and Pacific products. However, while real and rapid progress is being made in the Asia-Pacific to reduce illegal fishing there is still much to be done to eliminate misreporting or nonreporting of catch. The rapid advancement of access to telecommunications in the Asia-Pacific has provided an infrastructure for the adoption of digital tools for reporting of catch. The immediate challenge is to empower fishers to adopt this technology downstream. Eyes in the sky, boats on the water, boots on the ground Upstream, the region now has seven "state-of-the-art" fisheries monitoring and surveillance centers which use high-tech equipment to identify vessels suspected of engaging in IUU practices. The establishment of national centers in Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Thailand and the United States, in conjunction with the regional surveillance center for the western Pacific in the Solomon Islands, has increased the capacity for cohesion and collaboration among Asia-Pacific states to tackle IUU fishing. Further developing efficient and effective monitoring and surveillance technologies, rewarding honest fishers (including small-scale fishers) for accurately reporting all catch (through enhanced market access), and building capacity of port states to detect and prosecute IUU fishers are clear steps toward eliminating IUU fishing. Accession by all Asia-Pacific countries to the PSMA will send a loud and clear message to those involved in, or considering, IUU fishing that we're onto them. June 5 is International Day for the Fight against IUU Fishing and a timely reminder of the tasks at hand. And the time is now for the countries in the Asia-Pacific to expand their efforts to combat IUU fishing.

                Some good news, but will New York 2019 deliver?
            </a>
            <p>
                Elegant speeches won't do. The Climate Action Summit on Sept 23 should present concrete plans to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050 Even in this dangerous and unpredictable world, it's still possible sometimes to be surprised by hope - and on problems as challenging as the climate. One morning recently I woke up to the news that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro had ordered the Brazilian army to tackle the fires blazing through Amazonia. Later that day news came that Russia is planning to ratify the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. That was a hopeful day - to start with, at least. There is still time to tackle climate change, but it's going to need an unprecedented effort from us all. Global greenhouse emissions are reaching record levels, with no sign of peaking, and sea levels are rising. The last four years were the hottest on record, and arctic winter temperatures have risen by 3 C since 1990. We are now seeing the impact of climate change on health through air pollution, heat waves and risks to food security. But hold on to hope. The latest analysis shows that if we act now, we can reduce carbon emissions within 12 years and limit the global average temperature increase to well below 2 C and even to just 1.5 C above preindustrial levels, as the Paris Agreement requires. But that can succeed only with ambitious action, and so far the world has not shown anywhere near the ambition needed. To raise ambition and speed up action on implementing the Paris Agreement, UN Secretary-General Ant��nio Guterres will host the 2019 Climate Action Summit on Sept 23. It aims to demonstrate not only a surge in countries' political ambitions, but a massive movement in the global economy as well, to make it possible to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. And it is aiming to result in much faster action. So governments are being asked not just to make elegant speeches in New York, but to present concrete, realistic plans. These should list out how they will realistically improve their commitments under the Paris Agreement (known as their Nationally Determined Contributions - the emissions cuts they intend to make) by 2020, and then actually reduce those emissions by 45 percent over the next decade, and to net zero by 2050. It sounds simple; it almost certainly won't be. The UN says it will involve transformative changes in the areas of energy transition, infrastructure, cities and local action, industry transition, resilience and adaptation, nature-based solutions, climate finance and carbon pricing. And New York 2019 will also have to spell out how to achieve a full transformation of economies in line with the goals, not creating winners and losers or adding to economic inequality. And it needs also to include women as key decisionmakers. It will focus on finding how to move the world to renewable energy, sustainable and resilient infrastructures and cities relying on mass transport and caring for the urban poor, sustainable agriculture and management of forests and oceans, resilience and adaptation to climate impacts, and aligning public and private finance with a net zero economy. Doing all this should be easy, and in one sense it is. Business is recognizing the advantages to be gained from moving to a net-zero society. Accelerated climate solutions can strengthen economies and create jobs, while bringing cleaner air, preserving natural habitats and biodiversity, and protecting the environment. New technologies and engineering solutions are already generating energy more cheaply than fossil fuels. Solar and onshore wind are now the least expensive sources of new bulk power in virtually all major economies. But there's much more to do to overcome the inertia and resistance to change that continues to heat up the world. That's going to mean, for example, ending subsidies for fossil fuels and agriculture that comes with high emissions, shifting instead toward renewable energy, electric vehicles and climate-smart practices. It means carbon pricing that reflects the true cost of emissions, from climate risk to health hazards. And it means faster closure of coal plants, ending the construction of new ones and replacing dirty jobs with healthier alternatives. There are grounds for hope, but there are plenty of reasons for concern. Yes, there are national and global efforts to extinguish the Amazonian fires. But how much damage have they done already which can never be put right? Scientists warn that Brazil could be nearing the point where its forests will start drying out - and be damaged beyond saving. Yes, probably Russia will soon ratify the Paris Agreement - but so what? What if the agreement is still too weak to cut carbon emissions deeply enough? Time is running out very fast. A wise man once told me: "Protecting the environment means finding new ways to think." How fast can we do that? The author was a veteran BBC environment journalist.
