                Semenya responds to court case with victory on track in 800
            </p>
            <p>
                DOHA, Qatar — Caster Semenya has easily won the 800 meters at a Diamond League meet, her first race since losing a high-profile court case against track and field's governing body.The Olympic champion was never challenged Friday when she won in 1 minute 54.98 seconds, her fourth fastest time. She faced a strong field that included two Olympic medalists — Francine Niyonsaba and Maragaret Wambui.Semenya's dominance in the 800 might be at an end, though.This was the last women's 800-meter race before new regulations take effect. They will require Semenya and other female athletes with high levels of natural testosterone to lower them to be eligible to compete in certain events.Semenya has not said if she will follow those rules or switch to longer distances not affected by the regulations.AP

                Semenya's fan club growing
            </a>
            <p>
                Controversial South African speedster counts LeBron, Kaepernick and Billie Jean King as supportersNEW YORK - South African track star Caster Semenya can add LeBron James to the list of admirers ahead of her showdown with the international track and field governing body.James watched the world and Olympic 800 meter champion win a race last month in Berlin. She's a fan of the LA Lakers star, and they're both Nike-sponsored athletes."You know, in American English they say 'you're dope'," said a smiling Semenya, who wore James' white and gold Nike shoes with a lion head on the back. "LeBron told me to keep on working hard, that I'm a special kid. I was deeply touched."James is just one of Semenya's global fans, supporting a fight against world track officials that's dragged on nearly a decade.The IAAF wants to limit the eligibility of female middledistance runners who have naturally high levels of testosterone. Semenya - who has not often spoken openly about challenges - is taking control of her message, joining Nike sponsored-athletes like James, Colin Kaepernick and Simone Biles in a series of ads.In the video I Was Born to Do This, Semenya asks: "Will it be easier for you if I wasn't so fast? Will it be simpler for you if I stopped winning? Would you be more comfortable if I was less proud?"Semenya said her intended audience is not her critics or competitors."It's just to inspire the youth, to be honest," she said. "They see light in me. So they can see a better future."On Wednesday night, Semenya will receive the Wilma Rudolph Courage Award from the Women's Sports Foundation and Billie Jean King. Semenya flew 23 hours from Johannesburg, via Dubai, for her first trip to New York.King and the Women's Sports Foundation are supporting Semenya in her latest fight against the IAAF, which wants females to be required to take hormones to lower their testosterone to compete in international events and the Olympics.Semenya and Athletics South Africa are challenging the proposal before the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, Switzerland.On Tuesday, her hearing got pushed back to February, with the possible start of the IAAF's ruling on March 26.Early in Semenya's career, her improved times and what some competitors considered a masculine appearance drew the attention of the IAAF.Before the 2009 world championships in Berlin, the IAAF made her undergo gender tests and the results were not released. But on the day of the final, it became public she'd been tested.Semenya, who was 18 at the time, won the 800 title despite the distractions.Then the IAAF stopped Semenya from competing for 11 months while conducting more tests. She was allowed to return in 2010, with no explanation from the governing body.Semenya said her family deals with the critics based on how she responds."You cannot control what other people say. I'm the one who can control that by being me," she said."By being that kid that they raised. That kid with respect and a sense of humor."The IAAF wants to lower natural testosterone in female middle-distance runners to a maximum of five nanomoles per liter of blood.The governing body argues that naturally high testosterone provides a "competitive advantage". There is no equivalent rule for male athletes.The previous IAAF maximum of 10 nanos for females was enacted in 2011 and struck down in 2015 by CAS after Indian sprinter Dutee Chand challenged the rule.The current IAAF attempt seeks to narrow the rule to females who run the 400, 800 and 1,500."It is always concerning, as a matter of law, when policies appear to be targeted to limit the participation of a small group of individuals," said Suzanne Goldberg, director of the Center for Gender & Sexuality Law at Columbia University.Semenya's legal firm Norton Rose Fulbright said in statement in June it is necessary to challenge the IAAF's proposal to "protect the rights of all women". Her lawyers say it violates the IAAF constitution, the Olympic charter and universally recognized human rights.Growing up playing soccer with boys in the province of Northern Limpopo, Semenya drew strength from meeting Nelson Mandela on several occasions after winning the 2009 world title."The words of wisdom he shared with me - it was about educating yourself to be better," she said."Education is the key to success. Sport does unite people. It changed other people's lives."Treat other people with love and respect. If you can learn that, life is just simple."A sports science major at the University of Pretoria, she went on to win world titles in the 800 in 2011 and 2017 and gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics.Russia's Mariya Savinova - one of the competitors who publicly criticized Semenya's times and physique - was banned from the sport for doping in 2017. Her 800 gold medal from the 2012 London Olympics was handed to second-place finisher Semenya.King joined more than 60 athletes who wrote an open letter to the IAAF in July, urging it to rescind the proposed standard. US soccer star Megan Rapinoe called out sports federations for policing female bodies but "never our male counterparts".She pointed to the competitive advantage of the wingspan of Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt's long legs.Competitive advantages might include the age an athlete starts training, the quality of coaches and facilities, nutrition and other factors."Singling out women's testosterone levels from all possible factors that influence athletes' success is not a sensible or just answer," Goldberg said.The 27-year-old Semenya plans to defend her 800 world title in September in Doha, Qatar, and her Olympic gold at the 2020 Tokyo Games.Her long-term goal is to break the 800 world record of 1:53.28 set in 1983. She's about one second off the mark."South Africa is a rainbow nation for me," said Semenya, who carried the flag at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics."I stand for my country, I stand for my people, I stand for people who love and support me. It's fantastic."Semenya is married to Violet Raseboya, her longtime partner and former runner, who is setting up a foundation to benefit South African youth.Associated Press

                Kenya's Olympiad Wambui plots Semenya's downfall of 800m dominance
            </a>
            <p>
                NAIROBI -- Olympic 800m bronze medalist Margaret Wambui believes she will finally emerge from the shadow of South Africa's Caster Semenya and beat her at the World Championships in Doha, Qatar in 2019.Speaking in Nairobi on Tuesday, Wambui says Semenya, who is both world and Olympic champion, is beatable and believes she is the one who will finally puncture the aura of invincibility that the South African has over the two-lap race at international level."Competition is about winning and losing and nobody is indispensible. Everyone is beatable," said Wambui, who was fourth at London World Championships in 2017."Semenya is beatable. Her day will come but let her enjoy the moment. My time is yet to come," she added.Semenya remains unbeaten since 2015 and a lack of serious competition has prompted her to branch out into the 400m and 1,500m distances."It has always been my dream to win a major competition and my target next year is to win the World Championships in Doha and then we will see what happens at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics," Wambui said.Also hoping to compete at the Doha worlds is Francine Niyonsaba, who holds a personal best of 1:55.47, run in Monaco in 2017.Like Wambui, Niyonsaba has largely played second fiddle to Semenya, finishing second in both the 2017 worlds and the 2016 Olympics.The trio will relaunch their rivalry early next year, starting with the indoor circuit before moving outdoors with the Diamond League series, with the Doha worlds representing the culmination of the 2019 season.

                Semenya's status still in limbo
            </a>
            <p>
                LONDON - The Times reported on Wednesday that the IAAF will argue that Olympic women's 800m champion Caster Semenya should be classified as a "biological male" and forced to take testosterone suppressants in order to compete in women's competitions. Ahead of a landmark hearing at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) next week, the newspaper said the IAAF will contest Semenya and other athletes with "differences of sexual development", arguing that so-called DSD athletes should only be able to compete with lower testosterone levels. However, athletics' world governing body denied the "biological male" claims, stating: "The IAAF is not classifying any DSD athlete as male. To the contrary, we accept their legal sex without question, and permit them to compete in the female category.

                Semenya accuses IAAF of breach of regulations at CAS hearing
            </a>
            <p>
                Caster Semenya has said the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) breached confidentiality regulations ahead of her appeal hearing on Monday where she is fighting for her athletics future.The South African 800-metres double Olympic champion is seeking to overturn a new set of IAAF regulations that are aimed at lowering the testosterone levels of hyperandrogenic athletes.The appeal, being heard at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Switzerland, could be a landmark case for the sport with wide-reaching consequences.Semenya believes the IAAF breached confidentiality rules of the hearing after they released the names of five expert witnesses they will bring to the CAS to testify on their behalf."The arbitration proceedings are subject to strict confidentiality provisions and this information should not have been released?" Semenya's lawyers said in a statement on Monday."Ms Semenya believes the IAAF press release is a clear breach of the confidentiality provisions that was orchestrated in an effort to influence public opinion in circumstances where the IAAF knew that Ms Semenya would not be prepared to respond because she was complying with her confidentiality obligations."As a matter of fairness Ms Semenya raised this issue with the CAS and has been granted permission to publicly release information responding to the IAAF press release? including disclosing the experts who are testifying in support of Ms Semenya's case. This information will be released tomorrow."An IAAF spokesperson told Reuters they believe they were within their rights to make their witness list public."The IAAF does not believe the list of witnesses it will be calling is confidential, just their evidence at CAS," the spokesperson said.

                Semenya camp slams Coe for opening 'old wounds' in interview
            </a>
            <p>
                Caster Semenya accused IAAF president Sebastian Coe of opening "old wounds" in an Australian newspaper interview, where he said the two-time Olympic 800-meter champion and other female athletes with high levels of naturally occurring testosterone were a threat to "the sanctity of fair competition".In a response released on Wednesday, Semenya's lawyers said Coe's comments and the Daily Telegraph's "distorted" reporting - the newspaper referred to the South Africa runner as "muscle-packed" and "unbeatable" - reminded her of how she was scrutinized and judged at her first world championships in 2009, when she was 18.Back then, Semenya won the 800m title a day after it was revealed she underwent gender tests ordered by the IAAF, partly because of her muscular physique.Some Australian media were criticized for inaccurate and unsavory reporting at the time, when they speculated on the then-teenager's anatomy.Semenya underwent further medical examinations after the event and was sidelined from running for nearly a year. The IAAF later accepted her in women's competitions.Semenya read Coe's interview with the Daily Telegraph over the weekend, her lawyers said."Ms. Semenya remembers her story breaking out of Australia ten years ago on the eve of her competing in the 2009 world championships," Semenya's lawyers said in their statement."After winning the 800-meter final the next day, Ms. Semenya stood in the middle of the stadium knowing that everyone watching the event was judging her. She was 18 years old."The nature of the intrusive medical examinations that Ms. Semenya was subjected to following the event were discussed publicly, including by the IAAF. The scars Ms. Semenya has developed over the past decade run deep."The statement from Semenya's camp came as she and track's governing body wait for a verdict from the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in a case that could change women's sports.Now 28, Semenya has gone to the CAS to challenge rules the IAAF wants to introduce to lower the high levels of natural testosterone in some female athletes through medication or surgery before they can compete in top-class races from distances ranging from 400 meters to the mile.A five-day hearing was held last month and a decision is expected in late April.In the interview with the Daily Telegraph, Coe was quoted as saying the proposed rules were designed "to protect the sanctity of fair competition and fair play"."The reason we have gender classifications is because if you didn't, no woman would ever win another title or another medal or break another record in our sport," Coe was quoted as saying.Associated Press

                Defiant Semenya threatens to skip world championships
            </a>
            <p>
                STANFORD, California - Olympic champion Caster Semenya said on Sunday she would not defend her world title in Doha in September if she cannot run in the 800 meters because of new testosterone regulations imposed by the sport's governing body."If I am not running the 800m, I'm not running in the world championships," the South African said after winning her favorite event in one minute, 55.70 seconds at the Prefontaine Classic Diamond League meeting in California."No 1,500 (meters), nothing. I am just going to take a vacation, and then come (back to competing) next year."But the 28-year-old, who is challenging International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) testosterone rules that could affect her career, is looking towards the next three Olympics."I expect to be in Tokyo, Paris and Los Angeles," she saidSemenya repeated that she would not take medication to satisfy the IAAF regulations, which are currently on hold for her after a court ruling.Under the rules, XY chromosome athletes with differences in sexual de velopment (DSDs), like Semenya, must take medication to lower their natural testosterone levels if they are to compete at distances from 400m to a mile.Testosterone is a hormone that increases muscle mass, strength and hemoglobin levels and the IAAF said its own research showed it gave a significant endurance advantage to athletes in the 400m-to-mile range.Semenya has refused to take the medication, saying: "I am a woman and I am a world-class athlete. The IAAF will not drug me or stop me from being who I am."But she said that even if she eventually lost her case, she planned to continue competing."There are a lot of races that I can do, there is a lot of stuff that I can do," she said."I am a talented athlete. I can play football (soccer), I can play basketball, I can do anything."I can run 100, I can run 200, I can run the steeplechase. I can do anything I want."Semenya charged ahead about 600m into Sunday's race and won by almost 15m over American Ajee Wilson to claim her 31st consecutive final in the event. She last lost an 800m final in Berlin on Sept 6, 2015.The race was the fastest ever run in the United States, but three-time world champion Semenya said she felt sluggish."I would be still sleeping at home, "she said, noting it was about midnight in South Africa.The competition was Semenya's first since the Swiss Federal Tribunal said she did not have to adhere to the IAAF regulations until her appeal against a Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruling in favor of the new rules is decided.The IAAF has said the regulations are necessary to preserve the integrity of female athletics in the restricted events.Reuters
