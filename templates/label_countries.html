Not only were cross-Straits ties friendly but also two-way trade and people-to-people exchanges flourished because Ma accepted the 1992 Consensus

                             A recent case in point in using regional economic relationships as building blocks for industrialization was a topic at a policy seminar of the Southern Africa Development Community, with a view toward its collaboration with China.Should the continent look to Asian friend's 'regional' model and adapt this approach? As a result of an emphasis on industrialization as the potential key driver of Africa's development at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) Johannesburg Summit in 2015, it has become a major area of focus for policymakers, implementers and thought leaders in Africa. For instance, it is doubtful that industrialization projects would take off in countries beset by policy and political challenges unless nudged by others outside the continent

                             If Osborne stays on as chancellor or moves to another important position within the government, like foreign secretary, then Britain's continued fostering of the China relationship is highly likely. Now that the ice has been broken between Britain, which remains one of the West's most influential societies, and China, the main Asian power and leader of the newly emerging world, the Sino-British relationship will probably continue to be of real economic and strategic significance to both sides, with or without British membership in the EU. The answer will depend largely on two things: first, the departure terms agreed by Britain with the EU, particularly regarding Britain's post-Brexit access to the single European market and the ease with which London-based financial institutions can continue to operate inside the EU; and second, Britain's longer-term success in creating a global economic footprint, based on developing trade relationships with important countries outside Europe like India and, yes, China

Especially in the context of the rising anti-globalization sentiment in many EU countries and North America, it is now time for East Asia to shoulder the historical responsibility of leading the global trend of regional cooperation. Although there have been some cooperation achievements at the financial level, such as the establishment of the East Asian foreign exchange reserve, it has not been able to initiate free trade negotiations under this framework even till now

In a communique after their two-day annual meeting in France on April 6, the G7 demonized BRI as a sign of China's global dominance and an obstacle for Western alliances. China's aid to Africa is making a more significant impact than the West's condition-based programmes, which were ultimately bad experiments on Africa's economies

                             In reference to the planned visit, the first of its kind in seven years, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Wednesday that more military exchanges between the two countries are beneficial for both sides to "properly handle disputes and consolidate mutual trust in security". The move toward restoring normal military contacts comes as the two sides have just concluded consultations on the creation of a maritime and air liaison mechanism to help avoid any misunderstanding or misjudgment. The two countries are yet to resolve the territorial dispute over the Diaoyu Islands in East China Sea, and the liaison mechanism will be an effective means of reducing the risks of any untoward incident happening

                            The Chinese president proposed that BRICS countries strengthen their strategic partnership, noting that in the second decade of BRICS cooperation mechanism, the leaders of the five countries should play a strategic leading role, steer BRICS cooperation in the right direction and continue to make steady progress in this regard.BRICS countries should better demonstrate the strategic value of their solidarity and cooperation, firmly uphold the development right of developing countries, and raise the status of emerging economies and developing countries in global affairs, they said.BRICS countries need to strengthen coordination, more actively play a leading role, safeguard multilateralism and rules-based international trading system, promote fair and sustainable patterns of development and trade based on mutual respect, and develop a more balanced international trade negotiations agenda, so as to play an even bigger role in boosting common prosperity and world economic growth, they agreed

The expansion of cities will increase continuously in the next 30 years and [oblige] the governments in this region to launch good management techniques to protect their countries from disasters," he said. It suggested that policy-makers make three preparations to deal with disasters: optimise the effectiveness of the Bt350-billion water-management budget; ensure cooperation among agencies assigned to analyse and study legal aspects of disaster issues; and develop city plans that minimise disaster risks from urban expansion, said World Bank official Abhas Jha

Both initiatives have enabled Chinese investment and loans in Africa to give priority to development projects and, through Chinese loans, have for the first time enabled African governments to turn the continent's resources advantage into a development advantage. Since Africa is yet to climb the value chain of mineral processing and manufacturing, the assistance in building up local capacity could have a much greater impact on developing skills in African economies if it were closely aligned with African economic potential and priority sectors, such as manufacturing

                            In order to achieve a practical way of making strides toward this target, the Chinese and UAE delegations, led by President Xi Jinping and His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan respectively, signed 16 agreements and memorandums of understanding, with the aim of strengthening cooperation across a vast number of areas, including economy, trade, investment, technology, artificial intelligence, culture and education, as well as protecting the environment and achieving food security. We now have a substantial result in this respect, complementing the strong synergy from President Xi Jinping’s visit to the UAE last year, with 14 memorandums and the setting in motion of the comprehensive strategic partnership. This forum showed the level of sophistication achieved in the UAE-China relationship, as opportunities for joint action for investment were explored with a high-ranking ministerial delegation and business leaders from the respective nations

                             In fact, there is a good reason that they should welcome such a move: recent research by my team at the University of Northampton indicated that the latest stages of globalization of innovation actually involved Chinese companies investing in developed countries for R&D and, perhaps counter-intuitively, they have things to teach their partners in the West, therefore also helping the latter to further upgrade their capabilities.Moving up the value chainWhile Western observers should keep pressing and helping China to further improve IP protection, they must also recognize and appreciate the legitimate concerns of China, and developing countries in general, in upgrading themselves in global value chains. There are many intertwined issues between China and the US (and the West in general) but the core issue is how the world (including China itself) should comprehend and cope with the rise of China and its technological giants
