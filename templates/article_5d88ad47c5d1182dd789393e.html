                Death toll rises to 22 in mass shooting in El Paso
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                HOUSTON - The death toll in weekend mass shooting in El Paso, US state of Texas, has risen to 22 after two people died at a hospital, El Paso police and medical officials said Monday.The Del Sol Medical Center in El Paso confirmed the deaths during a news conference Monday. One victim died on Sunday night, and another died on Monday morning.According to officials with the Del Sol Medical Center, there are five patients in stable condition and one in critical condition at the hospital. One patient has been transferred.Three Mexican nationals are among the dead and another six among the injured, Mexican officials said late Saturday. No first responders were among those killed or injured.US President Donald Trump said on Monday morning the shooter's manifesto was "consumed with racist hate."He called for mental health gun control reforms, the death penalty for those who commit mass murder and more bi-partisan cooperation over gun laws.On Sunday, Trump issued a proclamation, ordering that all American flags at military installations, federal facilities, and the White House be flown at half-staff until sunset on Aug 8.On Monday, three service dogs from Texas city of San Antonio arrived in El Paso to patients and families of shooting victims.Their handlers say the dogs from the Methodist Healthcare System are specially trained to help people experiencing grief, stress and trauma, local media reported.The attack in the border city of El Paso in Texas happened on Aug 3 at a Walmart mall. More than 20 people were also injured in the attack with several in serious condition. The victims' identities have not been released. A 21-year-old white male has been arrested.

                    ICE releases some workers after Mississippi raid
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                300 of 680 arrested at poultry plant, suspected of being in US illegally, released after processing; volunteers provide aid to familiesAbout 300 of the 680 immigrant workers arrested by federal authorities at seven poultry processing plants in Mississippi were released on Thursday as church groups, schools and other volunteers prepared to take care of children whose parents remained in custody following the raids.About 30 workers were released at the plants east of Jackson, the state capital, and about 270 were released from a nearby military base where they were taken to be processed. No court dates were immediately set to determine if those held or released will be deported."Not everyone is going to be detained," Bryan Cox, a spokesman for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), said in a statement.The raids, conducted Wednesday by about 600 officers from ICE and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in conjunction with the US attorney's office for the Southern District of Mississippi, were the largest since April, when agents arrested more than 280 people, suspected of being in the US illegally, in Texas in what then was called the largest worksite roundup in 10 years.In 2006, about 1,200 immigrants were arrested at food-processing plants in Colorado, Nebraska, Texas, Utah, Iowa and Minnesota."HSI's worksite enforcement efforts are equally focused on aliens who unlawfully seek work in the US as well as the employers who knowingly hire them," Jere Miles, special agent in charge of the New Orleans office, said in a statement. "The execution of federal search warrants was about enforcing the rule of law in our state and throughout the country."A spokeswoman for Koch Foods, which operates three plants in the region, told China Daily the company had no comment on the raids. Koch Foods is a privately held company and is not affiliated with Koch Industries or the Koch brothers, who contribute to Republican candidates and support libertarian causes.Joanna King, spokeswoman for the Catholic Diocese of Jackson, said attorneys from around the nation have volunteered to represent those arrested."Concerns about food and clothing are being taken care of at the parish level," she told China Daily. "Our next concern is the financial needs of the families. Many have paid rent but now have no income."Chad Harrison, assistant superintendent at the Scott County School District located about 47 miles (75 kilometers) east of Jackson and near several food-processing plants, said teachers told students about the raids and tried to comfort those whose parents were detained.He said the school district has 4,024 students, including 576 Hispanics, or about 14.31 percent of total enrollment. Most Hispanic students are young and enrolled in elementary or middle schools. On Thursday, 153 Hispanic students were absent, but Harrison said the school district didn't know if their parents had been swept up in the raids."We're trying to make it a routine day," Harrison told China Daily. "We have translators at the schools, and the federal agencies have been very helpful and will help with reunification. No students stayed at school overnight — they were released to relatives or friends."Harrison said he didn't want to "get into the politics of the situation" and noted, "The kids were afraid at first, but our teachers want the kids to feel like school is a safe harbor."Elected officials, advocacy groups and lawyers decried the raids of the poultry processing plants east of Jackson. The industry relies on immigrant labor to work in cold conditions to cut, clean, debone and pack chicken."The ICE raids are both dehumanizing and ineffective as a tactic for protecting citizens from potential harm," Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said in a statement. "These raids will only further alienate communities from law enforcement, disrupt community policing efforts and cause law enforcement to forfeit credibility and trust among the people they are sworn to protect."Bill Chandler, director of the Immigrants Rights Alliance in Jackson, said the raids were part of US President Donald Trump's continued actions against immigrants."These raids are part of an anti-immigrant campaign that Trump has engaged in since the 2016 campaign," Chandler told China Daily. "The raids are meant to terrorize Latinos and get them out of Mississippi. Trump's racist reaction to the immigrants is appalling."Cliff Johnson, director of the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi, called the raids "political grandstanding"."What did the government accomplish today by sending hundreds of out-of-state agents into Mississippi for the purpose of rounding up and detaining more than 680 of our hard-working neighbors and friends?" he said in a statement. "We're aren't one bit safer tonight — nobody believes these people were a danger to anyone. Families have been torn apart and local businesses have been hurt."

                    Walmart pulls violent game displays; no change on gun sales
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Walmart is removing from its stores nationwide signs, displays or videos that depict violence following a mass shooting at one of its stores in Texas, though it has not changed its policy on gun sales.The retailer instructed employees in an internal memo to remove any marketing material, turn off or unplug video game consoles that show violent games — specifically Xbox and PlayStation consoles, and to monitor and turn off any violence depicted on screens in its electronics departments.Employees were also ordered to turn off hunting season videos in the sporting goods department where guns are sold.Under the heading: "Immediate Action," employees were instructed to "Review your store for any signing or displays that contain violent images or aggressive behavior. Remove from the salesfloor or turn off these items immediately.""We've taken this action out of respect for the incidents of the past week," said spokeswoman Tara House in an email to The Associated Press on Friday.The company's policy on sales of video games that depict violence has not changed, nor has its policy on gun sales.Following the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Walmart Inc. banned sales of firearms and ammunition to people younger than 21. It had stopped selling AR-15s and other semi-automatic weapons in 2015, citing weak sales.There is no known link between violent video games and violent acts.Patrick Markey, a psychology professor at Villanova University who focuses on video games, found in his research that men who commit severe acts of violence actually play violent video games less than the average male. About 20% were interested in violent video games, compared with 70% of the general population, he explained in his 2017 book "Moral Combat: Why the War on Violent Video Games Is Wrong."The killings in Texas, followed by another in Dayton, Ohio, just hours later that left nine dead, have put the country on edge.On Thursday, five days after the El Paso shooting, panicked shoppers fled a Walmart in Springfield, Missouri, after a man carrying a rifle and wearing body armor walked around the store before being stopped by an off-duty firefighter.No shots were fired and the man was arrested after surrendering.A backfiring motorcycle in New York's Times Square set off a stampede Tuesday. Video footage showed the throngs rushing out of the busy tourism and entertainment area, some taking cover behind vehicles and in doorways.The New York Police Department took to social media saying, "There is no #ActiveShooter in #TimesSquare. Motorcycles backfiring while passing through sounded like gunshots."There have been 254 mass shooting in the United States this, according to the Gun Violence Archive. That means there have been more instances of four or more people being shot in individual outbreaks of violence than there have been days in 2019.The latest shootings have supercharged an already hot political topic this year.On Friday, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren blasted the company in a tweet."Companies that sell guns have a responsibility to the safety of their communities. @Walmart is one of the largest gun retailers in the world. The weapons they sell are killing their own customers and employees. No profit is worth those lives. Do the right thing_stop selling guns," Warren tweeted.Authorities believe Patrick Crusius, 21, wrote a racist, rambling screed that railed against mass immigration before opening fire last weekend at the El Paso Walmart. Crusius lived near Dallas, and El Paso police say he drove more than 10 hours to the largely Latino border city in Texas to carry out the shooting that killed 22 people and wounded about two dozen others. He's been charged with capital murder.Chris Ayres, a Dallas-based attorney for Crusius' family, told The Associated Press in an email they never heard Crusius express the kind of racist and anti-immigrant views that he allegedly posted online.AP

                    UN chief calls for India, Pakistan to exercise 'maximum restraint'
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                NEW DELHI - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged India and Pakistan to refrain from taking any steps that would affect the status of Kashmir.UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Guterres "is also concerned over reports of restrictions" in India-controlled Kashmir, "which could exacerbate the human rights situation in the region", and reiterates his call for "maximum restraint".An Indian presidential decree issued on Monday revoked Article 370 of India's constitution that guaranteed special rights to the Kashmir.Indian government also imposed an unprecedented security lockdown and a near-total communications blackout in the region since Aug 4, arresting more than 500 people.Tensions has since been escalated between India and neighboring Pakistan.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday night that he had stripped India-controlled Kashmir of its statehood and special constitutional status to free the disputed region of "terrorism and separatism".In his first nationally broadcast speech on the decision, Modi described the changes as historic. He assured its residents that the situation will soon "return to normal gradually", although he gave no specifics.Modi said the "mainstreaming" of the Kashmiri people with the rest of the nation would expedite development and create new jobs with investment from public and private companies.He accused Pakistan of using the past arrangement "as a weapon to incite people of the region against India.""I have complete faith under this new system we all will be able to free" India-controlled Kashmir "of terrorism and separatism", Modi said, referring to ending the region's special status.Pakistan said it would downgrade diplomatic ties with New Delhi, expel the Indian ambassador and suspend trade and a key train service with India. Prime Minister Imran Khan told his National Security Committee that his government will use all diplomatic channels "to expose the brutal Indian racist regime" and human rights violations in Kashmir, a government's statement said.Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said on Thursday Islamabad is not considering any military action, looking instead at its political and legal options.Pakistan has also promised to take the matter to the UN Security Council, while its military has said it "firmly stands" with Kashmiris.Meanwhile, a strict curfew keeping residents of India-controlled Kashmir in their homes for a fifth day will be eased for Friday prayers, according to the region's police chief."People will be allowed to go to the area-specific mosques for the prayers in most parts of the Srinagar city," the region's police chief told The Associated Press.The relaxing of the curfew was temporary but a precise time frame wasn't given. Friday prayers started at 12:37 pm in Srinagar and last for about 20 minutes.The Press Trust of India news agency said authorities will allow people to offer prayers in small local mosques.Agencies - Xinhua

                    Social media roasted over US shootings
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Shootings that left 31 people dead and 53 injured in two US cities during a 24-hour period have prompted a national outcry over the role of social media in distributing white supremacist and extremist content online.Violent extremism online has dominated the news since the shootings on Aug 3 at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, killed 22 people and 9 people in Dayton, Ohio, raising questions about online platforms' responsibility to deal with extremism.The suspect in the El Paso case is accused of publishing an anti-immigrant "manifesto" on the web forum "8chan"' minutes before the attack took place.Patrick Crusius, 21, of Allen, Texas, has been charged with capital murder in the mass shooting that left more than two dozen injured. He is being held without bond and prosecutors are handling the attack as a case of domestic terrorism.Trump administration officials met with leaders from the technology companies last week and discussed efforts to combat online extremism.A four-page document, titled "The Inconvenient Truth," was published on 8chan about 20 minutes before the shooting in El Paso. Shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand, on March 15, and at a synagogue in Poway, California, on April 27, began with a post on 8chan.The suspect in the El Paso shooting claimed in the document that he was inspired by the Christchurch massacre that killed 51 people.It is filled with white supremacist language and racist hatred aimed at immigrants and Latinos. The author says he opposes "race mixing" and encourages immigrants to return to their home countries.The website 8chan has a history of use by extremists celebrating racist, anti-Semitic and white supremacist violence. The El Paso shooting prompted the site's founder, Fredrick Brennan, who no longer controls it, to urge its owners to "do the world a favor and shut it off".The site went offline after the cybersecurity company Cloudflare, which had been keeping the site online for years, decided to cut off services to 8chan under public pressure. The company Tucows, 8chan's domain name registrar, also said it would no longer provide services to the site."We have a white nationalist terrorism problem in this country and it's being aided and abetted by our largest technology companies," said the activist group Sleeping Giants in a tweet. "If you're doing business with a site that helps people spread violent, racist ideologies, you are just as culpable. Full stop," the group tweeted.The El Paso shooting came days after a shooter killed three people and injured 13 others on July 28 at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in California. The FBI announced on Tuesday it had opened a domestic terrorism investigation into the shooting.The shooter, who died in the incident, had a "target list" of religious institutions, political organizations and federal buildings, said the police.Authorities believe that the gunman in the Dayton shooting on Aug 3 was exploring "violent ideologies" before going on a killing spree. The shooter was killed in the incident, too."There is a direct correlation between the rise of hate groups on social media and the frequent attacks," Keegan Hankes, a senior research analyst for the Southern Poverty Law Center advocacy group, told USA Today.Hankes said Twitter "does one of the worst jobs of content moderation", calling it an "absolute cesspool" of hate.Joan Donovan, director of the Technology and Social Change Research Project at Harvard University's Shorenstein Center, said "posting to 8chan is a tactic" for attackers to gain attention.The manifesto of the El Paso suspect contains instructions and a weapons kit and a call for continued violence, said Donovan. "It is meant to inspire other white supremacists," she said.

                    UK school racism rises since EU referendum
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Claims that some staff failed to act are called horrific by teaching union leaderStudents with an Eastern European background have been subjected to increase racist bullying at English and Scottish schools since the United Kingdom's 2016 referendum on whether the nation should remain a member of the European Union.The worrying trend has been highlighted in a new report led by a researcher from the University of Strathclyde.The study found 77 percent of students surveyed said they had been victims of racism, xenophobia, or bullying; and that 49 percent said they believed the attacks had become more frequent since the 2016 referendum.Daniela Sime, the report's author, said the racism was not only perpetrated by other students but, in some cases, by teachers as well."The role of teachers, who were often said to be bystanders and did not intervene, or, in some situations, became perpetrators themselves, emerged as a profoundly important dimension of young people's everyday experiences of marginalization," she told the Guardian newspaper. "Teachers were, on occasions, not only discriminatory in their practices, by ignoring young people's presence in class, but also racist in the views openly expressed during lessons or through ignoring incidents of racism they overheard."Sime, who is a reader in education and social policy at Strathclyde, presented her findings at the European Sociological Association conference in Manchester on Thursday.She said many of the bullying incidents went unreported to the school authorities because students felt that"teachers knew and did not act to counter the culture of racism and xenophobia".Sime's team, which included researchers from the universities of Strathclyde, Plymouth, and Durham, surveyed 1,100 students aged from 12 to 18 between October 2016 and May 2018. Most of the students were from Poland but there were also significant populations from Romania and Lithuania. All had lived in the UK for at least three years.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told the newspaper teachers were committed to protecting students from racism."The incidents reported in this survey are horrifying and unacceptable, and any teacher who failed to intervene to stop racist abuse, let alone colluded in it, would be guilty of serious professional misconduct," he said.Earlier this month, the Independent newspaper conducted a survey that found hate crimes in schools and colleges in the English region of West Midlands had surged by more than 50 percent in the past year.Despite the students' negative experiences, 74 percent of those surveyed said they were at least fairly satisfied with their lives in the UK. Only 12 percent said they hoped to leave.In the 2016 referendum, voters chose by 51.9 percent to 48.1 percent to leave the bloc, following a campaign that focused on such issues as immigration into the UK from other EU nations and that stirred up sentiments among some voters that pundits described as racist and xenophobic.
