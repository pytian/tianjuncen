                Convenience stores team up with Chinese brands for PRC's 70th anniversary
            </a>
            <p>
                Jianlibao drinks packaged in panda paintings and White Rabbit milk on convenience store shelves are part of a new campaign involving more than 40,000 convenience stores to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.Stores such as Good Neighbors CVS have updated their shelves with banners featuring Chinese elements and characteristics to create a celebratory atmosphere with shoppers.The move is considered a joint effort between local brands and the retail sector to bring local brands closer to young consumers in China.Pei Liang, head of the China Chain-Store and Franchised Association, said in the past three years, the number and revenue of convenience stores have seen double-digit growth, ahead of general growth in the retail industry."In less than ten years, the market scale of the convenience store sector will exceed 2 trillion yuan, a significant channel for the Chinese retail industry," said Pei."The move to align with Chinese local brands with a massive network of convenience stores is to boost the development of local brands and reach more young consumers in the country," said Pesi.Jianlibao Group Co, which has embraced traditional Chinese packaging, has enjoyed major sales success, said Wang Yi, general manager of Jianlibao's marketing department, a brand that has grown into a leading domestic beverage giant thanks to the reform and opening-up policy."It is a new way to work with a convenience store network – how to revitalize our brand is our priority," Wang said.

                Beijing museum exhibition celebrates science
            </a>
            <p>
                At the China Science and Technology Museum in Beijing on Thursday, children and parents made long lines waiting to experience driving a high-speed train or steering a jet fighter into the sky from China's first domestically-built aircraft carrier, the Type 001A, through virtual reality.These experiences were part of an interactive exhibition dedicated to popularizing science to members of the public and has gripped the curiosity of thousands of people every day since its debut last Saturday.From the world's largest crane vessel－Zhenhua-30－to the Queqiao relay satellite, from a manned submersible to medical robots, the exhibition handpicked some major scientific and technological achievements in the aerospace, ocean, nuclear energy, manufacturing, information and health industries since the founding of the People's Republic of China 70 years ago.The showing was one of 24,000 activities held across the country from Sept 14 to 20 to mark National Science Day, an initiative that has aimed to improve public scientific literacy since 2004. A record high 320 million people were estimated to have participated, and this year's events are occurring under the theme of the 70th anniversary of the PRC's founding.At the museum, a 4-year-old boy surnamed Liu was waiting anxiously for a turn in the simulated high-speed train control cabin. The experience was open in different time shifts, and the next open time was still 20 minutes away. But Liu refused to move to see other parts of the exhibition first, because he wanted to be the first when the time arrived."I love driving. I've seen it on TV," he said, adding that he had taken a high-speed train before and really wanted to know what it felt like to maneuver one.His mother, surnamed Zhao, said if she hadn't taken her son to this exhibition, she wouldn't have known her boy had such a passion for driving trains."It's also good for us to know our children's interests," she added.China has seen a rise in public scientific literacy in recent years, as well as in the budget to bring more science to the people. Chen Xi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China's Central Committee, stressed during a visit to the museum on Tuesday the necessity to push public scientific literacy to a higher level.He said President Xi Jinping has said that science popularization and science innovation are equally important, and it is vital to mobilize more science workers and coordinate other society sectors to promote scientific knowledge, thoughts, methods and spirits.Zhang Lei, an astronomy communicator, was attracted by the model showing how the Queqiao relay satellite bridges communication between the Earth and the dark side of the moon. He said he loved the interactions and dynamic presentations of the exhibition and hoped to find some inspiration for his own work."People now have a growing thirst for science and are willing to learn more," he said. "I believe it is an inseparable part of the scientific research. Only when we do well in popularizing science can we foster a better generation to push our research capacity to grow stronger and stronger."

                Equality, Development and Sharing: Progress of Women's Cause in 70 Years Since New China's Founding
            </a>
            <p>
                Editor's Note: The State Council Information Office of the People's Republic of China published a white paper titled Equality, Development and Sharing: Progress of Women's Cause in 70 Years Since New China's Founding. Following is the full text:ContentsPrefaceI. Women's Cause Remains High Priority and Is Actively Promoted in ChinaII. The Legal System for Protection of Women's Rights Constantly ImprovedIII. Women's Role in Economic and Social Development Becoming Increasingly ProminentIV. Women's Political Status Has Grown SignificantlyV. Women's Education Level Has Risen SignificantlyVI. Women's Health Condition Has Improved DramaticallyVII. Social Security for Women Continues to ImproveVIII. Women Play Unique Role in Cultivation of Family VirtuesIX. Women Taking Part in Extensive International Exchanges and Cooperation ActivitiesConclusionPrefaceIn the entire course of history, the liberation and progress of women have been indispensable to the liberation and progress of mankind. Since its inception, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has been struggling for women's liberation and gender equality. The founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 ushered in a new era for women in China, changing their social status from an oppressed and enslaved group in the past thousands of years to masters of their own fate.In recent 70 years, women's cause in China has been closely connected to the general growth of the CPC and the whole nation. Under the leadership of the CPC, the past few generations of women have contributed greatly to social construction, reform, and development. As the Chinese nation is rising and growing richer and stronger, Chinese women's social status has undergone enormous changes.Since the 18th CPC National Congress, guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, there has been a firmer belief in the future of women development based on Chinese socialism among Chinese women. In this background, women are able to exercise their democratic rights, participate in economic and social development, and benefit from the outcomes of reforms and development on an equal and legal basis. As masters of the nation, women now can find the best ways to fulfill themselves while gaining increasing senses of achievement, happiness, and safety, as witnessed by the historic accomplishments they have made so far.This white paper is issued specifically to the achievements of women's cause in the past 70 years since New China was founded fully known to the whole world.I. Women's Cause Remains High Priority and Is Actively Promoted in ChinaBoosting the comprehensive development of women and achieving gender equality have been perceived as important components of the socialism system with Chinese characteristics. China has always attached great importance to such development and equality. Among the concrete measures taken so far to accomplish these goals are reinforced CPC guidance for women's work, creation and improvement of women's rights protection legislations by the National People's Congress, establishment of practical mechanisms in favor of women's cause by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), setup and improvement of government working systems for implementation of national gender equality policies, and enhancement of the role of the Women's Federation as a bridge between the CPC, the government and the mass of women. Together these measures provide solid political and systematic assurance for the development of women's cause.The CPC has made earnest and persistent efforts in leading and improving the work concerning women in the past 70 years. With women's cause as an important part of its undertaking, the CPC has been striving toward women's liberation and gender equality. In the 12 sessions of the National Women's Congress concluded thus far, guidelines for women movement and work as well as main pertinent tasks were worked out in line with general CPC and government policies for nationwide implementation of relevant plans. With the coming of the new era, the CPC is now leading women's work more devotedly. "Adhering to the fundamental national policy of gender equality, and protecting the legitimate rights and interests of women and minors" were enshrined in the reports of the 18th and 19th CPC National Congress, and accepted as key concepts and parts of the CPC's governance and administration plans. The first conference on improving mass organizations organized by the CPC Central Committee in 2015 determined a direction for the work concerning women in the new era by showing how to promote reforms of the Women's Federation and how to make the organization and work of Women's Federation more politically responsive, up to date, and geared to the demands of the masses. For the CPC, women's cause always plays a significant role in Chinese reform, opening-up, and modernization. Full consideration has been given to actual gender differences and special interests of women in legislation, policy-making, planning, and policy implementation. There are also ongoing efforts in improving a legal system for protecting women's rights and building a firm legal foundation for gender equality and comprehensive development of women. Women development has been incorporated into general national economic and social development plans to facilitate high-level and long-term planning. Such incorporation makes the Chinese women's cause more reflective of modern trends.Enactment and revision of laws by the National People's Congress (NPC) for the protection of women's rights: The NPC is established as a fundamental political system that combines the leadership of the CPC, the running of the country by the people, and rule of law. When faithfully performing their legislation and supervision duties, the NPC and its Standing Committee put great stress on protection of women's rights and promotion of women development. A number of relevant organizations have been set up for these purposes successively, including Women & Children Working Group, Office of Communist Youth League, Trade Union, and Women's Federation under Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee, and Office of Communist Youth League, Trade Union, and Women's Federation under Social Development Affairs Committee. These organizations are established to vigorously promote and implement the gender equality principle stipulated in the Constitution, follow and collect opinions of the Women's Federation and women during legislative review and legal supervision, inspect the enforcement of laws protecting women's rights and other pertinent laws, hear related reports, organize thematic investigations, and take practical measures to protect legal rights of women.Creation and improvement of a working mechanism by the CPPCC for promoting women's cause: The CPPCC plays an important role in the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultations led by the CPC. The National Committee of CPPCC has successively established a number of women work organizations, including Women Working Group, Women and Youth Committee, Women, Youth, and Legal Affairs Committee, and Social and Legal Affairs Committee. These organizations make recommendations on key and difficult issues related to women development, and handle proposals regarding women's rights. Women's Federation is one of the 34 circles defined by the National Committee of the CPPCC. In China, a great number of women participate in political consultation, democratic supervision, and participation in the deliberation and administration of State affairs through consultation workshops, thematic investigations, and proposal submissions, thus promoting women development and gender equality on a continuous basis.

                White paper traces PRC's progress on human rights
            </a>
            <p>
                China on Sunday published a white paper on its progress in the field of human rights over the past 70 years. The white paper, titled "Seeking Happiness for People: 70 Years of Progress on Human Rights in China", was released by the State Council Information Office. "Living a happy life is the primary human right," the document said, adding that China regards the rights to subsistence and development as the primary and basic human rights and has been improving the rights of its people in a coordinated manner since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, especially after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012. Seventy years ago, under the leadership of the CPC, the people of China were emancipated and became masters of their country. Over the past seven decades, the Chinese nation has stood up and grown prosperous and is becoming strong; all basic rights of the people are better respected and protected; and China has made regular contribution to the international cause of human rights, the white paper said. China has opened a new path of human rights protection based on its national conditions, and increased the diversity of human civilizations, it said. In the future, the Chinese people will certainly enjoy to the full more extensive rights and realize well-rounded development at higher levels, it said. The white paper noted that, in the new era, China will continue to uphold cultural diversity, communicate with and learn from other civilizations and work with the international community for common development and prosperity, for progress in human rights worldwide, and for building a community with a shared future for humanity.
