In recent decades, Africa has witnessed far-reaching changes, and has seen one of the fastest rates of economic development globally, meaning there are now different requirements for aid from China, Wang added

It is a direct way to promote China's poverty reduction experience

But no other country - including China - is about to replace the US in terms of overall power resources in the next few decades

                            Land-sea trade corridor greatly reduces travel time of seaward exports from western and central China, officials with the province say The Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region has developed into a crucial hub of the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor as a result of blossoming cooperation with China's inland regions and neighboring countries. With Chongqing municipality serving as one of its transportation hubs, the corridor uses ports in Guangxi's Beibu Gulf coasts to provide access to Singapore and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations members by sea, and links with China-Europe freight trains coming from many western Chinese cities before heading to Central Asia, South Asia and Europe. The land-sea corridor can greatly shorten the travel distance of seaward exports from China's western and even central region, according to Guangxi's officials

China's central bank has been letting market forces play a larger role in determining the yuan's exchange rate, and on Monday, when the yuan faced growing devaluation pressure under the latest US threat to impose 10 percent punitive tariff on $300 billion Chinese goods starting Sept 1, it went beyond 7 to the US dollar.

Thus, China's position to what is happening in Hong Kong is deeply steeped in historical context and China's role in promoting sovereignty of nations, free of foreign interference.China's recent history and policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries make foreign meddling in Hong Kong affairs extremely unpalatable The protests in Hong Kong, now in their third month, must be an encouraging index of sovereign ambitions to China's detractors and competitors

                            Ladies and Gentlemen,Dear Friends,Faced with the profound changes in the global economy, should we, the Asia-Pacific economies, lead reform and innovation, or just hesitate and proceed haltingly? Should we steer economic globalization, or dither and stall in the face of challenge? Should we jointly advance regional cooperation, or go our separate ways?This is my answer: We must advance with the trend of times, live up to our responsibility and work together to deliver a bright future of development and prosperity for the Asia-Pacific.As China works hard to pursue innovation and higher quality of growth, new forms of business will keep emerging, more innovations will be used, and development of various regions in China will become more balanced.Fourth, we should continue to make economic development more inclusive and deliver its benefits to our people

                             That is part of what Stephen Perry, chairman of the 48 Group Club, described as "incredible testimony "to the ability of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people to realize these goals, to realize the transformation of China "from one of the most backward countries to one of the most advanced countries in the world in just 70 years". Ninety-eight percent of Fortune 500 companies have investments in China while 129 Chinese companies have made it to the 2019 Fortune 500 list, marking the biggest country group for the first time, bringing in participants such as Sherard Cowper-Coles, the chair-elect of China-Britain Business Council, which reaffirms that Sino-UK trade ties are on the right track. "It (China-UK) is an indispensable economic relationship, indispensable for the UK because of our need to engage with an economy of the size and sophistication of China's, indispensable for China because China's best friend in the West is the United Kingdom," said Cowper-Coles, who emphasized that huge synergy lies in the Sino-UK partnership on the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative

                            That the United Nations ambassadors of 37 countries, mostly developing ones, released a letter on Friday defending China's policy in its Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region is in striking contrast with the text signed by envoys from some developed countries denouncing China's actions in Xinjiang. The envoys from developed countries, on the other hand, are not taking a long-term perspective of what China has done or is doing in Xinjiang and considering the region's future development. Countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Algeria, Myanmar, the Philippines and others know what the most urgent concern is when it comes to the question of Xinjiang

                             It is an important decision made by China to pursue a new round of high-level opening-up, and is China's major initiative to still widen market access to the rest of the world. After going through 5,000 years of trials and tribulations, China is still here! Looking ahead, China will always be here to stay!I am convinced that as long as we have strategic confidence, deepen reform and opening-up across the board, intensify supply-side structural reforms and make greater efforts to solve outstanding problems, then the Chinese economy will surely make a quicker transition to high-quality development, the Chinese people will surely overcome all challenges coming our way, and China will surely embrace a brighter future of development. China will not stop its effort to pursue higher-quality opening-up! China will not stop its effort to pursue an open world economy! And China will not stop its effort to pursue a community with a shared future for mankind!China will unswervingly follow a win-win strategy of opening-up, adopt high-quality policies to advance trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and move toward nationwide opening-up that coordinates the coastal and inland areas and connects the eastern and western regions

                             The aim of supportive policies in China is to prevent a slowdown in growth, rather than boosting growth to a strong level, according to the latest research from Goldman Sachs, which added that policymakers are "highly flexible" in reacting to global conditions. Choosing policies that support growth has become the priority for global leaders, and Chinese policymakers are expected to follow suit in their own way, providing assurances that the economy is on firm footing while striking a macroeconomic balance for long-term stability, analysts said." Stephen Schwartz, senior director of sovereign ratings at Fitch (Hong Kong), said, "In the face of the external headwinds, we believe the Chinese authorities will stop short of the type of credit-led stimulus policies that could exacerbate medium-term financial and economic imbalances

Such concerns may be somewhat reasonable, but considering the declining trend of major economies across the world, in large part due to rising trade protectionism, and the still-strong growth momentum of the Chinese economy, there is no reason to view China's economic prospects with pessimism.Also, some new and emerging sectors are making greater contributions to China's longer-term high-quality growth

To understand the China policy of the current US administration, one needs to keep in mind its two major - and wrong - assumptions. The position on free trade expressed by the UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the fact that the journalists covering the G7 were focusing on Beijing, the time spent on China at the final news conference given by the US and the French presidents, are evidence of China's importance in world affairs

Although the investigation by the State Post Bureau has reportedly discovered violations of the regulations by FedEx, before the police in Jin'an conclude their investigation, it would be too early to jump to conclusions in this instance.But what has made headlines is the parcel was sent from the United States via FedEx, a US express delivery company that has been under investigation by the State Post Bureau since June on suspicion it illegally held back and misdirected to its US headquarters packages of the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei that Washington is intent on attacking

And while I'm glad that USDA (US Department of Agriculture) will offer aid to agricultural producers, the government needs to step up for others who have been harmed - especially fishermen," Pingree said in a statement

Otherwise, it would have not given such a feeble excuse when it was discovered to have delivered the three Huawei packages to the US, not their intended destination, which for one of the top-notch companies in the industry handling 15 million packages a day is a rather telling slip

                             Such astonishing violent and illegal acts seriously trample upon the rule of law in Hong Kong, gravely undermine public order and security, and openly challenge the red line of "One Country, Two Systems". So why do some Americans once and again connive at the extreme violent and anti-law acts by radicals in Hong Kong to storm and vandalize LegCo, assault the police and bite off an officer's finger, storm Central Government institutions and deface the national emblem?The spokesperson emphasized that the Central Government firmly supports Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the SAR Government in law-based governance, and the Hong Kong police in fulfilling their duties to protect public order and security in accordance with law. So what right do American politicians have to criticize human rights, freedoms and the rule of law of Hong Kong? They have never spoken out against the absence of human rights and freedoms in the city during the colonial period, nor showed concern about the status and situation of Hong Kong people back then

                             In fact, there is a good reason that they should welcome such a move: recent research by my team at the University of Northampton indicated that the latest stages of globalization of innovation actually involved Chinese companies investing in developed countries for R&D and, perhaps counter-intuitively, they have things to teach their partners in the West, therefore also helping the latter to further upgrade their capabilities.Moving up the value chainWhile Western observers should keep pressing and helping China to further improve IP protection, they must also recognize and appreciate the legitimate concerns of China, and developing countries in general, in upgrading themselves in global value chains. There are many intertwined issues between China and the US (and the West in general) but the core issue is how the world (including China itself) should comprehend and cope with the rise of China and its technological giants

                             Washington's calls for reforming an economic system that has worked very well for China over the past 40 years seem absurd," O'Connell said.Christopher Bovis, professor of international business law at the University of Hull in the United Kingdom, noticed that as the US administration has maintained a US-centric trade policy with protectionist and nationalistic features, it has departed from the principle of free trade and embarked upon a series of trade wars with its major partners across the world, including China.As China published a white paper on Sunday denouncing US unilateral and protectionist measures, foreign business and trade experts said that protectionism must be avoided as it is shortsighted and will have an adverse effect on the global economy in the long run

Washington is caustic about the so-called lack of transparency of China's military spending, worried about China's development of new military equipment, uncertain about China's military strategic intention, and believes China is carrying out an "anti-access/area-denial" strategy, which poses a challenge to the US' military supremacy. The lack of military mutual trust might lead the two countries to fall into the historical trap of conflict between a rising power and an established power
