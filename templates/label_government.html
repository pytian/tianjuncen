                             But with the motive of impeding China's development in any way it can, the US government has used its Exchange Rate and International Economic Policy Coordination Act of 1988, which is deemed subjective and without quantitative standards, to nonetheless define China as a currency manipulator to pave the way for future anti-China moves. A variety of economists and experts, among them some from the US, have criticized the US government of failing to respect the facts by taking the yuan's fluctuation in a very short period of time to define China as a currency manipulator regardless of the most recent criteria for currency manipulation set out in its 2015 act.The International Monetary Fund said in a report on Friday that the yuan's exchange rate was "broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals" and China's central bank has made few foreign exchange interventions in recent years, clarifying that China is not as the United States has claimed a currency manipulator

The second includes a crew member saying, "Look at that thing!" The third shows an object that appears over the water, and a sailor using salty language asks, "What is that, man?"The first video was posted online by a crew member in 2007, but the Navy didn't discover it until 2009 and took no disciplinary action.The Black Vault, a website dedicated to "exposing government secrets one page at a time", first reported the Navy's "unidentified aerial phenomena" designation

Thus, China's position to what is happening in Hong Kong is deeply steeped in historical context and China's role in promoting sovereignty of nations, free of foreign interference.China's recent history and policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries make foreign meddling in Hong Kong affairs extremely unpalatable The protests in Hong Kong, now in their third month, must be an encouraging index of sovereign ambitions to China's detractors and competitors

"Unbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday," Trump tweeted.

In other words, how does Washington justify its double standards when it comes to street violence in the US and Hong Kong?The UK government has always been poking its nose into Hong Kong affairs.On June 19, the Speaker of US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, a longtime critic of China's human rights record, called the mass demonstrations in Hong Kong "a beautiful sight to behold", despite the fact that the "beautiful sight" soon turned into a freak show of extreme actions that rocked the global financial hub for the following two months

Plus, the failure of May's initial Brexit plan meant the deal with the EU would face strong resistance from British members of parliament. Ironically, it also means Britain which decided to leave the EU has to take part in the European Parliament elections on May 23

The paper also stated that at the turn of the 20th century, as "Pan-Turkism" and "Pan-Islamism" made inroads into Xinjiang, separatists in and outside China politicized the geographical concept and manipulated its meaning, inciting all ethnic groups speaking Turkic languages and using Islam to create the theocratic state of "East Turkistan"

The expansion of cities will increase continuously in the next 30 years and [oblige] the governments in this region to launch good management techniques to protect their countries from disasters," he said. It suggested that policy-makers make three preparations to deal with disasters: optimise the effectiveness of the Bt350-billion water-management budget; ensure cooperation among agencies assigned to analyse and study legal aspects of disaster issues; and develop city plans that minimise disaster risks from urban expansion, said World Bank official Abhas Jha

Since Africa is yet to climb the value chain of mineral processing and manufacturing, the assistance in building up local capacity could have a much greater impact on developing skills in African economies if it were closely aligned with African economic potential and priority sectors, such as manufacturing

It means South Korea will no longer enjoy minimum trade restrictions on sensitive goods including electronic components, and Japanese companies must receive case-by-case approval from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan before such goods can be exported
