                Casualties of car bomb soar to 20 deaths, 93 wounded in S. Afghanistan
            </p>

                 QALAT - The death toll of a car bomb on Thursday that rocked Qalat city, the capital of southern Afghanistan's Zabul province, has risen to 20, with over 93 others wounded, provincial government spokesman Gul Islam Sayal said."Twenty people lost their lives and 93 others wounded in the car bomb that hit a hospital in Qalat city today morning," Sayal told Xinhua.Earlier, Interior Ministry spokesman put the number of casualties at 15 dead and 66 injured.Sayal said the target of the militants was the civilian hospital and all the victims including women and children are civilian people.Taliban outfit has claimed responsibility for the blast and in contact with media claimed that a suicide bomber targeted the provincial office of National Directorate of Security or the country's counter-intelligence agency, inflicting huge casualties.Sayal rejected the Taliban claim, saying all the victims killed in Qalat's attack Thursday morning are the innocent civilians.The armed group which has stepped up activities mostly in the shape of suicide bombing has also claimed responsibility for the deadly bombings that claimed scores of lives in Kabul, Charikar and Jalalabad cities over the past week.

                White House says bin Laden son killed in US operation
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - The White House says Hamza bin Laden, the son of the late al-Qaida leader who had become an increasingly prominent figure in the terrorist organization, has been killed in a US counterterrorism operation in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.A White House statement gives no further details, such as when Hamza bin Laden was killed or how the United States confirmed his death.The statement says Hamza bin Laden's death "not only deprives al-Qaida of important leadership skills and the symbolic connection to his father, but undermines important operational activities of the group."As leader of al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden and others plotted the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. US Navy SEALs killed him in a raid on a house in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in 2011.

                Assange to remain in prison after sentence expires
            </a>
            <p>
                A British judge has ruled that WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange must remain in prison after the sentence he is currently serving expires and before he is due to face an extradition hearing to the United States, because of the likelihood of him trying to evade extradition.Assange took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2012 to try and avoid being sent to Sweden to face sexual offence allegations, and spent seven years there before being ejected in April this year.The 48-year-old was subsequently jailed for 50 weeks over the incident, and was due to be released from London's Belmarsh Prison on Sept 22, but at a court hearing, the judge said there was "substantial ground" to believe he might "abscond again"."I have given your lawyer an opportunity to make an application for bail on your behalf and she has declined to do so," said district judge Vanessa Baraitser."Perhaps not surprisingly in light of your history of absconding in these proceedings. In my view I have substantial ground for believing if I release you, you will abscond again."Assange, who appeared at the hearing via a video link, said he did not understand the ruling but "was sure the lawyers would explain it."He currently faces extradition to the US on computer hacking charges after then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid signed an order in June.The charge contains 18 counts, with some relating to the US Espionage Act. Assange is accused of soliciting and publishing classified information, much of it to do with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and conspiring to hack a government computer.A statement from the US justice department said WikiLeaks' publication of the material was "one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States", adding that "Assange's actions risked serious harm to United States national security to the benefit of our adversaries". If convicted, he faces a maximum of 175 years in prison.When the charges were announced, WikiLeaks Editor-in-Chief Kristinn Hrafnsson attacked the decision. "With the indictment, the 'leader of the free world' dismisses the First Amendment — hailed as a model of press freedom around the world — and launches a blatant extraterritorial assault outside its border, attacking basic principles of democracy in Europe and the rest of the world," he said.At the time of its issue, Javid said "It is a decision ultimately for the courts, but there is a very important part of it for the home secretary and I want to see justice done at all times and we've got a legitimate extradition request, so I've signed it, but the final decision is now with the courts."A preliminary hearing about the extradition case is scheduled for Oct 11, with a final verdict likely in February.
