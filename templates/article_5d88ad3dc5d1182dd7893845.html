                US judge blasts drug lord El Chapo's 'overwhelming evil,' imposes life sentence
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                NEW YORK - Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, the Mexican drug lord who twice escaped maximum-security prisons in that country, will spend the rest of his life in a US penitentiary, a federal judge said on Wednesday after accusing him of "overwhelming evil."Guzman, 62, berated the US justice system, and a former associate described how he had paid a gang $1 million to try to kill her before US District Judge Brian Cogan imposed the mandatory sentence of life plus 30 years.Cogan also ordered Guzman to forfeit $12.6 billion in a hearing in federal court in Brooklyn.The judge said that even if the law had allowed him any leeway, he would have imposed the harshest sentence available, adding that any redeeming qualities Guzman might have were erased by his "overwhelming evil" actions.A jury in February convicted Guzman of trafficking tons of cocaine, heroin and marijuana and engaging in multiple murder conspiracies as a top leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, long known as one of Mexico's largest, most violent drug trafficking organizations.Guzman, whose nickname means "Shorty," developed a reputation as a Robin Hood-like figure that made him a folk hero to many in his home state of Sinaloa, where he was born in a poor mountain village.He has been held in solitary confinement in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a fortress-like jail in lower Manhattan. Cogan last month rejected Guzman's request for more time to exercise on the jail's roof, after prosecutors said that would risk an escape.Guzman, who recently grew a mustache, complained about the terms of his confinement before his sentence was handed down."It has been psychological, emotional, mental torture 24 hours a day," said Guzman. He alleged that the jurors on his case allowed media accounts of the trial to influence their thinking - an argument his lawyers have also made."Since the government of the United States is going to send me to a prison where my name will not ever be heard again, I take advantage of this opportunity to say there was no justice here," he told the court.Reuters

[Photo/Agencies]Just after 5 pm, American agents turned over Palma Salazar, who was released from prison in California on June 10, after completing 85 percent of a 16-year sentence for smuggling 50 kilos of cocaine from Mexico to the US.Since then, he had been in custody of immigration officials, prior to his extradition.An Mexican official told Xinhua that the drug lord and accomplice of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzmon in the Sinaloa Cartel would be flown to Mexico in the evening.Until now, Mexico's prosecutor-general has not ruled on whether Palma Salazar would face new charges in Mexico or would be set free.

                Recaptured drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman is escorted by soldiers at the hangar belonging to the office of the Attorney General in Mexico City, Mexico January 8, 2016. [Photo/Agencies]Mexico's Foreign Relations Department announced Guzman was handed over to US authorities for transportation to the US on Thursday, the last full day of President Barack Obama's administration and a day before Donald Trump is to be inaugurated.The US Justice Department issued a statement confirming that Guzman was en route to the United States and expressed gratitude to Mexico for its cooperation.A senior US official said the US Drug Enforcement Administration took custody of Guzman in Ciudad Juarez, which is across the border from El Paso, Texas, and a plane carrying him departed for New York at 5:31 p.m. EST. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and agreed to give the information only if not quoted by name.The convicted boss of the Sinaloa cartel, one of the world's largest drug trafficking organizations, had been held most recently at a prison near Ciudad Juarez. He was recaptured a year ago after escaping from a second maximum-security prison through a tunnel dug to his cell.The 2015 escape was highly embarrassing for the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto, and Mexican officials were seen as eager to hand the headache off to the United States afterward. Guzman's lawyers have fought extradition since his recapture."It was illegal. They didn't even notify us," said lawyer Andres Granados, who accused the government of extraditing his client to distract from nationwide gasoline protests. "They handled it politically to obscure the situation of the gas price hike. It's totally political."Guzman, who is in his late 50s, faces the possibility of life in a US prison under multiple indictments in six jurisdictions around the United States, including New York, San Diego, Chicago and Miami.A federal indictment in the Eastern District of New York, where Guzman is expected to be prosecuted, accuses him of overseeing a trafficking cartel with thousands of members and billions of dollars in profits laundered back to Mexico. It says Guzman and other members of the Sinaloa cartel employed hit men who carried out murders, kidnappings and acts of torture.He was indicted by a US federal grand jury in July 2009. A superseding indictment was issued in May charging him and Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada with a variety of drug, gun and money laundering charges as part of an ongoing criminal enterprise.The Mexican Foreign Relations Department's statement said a court had ruled against Guzman's appeal and found that his extradition would be constitutional.

[Photo/Agencies]A judge initially ruled that Guzman would appear in court by video on Friday rather than have marshals escort him to and from a high-security Manhattan jail cell. The order was changed after his lawyers asked the judge to reconsider.Guzman is charged with running a massive drug trafficking operation that laundered billions of dollars and oversaw murders and kidnappings.Guzman has repeatedly been imprisoned and escaped in Mexico. US authorities have pursued him for years.To get Mexico to hand him over to the US, prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty. They're demanding he forfeit $14 billion in assets.Guzman has pleaded not guilty.

[Photo/Agencies]MEXICO CITY - Mexican authorities on Thursday arrested the alleged chief financial officer of the Sinaloa Cartel, which was formerly headed by now-jailed drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, the Attorney General's Office (PGR) said.Victor Manuel Felix Beltran, alias "El Vic," was wanted by the United States, where Guzman is serving a prison sentence, and by Mexico, where he was known to be the financial operator for El Chapo's sons Archivaldo and Jesus Alfredo Guzman Salazar."Early this morning ... agents arrested Victor Manuel on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering," the head of the PGR's specialized organized crime investigative unit (SEIDO), Israel Lira, told reporters at a press conference.Nearly 30 SEIDO agents were involved in the operation to arrest Felix Beltran, 30, at an apartment building in western Mexico City's modern Santa Fe business and residential district.According to Lira, the suspect carried out the cartel's financial transactions and laundered money using false identifications to buy real estate, property, vehicles and businesses.Felix Beltran also served as the cartel's contact with criminal groups in the southern state of Guerrero, and is believed to have smuggled drugs into the United States.A native of Sinaloa, Felix Beltran is the son of former cartel member Manuel Felix Felix, "El 69," captured by Mexican police in March 2011.

                NEW YORK - The trial of accused Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman will begin with lawyers' opening statements in a federal court in Brooklyn on Tuesday, amid intense public attention and extraordinary security measures.Federal prosecutors say that as leader of Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel, Guzman, 61, directed massive shipments of heroin, cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine bound for the United States. He faces 17 criminal counts and a potential life sentence if convicted.As well as smuggling drugs to the United States, the Sinaloa Cartel has played a major role in narco violence between rival gangs that has torn areas of Mexico apart and defied successive governmentsMore than 200,000 people have been killed - many in cartel feuds - since the Mexican government sent troops in to take on the drug gangs in 2006.Guzman's lawyers have signaled that they intend to downplay their client's role in the cartel and argue that the prosecutors' witnesses are motivated by self interest and not believable.Guzman, who twice dramatically escaped from Mexican maximum security prisons, has been kept in solitary confinement in Manhattan and transported to court in Brooklyn in a heavily guarded motorcade.The security around him is so strict that US District Judge Brian Cogan, who is presiding over the case, last week denied a motion by Guzman asking to hug his wife before the trial.The jurors will remain anonymous and be escorted to and from by armed US marshals. Prosecutors have said the security is necessary because of Guzman's history of intimidating and even ordering murders of potential witnesses. Guzman's lawyers have called those claims unfounded.Reuters

                    'El Chapo' drug cartel boss found guilty in US trial
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The world's most infamous cartel boss Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, who rose from poverty in rural Mexico to run a global drug empire and amass billions of dollars, was found guilty in a US court on Tuesday of drug trafficking.Jurors in federal court in Brooklyn found Guzman, 61, guilty on all 10 counts. He faces a possible sentence of life in prison.Guzman, one of the major figures in Mexican drug wars that have roiled the country since 2006, was extradited to the United States for trial in 2017 after he was arrested in Mexico the year before.Though other high-ranking cartel figures had been extradited previously, Guzman was the first to go to trial instead of pleading guilty.The trial, which featured testimony from more than 50 witnesses, offered the public an unprecedented look at the inner workings of the Sinaloa Cartel, named for the state in northwestern Mexico where Guzman was born in a poor mountain village.Guzman’s legend was burnished by two dramatic escapes he made from Mexican prisons and by a "Robin Hood" image he cultivated among Sinaloa's poor.Prosecutors said he trafficked tons of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine into the United States over more than two decades, consolidating his power in Mexico through murders and wars with rival cartels.Small in stature, Guzman's nickname means "Shorty." His smuggling exploits, the violence he used and the sheer size of his illicit business made Guzman the world's most notorious drug baron since Colombia's Pablo Escobar, who was shot dead by police in 1993.Guzman's lawyers say he was set up as a “fall guy” by Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, a powerful drug lord from Sinaloa who remains at large.Mexico has been mired for 12 years in a deadly military-led war against drug gangs. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was elected last year after promising a change, suggesting a negotiated peace and amnesty for non-violent drug dealers, traffickers and farmers.The most detailed evidence against Guzman came from more than a dozen former associates who struck deals to cooperate with US prosecutors.Through them, jurors heard how the Sinaloa Cartel gained power amid the shifting allegiances of the Mexican drug trade in the 1990s, eventually coming to control almost the entire Pacific coast of Mexico.They heard how Guzman made a name for himself in the 1980s as "El Rapido," the speedy one, by building cross-border tunnels that allowed him to move cocaine from Mexico into the United States faster than anyone else.The witnesses, who included some of Guzman's top lieutenants, a communications engineer and a onetime mistress, described how he built a sophisticated organization reminiscent of a multinational corporation, with fleets of planes and boats, detailed accounting ledgers and an encrypted electronic communication system run through secret computer servers in Canada.A former bodyguard testified that he watched Guzman kill three rival drug cartel members, including one victim who he shot and then ordered to be buried even as he was still gasping for air.Estimates of how much money Guzman made from drugs vary. In 2009, Forbes Magazine put him on its list of the world’s richest people, with an estimated $1 billion. It later dropped him from the list, saying it was too difficult to quantify his assets.The US Justice Department said in 2017 it sought forfeiture of more than $14 billion in drug proceeds and illicit profits from Guzman.The trial also featured extensive testimony about corruption in Mexico, most of it involving bribes to law enforcement, military and local government officials so the cartel could carry out its day-to-day drug shipping operations undisturbed.The most shocking allegation came from Guzman's former top aide Alex Cifuentes, who accused former Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto of taking a $100 million bribe from Guzman. A spokesman for the ex-president has denied the claim.In one of the trial's final days, Guzman told the judge he would not testify in his own defense. The same day, he grinned broadly at audience member Alejandro Edda, the Mexican actor who plays Guzman in the Netflix drama "Narcos."Despite his ties to government officials, Guzman often lived on the run. Imprisoned in Mexico in 1993, he escaped in 2001 hidden in a laundry cart and spent the following years moving from one hideout to another in the mountains of Sinaloa, guarded by a private army.He was seized and imprisoned again in 2014, but pulled off his best known escape the following year when he disappeared into a tunnel dug into his cell in a maximum security prison.But the Mexican government says he blew his cover through a series of slip ups, including an attempt to make a movie about his life. He was finally recaptured in January 2016 following a shootout in Sinaloa.REUTERS

            <p class="style-content">
                NEW YORK - Mexico's most notorious drug lord, Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, was convicted on Tuesday of running an industrial-scale smuggling operation after a trial packed with Hollywood-style tales of grisly killings, political payoffs, cocaine hidden in jalapeno cans, jewel-encrusted guns and a naked escape with his mistress through a tunnel. The 61-year-old former boss of the notorious Sinaloa cartel - famed for his brazen escapes from Mexican prisons - faces life in prison for smuggling tons of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana into the United States. He was also found guilty on money laundering and weapons possession charges during a three-month trial in which witnesses described the mob boss beating, shooting and even burying alive those who got in his way. "The verdict was a tremendous victory for the rule of law, for Mexico, the United States and other countries that have been victims of the Sinaloa cartel," said Mike Vigil, former head of international operations for the US Drug Enforcement Administration. "Chapo Guzman was the world's greatest drug lord of all time," Vigil added. The trial unfolded like a real-life telenovela, with Guzman's ex-henchmen and a former mistress taking the stand under the gaze of the stocky gangster, whose nickname is Spanish slang for "shorty". His young wife, onetime beauty queen Emma Coronel, showed up almost every day in court to be with her husband. After sentencing on June 25, Guzman is likely to be transferred to a so-called "supermax" prison in Colorado, sometimes called the "Alcatraz of the Rockies" and considered one of the most secure in the US. Guzman's lawyer Bill Purpura said his client had expected the verdict but was a "guy who never gives up" and had vowed to appeal. In his closing arguments late last month, another of Guzman's lawyers, Jeffrey Lichtman, asked the jury not to convict on the basis of the "garbage" testimony of government witnesses.

                    Pompeo hails Mexico's curb on migrants

                The top US diplomat says the country 'made progress' but still a long way to go MEXICO CITY - US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday thanked his Mexican counterpart for increased immigration enforcement by the country, which Pompeo said is leading to fewer migrants entering the United States. Pompeo later traveled to El Salvador to meet with President Nayib Bukele, with the two sides pledging to work together on the issue of immigration. The top US diplomat's meeting in Mexico confirmed that relations between Washington and Mexico City had calmed considerably since early June, when US President Donald Trump had threatened stiff new trade tariffs against the US' southern neighbor unless it acted forcefully to slow the migrant flow. Pompeo met on Sunday in Mexico City with Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard on a regional trip that began in Argentina and Ecuador. "Secretary Pompeo thanked Foreign Minister Ebrard for Mexico's increased immigration enforcement efforts," the US State Department said. Speaking in El Salvador, Pompeo said that Mexico has "made real progress" on migration. "The numbers are good. ...There are fewer apprehensions taking place today along our southern border, but we've got a long way to go yet - there's still much more work to do," he told a news conference in San Salvador. The US Department of Homeland Security reported a 28 percent drop last month in the number of migrants encountered by Customs and Border Protection at the US-Mexico border compared to May. Some attribute the decrease to increased enforcement in Mexico, combined with the country's deployment of thousands of soldiers and police officers, both near the southern border with Guatemala and the US border in the north, to slow the migrant flows, which come principally from impoverished and crime-ridden Central American countries. The meeting between Ebrard and Pompeo, while focused primarily on migration, also included talks on recovering the wealth of notorious drug trafficker Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman - recently sentenced to life imprisonment in the US - as well as the status of the not-yet-ratified North American trade agreement, the Mexican Foreign Ministry said. That accord, reached under the shadow of Trump's trade threats, stipulated that failure by Mexico to rein in cross-border migration within 45 days could result in the need to negotiate a tougher arrangement. But the Mexican statement said that "in light of these advances", Ebrard "does not consider it necessary to initiate" such negotiations. At the meeting on Sunday, Ebrard said Mexico's strategy to "ensure orderly, safe and regular migrant flows will continue for the next 45 days", the statement said. Pompeo and Ebrard also discussed the fortune amassed by drug kingpin Guzman. The US judge who sentenced him to life in prison last week ordered Guzman to forfeit $12.6 billion, but Mexico wants the money to stay in their country. The two diplomats discussed creating a binational group to study the matter. During his stop in El Salvador, where gang violence is a major factor pushing people to make the trip north to the United States, Pompeo met with Bukele, who has pledged that security measures implemented by his government would do away with the long-running gang problem. "Immigration is a problem that we have, but it's a problem that ends at the southern border of the United States, so we have to solve the immigration problem together," Bukele said at a news conference alongside Pompeo, according to a US State Department transcript.
