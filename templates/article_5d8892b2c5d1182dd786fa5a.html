                Russian bombers intercepted off Alaska: NORAD
            </p>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON -- US and Canadian fighter jets on Thursday intercepted Russian bombers off the coast of Alaska, according to the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).NORAD tweeted that two US F-22 and two Canadian CF-18 fighter aircraft, supported by tanker planes and an early warning and control aircraft, "positively identified and intercepted two Tu-95 Bear bombers in the Alaskan and Canadian ADIZ (air defense identification zone) on Aug 8th.""The Russian aircraft remained in international airspace in the Beaufort Sea and at no time did the aircraft enter United States or Canadian sovereign airspace," NORAD added.NORAD is a United States and Canada bi-national organization charged with the missions of aerospace warning, aerospace control and maritime warning for North America.

                Alaska records its warmest month ever; future records likely
            </a>
            <p>
                ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Alaska has been America's canary in the coal mine for climate warming, and the yellow bird is swooning.July was Alaska's warmest month ever, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Sea ice melted. Bering Sea fish swam in above-normal temperatures. So did children in the coastal town of Nome. Wildfire season started early and stayed late. Thousands of walruses thronged to shore.Unusual weather events like this could become more common with climate warming, said Brian Brettschneider, an associate climate researcher at the University of Alaska Fairbanks' International Arctic Research Center. Alaska has seen "multiple decades-long increases" in temperature, he said."It becomes easier to have these unusual sets of conditions that now lead to records," Brettschneider said.Alaska's average temperature in July was 14.5 C. That's 3 C above average and 0.4 C higher than the previous warmest month of July 2004, NOAA said.The effects were felt from the Arctic Ocean to the world's largest temperate rainforest on Alaska's Panhandle.Anchorage, the state's largest city, on July 4 for the first time hit 32.22 C at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, 5 degrees higher than the city's previous recorded high of 29.44 C.Sea ice off Alaska's north and northwest shore and other Arctic regions retreated to the lowest level ever recorded for July, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado.Arctic sea ice for July set a record low of 7.6 million square kilometers. That was a South Carolina-size loss of 80,000 square kilometers below the previous record low July in 2012.Sea ice is the main habitat for polar bears and a resting platform for female walruses and their young. Several thousand walruses came to shore July 30, the first time they've been spotted in such large numbers before August.Effects were less obvious in the Bering Sea off Alaska's west coast. Lyle Britt, a NOAA Fisheries biologist who oversees the agency's annual Bering Sea groundfish survey, was on a trawler east of the island of Saint Matthew during the first week of July."The temperature out there for us was in the high 70s," Britt said. "On those boats, everything up there is designed to conserve heat, not vent heat. It was unbearably warm inside the boat."On the ocean bottom, Britt's crew for the second consecutive year found scant evidence of a "cold pool," the east-west barrier of extremely cold, salty water that traditionally concentrates Pacific cod and walleye pollock, the species that make fast-food fish sandwiches, in the southeastern Bering Sea.Alaska's wildfire season started in April. July's dry and hot temperatures extended it. An expected rainy season marked by southwest winds pushing up moisture and soaking fires did not show up on time, said Tim Mowry, spokesman for the state Division of Forestry."It extended our fire season through the month of July," Mowry said.Alaska by mid-July can usually free up crews to fight fires in other states, but only about 15 people have left this year. High fire danger around Anchorage, the Kenai Peninsula and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough has kept crews in Alaska."We've pretty much held on to all our resources in-state at this point," Mowry said.A burn ban and water sprinkler restrictions remain in place for Haines, just outside the Tongass National Forest. July extended a drought in the rainforest, said Rick Thoman, another climate expert at the International Arctic Research Center.Cities in the southern half of the rainforest have limited or no hydropower because of low water levels. That means power has to be generated by burning diesel fuel, Thoman said.July was the hottest month measured on Earth since records began in 1880, NOAA reported Thursday. And a United Nations report earlier this month warned that global warming threatens food supplies around the world.But Alaska's recent heat has had silver linings. Barley and other crops are ready to harvest, said Stephen Brown of the University of Alaska Fairbanks Cooperative Extension Service.The growing season has been extended by a month, and if extra days become the norm, they will expand what can be grown in the state. Brown used heat radiated from his blacktop driveway to grow fruit not usually seen outside greenhouses."I've got a bumper crop of tomatoes and jalapenos this summer," he said.On the other hand, the weather has stressed birch trees and left them vulnerable to leaf-eating insects."That gives the leaf miners opportunity to really whack them good," he said. "I'm looking at my lawn right now, and I need to rake leaves."Brettschneider, the climate researcher, sees mostly negative effects from the hot July and climate warming. Alaska looks the way it does because of the temperature regime, he said, and in 50 years, Alaska may look like Idaho."We should expect changes. We should expect the forests to be in different locations. We should expect wildlife to move. We should expect plants to move. And in many cases, if they can't move fast enough, we should expect them to just go away," he said.AP

                Walmart to stop selling ammunition for assault-style rifles
            </a>
            <p>
                Walmart, the US's largest retailer, announced on Tuesday that it will stop selling ammunition for assault-style rifles and handguns, one month after a gunman walked into an El Paso, Texas, Walmart with an AK-style semiautomatic rifle and killed 22 people.Walmart said it will stop selling the ammunition after selling all its current inventory for assault-style rifles and handguns.The move is expected to reduce Walmart's share of the nation's ammunition market to 6 percent, from 20 percent. Walmart said last month that it accounted for about 2 percent of the nation's firearm sales."As a company, we experienced two horrific events in one week, and we will never be the same," Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said in an email to employees Tuesday. "Our remaining assortment will be even more focused on the needs of hunting and sport-shooting enthusiasts."Walmart had stopped selling the type of assault-style rifle that was used in the El Paso shooting several years ago, but McMillon said the retailer recognized the need to do more "to make the country safer."At least four Democratic presidential candidates called on Walmart to stop selling guns after the mass shooting in El Paso."The weapons they sell are killing their own customers and employees," Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts wrote on Twitter. "No profit is worth those lives. Do the right thing — stop selling guns."Walmart ended the sale of handguns in all stores except those in Alaska over two decades ago but on Tuesday said it will now stop in the state as well.Walmart also said it will no longer allow shoppers to carry firearms openly inside any of its 4,700 US stores. Shoppers with concealed-carry permits can continue to carry guns, the company said.McMillon said the company has no plans to discontinue all gun sales, adding that it has a long history of serving hunters and that founder Sam Walton was an avid hunter. Walmart will continue to sell long-barrel deer rifles and shotguns and much of the ammunition for those guns."I'm a gun owner myself," Mr. McMillon said. "In a complex situation lacking a simple solution, we are trying to take constructive steps to reduce the risk that events like these will happen again," he said. "The status quo is unacceptable."The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this story.

                Walmart to end sales of ammunition after attacks
            </a>
            <p>
                Walmart, the world's biggest retailer, announced on Tuesday that it will stop selling ammunition for assault-style rifles and handguns, one month after a gunman walked into an El Paso, Texas, Walmart with an AK-style semiautomatic rifle and killed 22 people.Walmart said it will stop selling the ammunition after its current inventory for assault-style rifles and handguns is depleted. The company also will stop selling handguns in Alaska, the only state where it had continued to sell them after ending the sale of handguns in all stores more than two decades ago.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Walmart's changes were prompted by the El Paso shooting, as well as recent mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and Midland and Odessa, Texas.He said that he also will be sending letters to the White House and congressional leaders, asking for action on "common sense measures". McMillon said that Congress should debate reauthorizing an assault weapons ban and expand background checks."We encourage our nation's leaders to move forward and strengthen background checks and to remove weapons from those who have been determined to pose an imminent danger," he said. "Congress and the administration should act. Given our decades of experience selling firearms, we are also offering to serve as a resource in the national debate on responsible gun sales."In Washington, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday before Walmart's announcement that he won't put a gun bill of any kind on the Senate floor for a vote unless President Donald Trump says he would sign it into law.The Kentucky Republican said on a radio show that he expects to get an answer from the Trump administration within the next week on what, if anything, it's prepared to support."If the president is in favor of a number of things that he has discussed openly and publicly, and I know that if we pass it, it will become law, I'll put it on the floor," he said.McConnell has blocked nearly every piece of legislation passed by the Democratic-led House, including gun measures that have bipartisan support on Capitol Hill.The National Rifle Association, a gun rights advocacy group, responded to Walmart's announced changes by saying "lines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America's fundamental freedoms".Walmart's announcement on Tuesday is expected to reduce its share of the nation's ammunition market to 6 percent, from 20 percent. Walmart said last month that it accounted for about 2 percent of the nation's firearm sales.Several years ago, Walmart stopped selling the type of assault-style rifle that was used in the El Paso shooting, but McMillon said the retailer recognized the need to do more "to make the country safer".Walmart also said it no longer will allow shoppers to carry firearms openly inside any of its 4,700 US stores.

                Gun violence costs $229b per year: report
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON - Gun violence costs the United States $229 billion annually, amounting to 1.4 percent of its gross domestic product, according to a report released Wednesday.The report, which used data from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the Centers for Disease Control for a state-by-state analysis of gun violence costs, was commissioned by congressional Democrats.Lost income represents the biggest cost to the nation's economy, the report said. Other major expenses include employer costs, police and criminal justice responses, and health care treatment.Rural states, including Mississippi and Alabama, have the highest costs of gun violence measured as a share of their economies.States with high rates of gun ownership such as Alaska and Arkansas have the highest rates of gun suicide. Alaska also has the highest overall gun death rate per capita of all 50 states.The report also found that children and teens were also at a much higher risk of firearm-related injuries and deaths in the United States, compared to other advanced countries."The United States stands alone in this degree of gun violence," Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat told a hearing on Wednesday. "The human costs are beyond our ability to comprehend, it is tragic, it is sickening and it is a crisis."The report came as the White House is reportedly circulating a memo on Capitol Hill detailing a possible proposal to expand background checks for gun sales.The memo proposes expanding background checks to all advertised commercial sales, including sales at gun shows.If someone who attempts to buy a firearm fails a background check, it would be reported to law enforcement officials, according to the memo.In this past summer, several mass shootings claimed scores of lives in the United States, bringing back public attention to the nation's gun violence epidemic.The White House and congressional Democrats, however, remain divided over what actions should be taken.There have been 40,331 gun violence-related incidents in the United States this year as of Wednesday, killing a total of 10,681 people, according to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive.
