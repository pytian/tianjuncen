                Protests in Iran and elsewhere mark Quds
            </p>
            <p>
                TEHERAN - Thousands of Iranians rallied on Friday to mark Quds, or Jerusalem Day, which will see demonstrations across the Middle East as the Trump administration tries to offer an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. The annual protests, also being held in Iraq, Lebanon and elsewhere, come on the last Friday of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan. Iran has marked Quds Day since the start of its 1979 Islamic Revolution by late leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Al-Quds is the Arabic name for Jerusalem, and Iran says the day is an occasion to express support for the Palestinians. Israel views Iran as its archenemy in the region. Iran does not recognize Israel and supports the militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. In Teheran, rallies began across the city. They all headed to Teheran University, where the ceremony ended at Friday noontime prayers. Similar rallies took place in 950 cities and towns across the country. This year's protests come as the White House is promoting the June 25-26 meeting in the Gulf state of Bahrain as the first phase of its long-awaited Middle East peace plan. That plan, whose specifics have yet to be released, includes large-scale investment and infrastructure work in the Palestinian territories, much of it funded by wealthy Arab countries. Palestinian leaders say they won't attend the summit. US officials say the Bahrain conference will not include the core political issues of the conflict: Borders of a Palestinian state, the status of Jerusalem, the fate of Palestinian refugees or Israeli security demands. On Wednesday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that the US and its allies will fail to impose the so-called "Deal of the Century" on Palestinians. Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has described the peace plan as "shameful". "If the deal is implemented, it will be an eternal loss for Palestine and a major gain for its occupiers," the Iranian Foreign Ministry said. In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, embroiled in political chaos after failing to assemble a governing coalition, attempted on Thursday to divert public attention with his signature strategy: Political theater. Addressing a nation bewildered by the prospect of an unprecedented second election campaign in the same year, Netanyahu brandished an official US State Department map that had been updated to incorporate the long-disputed Golan Heights as part of Israel. He said that US President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner gifted him the map during his visit to Israel. Kushner and other architects of the US administration's Middle East peace plan are visiting the region to build momentum for the long-awaited proposal. "This map had not been updated since the Six Day War," said Netanyahu, referring to the 1967 Middle East war, after which Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria, and later annexed it in a move not internationally recognized. "Well, it has been updated, it just got an update. ... That is to say, there are very important developments here." The US delegation is on a trip in the region this week, seeking support for the Middle East peace plan that the US plans to roll out soon. The delegation arrived in Israel on Wednesday, after meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah II in Amman. The king reiterated his support to the two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

                DAMASCUS, Syria - Israel launched a second round of strikes against Syria in 24 hours on Sunday, Syria state media reported.Syria accused Israel of targeting an airbase in Homs province, reportedly killing five people, just hours after carrying out retaliatory attacks on military and intelligence posts south of Damascus, killing 10."Our air defenses thwarted an Israeli aggression and destroyed two of the rockets that targeted the T-4 air base," a military source told state news agency SANA on Sunday evening.The remaining rockets "killed one soldier, wounded two others, and damaged an arms warehouse," the source added.Observers reported five killed, including one Syrian soldier, adding that a rocket warehouse was destroyed.Hours earlier, Israel said it had carried out strikes in the province of Quneitra, which includes the Golan Heights, most of which is occupied and annexed by Israel.Israel said the attack was in response to rare rocket fire from its neighbor on late on Saturday.The Syrian government has repeatedly charged that Israel supports the terror groups in Syria and its repeated strikes are nothing but a way to lift the rebels' morale, Xinhua News Agency reported.Two rockets were fired from Syria at Mount Hermon in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and one had been "located within Israeli territory", the Israeli Army said.Meanwhile, Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria, most of them against what it says are Iranian and Hezbollah targets.Israel says it is determined to prevent its arch foe Iran from entrenching itself militarily in Syria, where Teheran backs President Bashar al-Assad in the country's eight-year civil conflict which has killed more than 370,000 people.The Jewish state insists that it has the right to continue to target positions in Syria held by Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah out of self-defense."We won't tolerate fire at our territory and will respond forcefully to any aggression against us," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, after the first strikes.AFP - Xinhua

                Bolton in Jerusalem sends warning to Iran
            </a>
            <p>
                JERUSALEM - US National Security Adviser John Bolton said Sunday in Jerusalem that Iran should not consider US abrupt cancellation of a military attack as "weakness".Speaking ahead of a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Bolton said that "neither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake US prudence and discretion for weakness"."No one has granted them a hunting license in the Middle East," he said in joint remarks alongside Netanyahu.He reiterated US President Donald Trump, saying Iran will "never" be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon and that the US military "is rebuilt, new and ready to go".His remarks came after Trump called off a military strike against Iran after the latter shoot down a US military drone.Netanyahu thanked Bolton and said his visit is "an opportunity to strengthen" even further the close alliance between Israel and the US.He praised Trump's nuclear-related sanctions on Iran. "The supporters of the Iran deal argued that the infusion of massive cash into Iran's economy would moderate Iran... And in fact, the opposite has happened," he said."We in Israel saw Iran's aggression in their increased efforts to establish Iranian military bases in Syria, in their increased efforts to provide sophisticated weapons to Hezbollah, in their increased financial support for terror proxies like Hezbollah, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad," he said.Bolton has arrived in Israel for a four-day visit during which a triple Israeli-Russian-US security meeting will be held. On Monday, Bolton, Israel's National Security Adviser Meir Ben-Shabba, and Russia's Secretary of the Security Council Nikolay Patrushev will meet in Jerusalem and on Tuesday the three will hold a joint meeting with Netanyahu.The meetings focus on the future of these countries' operations in Syria and are held amidst spiraling tensions in the Gulf.Israel considers Iran its arch-enemy.Netanyahu has been a vocal opponent of the nuclear deal signed in 2015 between Iran and the world powers, and welcomed Trump's sanctions on the Islamic republic.

                From Iraq to Yemen, drones raise US alarm over Iranian plans
            </a>
            <p>
                GENEVA/WASHINGTON - The increased use of drones by Iran and its allies for surveillance and attacks across the Middle East is raising alarms in Washington.The United States believes that Iran-linked militia in Iraq have recently increased their surveillance of American troops and bases in the country by using off-the-shelf, commercially available drones, US officials say.The disclosure comes at a time of heightened tensions with Iran and underscores the many ways in which Tehran and the forces it backs are increasingly relying on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in places like Yemen, Syria, the Strait of Hormuz and Iraq.Beyond surveillance, Iranian drones can drop munitions and even carry out "a kamikaze flight where they load it up with explosives and fly it into something", according to a US official who spoke on condition of anonymity.Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthis have significantly increased their UAV attacks in recent months, bombing airports and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, a main rival of Iran.Last month, Iran came close to war with the United States after the Islamic Republic's unprecedented shoot-down of a US drone with a surface-to-air missile, a move that nearly triggered retaliatory strikes by US President Donald Trump.Trump withdrew from a major 2015 nuclear deal last year and reimposed sanctions to cut off Iran's oil exports and pressure the Islamic Republic to negotiate over its ballistic missile program and regional policy.The increased use of drones by Iran or its regional allies is a strategy aimed at pushing back and defending against pressure from the United States and foes like Saudi Arabia and Israel, current and former security officials and analysts say.Iran now flies two or three drones over Gulf waters every day, the first US official estimated, making it a core part of Tehran's effort to monitor the Strait of Hormuz, through which one fifth of the world's oil consumption flows.The United States and Saudi Arabia have accused Iran of carrying out attacks against six oil tankers near the Strait in the past two months, a claim Tehran has denied.The US officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to quantify the extent to which surveillance near US forces has increased in Iraq or to specify which militia were carrying it out."We have seen an uptick in drone activity in Iraq near our bases and facilities," the first official said. "Certainly the drones that we have seen are more of the commercial off-the-shelf variant. So they're obviously a deniable type UAV-activity in Iraq."A second official said the recent increase in surveillance was worrying but acknowledged Iran-linked militia in Iraq had a history of keeping tabs on Americans.Reuters has previously reported that the United States has indirectly sent warnings to Iran, saying any attack against US forces by proxy organizations in Iraq will be viewed by Washington as an attack by Iran itself.In recent weeks, mortars and rockets have been fired at bases in Iraq where US forces are located but no American troops have been injured. US officials did not link those attacks to the increased surveillance.Attempts to reach the Iranian ministry of foreign affairs and the Revolutionary Guards, who are most closely linked to militant groups in Iraq, for comment were unsuccessful.Iraqi militia groups linked to Iran began using drones in 2014 and 2015 in battles to retake territory from Islamic State, according to militia members and Iraqi security officials.These groups received training on the use of drones from members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards and Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah, two Iraqi security officials with knowledge of militia activities said."Key militia groups have the ability to launch aerial attacks using drones. Will they target American interests? That hasn't happened yet," said one Iraqi security official."They used Katyusha and mortars in very restricted attacks against American interests in Iraq to send a message rather than trying to inflict damage. Using explosive-laden drones is very possible once we have a worsening situation between Tehran and Washington."Reuters

                Israel says strikes Iranian sites in Syria to 'foil attack'
            </a>
            <p>
                 JERUSALEM -- Israel's army said on Saturday that its air force has struck Iranian sites in Syria to foil an Iranian drone attack on Israel."Jets recently targeted a number of terror targets in Aqraba, Syria, southeast of Damascus," the Israeli military said in a statement, without elaborating on the specific date.According to the army, the strikes targeted Iranian Quds Force operatives and Shiite militias which were advancing over the past few days with plans to attack Israeli sites from within Syria.The plans included launching several armed drones to strike sites in Israel."The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) is prepared to continue defending the State of Israel against any attempts to harm it and holds Iran and the Syrian regime directly responsible for the thwarted attack," the army warned.Local Israeli media reported that following the strikes, Iron Dome anti-missile systems were deployed in northern Israel, for fear of Iranian or Syrian retaliation.Israel considers Iran its arch-foe and has carried out hundreds of deadly airstrikes in Syria, charging the attacks target Iranian sites and weapons convoys to Hezbollah.

                Netanyahu says Israel might launch another strike in Lebanon
            </a>
            <p>
                JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that his country is ready to launch another attack at Hezbollah in Lebanon after fire exchanges broke out along the Lebanese border.Netanyahu said that he had held consultation with the army's command following an anti-tank missile attack launched by Hezbollah earlier in the afternoon."We are prepared for any scenario and will decide how to continue based on further events," he said, warning Hezbollah not to fire more missiles.Shortly after 16:00 p.m. local time (13:00 GMT), Hezbollah fired anti-tank missiles at an Israeli military position near the community of Avivim in northern Israel's upper Galilee near the Lebanese border.Jonathan Conricus, a spokesman with the Israeli military, told reporters that two or three Hezbollah missiles were fired and hit a battalion headquarters and a military ambulance. Both were damaged.There were no injuries among the Israeli forces.Conricus said that in response, the army attacked the Hezbollah squad that fired the missiles with about 100 artillery shells and attack helicopters."This is a scenario that we have been preparing for since Sunday," he said, referring to warnings issued by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who vowed to retaliate against an Israeli drone attack in Beirut last week."Hezbollah executed the attack. However, it failed to cause casualties," he said, adding that the army still "maintains a high level of alert."Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli army confirmed that it sparked fires near the border. According to Hezbollah's al-Manar media outlet, the fires were caused by incendiary materials dropped by Israeli drones.The recent violence was a sharp escalation between Israel and Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed armed group and movement.Israel and Hezbollah, which fought a bloody war in 2006, were on high alert over the past days in the wake of a series of Israeli airstrikes in Syria and Lebanon.

                Israel, Hezbollah exchange fire

                Arab League voices 'full solidarity' with Lebanon over ongoing escalationKIRYAT SHMONA, Israel - Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement exchanged fire along the Lebanese border after a week of rising tensions, sparking fears of an escalation and prompting concern from world powers.Israel said it had responded with around 100 artillery shells Sunday after Hezbollah fired two or three anti-tank missiles at a battalion headquarters and military ambulance, hitting both.Israeli officials refuted claims by the Hezbollah movement that it had killed and wounded those inside the Israeli military vehicle, saying there were no casualties."We are consulting about the next steps," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. "I have ordered that we be prepared for any scenario."The Arab League voiced on Sunday its concern over the ongoing military escalation, stressing "full solidarity" with Lebanon in confronting any aggressions."Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul-Gheit is following up with concern the developments of fire exchange in the border areas between Lebanon and Israel," Egypt's official MENA news agency quoted an Arab League official as saying.The official said on condition of anonymity that Aboul-Gheit reaffirmed the Cairo-based pan-Arab body's full solidarity with Lebanon "in confronting any assaults it is subjected to".The United Nations called for restraint and France said it had made "multiple contacts" to avert an escalation.The United States voiced concern over the "destabilizing role" of Iranian proxies in the region and said it "supports Israel's right to self-defense", a US State Department official said."Hezbollah should refrain from hostile actions which threaten Lebanon's security, stability and sovereignty," the official added.Earlier, Lebanon's Prime Minister Saad Hariri contacted senior US and French officials to urge their countries and the international community to intervene.Hours after the flare-up, Israeli military spokesman Jonathan Conricus said the "tactical event" near Avivim, an Israeli community near the Lebanese border, was most likely over but that the "strategic situation is still ongoing".Israel had targeted the unit that fired the missiles, he said.Hezbollah said its fighters had "destroyed a military vehicle on the road to the Avivim barracks, killing and wounding those inside".Its Al-Manar TV said the group targeted a Wolf armored vehicle that can fit eight soldiers.After the initial reports of fire from Lebanon, an Israeli military spokesman said Israelis living within four kilometers of the border should remain at home and prepare shelters.Tensions have risen in the last week between Israel and its enemy Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite movement backed by Iran.Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said on Saturday that the militant movement had decided to respond to an alleged Israeli drone attack on the group's Beirut stronghold.Drone attack The predawn Aug 25 attack involved two drones - one exploded and caused damage to a Hezbollah-run media center and another crashed without detonating due to technical failure.Israel has not claimed responsibility for the incident, which came after it had launched strikes in neighboring Syria to prevent what it said was an impending Iranian drone attack on the Jewish state.Hezbollah says two of its members were killed in that strike.Major-General Stefano Del Col, the head of the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, said the "serious incident" violated the UN resolution ending the 2006 conflict.UN chief Antonio Guterres said he was "seriously concerned", according to a spokesman, and called "for maximum restraint".Sunday's escalation comes amid rising tensions pitting Iran against the US and its allies over a series of incidents involving shipping in sensitive Gulf waters.Bahrain, which hosts the US Fifth Fleet, on Sunday urged Bahraini citizens to leave Lebanon immediately.The United Arab Emirate's minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, tweeted that "our hearts are with Lebanon and the Lebanese"."The decision to make war, peace or stability should be the decision of the state," he tweeted, taking a jab at Hezbollah.The flare-up also comes ahead of Israel's Sept 17 elections.Netanyahu is seen as wanting to avoid a major conflict before the vote but he warned that the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah "knows very well that the state of Israel knows how to defend itself well, and to repay its enemies".Agencies

                Iran will lift all limits on nuclear R&D
            </a>
            <p>
                Rouhani calls it the 'most important step' away from 2015 nuclear dealTEHERAN - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday ordered the removal of all limits on nuclear research and development, taking the country's third step in scaling down its commitments to a 2015 deal with world powers.His announcement came shortly after the United States hit the Islamic Republic with further sanctions, the latest in a series of punitive measures including an embargo on Iranian oil exports.Iran and three European countries - the United Kingdom, France and Germany - have been engaged in talks to reduce tensions and save the nuclear deal that has been unraveling since US President Donald Trump withdrew from it in May last year.But late on Wednesday, Rouhani made good on a declared intention to take another step away from the multilateral deal signed with the five permanent member states of the United Nations Security Council and Germany (P5+1)."Iran's third step is of an extraordinarily significant nature. The atomic energy organization (of Iran) is ordered to immediately start whatever is needed in the field of research and development, and abandon all the commitments that were in place regarding research and development," Rouhani said.He referred to "expansions in the field of research and development, centrifuges, different types of new centrifuges, and whatever we need for enrichment".Iran in July abandoned two other nuclear commitments: To keep its stockpile of enriched uranium below 300 kilograms, and maintain a 3.67-percent cap on the purity of its uranium stocks.Rouhani had earlier on Wednesday told a Cabinet meeting:"I don't think that... we will reach a deal".But he had also said that Teheran and the European powers had been getting closer to an agreement on a way to resolve burning issues."If we had 20 issues of disagreement with the Europeans in the past, today there are three issues," he said.French President Emmanuel Macron, last month in France at the G7 meeting, encouraged Trump to offer economic incentives to Teheran and dangled the possibility of a summit between the US and Iranian presidents.Trump made clear on Wednesday that he was still interested in meeting Rouhani when the Iranian leader visits New York for the opening of the annual UN General Assembly this month."Sure, anything is possible," Trump told reporters.But Rouhani has already ruled out a summit without sanctions relief, and on Wednesday the Trump administration issued its third set of sanctions on Iran in less than a week.In the latest salvo, the US Treasury Department put on its blacklist a shipping network of 16 entities, 10 people and 11 vessels that it said was selling oil on behalf of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard's Qods Force.The network sold more than $500 million worth of oil this spring, mostly to Syria, benefiting both the Syrian government and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, the department said.A US official said that the move showed Washington's position on relaxing sanctions - and warned that more would come."We can't make it any more clear that we are committed to this campaign of maximum pressure and we are not looking to grant any exceptions or waivers," Brian Hook, the US State Department coordinator on Iran, told reporters.Iran has said it will resume full compliance with the nuclear deal if it reaches a deal with France on a $15-billion credit line, which Teheran would repay once it resumes oil exports.The US is currently trying to block such shipments with unilateral sanctions.Hook stopped short of criticizing the credit line itself, saying there was no "concrete" proposal.Hawks in the Trump administration adamantly oppose any easing of pressure, saying their goal is not only to contain Iran's nuclear program but to curb Iran's influence across the Middle East.Iran had long threatened to carry out a third set of nuclear countermeasures by Friday unless other parties to the deal offset the effect of US sanctions in return for its continued compliance.Agencies - Xinhua

                Hezbollah group says it downed Israeli drone
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIRUT, Lebanon - The Hezbollah military group said it downed an Israeli drone in southern Lebanon on Monday, a week after the group's leader said it would shoot down Israeli drones in Lebanese airspace.The drone is now in Hezbollah's possession, it said in a statement.An Israeli military statement said one of its drones "fell inside southern Lebanon during routine operations". It did not say why the drone crashed, but said "there is no concern information could be taken from it". An Israeli military spokeswoman said it was a "simple drone" without elaborating.Hezbollah said its fighters had used "appropriate weapons" to bring down the drone on the edge of the southern Lebanese town of Ramyah.A correspondent for Hezbollah's al-Manar television said the drone had not sustained much damage, and had been in Lebanese airspace for around five minutes.A week ago, after a drone attack in a Hezbollah-controlled Beirut suburb, Hezbollah and the Israeli army exchanged cross-border fire that marked their fiercest shelling exchange since the 2006 Lebanon war.Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, as well as Lebanon's government, blamed Israel for the drone attack and had vowed to target Israeli drones entering Lebanon's airspace.Nasrallah said while last week's flare-up with Israel was over, the episode had launched a "new phase" in which the Iran-backed group no longer had red lines it would not cross.In that brief exchange of fire, Hezbollah said it destroyed an Israeli armored vehicle, killing and wounding those inside, and broadcast what it said was footage of two missiles hitting a moving vehicle.Israel said it had faked soldier casualties to dampen any inclination of Hezbollah to escalate hostilities.Nasrallah said the attack marked the first such targeting of positions inside Israel by the Islamist militants in a long time. More commonly, Hezbollah targets the Israeli-occupied Shebaa farms, which are on land which Lebanon claims as its territory.Amid rising tensions in the region, Israel also raised the stakes last week by accusing Hezbollah, with Iranian assistance, of setting up a factory for precision-guided missiles in Lebanon's Bekaa valley.Hezbollah has denied having production sites in Lebanon.Agencies - Xinhua
