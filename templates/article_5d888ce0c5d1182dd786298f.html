                Yuanmingyuan Park authorities plan to begin restoration of 11 cultural relics
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                The administration of the Yuanmingyuan Ruins Park announced on Friday that it plans to start the restoration of 11 cultural relics that were excavated from the remains in recent years.Yuanmingyuan, or the Old Sunmer Palace, was the imperial resort of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). It was burned down by the invading Anglo-French Alliance Forces in 1860.Archaeological excavations in the ruins, however, have unearthed numerous cultural relics in recent years. Restoration of the artifacts began earlier this year.The 11 artifacts include 10 porcelain items and a Buddhist statue, from a period which spans from the reign of Kangxi (1622-1722) to of Qianlong (1736-95).Previously,restoration of six ceramic artifacts was launched in April and has been completed.Some of the items are now on display in the park.According to administration, the restoration of the cultural relics will be a long-term project. There are over 100,000 porcelain pieces that have been found in the ruins.

                    Geely calls for more homegrown R&D
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Zhejiang Geely Holding Group is calling for Chinese automotive brands to step up research and development and regain ground lost to international rivals as China's auto market continues to falter.The vehicles sales in China has been falling since 2018. This year, a total of 16.1 million vehicles were delivered from January to August, a 11 percent fall on the same period in 2018, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.The association expects total sales this year to fall by at least 5 percent from 2018.Chinese brands' market share is shrinking, with combined sales accounting for 38.9 percent of the total from January to August, down from 42.3 percent from the same period last year, according to the association."The only way to solve this problem is for all Chinese brands to work together instead of complaining, because this is the result of fair competition," said Geely Chairman Li Shufu at an industry forum held on Friday in Sichuan province."This share is determined by the market and it's determined by the customers," he said.He called on Chinese brands to sharpen their competitive edge through improving research and investment, adding that research and investment instead of expanding production should constitute the largest part of car companies' operational investment.Geely's investment in research and investment totaled 21 billion yuan ($2.96 billion) in 2018, accounting for 6.4 percent of the total revenue of the group that year, which is roughly the same proportion as international automotive groups. Over the past decade, the group that owns Geely, Volvo and other brands has invested over 100 billion yuan in research and development.So far the group has established five major research and development facilities, employing up to 20,000 engineers.The group is also leveraging the advantages of its brands to create synergy. For example, the CMA platform is now shared by Volvo, Lynk&Co and Geely-branded vehicles.The on-board connectivity system called GKUI is available on 22 models of different brands, with their combined sales totaling over 1 million. It is also featured in Proton models, a Malaysian brand of which Geely acquired a stake in 2017. Geely-branded vehicles increased their share in China from 6.3 percent to 6.5 percent in the first half of the year. Last year, the group's total sales hit 2.5 million vehicles.In the future, Geely will maintain strong research and development investment. "Geely's long-term strategic goals will not be affected by short-term market fluctuations. We must maintain our strategic strength, grit our teeth, and not relax," Li said.

                    Additive Manufacturing and Design Innovative Forum held in Xi'an

                The Additive Manufacturing and Design Innovative Forum, one of the sub-forums of Eurasian Economic Forum - Silk Road International Innovative Design Week 2019, was held on Friday in Xi’an, Shaanxi province in Northwest China to further promote the industry’s development.Experts, scholars and industry elites from all over the country made speeches about the advanced achievements of the incremental manufacturing industry in breaking through industry barriers, fully demonstrating the enormous potential of the development of the additive manufacturing industry endowed by innovative design and describing the future of the incremental manufacturing industry.Zhu Gang, Deputy Chief Engineer of the National Additive Materials Manufacturing Innovation Center, presented Additive Materials Manufacturing from three aspects: forward design process equipment, optimization based on Simulation Analysis and study of mechanism models.“For additive manufacturing, materials, equipments and application are indispensable,” Zhu said.Han Bin, associate professor at the Institute of Innovative Design of the National Institute of Additive Manufacturing, said that additive manufacturing has a very high degree of manufacturing freedom, which is an important basis for the realization of innovative design. At the same time, innovative design can maximize the advantages of additional material manufacturing.He believes that by advanced simulation and optimization, additive manufacturing can comprehensively consider structure, performance, process and functional effects to achieve innovative design, ultimately satisfy the needs for improved efficiency and reduced weight, and obtain new functional materials, which would reduce the number of parts.Professor Lu Changde of Northwest Polytechnic University shared a report on Intelligent Manufacturing and Innovative Design.Lu said that it was time to look for industrial design with Chinese characteristics. “Design circles and designers should have the goal of exploring the design with Chinese characteristics. Sooner or later, we will turn Made in China into a proud Chinese design. This period is not far away; our designers and friends should work together for the goal,” Lu said.
