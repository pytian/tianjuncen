                Strike on Libyan migrant center sparks outrage
            </p>
            <p>
                TRIPOLI, Libya - Outrage and calls for an independent probe mounted on Wednesday as 44 migrants were killed in an airstrike on a detention center in Libya. The United Nations said the airstrike could constitute a war crime. UN chief Antonio Guterres denounced the "horrendous" attack and demanded an independent investigation. Libya's internationally recognized government and arch-foe rebel leader Khalifa Haftar traded blame for the deadly assault, which the European Union called a "horrific" attack. Bodies were strewed on the floor of a hangar in the Tripoli suburb of Tajoura, mixed with the blood-soaked clothes of migrants, an AFP photographer said. "There were bodies, blood and pieces of flesh everywhere," a Moroccan survivor, 26-year-old Al-Mahdi Hafyan, said from his hospital bed where he was being treated for a leg wound. Hafyan said he had been detained in the center for three months, after coming to Libya with a fellow Moroccan hoping to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean Sea. His friend survived the attack unscathed, but his T-shirt was stained with other people's blood. "We were lucky. We were at the back of the hangar." Tuesday night's strike left a hole around three meters in diameter in the floor of the hangar, surrounded by debris ripped from the metal structure by the force of the blast. At least 44 people were killed and more than 130 severely wounded, the UN said. The UN shared the coordinates of the Tajoura detention center east of Tripoli with the warring sides to ensure that civilians sheltering there were safe, Guterres said. UN envoy to Libya Ghassan Salame said the "attack clearly could constitute a war crime, as it killed by surprise innocent people whose dire conditions forced them to be in that shelter". Around 600 migrants and refugees were held in the Tajoura center, the compound's head Noureddine al-Grifi said, adding that people were wounded in another hangar. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. But the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord, or GNA, denounced the attack as a "heinous crime" and blamed it on Haftar, who in early April launched an offensive from the east to seize the capital. On Wednesday evening, a spokesman for Haftar's Libyan National Army, or LNA, said: "The (pro-Haftar) forces deny their responsibility in the attack on the migrant center of Tajoura". Ahmad al-Mesmari blamed the attack on the GNA, accusing it of "plotting" against the LNA. "We never target civilians. Our armed forces are professional and accurate in their strikes," Mesmari said, calling for an investigation into the carnage. The European Union - echoing many countries and international organizations - called for an independent probe. "Those responsible should be held to account", an EU statement said. Migrants 'at risk' The UN Refugee Agency also deplored the attack. "Migrants and refugees must NOT be detained; civilians must NOT be a target; Libya is NOT a safe place of return" for migrants and refugees, UNHCR head Filippo Grandi tweeted. The UN's mission in Libya estimated that around 3,500 migrants and refugees held in detention centers near the combat zone are at risk. Wracked by chaos since the 2011 conflict that ousted former leader Muammar Gadhafi, Libya has become a major departure point for migrants from other countries seeking to reach Europe, even though they are vulnerable to numerous militias vying for control of the Libya's oil wealth. Activists said those migrants' plight has worsened since Haftar launched the offensive against Tripoli. More than 700 people have been killed and 4,000 wounded since the assault began in early April, while nearly 100,000 have been displaced, according to UN agencies.

                Heavy rainfalls force over 2,500 Libyans to flee homes: UNHCR
            </a>
            <p>
                GENEVA - More than 2,500 Libyans have been forced to flee their homes after heavy rainfalls caused severe flooding in the town of Ghat, some 1,300 km southwest of Tripoli, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said on Friday.In a press release, the UNHCR said the rains, which started on May 28, have already claimed the lives of four people, while 30 more are injured.According to the UN agency, the telecommunications network has been disrupted for days. In some areas, houses and crops have been destroyed, and people reliant on their farmland as their sole source of income are set to face major challenges ahead."All 20,000 of Ghat's inhabitants are now in need of humanitarian support. Shelter, food and basic items are urgently needed," the UN agency said.It added that further rainfall, albeit of reduced intensity, is expected in the coming days, worsening the challenges and risks.

                Over 70m people displaced in 2018, UN says
            </a>
            <p>
                ROME — Almost 70.8 million people were forcibly displaced last year, a 2.3-million increase compared to 2017, according to a report released in Rome on Wednesday by the United Nations Refugee Agency, or UNHCR.Ahead of the World Refugee Day, celebrated worldwide on June 20, the UN agency in Rome provided the latest figures in its annual Global Trends report.The number of people forced to leave their homes, and often their countries, due to war, unrest, or persecution has never been so high in the last seven decades, the report stated."This is the largest global displacement situation since the World War II," Roland Schilling, UNHCR regional representative for Southern Europe, told a news conference.The 70.8 million comprised 25.9 million refugees, nearly 41.3 million people forcibly displaced within their own country, and more than 3.5 million asylum-seekers waiting for a decision on their application, according to the report.An estimated 13.6 million were newly displaced because of conflicts or persecution last year, including 10.8 million people looking for safety within the borders of their own country.Such number made an average of 37,000 people being forced to flee for every single day of 2018, officials at the news conference highlighted.Finally, there were 1.7 million new claims lodged by asylum-seekers last year, with most seeking asylum in the United States, followed by Peru, Germany, France and Turkey.Altogether, two-thirds of refugees worldwide in 2018 originated from five war-afflicted countries: Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq, Syria and Sudan.Yet the UN agency warned it was unable to provide a detailed estimate of people fleeing from all crises around the world. "The figure of 70.8 million is conservative, in particular as the crisis in Venezuela is still only partly reflected in this number," the report specified.Overall, the number of displaced people spiraled out of control in the last decade, rising from 43.3 million in 2009 to the current 70.8 million, the report said.The situation worsened especially between 2012 and 2015, mainly due to the war in Syria, which has now entered its eighth year and has so far produced more than 5.6 million refugees and 6.6 million internally displaced.Yet, other hot spots around the planet contributed to the rise as well, including Iraq and Yemen in the Middle East, the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan in Africa, and Bangladesh in Asia.Not only was the situation not improving, the UNHCR warned, but a much-needed trend reversal seemed to be nowhere in sight."This proves the current policies implemented not only in Italy or Europe but around the world — policies mostly built on concepts such as exclusion and fear, and leading to the construction of defensive walls — are not focusing on a real solution," said Carlotta Sami, UNHCR spokeswoman for Southern Europe.

                UN refugee agency holds film festival to observe World Refugee Day
            </a>
            <p>
                A three-day film festival launched by the UN Refugee Agency to observe World Refugee Day ended in Beijing on Saturday. This year's events are especially poignant as they mark 40 years of the agency's presence in China and its partnership with the Chinese government, UNHCR said.The film festival opened on Thursday, World Refugee Day, with Kakuma My City, a film that celebrates the diverse nationalities, cultures and dreams in Kenya's Kakuma camp. Through the eyes of a young refugee, it depicted how refugees from countries like Somalia, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo live and thrive with their Kenyan hosts."More than 70 million people have been forcibly displaced by war and persecution. The numbers are staggering, but behind every statistic is someone who has survived unimaginable horrors and is working to rebuild their lives," said Sivanka Dhanapala, the refugee agency's representative in China. "This film festival aims to tell these stories of courage and resilience – not just of refugees but also of the host communities that embrace them.""The film industry has a long tradition of focusing on conflict and displacement, with movies like Schindler's List, Life is Beautiful and Hotel Rwanda," said Zhang Xiaoguang , deputy curator of the China Film Archive, where the event was held. "In recent years, we've eagerly watched the rise of such films coming from outside Hollywood, providing different voices and perspectives on the global challenge of forced displacement."The closing film was Capharnaum, which won the Jury Prize at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2019 Academy Awards. Made in Lebanon, it tackles many social issues affecting Lebanese and refugees alike: Child labor, early marriage, statelessness and poverty. The main character is played by a real-life refugee , Zain Al Rafeaa, who fled Syria with his family in 2012 and tapped on his own experiences for the fictional role."Capharnaum was the surprise hit of the year," said Yang Hai, general manager for publicity and promotion at Alibaba Pictures. "This film basically tells the story of a Lebanese child who struggles to grow up with the heavy burden of life, and it is recognized as a realistic film masterpiece. The harsh reality reflected in this film has also caught a lot of attention."

                UN 'deeply shocked' by death of father, child at US-Mexico border
            </a>
            <p>
                GENEVA -- The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said on Wednesday it was "deeply shocked" to see the "heartbreaking photo" of the drowned bodies of a father and his 23-month-old daughter from El Salvador washed up on the banks of the Rio Grande, which separates the United States and Mexico.While the details remain uncertain, it is clear, said the UNHCR in a statement, that the circumstances that led to the tragic death of Oscar Alberto Martinez Ramirez and his daughter Valeria are "unacceptable."The UNHCR noted that "less than four years after the world witnessed the lifeless body of a Syrian refugee toddler, Alan Kurdi, washed up on the shores of the Mediterranean", the world is again "confronted with powerful visual evidence of people dying during their dangerous journeys across borders.""The deaths of Oscar and Valeria represent a failure to address the violence and desperation pushing people to take journeys of danger for the prospect of a life in safety and dignity," UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said."This is compounded by the absence of safe pathways for people to seek protection, leaving people with no other choice than to risk their lives."The UNHCR said that it continues to call on all countries in the region to take immediate and coordinated steps to prevent further tragedies like this from occurring.The refugee agency said it had also offered proposals on ways to improve and strengthen the processing of asylum-seekers in the United States, including conditions in detention."We remain ready to support all governments in the region in ensuring that any person in need of international protection receives it promptly and without obstruction," the UNHCR said.
