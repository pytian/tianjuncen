                Future of luxury brands is already here for those that adapt to how technology is changing the way people buyIn a market upswing, everyone's a genius. "Only when the tide goes out," Warren Buffett warned his fellow investors, "do you discover who's been swimming naked." The upswing of the Chinese market over the past three decades has been so perpetual, businesses in China seemed immune from global turbulence. That held true until the tide went out for Apple, which cut its sales forecasts for the first time in 17 years, citing the unforeseen "magnitude" of the economic slowdown in China.But if the big West Coast tech company is feeling the squeeze, then Europe's biggest luxury brands - Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Herm ès, Burberry - must be bracing themselves for a long winter. This does not come without warning. In October, the French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH saw its share price decline, despite robust sales growth overall, when the Chinese showed the first signs of waning demand for high-end handbags. Collectively, luxury stocks are down by about 11 percent since the start of October, wiping out some $150 billion in combined market value.When demand wanes, supply must shrink. In an industry shakeout, it's survival of the fittest. Unfortunately, there are those, like me, who would say that luxury brands are not exactly well-known for their operational excellence.They have corporate headquarters full of brilliant designers who are determined to take on the fashion challenge of changing consumer tastes, only to find the sales organization battling against their brilliance because it makes no sense for the local market. Who's right? Who knows? But it would be quite a miracle if it all works out for everyone.This sort of tug of war seems fine for those familiar with the business of haute couture. But it's the sort of nonsense that Jack Ma from Alibaba doesn't allow. In 2013, Alibaba bought an 18 percent stake in Weibo, a Chinese microblogging website that is a combination of Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter, with a bit of YouTube and livestreaming thrown into the mix. Alibaba's online shopping website (Taobao) has since integrated with Weibo, allowing merchants to "hang" dozens if not hundreds of new items on virtual racks. These merchants, who in turn are followed by their fanbase, curate pictures and stories of their lifestyle, aesthetics, and travel, not unlike Kim Kardashian, Jessica Simpson, or Bethenny Frankel. They explain to their fans how to pair a style with the rest of the wardrobe, give makeup tips, and provide in-depth descriptions of the stitching or detailing on apparel. At other times, these celebrities on Weibo talk about their feelings and worries and their personal relationship with "realness".A week or two before launching a sale, Weibo celebrities closely gauge interest in new items, such as by posting a shot at dinner wearing a new sweater. Fans discuss these items on display, debating between different styles, colors, and cuts. If a certain color is discussed more than expected, the brand can then produce a larger first batch; if fans ignore something, it may get dropped. Thanks to Alibaba's automated supply chain infrastructure (Ruhan) and Chinese factories ranging from a single sewing machine in a small room off an alleyway to world-class manufacturing site that handle orders from Burberry and Louis Vuitton, merchants can make clothes in three to seven days, usually in small batches, with low marginal cost and exemplary quality.That on-demand supply is also met by an AI-powered chatbot, AliMe, that Alibaba launched in 2016. Using a variety of machine-learning techniques from semantic comprehension, context dialogues, knowledge graphs, data mining, and deep learning, the chatbot learns about products within merchant webstores, is well versed in return policies, understands delivery costs and how to change an order or delivery destination, and can find solutions to resolve a customer's inquiry and then execute them without human intervention. This lack of human action allowed AliMe to shoulder more than 95 percent of customer questions on Alibaba's Singles Day on Nov 11, which generated more than $30 billion in sales within a 24-hour period, surpassing Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales in the US by a wide margin."The future is already here. It's just not evenly distributed yet," wrote novelist William Gibson. In this future of retail and branding, European luxury brands have fallen behind, because the new generation of consumers expects well-curated product personas across all social media channels with spontaneous user engagement. Meanwhile, the squeeze of tighter economic conditions requires an agile supply chain that can quickly pivot with emerging consumer preferences. Above all, Alibaba's operation relies on data analytics and advanced automation, without human meddling in the name of "expert judgment". This amounts to a radical leap for the fashion industry into a new knowledge frontier.In my book LEAP: How to Thrive In a World When Everything Can Be Copied, I documented how Steinway& Sons, the best piano maker in the world, relied on timely craftmanship to build pianos that Arthur Rubinstein and Lang Lang desired. However, Steinway saw its sales decline from 6,000 pianos a year in the 1960s to some 2,000 in 2012. The company was forced to auction off many of the historic buildings that had once been part of the Steinway Village in northern Astoria, Queens. The original campus was reduced to one gritty red-brick factory at the end of Steinway Street.A poignant story, perhaps. But it doesn't need to be this way. Through five principles - including "leveraging seismic shifts" and "experimenting to gain evidence" - pioneering companies can in fact thrive if they are prepared to rethink the way they do business. Being best at what you do has never been enough. Being best at something different - over and over - is key to flourishing over generations.The author is professor of Management at IMD Business School in Switzerland.

                'Laurel' or 'Yanny'? What's the difference?
            </a>
            <p>
                An online audio clip has puzzled internet users, going viral on the internet after being posted by a US high school student on social network Reddit.Some insisted they heard "Laurel" each time they listened to the clip, while many others argued only "Yanny" could be heard, no matter how many times they tried.The initial version of the audio was recorded by the original poster at a vocabulary website, according to the Paper.cn.The audio was also posted on China's twitter-like Sina Weibo. The official Weibo account of People's Daily posted the audio, and the post got 1,977 likes, 1,424 comments and 1,865 reposts in the hours after its release on Friday.A weibo user named JiYuCtrip said "if you hear 'Yanny', please click the like on my comment," and that comment had received 1,656 likes by 12:49 pm. Another Weibo user named Jiuxiangnanxiang said, "It's 'Laurel'." This comment got 801 likes.However, Pikachu-u, another Weibo user, said "isn't it 'Yarel'?"But there's no need to be confused, or question your own hearing.Abby Walker, a linguistics professor from Virginia Tech University, was quoted by the Paper.cn as saying there are two main reasons for the phenomenon. One is people's hearing differences and the other is the speaker equipment. In either case, it depends on one's ability to receive high-frequency or low-frequency sound waves. People who hear "Yanny" mostly receive high-frequency sound waves in the audio, and people hearing "Laurel" receive low-frequency ones.Walker added people may hear different words if the audio's pitch is adjusted.Bridget Carey, a sci-tech reporter with CNET, was quoted by the Paper.cn as saying people who are hearing-impaired, usually caused by aging or excessive use of earphones, will find it hard to hear "Yanny".

                Understanding China from within
            </a>
            <p>
                I find debates on objective reality not in the least useful, because eventually you arrive at the question whether all of the truths on which we base ourselves are true. And the answer has to be yes. Even if the truths we hold true would be false, believing so is clearly no option. Taken to the extreme: we may be living in a simulation, but believing so clearly is no option. We have to believe in the truths we tell ourselves to be true, because we base our judgement on them. Those are the truths that make us, and if we were to stop believing in those — if we’d question our subjective reality — we’d have no identity, no sense of self.This is why empathy for different cultures is so difficult, because even when we tell ourselves we are emphatic — even when we think we are open to new experiences — we still don’t really believe other truths. In order to do so we’d have to question our own truths, which would challenge our believes and identities. It’s very difficult to believe in two conflicting truths at the same time (James Sowden writes about it in ‘Unlearning me’.) Instead, it’s way easier to look at a foreign culture like it is a curious gem, to observe it from all sides, except from within. To admire it or laugh at it. To observe like you would observe an animal in a zoo. But not really try to understand it, and really challenge our truths.What is the norm, what’s normal? The answer is easy: when you’re at home. And tourists in China are not at home. And you could argue many expats aren’t either — either located in expat suburbs or wearing headphones to blur out the noise.To be fair, when I was much younger (and more foolish) I met a Chinese teenager in Sydney— and I thought it was pretty funny that he invented his own name: James, because he liked James Bond. But I did not try to understand why James himself was logical in an English speaking environment. I just assumed my default.And the first time I saw someone eating which chopsticks I would have thought it to be weird, too. Why not use a knife and fork? Ulrich Libbrecht once asked a Chinese man about what he thought of Western dining habits, who answered: “I think it’s rather barbaric. I would never think that you would constantly put those sharp iron things in your mouth. They are not eating utensils, but weapons. I think in their origin they are weapons. Who brings knifes to the table?”These are just two practical examples, but the differences dive into many other topics. What saddens me most are the Westerners who have never set foot in China, who judge from their Twitter and Reddit accounts. Vast nuances are reduced to black and white absolutes. There is no real attempt at understanding.I’m fortunate to have been brought into a Chinese family, as it has made me understand Chinese culture, and question it, as well as my own. Even though I don’t understand it fully. Language is your country and I do not speak it (yet). What I want to say is that when you open the door and try to look from within, you see it’s marvellous and your world becomes much larger. China is not weird, it’s just wonderfully different.Jaap Grolleman is a marketing professional from the Netherlands and now working as a strategist at the Chinese-Swedish company Seventy Agency in Shanghai.

                Study finds excess use of social media  is socially isolating
            </a>
            <p>
                Social media is intended to bring individuals together by allowing them to share photos, chat about common experiences, exchange ideas and develop communities of shared interest.But researchers at the University of Pittsburgh concluded that tapping away at a computer or smartphone leads to greater isolation and is detrimental to building social bonds."Contrary to our hypothesis, young adults with high (social media use) seem to be more, and not less, socially isolated," the researchers said in a study published in July in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.The researchers surveyed a representative sample of 1,787 adults aged 19 to 32 years. They assessed both the frequency of use and time spent on 11 social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, Vine, Snapchat and Reddit.Participants then were asked to complete the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, which surveys how socially connected or isolated the respondent feels.The researchers classified 42 percent of respondents as "low social isolation", 31 percent as "medium social isolation" and 27 percent as "high social isolation"."We found robust linear associations between increased social media use and increased social isolation," the researchers said. Translation: The more time an individual devoted to social media, the more likely that person was to be socially isolated.People who spend two hours a day or more on social media reported greater instances of depression, jealousy, low self-esteem and feelings of inferiority. This may stem from the perception that others have developed a large circle of friends and are engaged in interesting activities while the respondent feels cut off from much social interaction and therefore feels isolated.Social science is sometimes derided as the art of stating the obvious with copious footnotes. Could this study be yet another instance, despite its voluminous bibliography, of stating what we already know?For starters, is it possible that socially isolated individuals are drawn to social media because it requires nothing but a computer, an internet connection — and no face-to-face interaction? Are the researchers describing a chicken-or-the-egg conundrum: Which came first, an individual's social isolation or heavy use of social media?The researchers note that face-to-face interaction is needed to build and preserve lasting friendships. Isn't meeting other people the point of interest groups, in or out of school?Aren't personal relationships the key to small-business transactions? Customers can depend on a major bank's reputation for quickly and accurately handing transactions, but if you're buying a house, don't you need to get to know the real estate agent, and don't you want to check out the neighborhood?"Because many socially isolated individuals use social media, this may be a good medium for intervention," the researchers said. "While this study raises potential concerns, there also may be useful ways of leveraging social media to identify socially isolated individuals and helping them connect to more valuable in-person networks."Understanding the relationship between (social media use) and social isolation will help that these interventions are appropriately designed and provide the support necessary."Contact the writer at scottreeves@chinadailyusa.com

                The return of 'golden age' science fiction - made in China
            </a>
            <p>
                Like many, many people across China, I had the pleasure of watching the movie version of Liu Cixin's The Wandering Earth during Spring Festival.I love science fiction, but, with a few exceptions, the recent movies and books from the United States have been such insipid stories and so philosophically empty that I had almost given up on the genre. Many current sci-fi novels in the US are unreadable, shallow and politically correct dystopias.As in classic science fiction, the hero and heroine of The Wandering Earth find inner strength as they struggle to achieve something great. Much current US sci-fi clearly doubts the very idea of personal fortitude.

                The rising 'one' population
            </a>
            <p>
                In the US, more than 45% of those age 18 or over are single, with the number in China about 15% (200 million people). The increase in singles is expected to have enormous consequences on housing, healthcare, population levels and consumer habits.For Ashley Gray, a 26-year-old web developer living on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, her best time is in the evening, after a long and tiring day at work — and when she is alone."I will cook my own dinner – I can eat whatever I want, and I will go to the gym, then get beers and watch my favorite shows on Netflix," said Gray, who has been single for about five years after breaking up with her college boyfriend. "Or I can choose to hang out with my friends."She said she likes to be free to go with the flow and be responsible only for herself, and not having to compromise."I just feel like I'm happier and more myself [when I'm alone]," Gray said, adding she's also busy trying to advance her career, so she doesn't want to spend extra time on taking care of a partner or children if she gets into a relationship or gets married."So, I think I won't get married until I'm 33," Gray said.Like Gray, more women and men in the US are single — more than 45 percent of all Americans age 18 or older, the US Census Bureau reported in 2017 — and the number of single households around the world also is increasing.Singles make up about 14.6 percent — about 200 million — of China's population, the largest singles population in the world, People's Daily reported.Sweden has the highest rate of people staying single, 51 percent of all households, according to 2017 data from the European Union's Eurostat.Sweden is followed by Denmark, Finland and Germany, which all have more than 40 percent one-person households.The never-married population age 16 years and over in England and Wales increased by 3.9 million from 2002 to 2017, while the number of married people increased only by 1.2 million during the same period, UK Census reported.Factors contributing to the rise of one-person households include new views on marriage, high levels of divorce, increased education that leads to more employment and better-paying career opportunities, and increased longevity and improved health at older ages.The growth of one-person households could have numerous consequences for society, ranging from housing and health care to the fertility rate and consumption patterns, say experts.
