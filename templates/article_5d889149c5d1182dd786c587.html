                A Ukrainian fighter jet was shot down by insurgents in the country's restive east on Sunday, a military spokesman said. According to Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky, the MiG-29 jet was downed in the Lugansk region, where government forces have been battling with the pro-independence insurgents since April. The pilot ejected and was rescued by government troops, he added.

                UN chief, experts laud China's role in WWII
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and experts from around the world have highly commented on China's contribution to and sacrifice in World War II (WWII), shortly before China's Sept. 3 parade to mark the 70th anniversary of its victory in the Anti-Japanese War. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon meets the press at the UN headquarters August 28, 2015.  [Photo/Xinhua]"China's contribution and sacrifice during the Second World War is very much recognized, (China is) appreciated for all such sufferings, and sympathized by the world's people," Ban told reporters at the UN headquarters. Japan invaded Northeast China in 1931 and had conducted a full-scale invasion since 1937. By the end of World War II, more than 35 million Chinese were killed or wounded during the Japanese aggression. The UN secretary-general will join 30 heads of state, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Republic of Korea President Park Geun-hie, in attending the upcoming celebrations of the victory in the Anti-Japanese War. China, which won the war in the major oriental theatre of WWII, will stage a grand military parade in the heart of Beijing to mark the anniversary on Sept. 3. Asked about his response to the reported Japanese concern on his upcoming China visit, the secretary-general said it is very important for the world community to learn from the past and move forward. The Chinese people's contribution to the victory in World War II has been significantly underestimated until recently, said Nikolay Samoylov, an East Asia expert at St. Petersburg State University. The Chinese people deserve credit for having faced the threat single-handedly in the early years of the war following the beginning of overt Japanese aggression in 1931, Samoylov said on the eve of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II and the liberation of China from Japanese aggression. Ukrainian historian Oleksiy Koval called China's resistance against Japanese invasion an example of the nation's struggle for freedom. "China's resistance to Japanese aggression can be called one of the most heroic and tragic pages of World War II," said the expert, who is also a member of the Ukrainian Sinologists Association. During the conflict, Chinese people showed exceptional courage and made an enormous national sacrifice, he said. Chinese people's role in defeating Fascism deserves greater recognition, said Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev. China made unmeasurable contributions to the Allied victory in WWII, Nazarbayev told Xinhua in an interview before departing for China to attend the Sept. 3 parade. China's military parade symbolizes a sense of pride and is a celebration for heroism and the older generation's remarkable feats, he said. Nazarbayev also expressed concern about some forces' attempt to distort the history of WWII, saying the deliberate manipulation of history has become a publicity means for some politicians. The distortion of history aims to serve for short-term political interests, including stirring up social hatred, he said.

                Children near Fukushima more likely to suffer from thyroid cancer
            </a>
            <p>
                An abandoned farm and some houses are seen in Fukushima Prefecture in Japan in this June 14, 2015, file photo. [Photo/Xinhua]TOKYO -- Children living in Fukushima Prefecture in Japan are significantly more likely to suffer from thyroid cancer after the Fukushima nuclear disaster despite denial by Japanese authorities, according to recent reports.The rate of children suffering from thyroid cancer in Fukushima Prefecture was as much as 20 to 50 times higher than the national average as of 2014, three years after the disaster, said Toshihide Tsuda, professor of environmental epidemiology at Okayama University.More than 160 teenagers in Fukushima Prefecture had been diagnosed with thyroid cancer, including suspect cases, since the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was crippled by the monstrous quake-triggered tsunami in March 2011.The number almost certainly increased with the passage of time, according to Tsuda's findings published in the electronic edition of the journal of the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology (ISEE) late last year.On the fifth anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear crisis, the parents of the children thyroid cancer sufferers in Fukushima formed a mutual help group to demand the government provide convincing evidence that their children's sufferings were not related to the nuclear crisis.The ISEE has sent a message to the Japanese government suggesting it to conduct detailed and continuous research on residents' health in Fukushima, but the government did not respond to the advice, Tsuda said.The Fukushima prefectural government doubted the cases were related to the nuclear disaster and attributed the surge to "over diagnosis."Some nuclear experts were surprised by the Japanese government's irresponsible and indifferent attitude.Oleksiy Pasyuk, an expert on energy policy at the National Ecological Center of Ukraine, said that one of the main mistakes made by Japan in the aftermath of the accident was that the government had not stocked enough medicinal iodine tablets, which can prevent the absorption of radioactive material into the human body.According to research by Fukushima University, about 3,500 trillion becquerels of radiative cesium-137 were discharged into the sea with toxic water since the disaster broke out and radiative material reached as far as the western coast of northern America.
