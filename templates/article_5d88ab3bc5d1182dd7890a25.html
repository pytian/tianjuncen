                Ex-NYC mayor pledges $160m  to push flavored e-cigarette ban
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Tuesday that he is committing $160 million for a campaign to ban all flavored e-cigarettes as Kansas health officials confirmed the first vaping-related death in the state, bringing to six the nationwide toll from an outbreak of a lung disease linked to the products.The man in Kansas, who was over the age of 50, "had a history of underlying health issues and was hospitalized with symptoms that progressed rapidly", said state health officials, who are not sure of the exact vaping products the man used.Other vaping deaths have occurred in California, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota and Oregon. State and local health officials still don't know the exact cause of the lung disease.Health departments around the country report more than 450 cases of possible lung illnesses linked to e-cigarettes in 33 states and the US Virgin Islands.Bloomberg, the billionaire and founder of the Bloomberg media company, has long been an advocate of antismoking campaigns and has spent millions to get people to quit smoking. The city's Smoke-Free Air Act came into effect a little over a year into Bloomberg's first term as mayor in 2003 and prohibited smoking inside bars, restaurants and most workplaces.In a joint New York Times op-ed on Tuesday, Bloomberg and Matt Meyers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a Washington-based nonprofit combatting tobacco use, announced a three-year initiative — "Protect Kids: Fight Flavored E-Cigarettes''.Bloomberg said that his non-profit, Bloomberg Philanthropies, is pledging the money to fund the program."As part of our new campaign, we will help at least 20 cities and states pass laws banning all flavored tobacco and e-cigarettes. We will evaluate the impact of these rules on youth use and share lessons with other cities and states,'' they wrote in the article.They called vaping "an urgent health crisis", warning that companies promoting the habit are using "flavorings, unfounded health claims and the hiring of celebrity promoters", the same tactics used by Big Tobacco."The tobacco industry knows how to run out the clock, how to deceive, how to entice young people, and how to sugarcoat its products, marketing and methods."We're not buying it, and we shouldn't let America's children get fooled into buying it either,'' they wrote.

                    Guangzhou Ballet delivers stirring performances in NYC
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The famous Guangzhou Ballet treated New York audiences to two performances over the weekend.In Goddess of the Luo River, the corps de ballet flowed across the stage in a variety of patterns, moving like water."It's really marvelous," Galeyn Remington, an audience member, observed after the show on Saturday at the David H. Koch Theater at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York."The women lead dancers were so exquisite and fabulous, and the men's dancing was also very beautiful," she said. "I loved the grace and enjoyed it."The performance was recomposed by Canadian choreographer Peter Quanz, based on a violin concerto."Originally when I started working on the piece, I read a Chinese poem about having a lover on each side of the river who'll never meet but they are in love with each other," Quanz told the media before a preview performance."I thought the poem (to be) really evocative and gave many images I could use with the corps de ballet being the water, with them separating the two lovers," he said."I found it very easy to find the emotional quality in this Chinese poem," said Quanz, who has worked manly in China the past five years.For the musical style, it features "grand as well as Eastern-classic lasting appeal. It established the romantic, solemn and stirring atmosphere in the emotional tone of the whole play. Dance music is driving the plot forward, like floating clouds and flowing water," the press release said.Another ballet production, Carmina Burana, was performed the same night by Guangzhou Ballet, presented by the China Arts and Entertainment Group Ltd (CAEG).Carmina Burana is considered one of the most complete and artistic medieval poems. For centuries, it was buried deep in a monastery south of Munich, Germany, and then made public.According to Zou Gang, head of the Guangzhou Ballet, the contemporary version of Carmina Burana "is not a classical ballet in the usual sense, but an exploration and attempt of ballet and medieval poetry, aiming at the perfect integration of medieval poetry and music"."Moreover, Western poetry and music is performed and interpreted by the Chinese ballet dancers, while integrating different cultural essences," he said."Within a unique range, it expands the bridge between different cultures, reduces the estrangement between different cultures, and makes this work full of appreciation of culture and promotion," he added.Winner of 42 international awards and 159 national awards, Guangzhou Ballet is one of China's outstanding artistic performance organizations.The ballet has a repertoire of 18 large-scale dance operas and more than 70 small and medium-sized programs. It has toured more than 20 countries and regions, including Russia, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Australia, and Germany.CAEG stages on average more than 4,000 performances, exhibitions and cultural activities in over 200 cities in dozens of countries and regions, attracting more than 10 million attendees every year.

                    NYPD fires officer for 2014 death of Eric Garner
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                NEW YORK — After five years of investigations and protests, the New York City Police Department on Monday fired an officer involved in the 2014 chokehold death of the black man whose dying cries of "I can't breathe" fueled a national debate over race and police use of force.Police Commissioner James O'Neill's said he fired Daniel Pantaleo, who is white, based on a recent recommendation of a department disciplinary judge. He said it was clear Pantaleo "can no longer effectively serve as a New York City police officer.""None of us can take back our decisions," O'Neill said, "especially when they lead to the death of another human being."Asked whether Mayor Bill de Blasio forced his hand, O'Neill said the dismissal was his choice. "This is the decision that the police commissioner makes," he said, calling Eric Garner's death an "irreversible tragedy" that "must have a consequence."The president of the police union, Patrick Lynch, accused O'Neill of choosing "politics and his own self-interest over the police officers he claims to lead."Lynch urged police officers to "proceed with the utmost caution in this new reality, in which they may be deemed 'reckless' just for doing their job.""Now it is time for every police officer in this city to make their own choice," he said in a statement. "We will uphold our oath, but we cannot and will not do so by needlessly jeopardizing our careers or personal safety."Video of the confrontation led to years of protests and calls by black activists and liberal politicians for Pantaleo to lose his job. City officials had long insisted that they could not take action until criminal investigations were complete.A state grand jury declined to indict Pantaleo in 2014. Federal authorities, however, kept a civil rights investigation open for five years before announcing last month they would not bring charges.Pantaleo's lawyer has insisted the officer used a reasonable amount of force and did not mean to hurt Garner.O'Neill said Pantaleo initially placed Garner in a chokehold as the two men stumbled backward into a glass window. That, he said, was understandable, given the struggle.But after the officers got Garner on the ground, Pantaleo did not relax his grip but "kept his hands clasped and maintained the chokehold." That, he said, was the mistake that cost him his job."That exigent circumstance no longer existed when they moved to the ground," O'Neill said.Garner's death came at a time of a growing public outcry over police killings of unarmed black men that sparked the national Black Lives Matter movement.Just weeks later, protests erupted in Ferguson, Missouri, over the fatal shooting of teenager Michael Brown. And later in 2014, a man angry about the Garner and Brown cases shot two New York City police officers to death in their cruiser in retribution.De Blasio never said whether he believed Pantaleo should lose his job but promised "justice" to the slain man's family.At a recent administrative trial at police headquarters, Pantaleo's lawyers argued he used an approved "seat belt" technique to subdue Garner, who refused to be handcuffed after officers accused him of selling untaxed cigarettes.In a bystander's video, it appeared that Pantaleo initially tried to use two approved restraint tactics on Garner, who was much larger at 6-foot-2 (188 centimeters) and about 400 pounds (180 kilograms), but ended up wrapping his arm around Garner's neck for about seven seconds as they struggled against a glass storefront window and fell to the sidewalk.The footage showed Garner, who was 43 at the time, crying out, "I can't breathe," at least 11 times before he fell unconscious. The medical examiner's office said a chokehold contributed to Garner's death.Questions about the handling of the case have dogged de Blasio during his longshot run for president, with some protesters at the recent debate in Detroit chanting, "Fire Pantaleo."AP

                NEW YORK-- In a sold-out Major League Baseball (MLB) game here on Saturday, the home field of New York Mets turned into a spectacle of Chinese culture.Ahead of the game between the Mets and the Atlanta Braves, fans of both teams gathered at the entrances of the Citi Field, ogling an array of photos showing natural and cultural heritage sites in China. Many helped themselves to the brochures and souvenirs.As the players were warming up, the beauty of China's sceneries and culture lit up every screen. Then these LED screens around the stadium illuminated the faces of the crowd, inviting them to visit China.The 12th annual event of "An Evening of Chinese Culture" culminated when Chinese Consul General in New York Huang Ping, who appeared on the field in a Mets jersey, threw the "ceremonial first pitch" to kick off the game amid a volley of cheers and applause from the frenzied crowd.

                    Asians would be affected if NYC drops gifted school programs
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                New York City's public-school system is the nation's largest and among the most segregated.A new report has produced recommendations to desegregate the system in which black and Hispanic students make up nearly 70 percent of the 1.1 million students.Perhaps the most controversial recommendation is ending all current elementary school gifted-and-talented programs. In 2018, Asians had the highest rate of enrollment in the programs at 40 percent.The report by a panel of education experts and community leaders appointed by Mayor Bill de Blasio and the city's school chancellor acknowledged that its recommendations could lead to some departures of whites and Asians from the system.Among the recommendations issued on Tuesday is ending most screened admissions for elementary and middle schools, reducing screening for some high schools. It also recommends redrawing school-district lines citywide to "fully integrate" them within 10 years.There were 15,979 children enrolled in gifted-and-talented programs in 2018, according to the Department of Education (DOE), and nearly 75 percent of the students were white or Asian."If New York City loses students to private schools or families move to other locations, it will become even more difficult to create high-quality integrated schools that serve the interests of all students," the ¬report said.Vanessa Leung, of the Coalition for Asian-American Children and Families, and a member of the report's committee, said she supported the recommendations.The status quo enables "systemic harms against black and Latino students and communities but also ignores the barriers faced by many within the Asian- Pacific American community," she told a press conference when the report was issued. "For decades, increasingly exclusionary admissions practices make it challenging for a vast majority of Asian students to navigate the system for their families and themselves."But Peter Koo, a member of the City Council representing Flushing, Queens, that has a large Asian population, urged the mayor to reject the proposal, saying it is "scapegoating success"."I wholeheartedly condemn the report calling for the elimination of NYC's gifted-and-talented programs," Koo said in a statement given to China Daily. "Increasing diversity and expanding access to higher education should not mean scapegoating success.""These classes are coveted by many students and parents throughout the city and need to be expanded if anything, not eradicated. Yet, instead of working to increase access for students in underserved communities, this proposal seeks to completely remove all opportunities to an advanced education," he said.The mayor has the authority to implement the report's recommendations because he controls the city's education department. On Tuesday, he said he would study the report's recommendations.Not included in the report are the city's eight most elite high schools that admit students based on a single standardized test score and have diversity issues but are under the partial control of the state.Those schools include the three most prestigious ones that regularly send students to Ivy League universities — Stuyvesant, Brooklyn Tech and Bronx Science.Asian students receive the largest number of admission offers to the schools.

                NEW YORK -- A Chinese composer will lead his multicultural band to demonstrate the charm of a unique style of fusion music this week in New York City.Liu Dongfeng, a Chinese composer, arranger and pianist, is set to perform his latest musical works, which fuse Chinese traditional melodies with American jazz harmonies and Caribbean rhythms at the ShapeShifter Lab, a creative music and art hub in New York, on Sept. 19.In addition to Grammy award-winning Latin bassist John Benitez, the concert will also feature other Chinese musicians, including Yang Feifei on erhu, a two-stringed bowed instrument."Chinese music culture has a time-honored history, which is not only the treasure of China, but also the treasure of the world," Liu, who is also a voting member of Grammy Recording Academy, told Xinhua on Tuesday."Combining Chinese music with traditional jazz, we hope the concert could provide an accessible way for international audience to understand Chinese culture," he added.Born and raised in China, Liu felt a deep affinity for the music of the Caribbean. He released his first album "That Time" in 2014 and second album "China Caribe" in 2018.DownBeat, an American magazine devoted to "jazz, blues and beyond," once commented Liu's music as "a kaleidoscopic work that is global in scope."
