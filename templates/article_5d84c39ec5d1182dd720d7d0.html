                Dorian lashes Canada, then weakens
            </p>
            <p>
                TORONTO, Canada - The storm that already walloped the Virgin Islands, Bahamas and North Carolina lashed at far eastern Canada with hurricane-force winds for much of on Sunday, knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of people before weakening and heading into the North Atlantic Ocean.Dorian hit near the city of Halifax on Saturday afternoon, ripping roofs off apartment buildings, toppling a huge construction crane and uprooting trees. There were no reported deaths in Canada, though the storm was blamed for at least 50 elsewhere along its path.The US National Hurricane Center said the post-tropical cyclone was centered about 600 kilometers north of Cape Race, Newfoundland, late on Sunday. Its top sustained winds continued at 95 kilometers per hour, after being above the 120 km/h threshold of hurricane force earlier in the day. The storm was heading to the east-northeast, roughly up the St. Lawrence River, at 39 km/h.The storm swept over northwestern Newfoundland and southeastern Labrador during the afternoon and moved out over the cold waters of the Labrador Sea during the night.Nova Scotia officials asked people in the province to stay off the roads so crews could safety remove trees and debris and restore power.The government said 700 Canadian troops would be fanning out across the Maritimes to help restore electricity, clear roadways and evacuate residents in flooded areas.Nova Scotia Power Inc chief executive Karen Hutt said more than 400,000 customers lost power at the peak of the storm but it had since been restored to 50,000 of them. About 80 percent of Nova Scotia's homes and businesses were blacked out - the highest in the company's history. Hutt said some customers could remain without service for days.On Prince Edward Island, about 75 percent of homes and businesses had no electricity by Sunday afternoon, according to the province's Public Safety Department.Widespread blackouts, affecting up to 80,000 NB Power customers, were reported in southern New Brunswick.By far, the greatest devastation caused by the storm was in the Bahamas, where Dorian struck a week ago as a Category 5 hurricane with 295 km/h winds, and then hovered just offshore for more than a day and a half, obliterating thousands of homes.Planes, cruise ships and yachts were evacuating people from the Abaco Islands and officials were trying to reach areas still isolated by flooding and debris.The country's National Emergency Management Agency said it was sending in extra staff because operations had been hampered by the storm's impact on local workers.The agency said it was setting up shelters or temporary housing for the newly homeless across the islands and appealed for Bahamians to take in storm victims.Bahamian Health Minister Duane Sands said on Sunday the death toll had risen by one to 44. Dorian was blamed for five deaths in the US Southeast and one in Puerto Rico.Agencies

                Dorian still slamming eastern Canada at hurricane force
            </a>
            <p>
                TORONTO — The storm that has already walloped the Virgin Islands, Bahamas and North Carolina brought hurricane-force winds to far-eastern Canada on Sunday, knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of people.Dorian hit near the city of Halifax Saturday afternoon, ripping roofs off apartment buildings, toppling a huge construction crane and uprooting trees. There were no reported deaths in Canada, though the storm was blamed for at least 50 elsewhere along its path.The US National Hurricane Center said the post-tropical cyclone was centered about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Chevery, Quebec, Sunday afternoon. Top sustained winds had slipped to 75 mph (120 kph), just above the threshold of hurricane force. It was heading to the northeast, roughly up the St. Lawrence River, at 25 mph (41 kph).The track would bring the storm near or over northwestern Newfoundland or eastern Labrador during the afternoon and over the North Atlantic in the evening.Nova Scotia officials asked people in the province to stay off the roads so crews could safety remove trees and debris and restore power.The government said that up to 700 Canadian military personnel will be fanning out across the Maritimes to help restore electricity, clear roadways and evacuate residents in flooded areas.Nova Scotia Power Inc. chief executive Karen Hutt said there were over 400,000 Nova Scotia Power customers without power at the peak of the storm and 50,000 have since been restored. But she said some could remain without service for days.As the storm plowed into Prince Edward Island, about 50,000 homes and businesses were soon without power, as were another 74,000 in New Brunswick.By far the greatest devastation caused by the storm was in the Bahamas, where Dorian struck a week ago as a Category 5 hurricane with 185 mph (295 kph) winds, and then hovered just offshore for more than a day and a half, obliterating thousands of homes.Planes, cruise ships and yachts were evacuating people from the Abaco Islands and officials were trying to reach areas still isolated by flooding and debris.The country's National Emergency Management Agency said it was sending in extra staff because operations had been hampered by the storm's impact on local workers.The agency said it was setting up shelters or temporary housing for the newly homeless across the islands and appealed for Bahamians to take in storm victims.Health Minister Duane Sands said Sunday the death toll had risen by one to 44. Dorian was blamed for five deaths in the U.S. Southeast and one in Puerto Rico.Meanwhile, floodwaters were receding from North Carolina's Outer Banks, leaving behind a muddy trail of destruction. The storm's worst damage in the US appeared to be on Ocracoke Island, which even in good weather is accessible only by boat or air and is popular with tourists for its undeveloped beaches.Residents who waited out the storm described strong winds followed by a wall of water that flooded the first floors of many homes and forced some to await rescue from their attics."We're used to cleaning up dead limbs and trash that's floating around," said Ocracoke business owner Philip Howard said Saturday. "But now it's everything: picnic tables, doors, lumber that's been floating around."Gov. Roy Cooper said about 800 people had remained on the island to wait out Dorian, which made landfall Friday morning over the Outer Banks as a far weaker storm than the monster that devastated the Bahamas.The governor said officials were aware of no serious injuries on the Outer Banks from the storm. About 200 people were in shelters and 45,000 without power Saturday, according to the governor's office. Emergency officials transported fuel trucks, generators, food and water to Okracoke.Dorian also lashed the eastern tip of Maine with heavy rain, strong winds and high surf as the storm passed offshore. Several hundred homes and businesses lost power.AP

                Amid fears of higher death toll, islanders vie to leave Bahamas
            </a>
            <p>
                MARSH HARBOR, Bahamas - Bahamians scrambled to escape the islands hardest hit by Dorian, which has killed at least 43 people, while the storm wreaked "havoc" farther north in Canada after making landfall near Halifax on Saturday.Even as some Bahamians began to reunite with their loved ones, the death toll - 35 so far in the Abaco Islands and eight in Grand Bahama - was likely to climb "significantly", according to Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Minnis.A loosely coordinated armada of passenger planes, helicopters and both private and government boats and ships, including redirected cruise liners, converged in the Bahamas on the horribly battered Abacos to help with evacuations, both to Nassau and to the US mainland.Evacuees began flowing out of the region as a cruise ship carrying 1,400 people docked on Saturday in Riviera Beach, Florida, CNN reported. All had documents to enter the United States.The US Coast Guard said all Bahamian ports had reopened and that it had deployed nine cutters to the islands. Six of its MH-60 Jayhawk helicopters had so far rescued 290 people.More than 260 Abacos residents arrived on Friday in Nassau, the capital, on a government-chartered ferry, part of the first wave of people to be evacuated off the archipelago's most decimated islands.Bahamas residents said conditions on the devastated islands were brutal and that the smell of unrecovered bodies, along with mounting piles of garbage, was oppressive and unsanitary.Hundreds or even thousands of people were still missing, officials said, as search-and-rescue teams continued their grim retrievals.Meanwhile, thousands of miles (kilometers) north, Dorian, now classified as a post-tropical cyclone, was "wreaking havoc over the Canadian Maritimes", the US-based National Hurricane Center said.Power outages in Canada More than 500,000 power outages were reported according to the Canadian Hurricane Center, which said the problem extended across the Maritimes, a three-province region in east Canada comprising Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.Dorian made landfall earlier in the day south of the port city of Halifax, home to Canada's Atlantic fleet."We're talking about a very dangerous storm," Bob Robichaud of the Canadian Hurricane Center told a news conference.Television images showed a downpour and howling winds in the empty streets of downtown Halifax where a crane collapsed onto a semi-constructed building and a roof was torn off another apartment.No significant injuries or fatalities had been reported, according to Halifax Regional Police late on Saturday, The Toronto Star reported.Police had evacuated 150 people from downtown Halifax, including residents of the apartment buildings, they said.In the Bahamas, the prime minister has said Nassau "cannot possibly accommodate" all the Abaco victims.For now, he said, supplies of food and water were adequate, although several witnesses from Abaco contested that.While Minnis called the loss of life "catastrophic and devastating", Health Minister Duane Sands said the final death toll "will be staggering."UN relief officials said more than 70,000 people on Grand Bahama and Abaco were in need of assistance. The UN World Food Program was sending food and supplies. The Food Program team estimated that 90 percent of buildings in Marsh Harbour were damaged.The US Coast Guard, Britain's Royal Navy and private organizations have been helping evacuate island residents to Nassau, hampered by damaged piers and airport runways.Chamika Durosier was waiting on Saturday at the Abaco airport. The island, she said, was unsafe."The home that we were in fell on us," she said. "We had to crawl - got out crawling. By the grace of God, we are alive."Agencies

                North America's elite back on ice and eyeing new beginning
            </a>
            <p>
                Players hope 'Dream Gap Tour' can help revitalize women's professional sceneGrowing up, Kendall Coyne Schofield recalled how her dreams of playing hockey ended at college, or maybe the Winter Games - something the two-time US Olympian forward eventually would achieve.Playing professionally was never part of the equation, which is something Coyne Schofield remembers once mentioning to former American star Cammi Granato, noting how girls can only win gold medals while boys can win Stanley Cups."You always grow up and hear boys say, 'I want to be a pro hockey player one day.' You don't hear little girls saying that. They say, 'I want to go to the Olympics,'" Coyne said. "That's the pinnacle of our sport. I can't make a living playing this sport. So when I graduate college, I either go to the Olympic Games or get a job."Coyne Schofield and more than 200 of the world's top female players who have pledged to not compete in North America this season are determined to change that notion.They're launching what's being called the Dream Gap Tour, announced by the newly formed Professional Women's Hockey Players' Association (PWHPA) last month. The gap represents the missing link young girls have in their dreams of playing professionally.The tour's first stop will be in Toronto from Sept 20-22, followed by an event in Hudson, New Hampshire, from Oct 4-6, and Chicago from Oct 18-20. The union also announced its members will play exhibition games against Boston College on Sept 21 and against the Sharks alumni in San Jose on Sept 22.Additional tour stops are being considered but not yet finalized, including Southern California and Buffalo, New York. Among the sponsors already on board are Adidas, and the players are also backed by Billie Jean King Enterprises.The stops will feature about 80 players split into four teams playing a three-game round-robin tournament followed by a championship game. The circuit will also include youth clinics.It's essentially a barn-storming tour made up of PWHPA members seeking to bring the sports' stakeholders - including the NHL, USA Hockey and Hockey Canada - to the table to establish a single league with a sustainable economic model, featuring the world's top talent, and pay a livable wage and include health care.The boycott and the union were born out of the demise of the Canadian Women's Hockey League, which folded due to financial reasons last spring. That left the US-based, five-team National Women's Hockey League as North America's only pro women's league. It is privately backed and has endured financial struggles since being established in 2015.The tour is considered the union's coming-out party, and feature players wearing jerseys with PWHPA logos."We're not talking about millions of dollars here. We just want to be able to live and train full time, and see how far we can take this game," said defenseman Alyssa Gagliardi, who has played in both the CWHL and NWHL. "For so long, it's only been limited to the girls on the national team that can truly do that full time, so this is kind of broadening that."Growing up in Raleigh, North Carolina, Gagliardi had no role models to look up to except for tuning in to the Winter Games every four years. She's looking forward to making a positive impression on young female hockey players during the tour."This is what we're fighting for," Gagliardi said. "I think we want to really make sure this stays with them for the rest of their lives, and by the time they're graduating college there's a place for them to play."Billie Jean King entered the picture to provide guidance. On Aug 26, she was joined by five female hockey Olympians, including Coyne Schofield, at the US Open, where they posed for a picture posted on King's Twitter account.Having blazed a trail in starting women's professional tennis in 1970, King sees an overlap in other sports."We envisioned a world where any girl, if she is good enough would have a place to compete, would be appreciated for her skills and accomplishments, and could make a living playing professional tennis," King said."Today, almost 50 years later, the women of professional hockey, soccer and other sports are facing the same situation, and our vision has not changed. Everyone should be able to have the dream and the opportunity to earn a living playing the sport they love."Coyne Schofield was so excited to meet King that she took in her exhibit at Arthur Ashe Stadium and even bought a King doll at the gift shop.King's message, however, is what resonated most."She always says, 'If you see it, you can be it,'" Coyne Schofield said, reflecting on watching Serena Williams compete and seeing the picture of the original nine professional tennis players including King who formed the first women's tour. "For me, that was the moment when I saw it. She built this and we're literally living in it. And you know what, we have the opportunity to do that."She said it's long past time the best female players from around the world have the opportunity to showcase their talents in one league."We can't just keep accepting the fact that we're grateful for an opportunity," Coyne Schofield said. "We're done being grateful, and we need to stand up for what we know is right. Because if we don't stand up today and fight for what's right, we're setting up the future to fail."Associated Press

                NHL moving forward with female officiating
            </a>
            <p>
                BUFFALO, NY - Once the butterflies and adrenalin rush of officiating her first NHL prospects game subsided, Kirsten Welsh woke up on Saturday eager to get back on the ice again.Whatever miscues Welsh made and hesitancy showed during her debut at the Buffalo Sabres prospects tournament a day earlier were overshadowed by how much she enjoyed the experience. There was also the realization she might have a future as an NHL linesmanor - or is it lineswoman?"I just think this is what I love. This is what I've always been about," Welsh said. "Having the opportunity to pursue this is just unbelievable. I can't tell you how thankful I am."The 22-year-old from Toronto was, as she put it "thrown into the fire" by working a game between Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins prospects. Aside from calling offside and icing and handling faceoffs, the 5-foot-10 Welsh was unafraid to get in the middle of several post-whistle scrums."I think the guys were kind of thrown off that a girl was rushing in there to break them up," said Welsh, who completed a four-year college career playing defense at Pittsburgh's Robert Morris University last season. "I got smushed in the boards yesterday, too. It's fun. I just think it's so great to be out there with them and being able to be on the ice with all these amazing athletes."Welsh has the potential to become a trailblazer in a role that's been exclusively reserved for men at NHL level until last Friday. That's when the league announced Welsh was one of four women selected for the first time to officiate the league's various prospect tournaments held around the nation.Welsh is joined by Katie Guay and Kelly Cooke, who were selected as referees to work tournaments in Anaheim, California, and Nashville, Tennessee. Kendall Hanley was assigned to work as a linesman at the Detroit Red Wings tournament in Traverse City, Michigan.The four were chosen after being among 89 participants - 11 of them women - at the NHL's annual officials scouting combine in Buffalo last month. And they become the first women assigned to work on the ice in a competitive NHL setting.All four are considered candidates to eventually break the NHL's officiating gender barrier, which has become a point of emphasis stressed by commissioner Gary Bettman and the league's director of officiating, Stephen Walkom.The NBA has had female officials since Violet Palmer and Dee Kantner were hired in 1997. Sarah Thomas was the NFL's first female official in 2015. Pam Postema, in 2000, was the first female to umpire a Major League Baseball spring training game, and there are at least two women currently working at the Triple-A level.Al Kimmel, the NHL's director of scouting and development for officiating, said last month that the growth of women's hockey has led to a surge of candidates."In my six years here, the growth and improvement of the on-ice and off-ice abilities match some of the men and surpass some of the men," Kimmel said. "We've got some high-caliber women officials here that have world-class experience that are going to show some of the boys some things out there."Guay is the most experienced of the four. Her 14-year officiating career includes working women's games at last year's Winter Olympics, college hockey men's games and being part of the first all-female officiating crew to work the women's Frozen Four championship last spring.Her lifelong objective was limited to working the Olympics, before finally realizing the possibility of working in the NHL."I think it's huge," she said last month, of the chance of being selected to work an NHL prospects game. "I think any time people are given a chance and new paths are formed, it opens eyes for others to kind of dream bigger."Welsh's debut wasn't spotless. She said she needs to be more assertive in her calls and more in control of players during faceoffs."It's really being firm, like kicking them out of the faceoff if that's the case, don't let them get away with stuff because I'm a girl," she said.Welsh was grateful for the positive support she received from her fellow on-ice officials and league supervisors, who immediately went over her tape to provide tips on what she needs to improve. She also leaned on the support of former Robert Morris player Brandon Blandina, who made his NHL officiating debut last season.Welsh was particularly encouraged by undrafted Penguins prospect Chase Berger congratulating her by shaking her hand following the game."I literally had to say, 'Wow. Thank you. You have no idea how much that means to me,'" she recalled.Bruins prospect forward Cooper Zech said he wasn't aware of a female linesman working the game until he noticed Welsh's long hair."It didn't change anything. It's a linesman. It doesn't matter if it's a boy, girl, they blow the whistle, the plays dead. Nothing changes," Zech said. "She's got the same jurisdiction of any linesman in the National Hockey League or anywhere. Hockey's hockey."Associated Press
