            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                How Chinese companies in Africa treat employees doesn't differ significantly to non-Chinese companies, a study has shown. The research compared Chinese and non-Chinese manufacturing and construction companies in Angola and Ethiopia.It found that the majority of employees in Chinese firms were local workers.The report said that allegations Chinese firms predominately hire Chinese workers are "untrue".According to the report, about 90 percent of workers in Chinese companies in Ethiopia are Ethiopians.The small numbers of immigrant workers, it found, are concentrated in managerial or skilled technical jobs.The report's findings in Ethiopia were reflected in Angola.The number of Angolans working in Chinese firms has grown considerably over the past decade, from around 50 percent in the early days of post-conflict reconstruction to the current rate close to 75 percent.The report, conducted by the School of Oriental and African Studies in the University of London, concluded that wages across Chinese and other firms are broadly similar.It found that differences in wages and working conditions are driven more by the skill and experience of the employee than by the origin of the company.In cases where salaries were lower, there were incentives and benefits, the report found.In Angola, although Chinese companies pay lower average wages for low-skilled workers in manufacturing and construction, they provide them with free food and accommodation, the report said.The study also found that Chinese firms contribute to training as much as other firms, especially in the manufacturing sector.For semi-skilled manufacturing workers, Chinese firms provide training to slightly more workers than Ethiopian or other foreign-owned firms, the report showed.The research studied 76 companies, 31 of them Chinese, and 1,500 Angolan and Ethiopian workers were interviewed for the report.

                    Angolan student chases 'Chinese dream' on video-sharing platform

            <p class="style-content">
                Clarck Gable, an Angolan student who studies computer technology in Nantong Vocational University in Jiangsu province, has become an online celebrity with 2.8 million followers on China's video-sharing platform Douyin.Naming himself "Laoma" in Chinese, Gable registered a Douyin account under his Chinese name with several Chinese young people last year and started to write, direct and act in short videos.Most of the short videos made by Gable and his partners are based on Gable's experience of studying and living in China. In those videos, he speaks fluent Chinese and makes jokes about himself making funny mistakes when he studied Chinese in the past.This is the second time Gable has been a student in China. In 2015, he once studied in Guangdong University of Foreign Studies but had to come back to his hometown in Angola because of some accidents. To return to China, he found a translator job at a Chinese company in Angola to practice his Chinese and got sponsored by a chamber of commerce from Nantong last September to study in Nantong Vocational University.Gable thinks funny videos are the same as traditional comedy on TV. He does brainstorming with his partners everyday to generate ideas. Sometimes, to make a video that lasts several seconds, he needs to work late into the night.Behind his humorous videos are Gable's understanding of and passion for Chinese culture. He hopes people can feel the charm of the Chinese language, writing and culture while they are amused by his performance.Gable has attracted more than 240 million likes on Douyin but he turned down all commercial performance invitations. Instead of money, he cherishes his experience of living in China far more and wants to become a professional actor in the future to chase his own "Chinese dream".

                    Angola eager to welcome more Chinese investors, says ambassador
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Angola's ambassador to China said the southern African country of 30 million people is a huge market and keen to welcome more Chinese investors to the country."Chinese enterprises are making great contributions to Angola in helping rebuild its infrastructure ravaged by its previous civil turmoil. These include highways, hospitals, schools and others," Joao Salvador dos Santos Neto said in an exclusive interview with China Daily.The envoy pointed to the China Tiesiju Civil Engineering Group Co Ltd (CTCE), which has been doing business in Angola for 11 years. He said the company's largest unit in the capital of Luanda has some 800 employees, 60 percent of whom are Angolans.Since the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two nations in 1983, hundreds of Chinese enterprises have been doing business in Angola.Most Chinese enterprises and private investors are engaged in industrial projects, helping promote Angola's economic and social development while boosting local employment, the ambassador said.Last year, bilateral trade reached $28.05 billion, with exports from China to Angola hitting $2.2 billion and imports from Angola to China climbing to $25.799 billion, a year-on-year rise of 26.76 percent.Angola is China's second-largest trade partner in Africa.The country's mild climate, fertile soils, rich flora and fauna also make the country rich in agricultural resources, the ambassador noted, and this is an area Chinese investors can explore.With a coastline of around 1,650 kilometers which is extremely rich in fish, mollusks and shellfish, Angola also has unique and diverse aquatic products awaiting Chinese partners, he said.Angola is the third largest oil producer in Africa, has abundant natural gas resources and is the fifth biggest producer of diamonds in the world.Last October, President Joao Manuel Goncalves Lourenco paid a state visit to China, meeting China's top leaders and presiding over the signing of two agreements promoting bilateral trade and mutual progress, the ambassador said.Most projects involving Chinese investors were started years ago, but the Belt and Road Initiative is helping to inspire talks so a lot of projects are being negotiated, the envoy said."Angola is now trying to diversify its economy in addition to its oil production and diamond exploration," he said, and interested investors can have opportunities in building railways, highways and airports among others.During the first China-Africa Economic and Trade Expo held between June 26 and 29 in Changsha, capital of Central China's Hunan province, more than 60 Angolan enterprises sent representatives to join the fair.They held talks with potential Chinese partners, showing their enthusiasm to cooperate with potential trading partners, the ambassador said.According to the organizing committee of the expo, the event drew more than 10,000 participants, including those from 53 African countries.Currently, more than 190 Angolan students are studying in China on grants from the Chinese government and enterprises, the ambassador said. Some 500 others are expected to come to study in China over the next three years. These Angolan students will help boost bilateral ties, he added.

                Coach Li cautious about sacrificing height to adapt to modern gameSize still matters for Team China. That's the message from the host squad as it looks to adapt to basketball's ever-quickening evolution ahead of the forthcoming FIBA World Cup.With the so-called small-ball style speeding up the game and tending to favor shorter, more agile players, China head coach Li Nan remains reluctant to sacrifice height in pursuit of the latest tactical trends."I think our strength is still our size under the rim, although we don't have a dominant force like we did in the past when we had Yao Ming as our backbone," said Li at a Nike event in Beijing on Thursday to unveil China's new jersey for the tournament."I believe our post players are still among the best in the world and that we need to play them in the right way to maximize their performance," added Li, who was a member of the Yao-led Chinese team which finished eighth at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.With Yao now a keen spectator from the sidelines as chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association, it's left to former NBA players Yi Jianlian and Zhou Qi as well as Wang Zhelin, the Memphis Grizzlies' second-round pick in the 2016 draft, to collectively try and fill the great man's sizable shoes.The smooth shooting, mobility and defensive stretch of the three big men, although not quite up to NBA standards, can help make China more competitive in the modern game, where transition offense dictates play and zone defense make traditional post-ups in the paint nearly impossible."Playing stretch fours and even stretch fives has become a new trend internationally, and I think talent-wise we have the ingredients to adapt to the style. It just depends on if we can get the best out of them," said Li.The 32-team FIBA World Cup, formerly the world championships, will run from Aug 31-Sept 15 in eight Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.Drawn in Group A with Cote d'Ivoire, Poland and Venezuela at west Beijing's Wukesong Arena, Team China has targeted reaching the quarterfinals and qualifying for next year's Tokyo Olympics as the best Asian performer.The rise of big-yet-versatile NBA players from overseas, such as the Denver Nuggets' play-making center Nikola Jokic of Serbia and the Milwaukee Bucks' 'Greek Feak' Giannis Antetokounmpo, pose a threat to the United States' traditional dominance at the tournament.Speaking at the Nike event as a brand ambassador, NBA legend Scottie Pippen expects the World Cup to be an intensive showcase of the new game."I see it as a new trend … I like the word position-less," said the 53-year-old, who was Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls wingman and was on the USA's 1992 Olympic champion Dream Team."The game is different now. There are no big centers blocking in the lane. Guys are not playing in the traditional way of throwing the ball inside and cutting. It's a faster game, it's an outside game and it's a shooter's game."One big concern for China is how quickly veteran forward Yi can get up to speed following a three-month ankle injury layoff.Yi, the only member of the 2008 Games squad on the current roster, officially made his comeback for China in Saturday's 73-62 victory over Angola in Kunshan, Jiangsu province.After representing five different NBA teams since being drafted by Milwaukee sixth overall in 2007, Yi returned home in 2016 and led the Guangdong Southern Tigers to their ninth CBA title in May."Physically, I feel just fine. I just have to figure out how I can fit in smoothly and communicate better with the others as quickly as possible," said Yi, who contributed 10 points and seven rebounds in his 20-minute run-out against the Angolans.Asked what his expectations are for China at the Cup, the 31-year-old replied: "I hope we can at least equal our national team's best result (eighth place in 2008) this time and leave a legacy for the next decade."

                    Angola may tender mining rights to Chinese investors
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China's private sector vital cog in African country's economic diversificationAngola will present its first international public tender in Beijing on Sept 16 to grant diamond, iron and phosphate mining rights to Chinese investors for the country located in the western part of southern Africa.The Angolan embassy in Beijing said on Tuesday the process aims to bring mining concessions for diamonds in the Angolan provinces of Lunda-Norte and Lunda-Sul, iron mining in the province of Kwanza-Norte, and phosphates in the provinces of Cabinda and Zaire.The mining rights roadshow began on Tuesday in the Angolan capital of Luanda, with Dubai hosting the second presentation. They will be followed by Beijing and London later on.Angolan Minister of Mineral Resources and Petroleum, Diamantino de Azevedo, said in a statement that national and foreign companies, embassies, banks, chambers of commerce and industry, professional associations and other entities interested in the mining concessions are invited to attend the presentations."China has been an important strategic partner for Angola and we believe that the Chinese private sector can play a crucial role in Angola's economic diversification by seizing the business opportunities listed in the privatization program," said Domingos Orlando Jacinto, press counselor at the Angolan embassy in Beijing.The minister said the Angolan government has released a list of 195 public companies to be privatized and 32 of them are major national companies. The sale can be executed through public tender, an initial public offer (IPO) or an auction at the stock exchange.Of the total, 175 of the target companies will go private by public tender, 11 by stock exchange auction and nine by IPOs.The privatization program will foster economic diversification and the creation of jobs in Angola as the government intends to increase competition, efficiency of the firms and boost the country's economy. The privatization program will be executed over four years, the minister said.The Angolan embassy official said the most well-known companies involved in this process are state oil company Sonangol, diamond company Endiama and airline TAAG, commercial banks BCI, BAI and Banco Economico, and financial companies ENSA Seguros and Bodiva-Angola Debt and Securities Exchange.The telecommunication companies included in the program are Unitel, MS Telecom, Net One, Multitel, Angola Telecom, TV Cabo Angola, Angola Cables, Angolan postal company ENCTA and telephone directory company ELTA, he said.The program also includes agroindustrial farms Aldeia Nova and Biocom, textile companies Textang II, Satec and Africa Textil, cement plants Nova Cimangola and Secil do Lobito, breweries such as Cuca, Eka and Ngola, and the engineering and construction company Mota-Engil Angola, he added.
