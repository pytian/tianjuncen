                Quiet superstar closes curtain on NBA careerTim Duncan never wanted the spotlight, only the trophies. He never wanted the endorsements, only the camaraderie. He never wanted the accolades, only the collective achievement.So when one of the most understated superstars in sports decided to finally call it a career after nearly two decades of excellence, he made the announcement with a 15-foot bank shot and not a monster slam dunk.

                The hills are alive with the sound of a big, lucrative anniversary.The 1965 Oscar-winning film adaptation of the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical The Sound of Music is celebrating its 50th birthday this year and its star Julie Andrews can't quite believe it."This is a lovely moment to mark. I've been saying all along it's like a very bad joke because surely it was only 30 years ago - not 50," she says. "I feel I lost 20 somewhere along the way. A little thing called life got in the way."
