                New York tells nonessential state employees to stay home NEW YORK - A strong late winter storm lashed the northeast of the United States with blizzard on Tuesday, grounding more than 6,000 flights and knocking out power to about 250,000 customers. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland and Pennsylvania have declared states of emergency. It was easily the biggest storm in a merciful winter that had mostly spared the US Northeast, and many weren't happy about it. "It's horrible," said retired gumball-machine technician Don Zimmerman, of Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, using a snowblower to clear the sidewalk along his block. "I thought winter was out of here. ... It's a real kick in the rear." Eighteen centimeters of snow fell in New York while the city's northwest suburbs have seen more than 30 cm. At least 50 cm of snow was observed in parts of eastern Pennsylvania. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has instructed nonessential state employees to stay home. In Massachusetts, where the forecast called for 30 to 45 cm of snow, Governor Charlie Baker encouraged motorists to stay off the roads and to take public transit only if absolutely necessary, saying the fast snowfall rates would make driving hazardous. The storm came just days after the region saw temperatures climb into 15 C, and less than a week before the official start of spring. February, too, was remarkably warm. "The winters seem to be upside down now. January and February are nice and then March and April seem to be more wintry than they were in the past," said Bob Clifford, who ventured out on an early morning grocery run for his family in Altamont, near Albany, New York. His advice: "Just hide inside. Hibernate." Schools in New York, Philadelphia, Boston and elsewhere were closed. The airports with the most cancellations are: Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey; LaGuardia Airport in New York; JFK International Airport in New York; Logan International Airport in Boston; Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport in Maryland. At least 817 flights have been canceled for Wednesday, according to FlightAware.com. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at Kennedy Airport due to flight cancellations in New York. The aboveground portions of the New York subway system were shut down. Massive power outages occurred in Massachusetts. More than 60,000 electric customers lost power during the storm in Massachusetts, the state's emergency management agency said.  People clear snow from a security barricade on Capitol Hill in Washington on Tuesday.J.

                    'Bomb cyclone' snowstorm paralyzes US East Coast
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                A massive winter storm paralyzed much of the US East Coast on Thursday, dumping as much as 18 inches of snow from the Carolinas to Maine, causing flooding in streets of Boston, forcing the cancelation of more than 4,000 flights and closing businesses, offices and schools. Forecasters expected the storm - which some meteorologists classified as a "bomb cyclone" for its sharp drop in atmospheric pressure - would be followed immediately by a blast of cold air that could break records in more than two dozen cities and bring wind chills as low as minus 40 this weekend. Officials said that more than 100,000 customers lost power in the storm that hit many areas heavy winds. Airlines canceled 4,000 flights on Thursday and hundreds more on Friday, according to FlightAware.com, a tracking service. About 27,000 flights were scheduled Thursday to, from or within the US. The storm shut down major airports until early Thursday evening, including John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in New York and Logan International Airport in Boston. Baltimore-Washington International Airport and Philadelphia International Airport remained open. Newark Liberty International Airport had one runway open, but flights couldn't land due to strong crosswinds. Passenger train operator Amtrak was running reduced service in the Northeast, while mass-transit systems in major metropolitan areas, including New York and Boston, remained open. The New York City area was among the hardest hit with up to 8 inches of snow in Manhattan and 15 inches on eastern Long Island. Wind gusts topped 40 mph in Manhattan and neared 60 mph on Long Island. People struggled against the wind gusts and swirling snow as drifts piled up on corners. But the storm didn't stop people from wandering in Times Square and taking selfies as nearby plows and even a bulldozer sought to clear the area. Drivers crawled on roads, some littered with cars that had gotten stuck or had pulled over. Plows cleared roads as best they could, but wind gusts covered them again. By Thursday afternoon, the snow had stopped in the city, but Mayor Bill de Blasio said it could feel like minus 20 degrees on Friday and Saturdays with the wind chill. "This is a serious, serious storm," he said at a news conference. "We expect tough conditions for days to come, particularly in terms of cold." New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency for the southern part of the state. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency for several counties. The high winds caused coastal flooding from Massachusetts to Maine, stranding people in homes and cars. In Massachusetts, Boston Harbor overflowed with chunks of ice and the rising tide pushed some boats up to street level. The National Weather Service said it was reviewing the water level in Boston, believing it topped levels from the blizzard of 1978. The massive storm began two days ago in the Gulf of Mexico, first hitting the Florida Panhandle with snow in Tallahassee on Wednesday, that city's first snow in nearly three decades. It then barreled up the coast and hit southern cities such as Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, with snow and ice. AP and Reuters contributed to this story.

                NEW YORK - At least five people were killed after a major winter storm pounded the US East Coast on Friday, with strong winds, heavy rain and snow disrupting thousands of flights and forcing the closure of federal government offices in Washington. Coastal flooding alerts were issued from New Jersey to Massachusetts with winter weather advisories, winter storm warnings and high wind warnings in effect from the Northeast to the mid-Atlantic, the National Weather Service said. Winter Storm Riley dropped more than 30.5 centimeters of snow in the western and northern parts of New York state, as heavy rain lashed coastal areas. Police in James City County, southern Virginia, confirmed a 44-year-old man was killed when a tree fell on the truck he was traveling in - while in Chesterfield County, south of Richmond, authorities said a 6-year-old boy was killed when a fallen tree struck him as he slept in his home. Outside Baltimore, an elderly woman, 77, was also killed when she was hit by a large tree branch in Kingsville, Baltimore County Police and Fire Department said in a statement. Meanwhile, local media said fallen trees also killed an 11-year-old boy in Putnam Valley, New York, and a man in his seventies in Newport, Rhode Island. More than 3,000 domestic and international flights were canceled on Friday and more than 2,400 others were delayed, according to the website FlightAware. More than half the flights scheduled to arrive and depart from New York's LaGuardia Airport were canceled, with disruptions at Boston Logan International and New York's two other area airports, Newark and John F. Kennedy International. Amtrak, the US public railway service, announced that "for safety" all services along the northeast corridor were temporarily suspended. Trains already en route between the US capital, New York and Boston would continue to their destinations and hold, it said. New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo warned that Long Island and New York City would see winds of 64 km/h, with gusts as high as 112 km/h possible in eastern Long Island. Wind at that speed has the potential to uproot trees and cause power outages. In the federal capital Washington and surrounding suburbs, public schools were closed because of the storm, which some dubbed online as "Windmaggedon". Weather forecasters urged people to avoid driving through floodwaters or heading to the coast to watch the flooding, flagging reports of stranded motorists.

                The fourth nor'easter snowstorm this month hit the US East Coast on Wednesday, the day after Spring officially arrived.The forecast was for up to 12 to 18 inches of snow in New York City, with 12 to 15 inches expected north of the city, New Jersey and Long Island.The heaviest snowfall amounts will be right in and around New York City," said Bill Goodman, a meteorologist from the National Weather Service.The storm caused travel disruptions from parts of the Midwest and southern Appalachians to the mid-Atlantic and coastal New England. Airlines canceled more than 3,000 flights scheduled for Wednesday.Two-thirds of the scheduled departures from Newark Liberty International Airport, or 418 flights, were called off for Wednesday, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware. More than half of departures from LaGuardia were also canceled.Other affected airports include Philadelphia, those in the Washington area and in Boston.Amtrak suspended all its Northeast Regional trains between New York and Boston on Tuesday. The passenger railroad had previously canceled high-speed Acela Express service between those cities.

                United Airlines will formally open the third edition of its United Polaris lounge at Newark Liberty International Airport on June 4.Building upon the airline's international premium travel experience under the Polaris brand, the lounge will serve the New Jersey airport, one of United's most important hubs."I like to say we are the heartbeat of the system," said Jill Kaplan, president, New York/New Jersey for United. "More United customers begin their journey in the New York/New Jersey region than in any other of our hub cities."The lounge features more than 400 seats with 15 different types of seating, 10 private daybeds and 10 shower suites. Upon entering the lounge, visitors are greeted by an elaborate lighting fixture that mimics the constellations of the 12 zodiac signs.Dining choices include a bistro-like buffet with a do-it-yourself bagel bar, plus sandwiches and wraps such as a curried salmon salad with cucumber raita and baby spinach on a pumpernickel roll as well as a charcuterie board.Mark Krolick, a vice-president of marketing for United, said the lounge is designed to include all the amenities travelers want in an airport.It's especially crafted for businesspersons who may be arriving after a long flight from Shanghai for example. "You can come in and get a shower," Krolick said. "That is especially helpful if you are going straight to a meeting."If you are waiting for a connecting flight to another destination, "we have rest areas which have full beds with Saks Fifth Avenue bedding", he said.International air travel has been gaining momentum, and travel between China and the US has been rising as economic ties expand."We have been working hard on the China market," said Krolick. "United is the largest carrier between the US and China. We now fly to Chengdu so we are entering some of the secondary markets in China."United has Polaris lounges in Chicago and San Francisco and expects to open others in Houston and Los Angeles this year.United is also accelerating the pace in reconfiguring planes with Polaris international business class seats. They plan to roll out one Polaris-equipped plane every 10 days through 2020.Contact the writer at paulwelitzkin@chinadailyusa.com

            <p class="style-content">
                          China urges restraint, calls on relevant parties not to 'open Pandora's box'              WASHINGTON/DUBAI - US President Donald Trump approved military strikes against Iran on Friday in retaliation for the downing of a US surveillance drone, but called off the attacks at the last minute, The New York Times reported.                  The newspaper cited an official from the United States, who was not authorized to discuss the operation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, and said the targets would have included radars and missile batteries.                      Strikes were set to take place just before dawn on Friday to minimize risk to the Iranian military or to civilians. "Planes were in the air and ships were in position, but no missiles fired, when the order to stand down came," the official said.                          It was unclear if attacks on Iran might go ahead later, the newspaper reported, nor was it known whether Trump had changed his mind or whether his administration had become concerned about logistics or strategy. The White House declined requests for comment.                              Iranian officials said on Friday that Teheran had received a message from Trump through Oman overnight warning that a US attack on Iran was imminent.                                  "In his message, Trump said he was against any war with Iran and wanted to talk to Teheran about various issues... he gave a short period of time to get our response but Iran's immediate response was that it is up to Supreme Leader (Ayatollah Ali) Khamenei to decide about this issue," one of the officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity.                                      Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps said it had shot down a US unmanned aircraft RQ-4 Global Hawk on Thursday, which prompted accusations from Washington and Teheran about who was the aggressor.                                          Iran insisted the drone was shot down when it entered Iran's airspace near Mobarak Mountain region in southern coastal Hormozgan Province, and said the drone was on a spy mission. A general said on Friday that Iran had given two warnings before downing the US drone.                                              But the US said it had been flying over international waters.                                                  Independent confirmation of the drone's location when it was brought down was not immediately available.                                                      Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Friday that Beijing has repeatedly called upon all related parties to remain rational, exercise restraint and avoid any moves that will escalate tensions                                                          Noting that the current situation in the Persian Gulf region is complicated and sensitive, Lu said relevant parties should not "open Pandora's box".                                                              Those parties involved should respect each other, properly resolve their differences through dialogue and negotiation and jointly safeguard regional peace and stability, he said.                                                                  Majid Takht-e Ravanchi, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, said Iran had the right to defend its sovereignty according to the global body's charter.                                                                      Trump's initial comments on the attack were succinct, declaring on social media that "Iran made a very big mistake!"                                                                          But he also suggested that shooting down the drone - which has a wingspan wider than a Boeing 737 - was a foolish error rather than an intentional escalation, suggesting he may have been looking for some way to avoid a crisis. "I find it hard to believe it was intentional, if you want to know the truth. I think that it could have been somebody who was loose and stupid that did it."                                                                              Meanwhile, the US Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency order on Thursday prohibiting US operators from flying in Iran-controlled airspace over the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman due to heightened tensions.                                                                                  The order came hours after United Airlines suspended flights between New Jersey's Newark airport and the Indian financial capital of Mumbai, which fly through Iranian airspace.                                                                                      Russia accused the US on Friday of deliberately stoking dangerous tensions around Iran and pushing the situation to the brink of war, the RIA news agency reported.                                                                                          Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov called on Washington to weigh the possible consequences of conflict with Iran and said a report in The New York Times showed the situation was extremely dangerous.

                    Southwest to depart Newark Airport service over MAX, profitability
                </p>

                Southwest Airlines, which has the largest fleet of 737 MAX jets in the US, is pulling out of Newark Liberty International Airport because it doesn't expect the grounded aircraft to return to service this year.The airline is reassigning critically short planes to more profitable routes serving Hawaii and Mexico from California and Texas. Other airlines have canceled flights or purchased older, less fuel-efficient planes, to make up for capacity lost to grounded MAX jets. Southwest has canceled flights and now is moving planes where demand is high."Effective Nov 3, we will cease operations at Newark and consolidate our New York City presence at LaGuardia Airport, where we are experiencing strong customer demand," the airline said on Thursday in its second-quarter earnings report. "The financial results at Newark have been below expectations."Southwest has as many as 20 daily departures a day from Newark compared with 200 from Midway Airport in Chicago, its busiest hub.Southwest flies 34 MAX jets with orders for hundreds more, including 41 scheduled to arrive this year. The carrier said Thursday that it won't plan to fly the MAX again this year, extending planned cancellations through Jan 5. Southwest said the MAX grounding will reduce capacity by 1 or 2 percent this year compared with 2018. The company warned that could erode earnings because it planned to increase capacity by about 5 percent. Airlines worldwide, including those in China, have said they will seek compensation from Boeing for lost revenue.American Airlines also said Thursday that it now expects the grounding to reduce pretax earnings this year by $400 million, up from the $350 million impact it previously anticipated.Boeing MAX jets were grounded worldwide following crashes March 10 in Ethiopia and Oct 29, 2018, in Indonesia that killed a total of 346 passengers and crew.Boeing said it expects MAX jets to resume commercial flights in the fourth quarter, but some analysts believe the plane will remain grounded until 2020.Boeing has sent a software update for the anti-stall device implicated in the crashes to the US Federal Aviation Administration for review, but it's unclear when it will be approved.On Thursday, Boeing withdrew from bidding on a $60 billion Pentagon contract to replace US land-based nuclear missiles a day after CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company was a good fit for the job. Northrop Grumman is now the sole bidder for the project.
