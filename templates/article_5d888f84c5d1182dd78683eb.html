                Why the sceptics are wrong on the Belt and Road Initiative
            </p>
            <p>
                The stage is set for the second Belt and Road Forum (BRF) for International Cooperation in Beijing from April 25. This time BRF will be a much bigger affair, with more heads of State and government, along with thousands of delegates, expected to attend than the first event held mid-May 2017. Along with the forum there will be a conference for the global business community.China has said that it will seek greater congruence between the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the development strategies of participating countries. BRI will also aim at aligning with key projects in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.The forum will be themed Belt and Road Cooperation, Shaping a Brighter Shared Future, a testament to BRI's vision. China's aid to Africa is making a more significant impact than the West's condition-based programmes, which were ultimately bad experiments on Africa's economies.BRI, also known as the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, is reminiscent of the ancient network of trade routes that were for centuries central to Asia and Europe.The route was so significant to China that the country protected it by extending Great Wall. Indeed the political and economic impact of the Silk Road was felt up to the Horn of Africa.The launch of BRI has been met with mixed reactions. On one side are sections of the Western world, who view it as a tool of Sino hegemony. The other side comprises tens of countries, and hundreds of business interests, who see BRI as a boon to the global economy.The optimists view the BRI as an opportunity to promote the flow of production factors and public goods for economic growth.It is now six years since Chinese President Xi Jinping announced BRI.In the ensuing period, China has signed over 170 agreements with more than 120 countries. BRI has created over 240,000 jobs abroad, with trade between China and BRI partner countries exceeding $6 trillion.BRI projects are funded mainly through the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Silk Road Fund and Chinese-funded banks, with the initiative's network now spanning five continents.Leading the few sceptics however is the Group of Seven (G7) and Bretton Woods Institutions, comprising the leading global economies. In a communique after their two-day annual meeting in France on April 6, the G7 demonized BRI as a sign of China's global dominance and an obstacle for Western alliances.BRI rivals initiatives like America's Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. The fact that the BRI is becoming a reality is bound to ruffle the erstwhile established geopolitical order.BRI will create an open world economy and promote economic globalization. This is something the Western world has dangled to the developing world for decades with no fruition.The G7 release was followed by a warning from both the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, who recently urged caution with Chinese loans. According to the two multilateral lenders, increased lending by China to developing nations could sow the seeds of a global economic crisis.The comments were provoked by what they observed as BRI-motivated Chinese lending throughout the developing world, particularly to resource-rich nations.Many economic experts however say that China's replication of the Silk Road will be highly productive, and have a positive impact on the global economy. What makes BRI attractive is also China's promise to maintain a policy of non-interference in the internal governance of its partners.The massive amount of money that China is planning to invest in this initiative shows how seriously the country is ready to follow through Xi Jinping's October 2013 vision on connectivity and cooperation. China is putting into practice both its mutual benefit and win-win cooperation policies in establishing BRI.East Africa forms an integral part of BRI through ongoing improvements to local ports and construction of the first motorway in the region. In Kenya the Chinese-funded Standard Gauge Railway, called the "project of the century", has created 50,000 local jobs and boosted the country's economic growth by 1.5 percent.It is agreed that BRI is now the largest platform for international cooperation and public good. To date 123 countries and 29 international organizations have signed BRI agreements with China, which is the greatest sign yet of support and confidence.To support BRI China has promised to fully implement eight major initiatives agreed on during the 2018 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation held in Beijing. These include industrial promotion, infrastructural connectivity, trade facilitation, green development, capacity building, promotion of health care, people-to-people exchange, and peace and security.

                As platforms for accelerating regional integration, more attention must be given to quality of Belt and Road port projects Ports are an integral part of the Belt and Road connectivity. At present, a pattern featuring improved local infrastructure supported by new industrial parks and free trade zones around ports has come into being along the Belt and Road routes. In Southeast Asia, South Asia, Africa, and Europe, this pattern, built by Chinese companies, facilitates logistics and the free flow of goods. As a result, trade has been promoted both on a regional and a global scale. The importance of ports in promoting trade along the Belt and Road routes is testified to in a series of Chinese government documents, including the 2015 Action Plan on the Belt and Road Initiative and the 2017 Vision for Maritime Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative, which make it clear that building ports overseas was a goal. Actually, Chinese companies began investing in overseas ports before the Belt and Road Initiative was proposed in 2013. But after the proposals for the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road were made, there was a surge both in the number of Chinese investors and an improvement in the scale and depth of the investment. Spurred by favorable policies, at the end of 2018, Chinese companies were involved in the construction and operation of 42 ports in 34 countries, and the number is growing. At the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation held at the end of April this year, the topic of overseas port investment attracted much attention and brought about more new achievements. For example, a memorandum of understanding on strategic cooperation was signed between the Liangjiang New Area of Chongqing and the Port of Duisburg in Germany. The two parties aim to work hand-in-hand in the planning and operation of logistics and hubs of communications in both areas. A framework agreement for strategic cooperation to revamp the old port in the downtown of Djibouti City was signed by China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone Holdings Co Ltd, China Merchants Port Holdings Co Ltd and the Great Horn Investment Holdings of Djibouti. Zhejiang Seaport signed an MOU with PT Pelindo I in Indonesia, in which they agreed to codevelop the Kuala Tanjung Port, and Ningbo Zhoushan Port Company signed an MOU on long-term friendly cooperation with PT Pelindo II in Indonesia. But on the other hand, problems in some China-invested ports are also becoming prominent, some of which have even misled the overall evaluation of the Belt and Road Initiative. A report on the strategic analysis of China's overseas port program was released by Grandview Institute on April 11, which surveyed 42 China-invested overseas port projects including the Hambantota Deep Sea Port, Gwadar Port, Djibouti Port, Port Darwin and the Port of Piraeus, and assessed the problems and risks during the investment, construction and operation stages. The report noted that external risks, especially security issues and cultural conflicts, need to be handled properly so Chinese workers can cooperate with the locals. Besides, problems around maintenance and operations have also arisen from time to time. For example, the classic model of Port-Park-City, which is widely used in China, cannot be simply copied and pasted overseas. Other problems such as the unsustainability of a project due to too much debt or the environmental issues caused by the construction also influence local people's understanding of the projects. Now, as the Belt and Road Initiative has entered a new stage, all parties have new expectations and higher requirements for port cooperation. The joint communique issued at the Second Belt and Road Forum on International Cooperation says: "We support the development of a sustainable blue economy and call for further strengthening of maritime connectivity and international maritime cooperation, including cooperation among ports and in shipping industries, while managing marine and coastal ecosystems in a sustainable manner." The key to achieving this goal lies in the following aspects. First, summarizing China's experiences in port development so far and adjusting its policies to local conditions. In the new era, ports act as a platform for opening logistics channels, reducing transaction costs and accelerating regional economic integration. Through the construction and operation of ports, China should empower the local people to develop their economy. Second, we should pay more attention to the quality of the projects. Since the inception of the Belt and Road Initiative, some Chinese enterprises advanced in a rash manner in order to get the right to invest and operate, but they underestimated the debt risks, thus leaving many operational problems. In the next stage, the relationship between strategic investment and business operation must be well handled to improve the sustainability of the projects. Third, more attention should be paid to the localized commercial operation of the ports. We need to strengthen ties with local organizations and social institutions, involve more local workers in the projects, absorb more local talent at the managerial level, and gain the support and trust of local people through charity or other social welfare work, as an effort to reduce our investment risk and facilitate China's trade and commerce there.

The gazelle species, on the brink of extinction, is superbly adapted to the wild habitat of dry deserts in high temperatures that would kill most mammals.A documentary about the wild release of 500 scimitar-horned oryx, the largest number for a mammal species to date, drew its first audiences in Asia on Thursday at the Zayed Center for Arabic Language and Islamic Studies of Beijing Foreign Studies University.Under the patronage of Ali Obaid Al Dhaheri, ambassador of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in China, the Asian premier won sustained applause from the audience and offered thoughtful reflections on global collective efforts, especially the enhanced cooperation between China and UAE, to protect endangered wildlife.The documentary, Back to Wild, recorded the past decade of international efforts that finally had a total number of 500 scimitar-horned oryx – commonly seen through North and Central Africa in the past – roaming wild and free once more.The gazelle species, named for their magnificent curved horns, went extinct in the 1990s, due to unregulated hunting, loss of habitat and lack of resources for conservation, according to Razan Khalifa Al Mubarak, secretary-general of the Environment Agency-Abu Dhabi.The agency then spearheaded an initiative, called the Scimitar-horned Oryx Reintroduction, in partnership with the UAE, Africa, Europe and the US, with an aim to preserve the species through an approach to conservation involving reintroduction to the wild. It was in part inspired by the UAE's late founding father Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who personally took care of a herd of oryx.With concerted efforts, the campaign of collecting and airlifting the endangered species to an isolated natural reserve in Chad started several years ago. It finally released a healthy and viable population of up to 500 scimitar-horned oryx to the Oadi Rime-oadi Achim Game Reserve, with an area of 77,950 square kilometers, achieving the initial target.Technology and data helped researchers closely monitor the oryx's physical condition, the documentary showed. Every single oryx initially released to the wild wore a GPS collar, transmitting real-time location data via satellite.The successful reintroduction project became an exemplar in international cooperation for wildlife conservation, according to a panel discussion regarding wildlife conservation and environmental protection.Documentary provokes reflections on wildlife protectionIt is imperative for countries across the world to coordinate on preserving wildlife, given that the longitudinal animal migrations involve different countries and regions, said Si Ping, head of the international cooperation office under the China Wildlife Conservation Association."Multinational cooperation will also play a vital role in cracking down on wildlife-related smuggling, especially in the digital age when online transactions have boosted wildlife smuggling," Si added.Zhou Jinfeng, secretary-general of China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, shared China's experiences in largely increasing the population of wild Pere David's deer by reintroducing the species to natural reserves along the Yangtze River.Zhou said he was deeply touched by the documentary on preserving the oryx, which led him to think more deeply about how to better conserve wildlife and the diversity of the global ecosystem. "I am looking forward to visiting the reserve in Chad, and creating more opportunities for mutual learning and cooperation in this field," said Zhou.The documentary was produced by Image Nation Abu Dhabi, one of the leading media outlets in the Middle East. "This film not only raised awareness about preserving endangered animals through reintroduction approaches, but also demonstrated the necessity of globally coordinating efforts to achieve the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development," said a Chinese student surnamed Wang, who is studying the Arab language at Beijing Foreign Studies University.Regarding future work in wildlife protection, Ambassador Ali Obaid Al Dhaheri said the UAE will stand with countries like China on initiatives including the Green Development Coalition, which is part of the Belt and Road Initiative.

                Horn of Africa loses youths to war-torn Yemen
            </a>
            <p>
                Lack of economic opportunities has driven thousands of young adults from the Horn of Africa to war-torn Yemen, according to a recent study by the International Organization for Migration, or IOM.In the first five months of the year, nearly 200,000 people moved to the Arabian peninsula country, exposing them to deadly perils along migration routes across the Horn of Africa and the Red Sea.About 95 percent of the migrants tracked through IOM's Displacement Tracking Matrix in the region were Ethiopians, followed by Somalis, signaling that poverty and instability continue to be the major push and pull factors.Ethiopia has recorded the fastest economic growth in Africa, at an annual rate of nearly 10 percent for the last decade. But the trends also show that Ethiopians have yet to feel a trickle-down effect. Over the recent past, the government has embarked on large investments in infrastructure and manufacturing zones.Somalia does not have a stable government with the UN-backed transitional government fighting with al-Shabaab extremists for control.The upsurge in this migration over the so-called Eastern route will probably exceed 2018 and 2017 arrival numbers in Yemen. In 2018, an estimated 160,000 migrants crossed over to Yemen while only 100,000 migrants reached the Arab Peninsula in 2017. This trend recorded a 50 percent year-on-year rise, according to IOM, an intergovernmental organization related to the United Nations.Located at the cusp of two continents, Yemen historically has been an origin, transit and destination country for migrants."The majority of these migrants are adult males who are traveling for economic reasons. They seek better lives for themselves, work, security and new opportunities," said Asman Saeed from the Regional Data Hub located at the IOM Regional Office for East and Horn of Africa.In 2018, IOM referred to this route as the world's most "youthful" because an estimated 24 percent of the migrants were children. Moreover, from nearly 900,000 movements tracked last year, 28 percent were adult females with four percent were pregnant or lactating women.She further revealed that movement in the Eastern route exceeded migrant numbers crossing to Europe via the Mediterranean Sea from the Horn of Africa. Last year, only 107,216 arrivals were recorded in Italy.Smaller movements were captured along the Southern and Northern routes. The former, which is from the Horn of Africa to the south via east Africa, recorded an increase of 2 percent in movement. Many of these movements were short term, followed by tourism. Economic motives came a distant third trailed by forced movements.The Northern route, which is from the east and Horn of Africa to North Africa and then later by sea also recorded 2 percent of the total movement tracked by the tracking matrix. Last year saw a decrease of 65 percent compared to 2017.Migration along the Horn of Africa route, which refers to movements to and within that region, was mainly due to evacuation from Yemen and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Last year, an estimated 230,000 Ethiopians returned home, with 86 percent reporting that they were returning involuntarily, according to the IOM report.Recent IOM data is based on the assessment from 65 monitoring points in six countries including Somalia, Djibouti and Yemen. The IOM said irregular migration from the Horn of Africa to the Gulf countries has been steadily increasing over the past few years, with many crossing over with the support of smugglers.

                CONCERNS MOUNT FOR CHINESE PANGOLIN
            </a>
            <p>
                Creature threatened by habitat destruction, poaching and smuggling On a late summer evening, the Qingtian County Forestry Department in Zhejiang province received a call from a woman who had found a frightened animal trapped in the center of a busy road amid blaring car horns. "I thought it was a cat, but when I picked it up, it quickly curled into a tight ball about the size of a melon, and I noticed that it was covered in crocodilelike scales," the woman said. Two days later, the local wildlife rescue center collected the animal from the department, confirming that it was a male Chinese pangolin that was about 2 years old. The creature weighed 6 kilograms. It was the fourth time that a Chinese pangolin had been found in the wild in the second quarter of this year. In July, during a sustainable development conference in Beijing, a woman from the China Biodiversity and Conservation Green Development Foundation, whose work involves pangolin conservation, made an eye-catching claim. She announced the "functional extinction" of the Chinese pangolin, since the organization had not observed any of the creatures in the wild for the past three years. The announcement triggered widespread public concern for the mammal. The Chinese pangolin is a shy, elusive and secretive animal whose body is covered in hard, keratin scales. In the past five years, about 50 of the creatures have been found in the wild, nine of them newborns, according to Zeng Yan, an engineer from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Zoology. "This indicated that the species is not functionally extinct - a term used to describe any animal that has lost the ability to reproduce in the wild, or that reports of its existence have not been made in recent years," she said. While experts said the species cannot be labeled "functionally extinct", they believe the Chinese pangolin population is falling significantly and is in urgent need of protection. Wu Shibao, a zoology and ecology professor from South China Normal University in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, who has conducted research into pangolins for years, said the exact Chinese pangolin population remains unknown. "It is very difficult to calculate the current population, as this nocturnal animal usually lives underground during the day and moves from one place to another more than 10 times a year," he said. "But there is no doubt the species will be on the verge of extinction if no further protective measures are introduced". Declining population According to a national wildlife survey conducted by forestry authorities in the 1990s, there were some 60,000 Chinese pangolins in 11 provinces, including Yunnan, Hunan, Guangdong, Sichuan and Zhejiang. However, in recent years, the number has witnessed a sharp decline due to habitat destruction, rampant poaching and smuggling. In 2017, the International Union for Conservation of Nature placed Chinese pangolins on the Red List of Endangered Species, as a team of experts believed that the population had dropped by 90 percent in the previous decade. Smugglers have targeted the animal for its scales, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine as a cure for hangovers, to treat liver conditions and help new mothers to breastfeed. Pangolin meat is also high in nutritional value. The demand for pangolins can be attributed to the high profit to be made from the creatures. A CNN report in 2013 investigated the illegal pangolin trade and found that a poacher could earn $22.50 from a 1-kilogram pangolin. "Sensing danger, pangolins curl themselves into tight balls instinctively. In the wild, this reflex protects them from predators such as bears and large cats. But they have little defense against wildlife traffickers," Wu said. In addition to the threat from poachers, the Chinese pangolin is facing challenges from lost habitat due to environmental pollution, commercial logging and urbanization, Wu said. "All these factors have resulted in the population decline. As the Chinese pangolin only produces one newborn a year, it will take a long time for the species to recover," he said. Response to stress To save a wild species from extinction, breeding in captivity is the preferred option in most cases. But according to Chen Jinping, a researcher from the Guangdong Institute of Applied Biological Resources, as studies on the Chinese pangolin are still at a very early stage, scientists have not even reached a consensus on the species' duration of pregnancy. Moreover, Chen said the pangolin has a very strong response to stress, meaning it easily becomes nervous in captivity. "Their immune system is weaker under heavy stress. Also, their willingness to mate is affected," Chen said. "In the 1990s, some medical companies invested a lot of money on breeding Chinese pangolins in captivity, but the results were disappointing." The decline in the Chinese pangolin population has triggered fears from animal protection groups, not only for the future of the species itself, but also for other pangolins, mostly in Africa and Southeast Asia. According to the wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC, Chinese customs officials cracked 209 pangolin smuggling cases between 2007 and 2016, seizing 35 metric tons of scales, 2,405 live pangolins and 11,419 pangolin body parts. A major proportion of these cases involved the Sunda pangolin that mainly lives in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos, Malaysia and Indonesia. According to the State Forestry and Grassland Administration, all eight pangolin species worldwide are listed in CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) Appendix I, which essentially bans international trade in pangolins and their parts or derivatives. Both the Chinese pangolin and the Sunda pangolin are classified as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. Action to take In 2007, China banned pangolin hunting, and since October has suspended all commercial imports of pangolins and related products. Under the Wild Animal Protection Law, the Chinese pangolin is a national second-class protected species, and trade in its meat is prohibited. An amendment to the law, enacted in 2016, banned the trading of pangolins on the internet. In August, an official from the State Forestry and Grassland Administration said the authorities were considering upgrading protection of the Chinese pangolin to the highest level, due to its population declining in the wild. Wu Zhimin, director of the administration's animal and plant department, said a document to this effect is awaiting central government approval, and the decision will be announced by the end of the year. Meanwhile, Wu said the administration is facing another challenge in pangolin protection. The number of live Sunda pangolins being saved from illegal cross-border trade has posed a heavy financial burden on local wildlife animal rescue and protection centers, most of which lack experience in breeding pangolins in captivity and do not have the budget to house the animals. Under CITES guidelines, nations must send confiscated animals back to the home country, or to a "government-designated rescue center", or other "appropriate" places. But this does not always happen, according to protection advocates, who said it can be expensive or impractical to transport some wild animals to their home country and that some member nations do not have designated rescue centers. Closer to the wild Li Linhai, deputy director of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration Wild Animal Management Office, said, "The administration is hearing opinions from experts who are considering releasing the Sunda pangolins into the wild in China as a possible solution." Meng Zhibin, associate researcher from the Chinese Academy of Science's Institute of Zoology, said there is no evidence to show that the Sunda pangolin originated in China. Releasing them into the wild in China might pose a risk to other species. "Cross-fertilization of the Sunda pangolin and Chinese pangolin is also likely to cause physical degradation of the two species," he said. "If the authorities approve the release, this should only be carried out as a pilot program within a certain area to avoid potential risks to local wildlife species or the environment." Before any such pilot program is launched, Li said pangolins being saved through anti-trafficking actions must remain in wildlife rescue centers - most of them in cages. In Guangdong, wildlife experts are trying to provide more pangolin-friendly homes for the animals seized from smugglers. Chen, from the Guangdong Institute of Applied Biological Resources, said three major rescue centers in the province have built Sunda pangolin houses, complete with areas for outdoor activities. Some of the houses are big enough for several pangolins, enabling them to form communities. "We are calling for the authorities to release a national standard for pangolin preservation and protection work, or to build several regional pangolin care and rescue centers. This would be very helpful in boosting the pangolin survival rate and guaranteeing their welfare while they are bred in captivity before being released into the wild," Chen said. yangwanli@chinadaily.com.cn  A total of 216 pangolin bodies and 66 kilograms of the animals' scales were seized last year in Changsha, Hunan province, together with other wild species threatened by extinction.Zhou Mian/xinhua 1.
