                                      Regulators worldwide may recertify the Boeing 737 Max jet for commercial service at different times, creating a staggered return of the plane and underscoring a lack of trust in the US Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, an industry expert said.              In the past, overseas regulators have generally followed the lead of the FAA and accepted its findings, but that may change after crashes of the two Max jets that killed a total of 346.                                                      "The FAA has a transparent and collaborative relationship with other civil aviation authorities as we continue our review of changes to software on the Boeing 737 Max," the agency said in a statement

At the time, Assange denied the accusations but refused to be questioned in Sweden, fearing that Sweden would then extradite him to the US to face conspiracy charges
