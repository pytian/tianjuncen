                Moscow Zoo head says poised to host pandas from China
            </a>
            <p>
                MOSCOW - The Moscow Zoo has made all preparations to host a pair of giant pandas from China for 15 years or longer in a scientific program, its General Director Svetlana Akulova has said."The existing enclosure has been rebuilt to meet new requirements," she told Xinhua recently as the zoo was preparing to receive Ruyi, a male panda, and Dingding, a female one, on April 29.The complex gets divided so as to house a female and a male, with either division including an indoor and an outdoor space. Both spaces are equipped with swimming pools, drinking bowls and a variety of entertainment tools for the bears to rest and play."I think that they will be very active, so we have done everything possible. They will have a large number of toys made of natural materials, a large number of wooden structures, trees and everything needed for this type of animal," she said.The zoo has created a special Chinese fauna department. It will first put the pandas in quarantine upon their arrival before opening the enclosure to the public.According to an agreement, two employees from China will stay in the zoo for at least 120 days annually during all the 15 years, supervising and training Russian staff and monitoring how they fulfill obligations.Akulova believes the pandas will enjoy the climate in Moscow as in summer it would not be rather hot or humid while in winter the temperature does not drop too low and they could have rolls in snow.She said the zoo will provide the pandas with all the nutrition they need. "We know that pandas love carrots. But they cannot have them in large quantities, only as a treat. They love pancakes. We have specially purchased a stove to bake pancakes with various additives."It has ordered bamboo from China's southwestern province of Sichuan where the pandas were born. As they grow up, the zoo may offer bamboo from Crimea or Sochi of Russia to see if they acquire a taste of it."The juiciness of bamboo depends on the climate and altitude where it grows. Therefore, all these indicators will be considered directly here as this is also part of the scientific work," Akulova said.Akulova called the pandas "a symbol of friendship" between the two peoples as Russia and China celebrate the 70th anniversary of their diplomatic ties this year.A large group of scientists, zoologists and keepers, according to her, will participate in the scientific program. They plan to do much work, including solving the riddle why this animal species has chosen black and white colors."If our Chinese colleagues consider that we have managed to implement this program adequately and it will show a positive result, I think the contract may be extended," she said.Initially, the zoo was offered two pairs to choose from and it selected the younger one in hope that they could form a couple and produce healthy offspring."The whole department, which will take care of these animals, had month-long training," Akulova said.A competition soon will be announced to collect Russian names for the pandas from all Russians, with a winner decided next month."When I posted photos or wrote on social networks about these animals, I received a lot of questions, and in general people of Russia demonstrated a high interest," she said."Not many Russians can afford a trip to China, and we give to our Russian citizens and guests of the capital an opportunity to come and see this rare, endangered animal species."

            <p>
                CHENGDU - A pair of giant pandas took off in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, in a plane bound for Moscow on Monday.Chinese researchers held a send-off ceremony for a pair of giant pandas, Ru Yi and Ding Ding, who will stay in Moscow for a 15-year collaborative research. This is the second time a pair of giant pandas from Sichuan have been sent to Moscow. In 1957, a pair of giant pandas from Baoxing County arrived at the Moscow Zoo.

                Lovely pandas add more liveliness into China-Russia friendship
            </a>
            <p>
                "I heard groups of children passing by and shouting: 'Pandas! Pandas!' They want to see them as soon as possible," said Svetlana Akulova, director general of the Moscow Zoo.She was standing in a newly built panda house. Behind her are soundproofed windows. Looking through the windows, one can see two giant pandas, each playing in its own room.Inside the house are wooden climbers, swimming pools, and recreational toys among other things, all intended to create a comfortable and healthy living environment for the new ambassadors of China-Russia friendship.The pair, 3-year-old male Ru Yi and 2-year-old female Ding Ding, arrived in Moscow in late April from China's southwestern province of Sichuan. They will start a new life and hopefully a family in the Russian capital.They were formally handed over to Russia for a 15-year joint research program recently at an opening ceremony for the panda house, which was attended by visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin."The Moscow Zoo has built a panda house fully meeting the requirements to keep the animals," Akulova said.The red lanterns strongly suggest a Chinese flavor, in addition to Chinese ink landscape paintings. In the yard, the green bamboo groves are panda necessities.As part of their old diet, fresh bamboo and bamboo shoots are delivered every week from Sichuan, and kept fresh and prepared in special rooms with large freezers.Keeping the pandas healthy is an important task, and currently panda keeper Wang Pingfeng and vet He Ming from the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda are here to give a hand.Wang said several Russian workers at the zoo are trained to take care of the pandas and are able to conduct comprehensive physical examinations."The pandas are getting used to the new environment and their new life here," Wang said, adding that the local weather is drier than what the pandas are accustomed to.Muscovites have shown great interest in the panda pair, and the zoo expects huge inflows of visitors after the panda house is open to the public."These animals are really unique," said a 33-year-old visitor to the Moscow Zoo who gave her name as Anastasia. "I'm sure all people in Moscow would like to come to see the pandas."Many see the pandas' arrival as symbol of the solid friendship between China and Russia, especially since it coincides with the 70th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic relations."I think it's a very good sign of friendship, because animals are always associated with friendship, kindness and openness. Plus in this case, there will be serious research work. Nobody knows how well they will live here and how it can affect their ability to breed," said a visitor from St. Petersburg who called herself Osipova.The joint research work on the life of Ru Yi and Ding Ding at the Moscow Zoo in the next 15 years under a bilateral agreement aims to bolster efforts on both sides to protect endangered species and biodiversity."We are very proud of our part in the initiative aimed at protecting nature and in the study of rare animal species like the giant panda. It is one of the most important scientific activities by the zoo," Akulova noted.Studies on multiple topics will be carried out according to a joint working plan. A large team of scientists, zoologists and keepers is involved in the joint mission."I hope that our Ding Ding and Ru Yi will provide us with plenty of scientific findings," said Akulova.In her eyes, the timing that this year marks the 70th anniversary of bilateral diplomatic relations makes the giant panda research program more meaningful."We have to remember that all these can happen partly thanks to the friendship between our peoples, and thanks to the wisdom of our leaders," Akulova added."I hope that year after year our friendship will become stronger and stronger," she added. "And I hope that we will be able to write more than one chapter of scientific research on this wonderful animal."Xinhua

                Moscow Zoo launches live webcast of pandas

            <p>
                MOSCOW - The Moscow Zoo on Monday launched on its website an around-the-clock live broadcast of two giant pandas that arrived from China in late April for a 15-year scientific program.The zoo has installed eight cameras in the enclosure so that Ru Yi, a three-year-old male, and Ding Ding, a two-year-old female, can be observed from different angles."To get acquainted with the unusual habits of the pandas, it is not enough to spend the whole day at their enclosure," General Director of the Moscow Zoo Svetlana Akulova said on the Moscow mayor's website."Live webcast will help correct this situation. Thanks to it, everyone can watch the pandas at different times of the day," she added.The pandas from Southwest China's Sichuan province will spend 15 years at the Moscow Zoo as part of a collaborative research program in accordance with an agreement signed between the Moscow Zoo and the China Wildlife Conservation Association in February.
