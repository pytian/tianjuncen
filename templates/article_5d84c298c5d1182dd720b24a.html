                Guangxi a key cog in success of trade route
            </a>
            <p>
                Land-sea trade corridor greatly reduces travel time of seaward exports from western and central China, officials with the province say The Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region has developed into a crucial hub of the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor as a result of blossoming cooperation with China's inland regions and neighboring countries. The new land-sea corridor is an international trade and logistics passageway jointly built by western Chinese provinces and Southeast Asian countries under the framework of the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Demonstration Initiative on Strategic Connectivity, an agreement signed between the Chinese and Singaporean governments in November 2015. With Chongqing municipality serving as one of its transportation hubs, the corridor uses ports in Guangxi's Beibu Gulf coasts to provide access to Singapore and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations members by sea, and links with China-Europe freight trains coming from many western Chinese cities before heading to Central Asia, South Asia and Europe.  Clockwise from top: Fangchenggang has one of the busiest ports in the Beibu Gulf region. The Hengyang-Liuzhou High-Speed Railway has slashed the travel time between Guangxi and the central part of China. Nanning Comprehensive Bonded Area is an important part of the land-sea trade corridor. Photos Provided to China DailyIn August 2017, Guangxi, Chongqing, Guizhou province and Gansu province signed agreements to cooperate in developing the corridor. Qinghai province and the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region came on board in June and November 2018. Yunnan province and the Ningxia Hui autonomous region were the latest regions to join the program. The land-sea corridor can greatly shorten the travel distance of seaward exports from China's western and even central region, according to Guangxi's officials. They said exports from Chongqing, for instance, are traditionally shipped via the Yangtze to Shanghai and then transshipped to larger vessels. The trip on the 1,800-kilometer Yangtze waterway takes more than 10 days. In contrast, it takes only two days to transport Chongqing's cargoes to Beibu Gulf via railway. Guangxi also offers the shortest passageway for western China's freight to ASEAN, and other regions in the world through the Malacca shipping route. In the past two years, Guangxi has promoted cooperation with other Chinese regions and neighboring countries engaged in this initiative. These include agreements for implementation measures between Guangxi and other Chinese regions, as well as a memorandum between Guangxi regional government and the Ministry of Trade and Industry of Singapore. In addition, Guangxi also held promotional events in Singapore in May and in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in July. A number of key projects have been carried out in Guangxi to improve its land and sea transportation and information interconnectivity with its neighboring regions and countries. One of the landmark projects under the new land-sea corridor initiative is the Qinzhou Railway Container Central Station. Construction of its first phase, which covers an area of about 85 hectares, began in July 2017. According to Wei Ran, deputy chief of the Beibu Gulf affairs office at the regional government of Guangxi, the station has a designed annual handling capacity of 1.05 million containers, compared with the city's annual throughput of 150,000 railway containers before the operation of the new station. The central station was officially put into operation on June 30, as a China-Europe freight train loaded with 70 container cargoes departed from Qinzhou, to Duisburg, Germany. Construction of another key project for railway transportation, the first phase of Nanning International Railway Port, was completed at the end of last month. Construction of other transportation and logistics facilities, including a railway logistics center in the border city of Pingxiang and an expansion project of the Fangchenggang Port, has also been completed. Guangxi will accelerate construction on the Huangtong-Baise Railway, the Hunan-Guangxi Railway's Nanning-Pingxiang section and the Nanning-Kunming Railway's Weishe-Baise section. Qinzhou Port will add a 200,000-metric-ton container terminal and have its eastern shipping lane expanded. More direct freight trains will be launched to connect Chongqing with Beibu Gulf, and more shipping routes will connect Beibu Gulf with ASEAN countries. The China-ASEAN Information Port, which was proposed at the first China-ASEAN Cyberspace Forum in 2014, is a program for internet connectivity, information sharing and cultural exchanges between China and ASEAN members. It features five platforms for infrastructure construction, information sharing, technological cooperation, economic and trade services. According to executives of China-ASEAN Information Harbor Corp, the company that takes charge of the program's operation, the information harbor has made breakthroughs in infrastructure construction and promotion of IT-related businesses in regions involved in the program.

                Sixteenth edition of conference to feature new topics and exhibitions
            </a>
            <p>
                The 16th China-ASEAN Expo, running from Sept 21 to 24 in Nanning, capital of the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, will feature new exhibitions compared to previous sessions, said a local official in charge of the event. Wang Lei, secretary-general of the Secretariat of China-ASEAN Expo, said this year's event will feature five new highlights - a new vision, new hot issues, new business opportunities, new influences and new experiences. Focusing on the China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership Vision 2030, a key document approved at the 21st China-ASEAN leaders' meeting held in Singapore in November 2018, a range of high-level exchange activities will be held during this year's China-ASEAN Expo. Wang said industries prioritized by the Vision 2030, such as trade, investment, industrial capacity cooperation, digital technologies, finance, e-commerce and tourism, will also be highlighted at the expo.  Nanning, capital of the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, is the permanent host city of the China-ASEAN Expo. Wu Zhiyong / For China DailyThe new hot issues to be discussed during the expo will include the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor, China (Guangxi) Pilot Free Trade Zone, further opening-up of China's financial sector, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the China-ASEAN Information Harbor. The China (Guangxi) Pilot Free Trade Zone is among the latest free trade zones in the country, as its general plan was approved by the State Council on Aug 26. The 120-square-kilometer zone covering areas in Nanning, Qinzhou and Chongzuo will offer a new driver for Guangxi's opening-up and create new opportunities for business. To present the business opportunities in China and the 10 ASEAN members, there will be more than 80 trade and investment promotion events at the expo, according to Wang. He added that a development report on the China-ASEAN industrial parks will be released at the expo, helping investors identify their priority fields and ideal destinations for investment. Wang noted this year's expo will further extend its influence with several events scheduled for the media industry in China and ASEAN members. With the application of new information and digital technologies, Wang said this year's event is set to offer new experiences to visitors. He said the new venue for exhibitions, the Guangxi Agricultural Convention and Exhibition Center, will be equipped with more digital facilities. New applications to be used at the venue include an online trade and investment matching system and a WeChat app to help exhibitors and visitors to register and search for event information. Wang said this year's event is not limited to the China-ASEAN category, but covers a range of countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative. For instance, Poland is invited to be the special partner of the event. Wang said the host region of Guangxi expects to use this event to display its achievements in its reform and opening-up and opportunities in trade and investment. "We hope the China-ASEAN Expo will become a platform not only for business cooperation, but also for cultural and people-to-people exchanges," Wang said. He predicted the expo will become a more professional and internationalized platform in the near future, as the organizers are drafting a new five-year plan to upgrade the event.

                HK's economic future linked with mainland
            </a>
            <p>
                The three months of demonstrations, frequently marked by violence, in Hong Kong have dealt a serious blow to its economy, especially the tourism and retail sectors. Latest statistics show the number of tourists visiting Hong Kong in August reduced by about 2.4 million, a decline of nearly 40 percent year-on-year, and caused an economic loss of about 12 billion yuan ($1.69 billion). Other sectors, too, have suffered damage. For instance, some logistics companies' turnover has declined 50 percent in recent months. And in the first half of August, the passenger and freight volumes of Hong Kong International Airport declined 11 percent and 14 percent year-on-year. Logistics, finance, tourism, retail and special services are pillar industries of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The trade and logistics sectors account for 21 percent of Hong Kong's GDP and employ about 25 percent of its workforce. The SAR's gross domestic product has been declining since the US launched a trade war against China, and the demonstrations have further worsened the situation. Many even fear the SAR's economy could step into technical recession. Worse, the demonstrations' direct effect on Hong Kong's pillar industries might spread to other sectors. In the short term, Hong Kong's tourism industry has suffered huge losses, affecting more than 250,000 employees in the tourism sector and upstream-downstream industries, and their families. But in the long run, the real victims of a turbulent society and sluggish economy will be the youths many of whom have taken part in the three-month-long demonstrations. Unbalanced internal economic structure, especially the ever-widening wealth gap between the rich and the poor in Hong Kong, is what led to the violent demonstrations. Hong Kong's Gini coefficient, an indicator of the wealth gap between the rich and the poor, increased from 0.43 in 1971 to 0.54 in 2016. In fact, the number of impoverished people in Hong Kong is more than 1 million in a city of just 7 million. Despite being Hong Kong's second pillar industry, the financial sector employs just 5.5 percent of its total population, although it generates about 17.7 percent of its GDP. Since very few people can get employment in the high-income financial sector, Hong Kong's youths, in general, have become pessimistic about their career prospects and social upward mobility. Limited opportunities in the high-income sectors have something to do with Hong Kong's industrial structure. The city neglected the technology industry's development during the Third Industrial Revolution, focusing instead on the real estate and financial sectors. The Cyberport project, which many Hong Kong residents believed would expedite the development of the high-tech industry, eventually became a real estate project. And by failing to seize the precious development opportunities, Hong Kong deprived the young generation of a brighter future. The Chinese mainland has played a crucial role in maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial hub. More than 70 percent of the capital in Hong Kong's stock market and over 60 percent of its listed companies are from the mainland. Mobility and safety is crucial for any offshore financial center, which means political and social instability could be fatal to Hong Kong's financial sector. The violent demonstrations have already damaged Hong Kong's image as an international financial hub, and if the social instability continues any longer, capital will flow out of the city to other global financial centers, causing unbearable loss to its economy. The SAR government has waived some charges and rents to boost the economy in the short term. But in the l ong run, it should make efforts to reunite the society by introducing patriotic elements in school and college syllabuses. Also, it should strengthen industrial regulations and social supervision to regain its reputation. Learning from the advanced systems and experiences of other economies is crucial for an economy's development and prosperity. The mainland did so and developed at an unprecedented pace. As such, Hong Kong should learn from both the mainland and other economies in order to not only boost its economy but also expedite social development. And it should actively participate in the construction of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and integrate its economy with that of the mainland to regain its advantages.

                Hiddink dismissed as coach of China's Olympic team
            </a>
            <p>
                The Chinese Football Association (CFA) has appointed Hao Wei as the executive coach of the Chinese Olympic men's team when a four-member group was announced to be set up here on Thursday in charge of the Olympic qualifiers.The four-member group includes CFA vice president Gao Hongbo as well as the 43-year-old Hao, former head coach of the Chinese women's team, with the absentee of current head coach Guus Hiddink."Due to the ineffective Olympic qualification preparation, the CFA decides to establish a new group fully in charge of the training and match preparations of the Chinese Olympic team," said a statement released by the Chinese football governing body on Thursday.Last September, the 71-year-old Hiddink was appointed to be the head coach of the Chinese Olympic team. Despite his illustrious coaching career, the Dutch veteran is far from success in China as he only led to four wins out of the 12 official matches. Skepticism emerged after China lost to Vietnam 2-0 at home earlier this month.From the Olympic Qualifiers to kick off in Thailand four months later, China hopes to get one of the three Asian tickets for Tokyo.

                TEPCO trio cleared over Fukushima
            </a>
            <p>
                Court finds ex-executives not guilty of negligence relating to nuclear disasterThree former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company, or TEPCO, were acquitted on Thursday on charges of failing to prevent the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, meaning no one will be held criminally responsible for the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.In a much-anticipated verdict, the Tokyo District Court ruled that former TEPCO chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata, 79, and former vice-presidents Ichiro Takekuro, 73, and Sakae Muto, 69, were not guilty of professional negligence resulting in death and injury when the March 2011 nuclear accident was triggered by a tsunami.They had argued that they could not have foreseen the massive tsunami that crippled the Fukushima Daiichi power plant and caused core meltdowns."It would be impossible to operate a nuclear plant if operators are obliged to predict every possibility about a tsunami and take necessary measures," presiding judge Kenichi Nagafuchi said in handing down the ruling.Prosecutors had accused the former executives of failing to implement tsunami countermeasures, leading to the deaths of 44 people during or after their evacuations from hospitals in the area.A five-year prison term for each of the defendants was sought by the prosecutors, who claimed the executives could have prevented the nuclear disaster if they had fulfilled their responsibilities to collect information and implement safety measures.In response, the defendants had all pleaded not guilty to the charges of professional negligence, saying that the data available to them before the disaster was unreliable."It is difficult to deal with issues that are uncertain and obscure," Takekuro said during the trial.After the ruling, TEPCO released a statement but refused to comment further on the issue."We once again offer our sincerest apologies for causing great trouble and worries to many people, including people in Fukushima prefecture," the statement said, adding that TEPCO will "put all efforts" into Fukushima's reconstruction and pay compensation for damages."We are determined to reinforce security measures at nuclear power plants," the company added.However, the ruling rekindled the anger among protesters who had gathered outside the court and many were dismissive of the TEPCO statement."It's totally unacceptable. Our years-long efforts have been wasted," one of them told China Daily. The woman, who declined to give her name, said she had traveled from Fukushima to hear the ruling.Before the court case that led to the ruling, prosecutors had twice declined to press criminal charges against the former TEPCO executives, claiming there were only slim prospects for success. However, an independent panel of citizens later ruled against them and forced them to pursue a prosecution; the trial started in June 2017.On March 11, 2011, a magnitude-9.0 earthquake off Japan's northeast coast triggered the enormous tsunami that overwhelmed TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, resulting in meltdowns and hydrogen explosions that spewed radiation into the atmosphere and forced mass evacuations.The Japanese government estimated in 2016 that ongoing cleanup work from the accident would cost 21.5 trillion yen ($198.3 billion). However, a study released this year by the Japan Center for Economic Research said the bill could reach $749 billion.

                Discounts, free admission set for some tourist sites on National Day
            </a>
            <p>
                To celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a series of scenic spots and parks across the country will cut their ticket prices or even offer free admission.In Beijing, some renowned parks, including Tiantan (Temple of Heaven) Park, the Summer Palace, Beijing Zoo, Taoranting Park, Badachu Park, Ditan Park, Chaoyang Park, Beijing International Sculpture Park and Beijing Garden Expo Park, will open to public for free on Oct 1.But citizens and tourists still need tickets to visit these attractions. Tickets can be reserved through an attraction's official website, WeChat account or official app, and then exchange tickets at designated sites.Other than the capital city, the charge for a number of scenic spots across the country will be reduced, according to local authorities in some popular tourist destinations, such as East China's Zhejiang and Shandong provinces and Central China's Henan and Hunan provinces.In Zhejiang's Grand Buddha Temple scenic spot, a 4A level tourist destination, for example, the ticket price will be cut down from 100 yuan ($14.10) to 80 yuan, starting on Sept 30, a day before National Day.In Henan province, the provincial development and reform department recently asked relevant authorities to step up efforts to launch price reduction programs for some 4A- and 5A-level scenic areas before National Day.In recent years, the National Development and Reform Commission has issued a number of papers urging governments at all levels to lower ticket prices to benefit the public and encourage the boom in the tourism industry, according to China National Radio.

                Japan's Abe vows to reform social security system amid rising demographic crisis
            </a>
            <p>
                TOKYO - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday expressed his commitment to reforming the nation's social security system as the country is increasingly grappling with a demographic crisis as the population here rapidly ages and shrinks to the detriment of the economy."Reform toward social security for all generations is the biggest challenge. We will consider sustainable reforms for the entire social security system," the Japanese leader told a panel charged with dealing with the issue at their first meeting.One of the government's aims has been to encourage senior citizens to actively contribute to society by working for longer, which means they will still be eligible to contribute taxes to help trim the ballooning social welfare costs the government is and will have to cover, more so in the years to come.One scheme under the proposed social security reforms initiative is to incentivize Japanese businesses to hire, or allow those who wish to do so, to work or to continue working up until the age of 70.Reducing or ditching the system that lowers pension allocations for people who are earning a certain amount, has also been an idea floated to encourage businesses and seniors to begin to revamp the workforce and extend participation by seniors.The proposals come as social welfare expenses, which span public pensions and medical costs among others, are set to significantly increase from 2022, as postwar baby boomers turn 75 years old or older.At the end of August, the Japanese government ministries and agencies' budget requests for the next fiscal year hit a record high of close to 105 trillion yen (around $972.82 billion), government officials said, owing to the need to finance ballooning social welfare costs and other spending plans.The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has requested a budget of 31.90 trillion yen ($295.55 billion), a new record high and a 2.5-percent increase from the previous budget, as spending on social security is expected to rocket to more than 32 trillion yen ($296.48 billion), up by about 600 billion yen ($5.55 billion).Amid the record-high requests, the Japanese government also has to contend with a planned tax hike in October from 8 percent to 10 percent.Japan's economy plunged into recession when the government raised the tax to 8 percent from five percent in 2014.The budget requests, meanwhile, will be assessed by the Finance Ministry and adjusted as necessary and submitted to the Cabinet Office for approval by the end of the year.The panel charged with tackling the demographic crisis, comprising 16 people from ministerial, business and academic backgrounds, will compile a report on how to deal with the issue in two stages, with an interim report due before the end of the year and the final deliverable by the summer of 2020.
