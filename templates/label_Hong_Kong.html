                            Since too many radical protesters have been released on bail within hours of being detained under the current Hong Kong law, it is necessary and urgent to address the issue using legal means to remove their masks. And the violent protester was, ironically, identified as a 25-year-old civil servant working for Hong Kong customs, giving rise to a heated debate on whether the SAR should have a special law banning protesters from covering their faces with masks.There are enough reasons to believe such a law would be backed by public opinion, because it is already a consensus among the sane elements in the city that the rule of law must be safeguarded by putting an end to the violence in the city

                             It's simply normal people doing their best for Hong Kong, and making mistakes in judgment and action just as the protesters admit having done at the airport.Anybody who truly cares about Hong Kong will never take money in order to either "show up" for a protest, or perpetrate any form of violence.

                             It is also important to note that the "one country, two systems" pledge to which China committed itself after Hong Kong was handed over to it by the United Kingdom in 1997, forms part of the rationale for what the protesters argue is China's encroachment on Hong Kong's high-level autonomy. Thus, China's position to what is happening in Hong Kong is deeply steeped in historical context and China's role in promoting sovereignty of nations, free of foreign interference.China's recent history and policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries make foreign meddling in Hong Kong affairs extremely unpalatable The protests in Hong Kong, now in their third month, must be an encouraging index of sovereign ambitions to China's detractors and competitors

                            Investors might ask this question: why don't we compare the valuation to 2008? Isn't the end of 2008, when the global financial crisis was growling, supposed to have the lowest historical valuation? Fact is, the valuation of the Hong Kong market in 2008 was even higher than the valley that appeared in February 2016. Although P/E ratio is more frequently cited in financial analysis, the volatility of earning, as it fluctuates from the top of the business cycle to the bottom, makes it unfit for a comparison that is made across many years.Depending on which gauge you use to value the market, valuations are either at the lowest level in many years or at least close to the lowest level of the past few decades

China is also constantly introducing new policies and measures to facilitate Hong Kong people's work, studies and lives on the Chinese mainland. Without the strong support from the motherland, Hong Kong would not be self-sufficient in food, clothing, housing and transportation, let alone become an international financial, trade and shipping center or an international metropolis full of vitality and freedom

In the first 10 days of the month, merely 15 tour groups from the Chinese mainland visited Hong Kong, down 90 percent compared with the same period of last year, according to the figures released by the Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong

In other words, how does Washington justify its double standards when it comes to street violence in the US and Hong Kong?The UK government has always been poking its nose into Hong Kong affairs.On June 19, the Speaker of US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, a longtime critic of China's human rights record, called the mass demonstrations in Hong Kong "a beautiful sight to behold", despite the fact that the "beautiful sight" soon turned into a freak show of extreme actions that rocked the global financial hub for the following two months

                            Although the airline has put 40 crew members on a "duty to be assigned" list and introduced a new policy requiring flight crew to conduct even stricter checks on flights every 60 minutes to ensure complete security, there is still enough reason for the public to be worried about security on Cathay Pacific flights.In fact, on July 26, the pilot of a Cathay Pacific flight from Tokyo to Hong Kong, instead of informing passengers about the weather and flight condition, used the public address system to voice his support for the demonstrators, seriously violating work ethics. The airline should also ensure that its employees don't express support for the Hong Kong demonstrations while on duty, for by so doing they would not only break service rules but also could compromise flight security

Instead, they exploited the unrest in Hong Kong by expressing concern over democracy and for the law-breaking protesters, while trying to discredit China by saying the country is preparing to break away from the framework that established the SAR and will take action, military ones if needed, to restore law and order in Hong Kong. Despite the fact that he expressed support for the SAR's high degree of autonomy under the "one country, two systems" principle and acknowledged that the protests were "not all peaceful", he went on to suggest that there was a "need to find a way forward through meaningful political dialogue"

So why do some Americans once and again connive at the extreme violent and anti-law acts by radicals in Hong Kong to storm and vandalize LegCo, assault the police and bite off an officer's finger, storm Central Government institutions and deface the national emblem?The spokesperson emphasized that the Central Government firmly supports Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the SAR Government in law-based governance, and the Hong Kong police in fulfilling their duties to protect public order and security in accordance with law. So what right do American politicians have to criticize human rights, freedoms and the rule of law of Hong Kong? They have never spoken out against the absence of human rights and freedoms in the city during the colonial period, nor showed concern about the status and situation of Hong Kong people back then
