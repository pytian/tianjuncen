                Maguire no magical remedy for United's shortcomings
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Last Sunday's Community Shield clash between Manchester City and Liverpool reaffirmed many an educated hunch that last season's title duelists will again be biting at each other's heels at the summit of the English Premier League table this term.The season curtain-raiser is rarely a reliable barometer of battles to come, but both sides put on such a superb show at Wembley that, barring some sensational business before Thursday's transfer deadline, it's safe to expect Pep Guardiola's City slickers will retain their crown, with Jurgen Klopp's relentless Reds not far behind.Of the chasing pack, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur look to have the most convincing claims to third spot.Much is being made of the arrival at United of Harry Maguire, and rightly so.Maguire became something of a cult hero during England's World Cup campaign last summer, with his gladiatorial presence, commanding aerial ability and penchant for a goal or two reminiscent of throwback centerbacks like Tony Adams.Maguire's distribution is not too shabby either, although people should take Guardiola's claim that he can turn United into a title contender with a large pinch of salt.In the All or Nothing documentary of City's 2107-18 league-winning campaign, Guardiola is shown telling Kevin De Bruyne to target the then Leicester man, instructing: "Find that situation because the guy is not fast ... you will find space here."At 80 million pounds ($97 million), Maguire has inherited Virgil van Dijk's mantel as the world's most expensive defender. But regardless of price, Liverpool still possesses the world's best defender in this year's Ballon d'Or favorite van Dijk.

                It all starts with a bucket of water.When Danish theater director Torkild Lindebjerg was invited by the China National Theatre for Children to create a play based on the classic fairy tale, The Little Mermaid, written by the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, that was the first idea that came to his mind."I can still recall going to the seaside as a child with a small bucket, putting on my flippers and goggles. I liked stepping into the water and making noisy sounds with my flippers," says the Lindebjerg after a rehearsal for the play, which will premiere at the theater on July 6. After the opening performance, the play will be staged on the last three weekends of August and on Sept 1.As a director and actor working in theater for more than 40 years, Lindebjerg still found a challenge in turning The Little Mermaid into a play for children, since the original fairy tale is quite a sad story."Hans Christian Andersen's language is poetic and beautiful and I always want to get something out of a play I work on. In the end, the little mermaid sacrifices herself for the man she loves and she gets an eternal soul. That's the ultimate hope in the story," says the director. "The most important thing about theater is that it's a place for children and adults to get together and enjoy an exciting adventure."In March, Lindebjerg came to Beijing to do auditions and five young actresses from the China National Theatre for Children were selected to play the roles of the five mermaid sisters."This is the first time that I have directed a play performed by Chinese actresses, which is interesting and challenging to me," the director says.Lindebjerg has invited his longtime friend, Danish composer Jens Tolsgaard, to write music for the play and another Dane, artist Niels Secher, to be the production's visual designer.Most of the music pieces Tolsgaard has composed for the show are performed using stringed instruments, like guitar, harp and ukulele."I have tried to create two worlds, one above and one under the water, like replicating the sounds of the ocean, the bubbles, the chatting of the little mermaids," says the composer, adding that he started working with the director in 1993.The Little Mermaid is one of the plays which will be staged during the upcoming 9th China Children's Theatre Festival.

The Little Mermaid is one of the plays which will be staged during the upcoming 9th China Children's Theatre Festival. From July 6 to Aug 11, a total of 57 theatrical productions from 14 countries, including the United States, Denmark, Japan and Russia, will be staged with 191 performances at the China National Theatre for Children. Some of the plays will be staged in other Chinese cities, in Hebei and Shandong provinces, as well as in Tianjin. "China Children's Theatre Festival is an annual festival held during the summer vacation. We want to introduce theater to a younger audience, which, we believe, can change their lives," says Yin Xiaodong, head of the China National Theatre for Children. Marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a new original play titled Stars in the Flame will premiere as the opening play for the festival. It tells the story of children who lost their parents during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45). Yin adds that since 2014, the China National Theatre for Children has launched some other programs for the festival besides live performances, such as workshops and forums, which see artists from around the world share their views about plays for children. Co-producing plays is a great way for artists to communicate, learn and experiment, Yin says. Yin initiated the idea of co-producing The Little Mermaid with Henrik Kohler, CEO of Teatercentrum - a theater center in Denmark for children and adolescents and organizer of the Aprilfestival, a theater festival for young audiences. It was Kohler who introduced Yin to Lindebjerg and that's where the project started. Last year, the annual artistic gathering of the International Association of Theatre for Children and Young People came to China for the first time. The Children's Theatre of Charlotte in the US performed an adaptation of China Idiom Stories, one of the most popular productions staged during last year's China Children's Theatre Festival. "The exchange programs opened our minds about making plays for children and those programs prove the idea that theater can change children's lives," Yin says. Child actors from the Malanhua Art School in Singapore will close the festival with the play, Malanhua, which premiered in 1956 and has been a classic play in the China National Theatre for Children's repertoire.  Left: Danish composer Jens Tolsgaard writes music for the Chinese play, The Little Mermaid, adapted from the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen.

                A new musical marking the 70th anniversary of New China's founding will premiere at the China National Theater for Children on July 6.Stars in the Flame tells the story of children who lost their parents during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45).It centers on the Battle of Songhu, also known as the Battle of Shanghai, which was one of the bloodiest conflicts during the war.The work directed by Zhao Yu and composed by Wang Gang is the opening play of the ninth China Children's Theater Festival."We went to Shanghai and Wuhan to learn about the history," Zhao says."It was an unforgettable experience since we've learned many lesser-known stories, especially those about the orphans who fought alongside our soldiers."Another children's play, based on Danish author Hans Christian Andersen's classic fairy tale, The Little Mermaid, will also open the festival on July 6. The Chinese-Danish joint production is directed by Torkild Lindebjerg and composed by Dane Jens Tolsgaard.The festival is staged annually during the summer vacation under the theme, "art changes lives".From July 6 to Aug 11, 57 theatrical productions from 14 countries, including the United States, Japan and Russia, will stage 191 performances at the China National Theater for Children.

                VIRGINIA WATER, England — The European Tour has suspended Thorbjorn Olesen pending the investigation into his arrest on charges of being drunk on an aircraft and assaulting a female passenger while she slept.Olesen is to appear in court on Aug 21 on charges of sexual assault, being drunk on an aircraft and common assault, according to Metropolitan Police in London.The European Tour said Tuesday in a statement the Danish golfer has been suspended pending the outcome of his case. The tour said it would have no further comment while the legal matter proceeds.Olesen was arrested at Heathrow Airport on July 29 upon his return from the World Golf Championships event in Tennessee, where he tied for 27th. He allegedly got into an argument with other passengers in first class and urinated in the aisle.PA Sports reported Monday that Olesen's lawyer released a statement saying the 29-year-old Dane has cooperated fully with police during the investigation.The tour resumes next week with the Czech Masters, followed by the Scandinavian Invitation in Sweden on Aug. 22-25.Olesen has five European Tour victories and made his Ryder Cup debut last year by going 1-1, winning his singles match against Jordan Spieth in a European victory in France.AP

                On my recent weakly trip to my favorite Peking duck restaurant - weakly, as I don't possess the self-discipline to patronize the place just once a week - I finally gave in and chose the recommended beverage from the back of the menu.I am speaking, of course, about pear juice. In the West, pears seldom find themselves in concentrated states, and that's not because we lack focus. Other than strained pears and juices using the curvaceous fruit - other than in ready-made drinks for toddlers - pears are usually consumed fresh in the Occident. They even have trouble making it into pies, or cut up and served with vanilla ice cream, usually losing out to sweeter cousins like peaches or berries.That being said, after putting pear juice on my months-long-in-the-making tab, I sat back to take in the stunning spectacle of table-side carving, which would surely be uncomfortable for the duck if it were still animate.

                COPENHAGEN -- The Chinese Pavilion in Frederiksberg Gardens in the Danish capital was the focus of celebrations for the approaching end of a successful summer season on Saturday afternoon with authentic Chinese food and traditional music.The Danish Palace and Culture Board enlightened guests about the origins of the pavilion, describing the conversion of Frederiksberg Gardens from a baroque garden to that of a romantic landscape garden in 1802, when a Chinese Pavilion was constructed so that King Frederik's IV family could enjoy their afternoon tea.Frederiksberg Gardens is one of the largest greenspaces in Copenhagen. Specially invited guests then took part in a feast of Chinese beverages and Chinese hot pot.Danes, renowned for their appreciation of alcohol, reacted positively to the strength of Chinese whiskeys and aperitifs. The reaction to a variety of ingredients in the Chinese hot pot also came with comments ranging from "very interesting and fresh" to "inspiring."Later, the general public was invited into the pavilion to enjoy traditional Chinese music played by the Chinese Cultural Center in Copenhagen in cooperation with the Danish Music Conservatory's department for Chinese students."Very beautiful," "fascinating," and "pleasant and relaxing," were among the Danish guests' comments on the traditional Chinese music.Besides, many guests praised the traditional look of the pavilion, especially the "wonderful colors."The look can be partly attributed to a donation from the Frederiksberg Foundation which made it possible to buy Chinese porcelain, mainly copies of porcelain with patterns and colors from the beginning of the 19th-century Qing dynasty.
