                YOKOHAMA, Japan - China stormed past Russia 25-22, 25-16, 25-18 here on Monday to record its third straight win at the FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup.China bested Russia in attack (51-39), blocks (8-7), reception (16-9), and especially in serves (7-0), thanks to setter Ding Xia's four aces.Captain Zhu Ting returned to China's starting line-up after she was rested for the match against Cameroon and scored 21 points. Wing spiker Zhang Changning contributed 17."We prepared a lot for this match and I'm happy we could win," Zhang said at a press conference. "I knew I had some shortcomings technically and I paid extra attention to them during training sessions. Today I showed on court what I have been practising, and hope I can keep making progress."Irina Voronkova had a team-high 11 points for Russia, while Nataliya Goncharova, who had 31 points in her team's 3-2 victory over Japan on Sunday, was limited to nine points."We will take this competition as an opportunity to test our own strength as we prepare for the Olympics," said Russia captain Evgeniya Startseva, with both Russia and China having secured places at Tokyo 2020.The match was intense from the beginning with Voronkova firing for Russia while Zhang led China's attacking line. The deadlock was broken after Zhang scored four points in an 8-1 run to help China into an 18-12 lead, and the defending champion claimed the set 25-22 with Yuan Xinyue's spike.China had a dream 8-2 opening in the second set. Although Voronkova and Kseniia Parubets gave China's defense a stern challenge, China was unstoppable, with six players contributing points, and the 25-16 win was sealed after captain Zhu netted four points in a row.The third set became an attacking exhibition for Zhang and Zhu while Gong Xiangyu and Yan Ni were solid in their blocking. The match lost suspense after a 5-0 run saw China surge ahead 18-10 and the Rio Olympic champions triumphed 25-18 in one hour and 18 minutes."It is always tough playing against Russia. Their players are tall and very strong in front of the net. We had careful preparation before this match, and we were good in serve and reception," Chinese coach Lang Ping said.China will play the Dominican Republic on Wednesday while Russia now face South Korea.

                US Congress accused of 'inappropriate' meddling
            </a>
            <p>
                Attempts by the US Congress to interfere in China's internal affairs with the proposed Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act are not only "inappropriate", but also against accepted international practices, a major political party in Hong Kong said on Tuesday. The message was conveyed by members of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, known as the DAB, to Hanscom Smith, the US consul general to Hong Kong and Macao, in a meeting on Tuesday. The DAB is the largest political party in the city's legislature. Starry Lee Wai-king, the DAB's chairwoman, told reporters after the meeting that some US politicians have overreacted to Hong Kong's current situation in supporting the proposed act. The act, reintroduced in the US Congress in June, calls for an annual assessment of Hong Kong's autonomy and, if the results were deemed unfavorable, would allow such restrictions as the suspension of Hong Kong's special trade and economic status with the US. Lee said the proposed act constitutes meddling in China's affairs via US domestic law, which she said is against the common practices of the international community. Holden Chow Ho-ding, who is the DAB's vice-chairman and also a legislator, said the proposed act aims to pressure both the government of the Hong Kong special administrative region and the central government, which could lead to the escalation of tension between China and the US and harm both countries and the rest of the world. According to Lee, Smith said he would convey the DAB's message to the US Congress and the government. What is happening in Hong Kong is not a crisis of human rights but a crisis of rule of law, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. Attacks launched by radical protesters have severely damaged rule of law and security, and it is a top priority to end the violence at an early date, Hua said. Also on Tuesday, Hong Kong SAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said the much-awaited dialogue platform with the Hong Kong public will hold its first session next week. At a media briefing before the weekly Executive Council meeting on Tuesday, Lam said 100 to 200 people from all walks of life would be invited to next week's talk to discuss deep-rooted problems facing the city. The meeting will be open to the media. Lam added that the dialogue platform will adopt other formats, including discussions with randomly selected representatives and in-depth dialogues with small groups of people from various backgrounds. The efforts to build such a platform have received positive feedback from the public, Lam said. Amid the increasingly violent protests, which have roiled the city for more than three months, the dialogues are a key way for society to break the political impasse, she said, adding, "Communication is better than confrontation."
