                Using law to safeguard rule of law

                That the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government has canceled the annual National Day fireworks show on Oct 1 and Hong Kong Jockey Club called off Wednesday's Happy Valley race, both for security reasons, speaks volumes of the damage the violent demonstrations have caused to the city. Under the garb of democracy, signified by the masks they've worn to hide their identity, the insurrectionists have attacked police officers and stations, and tried to break into the Legislative Council building. It is absurd indeed that, despite claiming to fight for "democracy" and "righteousness", they are afraid of revealing their true identity. On Saturday, a middle-aged Hong Kong resident pulled the mask off a radical's face when the latter was showering a group of people singing China's national anthem with invectives. Instead of facing up to the situation, the radical punched the middle-aged man, cutting open his left brow ridge, covered his face with his arm and fled the scene. Immediately after being uploaded online, the video, recorded by a bystander, drew wide attention. And the violent protester was, ironically, identified as a 25-year-old civil servant working for Hong Kong customs, giving rise to a heated debate on whether the SAR should have a special law banning protesters from covering their faces with masks. Masks seem to have put the demonstrators above the law, simply because they cannot be identified. Which has seriously compromised the rule of law in Hong Kong. So it is good to hear Hong Kong Secretary of Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah saying the city's legislators are studying the feasibility of making such a law - which has been on their agenda for three years since the Mong Kok riots took place. In many countries and regions, such a law plays an important role in demarcating the legal and moral boundaries of demonstrators. There are enough reasons to believe such a law would be backed by public opinion, because it is already a consensus among the sane elements in the city that the rule of law must be safeguarded by putting an end to the violence in the city. Since too many radical protesters have been released on bail within hours of being detained under the current Hong Kong law, it is necessary and urgent to address the issue using legal means to remove their masks. Tough times call for tough measures. (China Daily Global 09/20/2019 page11)

                Love it, or hate it, this retiree blazed a trail with budget flights
            </a>
            <p>
                Even though I have only been to Beijing Nanyuan Airport three times, I used to hate it as much as many other passengers taking flights there.There was the lack of subway access, the difficulty in hailing a taxi, the overcrowded terminal building and flight delays.There were few clues that this was an airport in a major metropolis such as Beijing, with many people sitting on concrete steps or small cement pillars in front of the terminal.But every cloud has a silver lining, and the exclusive use of the airport by China United Airlines offered passengers an integrated service, from arriving at the building to takeoff.The average time taken from entering the terminal, to checking in, passing through security channels and boarding a plane is less than 20 minutes, while passengers at other airports need at least 40 minutes to complete such procedures.However, unlike me, many passengers have been grateful to choose Nanyuan, as it offers budget flights between Beijing and their hometowns, which may still have no direct train services to the capital.Many people said it was the first time they had taken such flights. China United Airlines has nearly 50 routes to remote cities, which other airlines at Beijing Capital International Airport are not willing to operate.According to the Civil Aviation Administration of China, in 1949, there were 36 airports in the country. By the end of June, the number had soared to 236, with some seven new facilities opening in the past decade.However, Li Xunlei, chief economist for Zhongtai Securities, said in a report in January that about 1 billion Chinese have never taken a flight.That was when I began to adopt a warmer approach to Nanyuan Airport, as such facilities helped to make it affordable for people to fly.In recent years, Nanyuan has undergone two large-scale expansions in an attempt to handle more passengers, but the 109-year-old airport still finds it difficult to keep pace with the booming civil aviation industry, especially Beijing's ambition to turn itself into a major international transit hub in northern China.It will soon be saying goodbye to passengers, with Beijing Daxing International Airport due to open before Sept 30.The new airport, together with many more to come in the near future, will pick up the baton to make air travel an option for everyone.

                China to enhance global competitiveness in transport
            </a>
            <p>
                BEIJING - China aims to raise its global competitiveness in the transport sector by setting up transport networks with wider coverage and higher speed, according to an official document.The country will establish a comprehensive modern transport system by 2035, according to the document jointly released by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council.The transport system will be composed of three networks: a high speed network of high-speed railways, expressways and civil aviation, an arterial network of low-speed railways, national highways and waterways, and oil and gas pipelines, and a basic network of provincial highways, rural highways, regional railways and general aviation, said Wang Zhiqing, a senior official with the Ministry of Transport.China will build a domestic travel circle to limit commutes within cities to one hour and travel times to neighboring cities and major cities nationwide to two hours and three hours, respectively.Circles for speedy logistics will be completed to facilitate domestic goods delivery within one day, shipping to neighboring countries in two days and logistics to major cities worldwide in three days, according to the document.The country will also promote intelligent transport with the support of big data, artificial intelligence, blockchain and supercomputing and adopt an environmentally friendly model of development by saving energy and controlling pollution.

                Smart security check system launched in Guangzhou
            </a>
            <p>
                GUANGZHOU - A smart security check system was put into operation Thursday at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in South China's Guangdong province to speed up the security check process.The system, supported by big data from the airport's security check department, airline companies and the police department, is able to analyze the passenger's past travel records, said Luo Junhua, vice general manager of the airport's security check department.Passengers with "good records" will go to the designated self-service checkpoints, according to Luo. Simply showing an ID card and going through facial recognition, the passenger will pass a millimeter wave scanner to complete security check. Baggages will be placed in a box with a chip that will note the baggage information on the passenger's travel record.Currently, the system can be applied to passengers who have departed from the airport more than 10 times in a year. The airport said that it will work to expand the service range of the system.The system is one of the trial projects carried out by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). Earlier this year, CAAC said that it would promote smart security checks by adopting artificial intelligence and biometric recognition technologies.
