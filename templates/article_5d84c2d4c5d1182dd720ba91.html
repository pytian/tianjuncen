                Guangzhou Customs focus on travelers using their bodies to smuggle drugs
            </a>
            <p>
                Guangzhou Customs has vowed to introduce more effective and concrete measures to prevent people from smuggling drugs inside their bodies as the number of such cases increases.Zheng Jun, deputy director of the Bureau of Anti-Smuggling of Guangzhou Customs, said there has been a reduction in the number of drug smuggling cases involving passengers' carry-on bags and mailed items after great efforts have been made to crack down on such methods."But cases involving the use of human bodies as vessels to smuggle drugs now represent a bigger part of the total drug smuggling cases investigated and fought by Guangzhou Customs in recent years," Zheng said at a news conference in Guangzhou on Wednesday.To this end, Customs departments in the southern metropolis will strengthen cooperation and exchanges of information with foreign counterparts in the fight against the smuggling method to prevent drugs from entering the country and to help construct a safe, social environment, Zheng said.Li Si, a senior customs officer with the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, said customs officers from the airport, one of the three busiest in the country, have investigated nine cases of people using their bodies to smuggle drugs in the first eight months of the year."More than a dozen kilograms of drugs have been seized after cracking down on such cases," Li said.On Aug 30, customs officers found an Angolan man and woman with dozens of small bags of suspected drugs inside their bodies during CT examinations at a hospital after they detained the pair, who arrived at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on the same flight.The man later discharged a total of 60 pills of suspected drugs while the woman discharged another 80. All told, the contents weighed nearly 1.7 kilograms.The pair admitted to using their bodies to smuggle drugs when the pills they discharged were later confirmed to contain cocaine.Between January and August, Guangzhou Customs officers detained 15 suspects in 38 drug smuggling cases and seized 17.3 kilograms of various drugs. Marijuana and cocaine are the drugs most often seized by customs officers."We will never relax our vigilance fighting against drug smuggling, which has been the top priority of the customs department," Zheng said.Zheng made his remarks after Guangzhou Customs on Wednesday burned 312 kilograms of various drugs seized by customs officers in recent years. The drugs included 201.6 kilograms of khat, a plant that is a fairly mild narcotic.Khat is mainly planted in Ethiopia, Kenya and other African countries, as well as some nations in the Arabian Peninsula.Other drugs that were burned include heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana, Zheng added.

                Port portal for Sino-African pragmatic cooperation
            </a>
            <p>
                The construction at Kribi has opened up new possibilities for Cameroon and other countries and turned around the region's economy On March 2, 2018, the Kribi Deepwater Port of Cameroon welcomed the first merchant ship from Hong Kong. As of July 31,2019, the container throughput, or amount of material or items passing through the port, had exceeded 200,000 twenty-foot equivalent unit. Both container and multi-purpose terminal throughput and market share have increased, with various taxes and fees exceeding $100 million. The dream of Cameroon's people for more than 30 years has finally become a reality thanks to pragmatic cooperation between China and Cameroon. Located in the southwestern part of the Republic of Cameroon, Kribi, on the edge of the Gulf of Guinea, is a beautiful coastal city. Since 1980, the Cameroon government hoped to build a deepwater port there and give full play to the natural and regional advantages of its natural harbor while evading the shallow water problem at the country's only existing then port at Douala. Large ships cannot be docked there, and even cargo unloading efficiency is low. Cameroon had first pinned its hopes to build a deepwater port on the West, but no Western country, business or financial institution responded positively, forcing it to put the plan on hold. Then came the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in 2006.It helped deepen pragmatic cooperation between China and Africa in various fields. And Cameroon once again began hoping the Kribi deepwater port was possible. In April 2007, the China Harbor Engineering Corporation was invited to send a delegation to Kribi. CHEC submitted the Kribi deepwater port construction and financing plan to the Cameroon government in 2008. After various consultative meetings with CHEC and Chinese financial institutions, the Cameroon government was eventually convinced of China's strong engineering and technical strength and mature financing solutions. The first phase of the Kribi Deepwater Port project officially got off in June 2011. A 50,000 metric ton container terminal and a 40,000-ton multi-purpose terminal were built and completed in June 2014, making an important contribution to the local economy's development. The project attaches great importance to localization, employs a large number of local people to participate in the project's construction and has trained a large number of technical talents. These talents have become an important force in Cameroon's construction. The project has greatly improved infrastructure conditions in Cameroon, its independent development capability and strategic position in the region's economy. The deepwater port's 16-meter depth allows for large ships to be docked directly at Kribi. Cargo handling efficiency has improved while costs have greatly reduced. In fact, the project has opened up new ports for Cameroon and countries in the region and improved the transportation and logistics environment. It has created favorable conditions for Cameroon to realize its development goal of becoming an emerging country in 2035 and for the economic and social development of Central Africa as a whole. The project has directly and indirectly created a large number of entrepreneurial and employment opportunities for the Kribi area, contributing to its prosperity. It has also contributed a large amount of tax, thus providing financial support for the next step of implementing the Port-surrounding Comprehensive Development Zone. The project has also created a new form of China-Africa cooperation under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative and the China-Africa Cooperation Forum. After completion of the project's first phase, CHEC obtained port franchise rights together with a French company, a first step towards transforming from an engineering contractor to an operator. This has helped accumulate useful experience for the next step of China-Africa cooperation to improve quality and efficiency, and realize transformation and upgrading. The Kribi Deepwater Port is a new flag for cooperation between China and Cameroon, even Central Africa. Chinese companies are also involved in major infrastructure projects including roads, ports, hydropower stations, power lines, water plants, communications, and social housing in Cameroon. In the course of the cooperation, China has adhered to the concept of justice and to the principle of equality, mutual benefits and win-win cooperation. China has actively responded to the reasonable demands of Cameroon, providing its assistance in financing and technology. The China-Cameroon cooperation was achieved thanks to the concern and support of leaders in both countries. President Xi Jinping pointed out that China has followed the principle of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith and the principle of pursuing the greater good and shared interests. Cameroon President Paul Biya has said on many occasions that cooperation between the two countries is a model for international cooperation with Cameroon. China is Cameroon's top and most important strategic partner. Last year, President Biya visited China twice. The two heads of state agreed to give full play to the advantages of deep friendship and great potential for cooperation between the two countries and push China-Cameroon relations to a higher level. The vigorous development of China-Cameroon cooperation has also benefited from the continuous improvement of China's overall national strength. China has become the world's second largest economy, the top country in manufacturing and trade, and is approaching the center of the world stage like never before. It is committed to achieving peaceful development, and is also open to African countries taking the China Development Express. Cameroon hopes to strengthen cooperation with China to achieve its national development goals. In future, China is willing to work with Cameroon and other African countries and jointly build up the Belt and Road area to maintain a closer China and Africa community. At present, Chinese companies are actively planning to implement the second phase of the Kribi Deepwater Port project, and plan to promote the comprehensive development of the port area. It is believed that with the continuous enrichment of cooperation between China and Cameroon, Kribi will enjoy a more brilliant tomorrow. And also better promote the social and economic development of Cameroon. The author is China's ambassador to Cameroon.

                Pride of Africa rolls on with dreams on board
            </a>
            <p>
                Rebuilt 'Made in China' Benguela Railway an epitome of Sino-Angolan cooperation Recently, the Pride of Africa, a luxury train, set off from Lobito, Angola, and arrived in Dares-Salaam, Tanzania's largest city, passing through Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia and Tanzania. This was the first time in history the Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean were linked by a railway line and also the first time Angola received international passenger trains. Expectedly, it aroused attention, received extensive coverage in the domestic and foreign media and was "liked" by numerous readers. The Benguela Railway is an epitome of Sino-Angola cooperation since the beginning of this century. It holds jurisdiction over 1,344 kilometers of the 4,300 km Two-Ocean Railway across the African continent and is recognized by train passengers for its good quality and comfortable travel experience. The Benguela Railway, located in the central part of Angola, was built in 1899.It runs from the west to the east, traversing the four provinces of Benguela, Huambo, Bie and Moxico, before reaching the bordering city of Luau on its onward journey to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The railway was shut down for a long time and was severely damaged during the civil war. After the war, on the Angolan government's request, Chinese enterprises undertook and completed reconstruction of the Benguela Railway. The exercise was funded by Chinese financial institutions, giving the reborn railway the rightful tag of "Made in China". The railway not only plays an important role in the economic and social development of Angola, but has also become another important achievement for Belt and Road projects in Africa. At the end of the civil war in 2002, the Angolan government urgently needed some external assistance. Other countries were slow to respond, but China became the first country to establish an innovative financing cooperation model for Angola. It is not surprising therefore for Angola's leaders to have time and again expressed their appreciation for China's timely help and support. In just over a decade, China has helped Angola repair or build 2,800 km of railways and 20,000 km of roads, more than 100,000 social housing sets, more than 100 schools and more than 50 hospitals. China has also assisted Angola in the construction of the Luanda Provincial General Hospital, the Agricultural Demonstration Center, the Institute of International Relations and the Huambo Integrated Technological Training Center. It has sent five teams of medical professionals and more than 2,500 person-times professionals in business, training, agriculture, health, media, and policing sectors. Enterprises funded by China have actively fulfilled their social responsibilities in Angola, donating a number of public facilities such as schools, hospitals, orphanages, which have had good social repercussions. Angola has got a completely new look while people's living conditions have improved greatly. The cooperation between China and Angola is wide-ranging, large-scale, and fruitful. It is thus at the forefront of China-Africa cooperation and sets a good example for China-Africa cooperation in the new era. In September last year, China's President Xi Jinping pointed out in his keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation that "With a similar fate in the past and a common mission, China and Africa have extended sympathy to and helped each other throughout. Together, we have embarked on a distinctive path of win-win cooperation. China, the world's largest developing country, and Africa, the continent with the largest number of developing countries, have long formed a community with a shared future." The success of China-Africa cooperation is evidence that China attaches importance to interest and sincerity, and not to political considerations, self-interest or pursuit of unilateral profit. China has actively combined the "Chinese Dream" with the "African Dream" to help African countries effectively transform their resources into fruits of development, winning the support and trust of African governments and the people. There are new challenges but China will continue to improve its mechanism and use innovative ideas to expand the fields of cooperation and steadily push China-Angola cooperation to a higher level. In 2018, President Xi and Angolan President Joao Lourenco met twice to arrive at an important consensus on China-Angola relations and cooperation, and chalked out the direction for improving quality and efficiency of the cooperation. Since Lourenco assumed office, the Angolan government has adopted a series of reform measures to actively expand opening up, optimize the investment environment and promote diversified economic development. With Angola's participation in Belt and Road projects and implementation of the China-Africa Eight Major Initiatives, China and Angola have continuously expanded cooperation areas and formed new cooperation models. According to the National Statistics Institute of Angola, in 2018, China became its largest source of international investment while also being Angola's largest trading partner. Investment into agricultural, industrial and mining production projects by Chinese enterprises in Angola will continue to improve production capacity, tap the potential of existing infrastructure, provide new hematopoietic capabilities for Angola's national economy and create new growth points for cooperation between China and Angola. The journey on the Pride of Africa might be a short one, but it carries the original intention and mission of China-Africa cooperation, indicating a bright future for Angola and the whole of Africa. China and Africa will continue to promote the Belt and Road Initiative, the Eight Major Initiatives and develop trilateral cooperation with other African countries to effectively improve the independent sustainable development capacity of Africa. China is always willing to work together with African countries to create a China-Africa Community that enjoys "joint responsibility, win-win cooperation, cultural prosperity, common security, happiness for all and harmony between human and nature". We have enough reason to believe that the giant train of China-Africa Community will carry the "Chinese Dream" and the "African Dream" to a better tomorrow.

                26 pupils, two teachers killed in Liberian school fire
            </a>
            <p>
                MONROVIA, Liberia－A huge fire at a Liberian Koranic school killed at least 26 pupils and two teachers on Wednesday when flames engulfed their dormitory, in one of the worst disasters of its kind for the West African nation.The boys were sleeping at the school when the overnight fire began, said police spokesman Moses Carter, adding that an electrical fault could have caused the blaze.President George Weah visited the site in Paynesville, on the outskirts of the capital Monrovia, and said the cause was still unknown."We are here to encourage parents of the victims to have strength, because it is painful to lose your kids in this manner," Weah told reporters at the scene.The president's office said 26 pupils between the ages of 10 and 20 died along with two teachers. The police spokesman said 27 students had been killed.On Wednesday evening, the president of neighboring Guinea, Alpha Conde, said several of his country's nationals died in the blaze.In a statement he expressed "great emotion" over the deaths and gave his "deepest condolences to the Liberian people and the Guinean community in Liberia", adding that he was following the investigation closely."We extend our sympathy to the bereaved families. We don't know the cause of the fire yet, but we will encourage our investigators to find how it happened," he added.Rescuers in white masks and surgical gloves carried the children's bodies in bags from the burnt-out building as crowds of people and relatives pressed together outside."Our team is investigating the cause of the fire," the police spokesman said. "It may be electrical," he added, while refusing to rule out the possibility that the fire was a criminal act."I was sleeping when I heard noise outside. My wife opened the back door and we saw smoke coming from the front. We came out and saw fire at the back," said local resident Zazay Ballah, who said they had helped in the rescue efforts."We went for water, trying to put it out.... When the firefighters came, the fire was already going down."The victims were buried swiftly in a collective ceremony, according to Muslim tradition.In an earlier tweet, Weah offered condolences to the families of those affected."My prayers go out to the families of the children that died last night in Paynesville City as a result of a deadly fire that engulfed their school building," he wrote."This is a tough time for the families of the victims and all of Liberia."The Liberian authorities are all too familiar with deadly fires, often caused by malfunctioning generators, though "not on this scale", the presidential spokesman said.The majority of Liberians are Christian but there is a sizable minority of Muslims among the 4.5 million population.AGENCE FRANCE­ - PRESSE

                Peaceful resolution in S. Sudan promoted by China
            </a>
            <p>
                As China scales up its bilateral relations with most African nations, including South Sudan, President Xi Jinping's diplomatic approach is built on the precepts of peaceful development. The pursuit of peaceful development is derived from such Chinese axioms as "a warlike state, however big it may be, will eventually perish"; "seek harmony without uniformity"; "bring prosperity to the nation and security to the people"; "peace is of paramount importance"; "replace weapons of war with gifts of jade and silk"; "foster friendship with neighbors"; and "achieve universal peace". Thus, as China continues to build its relationship with South Sudan, Beijing draws a comparison with the youngest nation in Africa, which gained formal independence from the larger Sudan in 2011 through a referendum, after more than 22 years of civil war. Its comparison is based on China's own experience of economic transformation and rapid development after being ravaged by wars and foreign turmoil before the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Historically, Beijing began its relations with Southern Sudan in the 1970s, when China decided to send the first medical team of agricultural experts to provide assistance there. Thirty-five years later, the China-Southern Sudan relationship was still solid. This was evident in January 2005, when China was present during the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement that ended the civil war between the north and south of Sudan. In a further push for the two countries' bilateral relations, in February 2007, then Chinese president Hu Jintao made his first visit to Sudan and met in Khartoum with Sudanese first vice-president Salva Kiir Mayardit. Later, Kiir, as president of the southern independent government, visited China in March 2005 and July 2007. In September 2008, China opened its consulate general in Juba. After the secession referendum, which was overwhelmingly supported by the population, China became one of the international states that recognized the results. In July 2011, Jiang Weixin, then China's minister of housing and urban-rural development, attended South Sudan independence celebrations as China's representative. On behalf of the Chinese government, Jiang signed the Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between the two countries with South Sudan Foreign Minister Deng Alor Kuol. This signified the establishment of China's official diplomatic relations with South Sudan. However, despite the solid bilateral relations between China and South Sudan, the youngest African independent nation is still lagging behind in terms of development. The country is rich in oil but still needs modern infrastructure. Furthermore, South Sudan is also experiencing a humanitarian crisis. In December 2013, civil war broke out after President Kiir sacked his Cabinet and accused former vice-president Riek Machar of planning a coup. The civil conflict was fought broadly between the country's biggest ethnic groups - the Dinka, led by President Kiir, and the Nuer, under Machar. In a joint news release by officials of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, UNICEF and the World Food Programme, South Sudan was classified as one of the countries most affected by humanitarian crisis. In their report, the UN agencies indicated that approximately 100,000 South Sudanese are facing starvation. In response to the humanitarian crisis, China has recently signed two key technical cooperation deals with South Sudan that will involve Beijing constructing 47 boreholes and sending technical experts to offer guidance on project equipment in the newly constructed Kiir Mayardit hospital in the central Rumbek area. Hua Ning, Chinese ambassador to South Sudan, said these projects will enable millions of South Sudanese to have access to clean water and medical services amid a peace deal that is largely holding. In regard to internal conflict in South Sudan, China can and should do more to ensure peaceful resolution, without compromising its interests or traditional adherence to the principle of noninterference.
