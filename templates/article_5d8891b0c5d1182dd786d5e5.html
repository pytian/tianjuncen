                I'm writing this after watching yet another video on Sina Weibo that shows a toddler wandering into a road in a Chinese city and being knocked down by a car driven by someone clearly oblivious to the unfolding tragedy.That's the second video recently, and I've lost count of how many I've seen over the years. Friends in Beijing have also shared countless tales with me of children blindly running out in front of the car or taxi they were traveling in. Like the videos, such incidents are far from uncommon.Yet despite such horrific images being shared widely online, almost every day I see a parent or grandparent crossing a road with a child at an unsafe spot or while the walk sign is still red, which sends exactly the wrong message to youngsters about road safety.

                Alibaba seeks to clean up image
            </a>
            <p>
                Cash-strapped Star Wars fans can pick up Darth Vader figurines and light sabers for as little as $4.59. Tom Brady jerseys go for about a 10th of those on the National Football League's store. A pair of red Beats Solo headphones can be had for just $107 - about half its official price.It's bargains galore at Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's Taobao: the EBay-like bazaar where buyers meet up with sellers. Billionaire Chairman Jack Ma is struggling to shake the company's reputation as a haven for cheap knock-offs and unauthorized merchandise, 21 months after calling counterfeits cancerous. He heads into 2016 after a bruising year that saw more than $50 billion wiped off its market value amid lawsuits and criticism from Chinese and US regulators.Cleaning up its image next year is crucial to Alibaba's goal of winning the trust of merchants and shoppers overseas, from where Jack Ma wants to get more than half the company's revenue within a decade. A cooling Chinese economy makes that effort even more pressing. At home, JD.com Inc is winning customers partly because it holds the inventory itself and sells directly to consumers, similar to Amazon, a business model easier to police and regulate, said Michelle Ma, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.

                Mayor mocked for advice on avoiding assaults

                The mayor of Cologne drew online mockery on Wednesday for her advice to women on how to avoid sexual assaults like those that marred her city's New Year's Eve festivities. Henriette Reker, 59, told a news conference about last week's mob attacks on Tuesday that girls and young women could avoid trouble by staying over "an arm's length" away from strangers. The comment sparked anger and ridicule amid a heated debate about the ugly scenes blamed on men of Arab and North African appearance.

                Competitors take part in the annual Inter-Livery Pancake Race at The Guildhall on Feb 28, 2017 in London, England. [Photo/VCG]LONDON - Dressed as chefs, superheroes and villains, Londoners in colourful costumes sped down a street flipping pancakes in an annual race to mark Shrove Tuesday and raise money for charity.The Great Spitalfields Pancake Race saw young and old competitors take part to raise money for London's Air Ambulance.Cheered on by crowds, teams of runners dressed as Batman, Darth Vader and yellow "Minions" movie characters raced up and down an east London street on the traditional Pancake Day or Shrove Tuesday, which precedes Ash Wednesday, the first day of the season of Lent."The key is to toss it and then start running. Don't run while you toss because otherwise it might get left behind," said Alex Lopez, whose team triumphed in Tuesday's race. "I had some pancakes, just to get in the mood, get energy."Various pancake-themed events are traditionally held across Britain on Shrove Tuesday. Meanwhile in the English town of Ashbourne, players competed in the annual Shrovetide football match in a game said to date from the 17th century, in which the Up'ards and the Down'ards teams aim to "goal" a ball by hitting it three times on stone plinths placed three miles apart.Reuters

                Tribute to Star Wars heroes
            </a>
            <p>
                More than four decades after the first Star Wars film was released, the science fiction series still has fans wanting more.Now, Swiss watch brand Oris has launched two limited edition watches using symbols from Star Wars to mark the opening of its flagship store on the Chinese online mall Jingdong.David Weber, the director of the brand in the Greater China; Chen Wan, the manager of the watch business department of Jingdong Mall; and local actor Jing Chao attended the launch event in Beijing.Jing says the film series was part of his childhood. He cherishes every moment of that memory, just like he appreciates the charm of the brand that emanates from the passage of time.Oris, a 114-year-old Swiss watch brand, has been trying to infuse different cultural characteristics into its designs to create timepieces that are directed toward the needs and preferences of the younger generation.One of watches is named after Darth Vader, a key character.It is developed from the brand's professional dive watch, and features a series of safety locking bezels for diving to depths of 1,000 meters. The multi-piece titanium case is covered with a black diamond-like coating, and the overall black color with red accents echoes the dark side of the character.The image of the warrior is inscribed on the back of the watch, surrounded by his famous line, "The force is strong with this one". There are only 250 pieces of this watch.The other limited edition watch named Stormtrooper comes from the famous Aquis diving watch series from Oris.It is made of stainless steel. And its white-and-black tone echoes with the color of the armor of "White Soldier" Imperial Stormtroopers in the film.The back of the dial is marked with the helmet pattern of the Imperial Stormtroopers, and the words said by Obi-Wan, a character in the 1977 Star Wars film - "Only Imperial Stormtroopers are so precise". There are just 1,300 pieces of this watch.For both the watches, the pattern of the Twin Ion Engines (TIE) fighter is engraved on the zero hour mark.Also, the classic element of the Star Wars series - the Death Star - is cleverly placed in the center of the dial, surrounded by the TIE fighters and the Rebel X-wing fighters chasing each other, depicting the classic air battles in the film.Besides, there are the logos of "Star Wars" and "Lucas Film Ltd" - the studio that produced the film series - engraved on the back of the dial.The links to Star Wars are almost everywhere, but actually they decorate the dial inconspicuously, more like puzzles hidden only for loyalty fans to discover.Weber says that the low profile design aims to attract fans to purchase related products, and also regular consumers who are just into beautifully designed watches. The appearance of watch needs to fit both casual and serious social contexts. And he emphasizes that he doesn't want customers to buy a watch and put it in the safe, or take it out once a year for the wedding anniversary."Most of the Star Wars fans are between 30 and 50 years old, so they're not walking around with a Mickey Mouse T-shirt," he says.Oris has been quite active in taking e-commerce initiatives in China. It opened a flagship store on Tmall, another Chinese online market, and Jingdong this year.

                Fantasies come true: In France, the Force is strong with lightsaber dueling
            </a>
            <p>
                BEAUMONT-SUR-OISE, France - Master Yoda, dust off his French, he must.It's now easier than ever in France to act out Star Wars fantasies, because its fencing federation has borrowed from a galaxy far, far away and officially recognized lightsaber dueling as a competitive sport, granting the iconic weapon from George Lucas' saga the same status as the foil, epee and saber, the traditional blades used at the Olympics.Of course, the LED-lit, rigid polycarbonate lightsaber replicas can't slice a Sith lord in half. But they look and, with the more expensive sabers equipped with a chip in their hilt that emits a throaty electric rumble, even sound remarkably like the silver screen blades that Yoda and other characters wield in the blockbuster movies.Plenty realistic, at least, for duelists to work up an impressive sweat slashing, feinting and stabbing in organized, 3-minute bouts. The physicality of lightsaber combat is part of why the French Fencing Federation threw its support behind the sport and is now equipping fencing clubs with lightsabers and training would-be lightsaber instructors. Like virtuous Jedi knights, the French federation sees itself as combating a Dark Side: The sedentary habits of 21st-century life that are sickening ever-growing numbers of adults and kids."With young people today, it's a real public health issue. They don't do any sport and only exercise with their thumbs," says Serge Aubailly, the federation secretary-general. "It's becoming difficult to (persuade them to) do a sport that has no connection with getting out of the sofa and playing with one's thumbs. That is why we are trying to create a bond between our discipline and modern technologies, so participating in a sport feels natural."In the past, the likes of Zorro, Robin Hood and The Three Musketeers helped lure new practitioners to fencing. Now, joining and even supplanting them are Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader."Cape and sword movies have always had a big impact on our federation and its growth," Aubailly says. "Lightsaber films have the same impact. Young people want to give it a try."And the young at heart.Police officer Philippe Bondi, 49, practiced fencing for 20 years before switching to lightsaber. When a club started offering classes in Metz, the town in eastern France where he is stationed for the gendarmerie, Bondi says he was immediately drawn by the prospect of living out the love he's had for the Star Wars universe since he saw the first film at age 7, on its release in 1977.He fights in the same wire-mesh face mask he used for fencing. He spent $400 on his protective body armor (sturdy gloves, chest, shoulder and shin pads) and on his federation-approved lightsaber, opting for luminous green "because it's the Jedi colors, and Yoda is my master.""I had to be on the good side, given that my job is upholding the law," he said.Bondi awoke well before dawn to make the four-hour drive from Metz to a national lightsaber tournament outside Paris this month that drew 34 competitors. It showcased how far the sport has come in a couple of years but also that it's still light years from becoming mainstream.In building their sport from the ground up, French organizers produced competition rules intended to make lightsaber dueling both competitive and easy on the eyes."We wanted it to be safe, we wanted it to be umpired and, most of all, we wanted it to produce something visual that looks like the movies, because that is what people expect," said Michel Ortiz, the tournament organizer.Combatants fight inside a circle marked in tape on the floor. Strikes to the head or body are worth 5 points; to the arms or legs, 3 points; on hands, 1 point. The first to 15 points wins or, if they don't get there quickly, the high scorer after 3 minutes. If both fighters reach 10 points, the bout enters "sudden death," where the first to land a head-or body-blow wins, a rule to encourage enterprising fighters.Blows only count if the fighters first point the tip of their saber behind them. That rule prevents the viper-like, tip-first quick forward strikes seen in fencing. Instead, the rule encourages swishier blows that are easier for audiences to see and enjoy, and which are more evocative of the duels in Star Wars. Of those, the battle between Obi-Wan and Darth Maul in "The Phantom Menace" that ends badly for the Sith despite his double-bladed lightsaber is particularly appreciated by aficionados for its swordplay.Still nascent, counting its paid-up practitioners in France in the hundreds, not thousands, lightsaber dueling has no hope of a place in the Paris Olympics in 2024.But to hear the thwack of blades and see them cut shapes through the air is to want to give the sport a try.Or, as Yoda would say: "Try not. Do! Or do not. There is no try."Agence France-Presse

                New Disney area to showcase Star Wars story
            </a>
            <p>
                LOS ANGELES - The world of Star Wars is coming from a galaxy far away to become the largest single-themed land created in a Disney park. Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge is an adventure through the grungy planet Batuu where guests can build their own droids and lightsabers, interact with aliens and climb into the cockpit of the massive Millennium Falcon, where you will discover your mission and engage in a dogfight with Tie Fighters. The sprawling 5.7-hectare land focuses on a remote world in the newest Star Wars trilogy - so don't expect appearances by Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader. But some familiar faces including Rey, Finn, Kylo Ren and fan-favorite Chewbacca will be a part of the adventure as visitors explore the immersive world. Galaxy's Edge is set to open this summer at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, then in the fall at Disney's Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Florida. The lands at both parks are nearly identical and offer a mix of trading outposts, a cantina and even a wooded area where Resistance fighters have set up camp. Entry is included with a park ticket, but it'll cost more for guests who want to create their own lightsaber or purchase their own droid modeled on R2-D2 or BB-8. Walt Disney Parks and Resorts chairman Bob Chapek says guests inside Galaxy's Edge will have persistent interaction with Star Wars elements, whether it's Stormtroopers barking orders or the up-tempo, swinging music of a grimy cantina that yes, serves Star Wars-themed alcohol. "You will not think you're in a theme park," he says. "Every cast member will be in character, the food and beverage and language will be in story. The merchandise inside the shops won't be in boxes that say Disney on them. Everything is very immersive." In a behind-the-scenes look, a tour of Batuu shows the land is also filled with smugglers and traders hoping to avoid the First Order, the successor of the evil Galactic Empire. Here are some of the land's key features: Millennium Falcon Selfie opportunities will be abundant inside and out of the "fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy". The spaceship is the exact replica of the ship from the films, measuring more than 30 meters long. Inside the cockpit, a team of six people operate the spacecraft during an interactive experience that, just like the movies, will get a little bumpy. Rise of the Resistance This is where it gets real. On a full-size starship, guests play as new Resistance recruits and go on a journey. A hologram image of Rey will appear with a message before guests board their ship and take off from Batuu and head into the orbit. Savi's workshop Even though Skywalker, Vader and Yoda won't show up in Galaxy's Edge their lightsabers will. Guests will be able to purchase their popular weapon or hand-build their own. Droid depot Who doesn't want their own personal R2 unit? Guests - for an undisclosed cost - can either purchase a pre-built droid or build one in the colors of their choosing by picking pieces off a conveyor belt. Taste of Star Wars There's no such thing as chicken in Galaxy's Edge. That's Tip Yip, and the cornbread that you might eat with it is blue, gravy is green and cauliflower is orange. Much of the food is plant based with dairy-free mash potatoes and vegan meatballs. Oga's cantina While talkative DJ R-3X spins music, bartenders pour beverages. The cantina will be the first location to serve alcohol to the general public in Disneyland's 60-plus year history. Play Disney parks mobile app Galaxy's Edge is the first land within a Disney park designed to integrate with the app. It can help translate Star Wars languages and scan crates to discover contents within them. The app can also be used to interact with droids, media screens, door panels and drinking fountains. Associated Press  This rendering released by Disney and Lucasfilm shows the planned Black Spire Outpost, a village on the planet of Batuu that will be part of an expansion project set to open this summer in California and Florida.
