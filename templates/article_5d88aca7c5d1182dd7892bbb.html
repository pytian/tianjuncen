                A panel discussion on how technology in education will affect the future of education is held in Wuxi on September 21. [Photo by Pan Qi/chinadaily.com.cn]A Rewiring: Education seminar discussing how technology is changing education was held at Hyatt Regency hotel in Wuxi on Sept 21.The seminar invited guest-speakers to discuss topics related to technology in education, including artificial intelligence, and how it will impact the future of education.The guests believe that technology will greatly improve efficiency in education and that access to online resources and AI technologies will help students to achieve personalized learning.Wu Xiaoxin, co-founder and CEO of Zhongyu Science & Technology Company in Wuxi, described his company's dedication to providing better hardware and software to improve interactions between students and teachers.Wu said teachers using the company's online platform can quickly find students' weaknesses based on their assignments and make a short video to help students correct their mistakes.Mo Huangjing, a computer engineer and AI researcher, said that in some cases AI technologies are better than teachers when it comes to detecting mistakes.Mo also noted that AI's application in education needs a huge amount of data collection, the support of talents, and application scenarios.Trevor George King, a college admissions consultant, said that through adaptive learning powered by AI technologies, students can receive their own customized learning paths and tailored instruction according to their way of processing information, preferences, and goals.When asked about the challenges faced when bringing technology to education, Zhou Wanrun, founder of Olean Children's Education, said that many teachers are reluctant to transform their daily routine and also worry that they will be replaced by AI technologies which enable one-on-one mentorship.Zhou said that instead of replacing teachers, she believes AI will create new work for them, such as paying attention to children's personal development.
