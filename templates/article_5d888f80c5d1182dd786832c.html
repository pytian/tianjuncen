                ROK envoy holds phone talks with US counterpart on Korean Peninsula denuke
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                SEOUL -- The nuclear envoy of the Republic of Korea (ROK) on Tuesday held phone talks with his US counterpart over the Korean Peninsula's denuclearization, according to ROK Foreign Ministry.Lee Do-hoon, ROK's special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, talked over phone with Stephen Biegun, US special representative for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) affairs.During the phone conversation, the nuclear envoys discussed recent situations on the peninsula and actual measures to completely denuclearize the peninsula and settle permanent peace, the ministry said.The two diplomats agreed to meet in the near future for further consultations.The phone talks came after the DPRK fired two unidentified projectiles into the eastern waters from its west inland area earlier in the day.It marked the DPRK's 10th test-firing this year and the latest launch was conducted on Aug 24 when the country fired what it called "super-large" multiple rocket launchers off the east coast.Choe Son-hui, the DPRK's first vice foreign minister, said in a statement that her country was willing to sit with the United States at an agreed-upon time and place in late September to comprehensively discuss issues the two sides had taken up, according to the Korean Central News Agency on Monday night.Biegun said during his visit to Seoul last month that the United States was ready to engage in working-level talks with the DPRK for the peninsula's denuclearization.

                    Washington's tactics risk reversing positive Korean Peninsula progress: China Daily editorial

            <p class="style-content">
                Every walk of life has its jargon and taboos. But as the top diplomat of the United States, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems incorrigible in speaking the diplomatic lingo while wagging his tongue as he likes.At the American Legion National Convention in the state of Indiana last week, Pompeo once again accused the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of rogue behavior. Prompting Pyongyang, to label him, not without reason, as a "diehard toxin", while claiming that the hopes for talks on the peninsula's denuclearization are fading.Although the US State Department reportedly said it remained interested in pursuing the talks, what Pompeo said has undoubtedly dented Pyongyang's belief in Washington's sincerity.The impromptu meeting of leaders of the two countries in the demilitarized zone between the DPRK and the Republic of Korea on June 30 raised high hopes that the working-level talks the two leaders agreed on, which have been stalled since their no-deal meeting in Hanoi, capital of Vietnam, in late February, would be restarted.Regretfully, despite a series of concrete measures the DPRK has taken to show its resolve on denuclearization, the meeting, apart from demonstrating the leaders' rapport, has not prompted the US to carry on the positive momentum to sustain the constructive atmosphere with any tangible and cooperative moves.That the DPRK has fired several short-range missiles recently, to protest against the US-ROK joint military exercises near its border, should be regarded as a restrained and compelled reaction. It is the military exercises and the inaction of the US that is gradually closing the window of opportunity for talks with the DPRK.That explains why State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to Pyongyang from Monday to Wednesday — the first visit by a senior Chinese official since President Xi Jinping's epoch-making state visit in June — has attracted so much attention.Apart from strengthening their already solid bilateral ties, it is hoped that Beijing can take the opportunity to help turn the worsening tide again before it is too late by further strengthening Pyongyang's confidence in denuclearization.But if the US administration is intent on playing fast and loose with the sensitive denuclearization talks, it is jeopardizing any fruitful progress.Turning a deaf ear to China's dual suspension suggestion, Washington's superstitious belief in the power of its "maximum pressure" tactics as being the art of a deal will not win it any advantages, but only push the Korean Peninsula situation back to where it was before Pyongyang and Washington started talking.

                    Will Britain look East after Brexit?
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Editor's note: Whether British Prime Minister Boris Johnson succeed in overcoming Parliament's opposition and formalize the United Kingdom's divorce from the European Union on or before the Oct 31 deadline is anybody's guess. But how will the UK handle trade after it exits the EU and how will Brexit affect its trade ties with Asian economies? Two experts share their views on the issue with China Daily's Wang Kan. Excerpts follow:UK trying to maintain its overseas marketsThe British government began making arrangements for the post-Brexit era long ago. Britain signed a free trade agreement with the Republic of Korea on Aug 22, indicating it wants to strengthen its economic and trade ties with its Asian trade partner after it leaves the EU.Britain began negotiating a trade deal with the ROK to continue the bilateral preferential trade arrangement and avoid any negative impact of Brexit on its economy. The two sides reached a consensus on relevant principles in June.Thanks to the EU's trade framework, Britain enjoys preferential trade arrangements for about 40 items with more than 70 economies. Post-Brexit, the UK cannot avail of this preferential treatment, which would cost it dear in terms of exports and imports.That's why it started bilateral trade negotiations with other economies the moment it launched the Brexit process, and has inked 13 trade agreements with more than 38 economies.As for the ROK, it has its own considerations. Under the EU-ROK free trade agreement (FTA), many commodities from the ROK can enter the British market under the preferential tariff agreement.However, after the UK leaves the EU, higher tariffs could have been imposed on ROK exports to the UK. For instance, the tariff on ROK automobile exports to the UK could have increased from zero to 10 percent in the absence of a new UK-ROK trade deal.And after the EU and Japan signed an FTA, the pressure on the ROK to sign such deals with other economies has increased, especially since relations between Seoul and Tokyo have deteriorated. Therefore, the ROK needs to stabilize its exports to the UK so that when Brexit becomes a reality, the FTA would help the two sides to have preferential trade arrangements as before.Still, the UK would do good to also sign FTAs with more economies, Japan in particular.Ni Yueju, a researcher of Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social SciencesFTA with China in the worksAs the British economy is largely export-oriented, it is obvious that the UK-ROK free trade agreement is of great significance to Britain's economy, particularly because Britain could lose its global economic status after exiting the EU.Since Britain has to pay additional customs duties and can no longer freely export goods to EU member states after Brexit, the free trade deal with the ROK would help it to maintain one of its important overseas markets. Aside from the ROK, Britain has also signed FTAs with countries such as Chile and Switzerland, and is negotiating a free trade deal with China.The ROK's free trade deal with the UK can be seen as further opening up of the Asian market. The FTA with the ROK will help Britain to address some of the problems that Brexit is expected to create.The deal could also facilitate British automobile sales to the ROK. Besides, the UK-ROK free trade deal could be a precursor to such deals with other economies, especially China.Due to its reliance on exports, particularly on the EU market, the UK needs to take measures to sustain its export markets to cope with the negative effects of Brexit.The UK-ROK free trade deal, to a certain extent, could ease British exporters' pain, and arrest the slide of the pound sterling which is inching close to the US dollar in terms of value.Besides, it could enhance investor confidence and stabilize the job market in the UK.Li Gang, a researcher at the Institute of European Studies, Chinese Academy of Social SciencesThe views don't necessarily represent those of China Daily.
