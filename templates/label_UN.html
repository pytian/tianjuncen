                            The All-China Federation of Trade Unions also made an important contribution by publishing in March its Handbook for Promoting Gender Equality at Workplace to help female workers access equal opportunities and remuneration, maternity protection and a better work-life balance. Ensuring that female workers are free from violence is not only a matter of fundamental human rights, it is also essential to change unequal power relations in the labor market and ensure women's equal participation.Many have argued that it was about time for the international community to adopt such a treaty as violence and harassment at work have been persistent characteristics of labor markets for years across the globe

                            UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said a culture of protection in the Security Council and across the UN has been in place for the past 20 years, including the deployment of special advisers in peace operations to protect children and all civilians from acts of sexual violence in conflict."The Security Council should earnestly fulfill its primary responsibility of maintaining international peace and security, and strive to resolve conflicts by promoting dialogue and consultation and political negotiations, so that civilians can be spared from the scourge of war," he told the council in an open debate on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, held at UN headquarters in New York on Thursday.China's permanent representative to the United Nations on Thursday called for efforts to prevent conflicts by resolving issues peacefully for the protection of civilians

                             Recently, there have been attacks upon passing oil tankers in this area: it remains a matter of debate whether such attacks are conducted by pirates or are state-sponsored operations from a nearby country. A couple of centuries ago, Britain's Royal Navy led the armed opposition to pirates on the high seas, eventually reducing that maritime threat to life and international trade to a negligible level. It is simply not good enough for countries to leave it to the few, such as to China, Britain and the US, to combat piracy by deploying their warships whilst most countries contribute nothing to the battle

But only 13 of these were lower-income countries, the report said, meaning that those most at risk of cervical cancer are still least likely to have access to the vaccine
