                Sino-African cooperation on development path
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                At the recent coordinators' meeting in Beijing to evaluate the implementation of programs agreed at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in September 2018, China and Africa agreed to build a community of shared future, jointly pursue a development path under the Belt and Road Initiative framework, and safeguard multilateralism and the spirit of equitable and open cooperation.The Coordinators' Meeting on the Implementation of the Follow-up Actions of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation was another important example of China-Africa friendly engagement and practical cooperation, which will elevate the China-Africa Comprehensive Strategic and Cooperative Partnership to a higher level.Thanks to rising unilateralism, protectionism and bullying, economic globalization is facing various counter-currents including growing uncertainties in international relations, which have become the major barriers constraining the development of developing countries. China as the biggest developing country and Africa as the continent with the largest number of developing countries remain true to their original aspiration, and have joined hands to promote a community with a shared future for mankind, and usher in a new chapter of global unity, coordination and mutual benefits.Cooperation based on equality, mutual respectMoving forward by working together is the eternal principle of China-Africa cooperation. Sino-African engagement features reciprocity and bears no mark of colonization and invasion. China believes in equality among nations regardless of their size, wealth or strength, seeks no political self-interests in cooperation, fully respects the sovereignty of African countries, and supports African countries to independently explore the development paths that suit their own conditions.Africa is an important cornerstone of China's foreign policy. President Xi Jinping has visited Africa many times, and met with leaders of different African countries on multiple occasions, forging unbreakable friendships with his counterparts. And the 29-year-old tradition of China's foreign minister visiting Africa on his first overseas trip in the new year bears testimony to the affinity between the two sides.China and Africa have been mutually supportive on issues of core interests. They share the common goal of promoting democracy in international relations, safeguarding multilateralism, equality and justice, and protecting the common interests of developing countries. The two sides have developed a model South-South partnership despite the ever-changing global situation.Joint development is an important mission of China-Africa cooperation. China and Africa are committed to realizing the dream of national prosperity and people's happiness, and promoting common development through practical cooperation.New development opportunities for bothChina supports Africa's development and has always been true to its word. By implementing the follow-up actions of the 2018 FOCAC summit in Beijing, aligning with Agenda 2063, and working under the Belt and Road framework, the two sides are creating mutual development opportunities.China has been Africa's top trading partner for 10 consecutive years, and its overall investment in Africa is more than $110 billion. Twenty-four African countries have forged strategic partnerships or comprehensive cooperative partnerships with China. And more than 3,700 Chinese businesses have invested in African countries. China does not rely on hyped-up ideas or pay lip service to cooperation with African countries; it believes in putting its words into action. The follow-up actions of the FOCAC summit in Beijing last year are proof of that.China will be implementing more than 880 cooperation projects in Africa. Major projects such as the Maputo-Catembe Bridge in Mozambique, Africa's longest suspension bridge, and Guinea's Souapiti hydropower plant have been either completed or put on the fast track for early completion. The first Luban Workshop (China's vocational training workshop) has already opened in Djibouti. The China-Africa Institute has been established in Beijing, and China and the African Union have inked an agreement to build the Africa Center for Disease Control and Prevention. And the Dialogue on the Implementation of China-Africa Peace and Security Initiative was held in Addis Ababa.Turning advantages into development driversAll this shows China is taking actions to transform Africa's advantages into development drivers, making significant contributions to Africa's peaceful development on a mutually beneficial basis.Keeping up with the times is an essential feature of China-Africa cooperation, both in terms of quality and efficiency, in this age of economic globalization. In fact, China-Africa cooperation is expanding to new areas such as information and communications technology, digital economy and renewable energies.Public-private-partnership and invest-build-operate projects, as well as investment and financing projects are developing fast. And the use of renminbi to settle crossborder trade has made great headway.China is also making efforts to improve Africa's business environment so the continent can attract more foreign investment. China lays emphasis on indigenization of business operations, supports the continent's capacity-building and promotes regional economic corridors and development centers to facilitate industrial relocation and technological transfer, generating employment, taxes and foreign exchanges for the host countries.For example, the Eastern Industry Zone built with Chinese investment is Ethiopia's first industrial zone. It houses 81 businesses with a combined investment of $370 million, and has generated more than $60 million in tax revenue and created over 10,000 jobs, making significant contributions to Ethiopia's economic and social development.China remains committed to the idea of sincerity, real results, affinity and good faith and the righteous vision of justice and interests, and pursues green development according to transparent market principles in order to ensure the high-quality development of China-Africa cooperation.China-Africa cooperation is known for its openness and inclusiveness, and does not seek to form exclusive groups or spheres of influence. No wonder international investment in Africa has been growing rapidly in recent years.Sino-African cooperation is not about one partner being superior to the other. What matters is the substantive work China does for Africa's development. China believes that international cooperation with Africa should stick to the "Africa First" principle, and China is willing to work with all countries and play a complementary role to promote peace, stability and development across the continent.In this regard, it is pertinent to also say that the Belt and Road Initiative is not China's solo show, but a choir involving other parties for its implementation.Africa can accommodate all development partnersIn fact, China has conducted meaningful trilateral cooperation with Western countries including the United Kingdom and France, proving that Africa has enough room for all countries to cooperate and facilitate the continent's development. Africa is not a racetrack or hunter's arena for external powers. Countries that still have a Cold War mentality and continue to play zero-sum games should make room for the principles of "African Initiative, African Consent and African Ownership" to chart the right path for cooperation and win-win partnerships. China-Africa cooperation is exhibiting new vitality and a brighter future for development. Despite the complicated and profound changes in the global situation, China-Africa cooperation and win-win partnership are deepening. China will continue to abide by the principle of equality, fair play and transparency in Sino-African cooperation to build a closer community of shared future, strengthen bilateral communication and cooperation in international and regional affairs, and step up efforts to align different countries' development strategies so the fruits of cooperation can benefit more people and keep Sino-African cooperation on the stable track of development.The author is head of mission of the People's Republic of China to the African Union.

                Chinese investments in Africa should promote industrialization and strengthen the continent's self-development capacity In recent years, China-Africa cooperation has been hit by Africa's uneven development, Africa's inability to develop itself and its debt crisis since the beginning of the century. There are clear signs Africa's debt problem needs to be addressed. Unlike the charitable assistance from Western countries, which comes with various affiliated conditions, China is able to provide "coordinated industrialization" aimed at cultivating African countries' self-development abilities. Most African countries gained their independence in the 1970s. In the early days of independence, Africa's debt problems were not serious. During the Cold War, both the Soviet Union and the West tried to draw Africa to their side and provided huge loans that led to a rapid rise in the debt ratio of African countries. By 1980, Africa's overall debt ratio had risen to 24.22 percent. Since 2000, Africa's economy has enjoyed strong growth. From 2000 to 2015, its average annual GDP growth rate reached 5.5 percent. Western financial markets have provided a lot of capital to Africa because of their optimistic assessment of its economic prospects. The aid provided by Western countries did not solve Africa's development and debt problems, as it did not help Africa strengthen its capacity for self-development. It ended up being charitable assistance with various conditions attached. So if China is going to really help African countries, it needs to help them find the path of industrialization, support manufacturing capacity which suits the different development stages of African countries and attach great importance to the relationship between the transformation of China's manufacturing industry and Africa's industrialization needs. China is still a developing country; its industrialization drive is still under way. But through the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative and its overseas development assistance, China hopes to change the predicament faced by African countries to help build a community with a shared future for all mankind. Four things are required to advance Africa's industrialization in a coordinated way: First, China should concentrate its investment in countries and regions with better conditions. Seen from the current debt crisis there are obvious differences among African countries, some countries are still stuck in a debt crisis, while others have been able to deal with it, and have a strong ability to maintain sustainable development and political stability. When selecting which African countries to invest in, China should opt for those with good economic conditions, stable political situations, good industrial structures and strong sustainable development capacity, such as South Africa, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, Cote d'Ivoire and Angola. African countries generally suffer from unbalanced development. After selecting the countries in which to invest, we also need to evaluate the cities. Due to the current strong demand for export-oriented industries in Africa, it is suggested that port cities on the east and west sides of the continent be the priority. Some countries and cities with large population bases and strong consumption capacity can also be considered. Second, China should increase its investment in manufacturing. The last round of large-scale investment was in infrastructure construction in Africa, which did not directly bring self-development to Africa, but laid a good foundation for the development of the manufacturing industry with ports, airports, other transportation networks and energy supplies. Third, investment projects should be located in industrial parks. At present, the investment and business environments in African countries are still unfavorable. To create conditions for the manufacturing industry to take root, industrial parks are needed as the means to create a sound business environment quickly. Developing the manufacturing industry in industrial parks can also improve the industrial chain and supporting industries, which is conducive to the agglomeration and development of manufacturing. China's establishment of overseas industrial parks in Africa over the past 10 years points the direction for this round of overseas industrial parks. Also the current situation of manufacturing transfer is much better than it was 10 years ago, so the probability of success is higher. Fourth, the current project contracting mode has many disadvantages. Since the project contractor does not bear investment risks, it is easy to cause low investment efficiency. For example, it is easy to exaggerate the significance of the construction project, and raise the project scale and level, and there is insufficient consideration of the demand for the operation period during the construction. To improve the efficiency of investment and promote the sustainability of China-Africa infrastructure cooperation, the mode of infrastructure cooperation and investment and financing should be changed. For example, once a project contractor participates in the investment of a contracted project, it needs to bear the corresponding investment risk, and carry out more scientific demonstration of the construction scale and standards of the project. At the same time, the loan repayment ability and economic benefits of the project need to be considered to avoid the investment being wasted, and improve the efficiency of investment and avoid a large amount of debt to the host country. In addition, local staff in Africa, both general technical workers and local managers, should be trained in the operation process. After a long period of operation, the whole project should be transferred to the host country. Training local staff and providing long-term and stable employment opportunities for local people will create favorable public sentiment for Chinese investments and will promote cultural integration between China and Africa. Training should also be provided for management personnel in African countries. The advanced corporate governance experience and management processes of China's operating companies should be taught to local management personnel to realize the localization and sustainable operation of projects.
