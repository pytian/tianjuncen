                    Shanghai leads nation in new era of garbage sorting
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                A municipal regulation on waste management has shown promise in Shanghai in the past two months, as the city leads China into an era of compulsory garbage sorting and recycling.Since the regulation took effect on July 1, up to 9,200 metric tons of kitchen garbage have been handled separately per day, an increase of 130 percent from the end of last year, official data has shown.The city's ability to recycle kitchen waste has improved as well. Up to 4,600 tons of organic garbage is reused per day, and the amount is expected to surge to 5,800 tons by the end of the year.The amount of residual waste is now less than 15,500 tons per day, dropping 26 percent from the end of last year, while the weight of recyclables hit 4,500 tons per day, five times higher than the end of last year, according to Shanghai Landscaping and City Appearance Administrative Bureau."Appropriate waste sorting preserves the living environment and saves nature resources," said Deng Jianping, director of the bureau. "Led by the central government, Shanghai is endeavoring to develop long-term solutions to garbage management."President Xi Jinping visited a community center in Hongkou district during his two-day inspection in Shanghai on Nov 6 and 7. He stressed that waste sorting is a new fashion and Shanghai should ensure garbage management is done well.The municipality stipulated that residents should classify garbage into four categories: recyclables, kitchen waste, hazardous waste and residual waste.

            <p class="style-content">
                Like many outdated or old electronics, the final days of life for a TV are waiting to be dismantled and disposed of. A young man called Li Meng in Jining, East China's Shandong province, however, has turned what would have been waste into wealth with his ingenuity.From TV fish tanks to bottle speakers, these are just a glimpse of the eye-catching handicrafts from Li, who used to be a chef. He now has his own studio and even self-made tools for unconstrained creation, turning old, forgotten items into new gadgets while teaching thousands of people to take on a new art-form of recycling via live-streaming.

                    Recycled plastic sports gear gives consumers eco-friendly alternative

            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                The country's top sportswear producer Anta Sports Products Ltd has rolled out its first series of environmentally friendly athletic products using recycled plastic bottles.The bottles were collected from the ocean to contribute to environmental protection efforts, as well as to satisfy the growing number of eco-conscious Chinese consumers.The first batch of sports products – A-awake Energy — is now available at all Anta-branded stores in the country.Each product uses recycled polyester from about 11 waste 550-milliliter plastic bottles. This series, in its third season this year, has recycled an equivalent of about 7.7 million bottles.Cheng Qiong, chief designer of this eco-friendly series, said the company has managed to lower its costs by 30 to 50 percent compared with environmental friendly products produced by other international sports brands.Traceable technology in the recycled polyester has allowed tracking from textile to fabric to finished product to ensure the quality of environmental protection.Ding Shizhong, chairman of Anta Group, said the group has been dedicated to contributing to environmental protection causes as part of the company's social responsibilities.In the coming years, the company will continue to enhance technology advancement to protect the environment and join hands with consumers, he said.

                    China wages war against delivery packaging waste
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                China, the world's largest express delivery market, has been waging a war against waste produced by delivery services through tougher regulations and environmentally friendly packages, according to the country's postal authority.Over 50.7 billion parcels were delivered last year by express delivery, accounting for more than 50 percent of the world market.The average annual growth of the express delivery industry stood at 41.5 percent over the past 30 years, said Ma Junsheng, head of China's State Post Bureau."The total number of express deliveries will without any doubt top 60 billion this year," he said at a news conference at the State Council Information Office on Tuesday. "Such great numbers of parcels create much convenience, as well as a lot of packaging waste."The current standard includes recommendations for packaging material that is not effective enough, so the bureau is drawing up a tougher regulation targeting green logistics to reduce plastic pollution, he said."So far, 96 percent of the courier deliveries have adopted digital waybills, and 12,000 waste sorting devices have been deployed in courier service branches nationwide," he said, adding that 45 percent of products sold on e-commerce platforms no longer use secondary packaging.But the express firms still fell short of using recycled environmentally friendly packaging. The bureau has required 70 percent of its packaging materials to be renewable by the end of this year, up from only 44 percent now.Liu Jiang, a researcher with the Development and Research Center of the State Post Bureau, said that although China has a huge market share and rapid growth that outperforms its counterparts around the world, it is still lagging in terms of green logistics services."But many delivery companies were caught in the dilemma of high costs and low margins," he said. "Lack of funds made it difficult for them to handle the problem alone. This led to the cooperation of enterprises in the industrial chain such as the e-commerce platform."By the end of last year, 95 percent of the townships across China had delivery service outlets. The sector raked in 1.2 trillion yuan ($175 billion) of revenue in 2018.
