                Talks make progress, but no final agreement
            </p>
            <p>
                KABUL－The peace talks between the United States and Afghan Taliban have made progress after 16-day tough negotiations in Qatar's capital Doha, and conditions for achieving peaceful settlement have improved, US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said in a statement posted on his Twitter account."I just finished a marathon round of talks with the Taliban in Doha. The conditions for peace have improved. It is clear all sides want to end the war. Despite ups and downs, we kept things on track and made real strides," Khalilzad said in the statement.The US envoy made the comments late on Tuesday hours after ending the fifth round of talks with Taliban negotiators. The 16 days of hard discussions that led the two sides on agreeing in draft on counterterrorism assurances and foreign forces withdrawal."Peace requires agreement on four issues: Counterterrorism assurances, troop withdrawal, intra-Afghan dialogue, and a comprehensive cease-fire. In January talks, we agreed in principle on these four elements. We're now 'agreed in draft' on the first two," said Khalizad, US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation.When the agreement in draft about a withdrawal timeline and effective counterterrorism measures are finalized, the Taliban and other Afghan players including the government, will begin intra-Afghan negotiations on a political settlement and comprehensive ceasefire, he noted."My next step is discussions in Washington and consultations with other partners. We will meet again soon, and there is no final agreement until everything is agreed," Khalilzad said.The Afghan government also welcomed the recent political negotiations while the Taliban also backed the talks in a statement."We welcome US efforts in Afghan peace process. We hope to witness a long-term comprehensive cease-fire with the Taliban, and hope that direct negotiations of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban begin soon," Haroon Chakhansuri, chief presidential spokesperson, tweeted.However, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said that the insurgent group did not agree on any cease-fire or meeting with the Afghan government."It should be mentioned that no agreement has been reached regarding a cease-fire and talks with the Kabul administration, nor were other issues made a part of the current agenda. Reports by some media outlets in this regard are baseless," Mujahid said in the statement."Progress was achieved in Doha talks. For now, both sides will brief their leaders about the achieved progress, share it with their respective leaderships and prepare for the upcoming meeting, the date of which shall be set by both negotiating teams," Mujahid said.The latest development in the political negotiations came as more than 50 Afghan government troops and scores of Taliban militants have been killed in clashes across the country over the past couple of days.

                Twin blasts in Afghan capital kill at least 26, including nine journalists
            </a>
            <p>
                Explosions in the Afghan capital Kabul killed at least 26 people on Monday, including nine journalists who had arrived to report on an initial blast and were apparently targeted by a suicide bomber, officials said.The attacks, a week after 60 people were killed as they waited at a voter registration center in the city, underlined mounting insecurity despite repeated government pledges to tighten defences.Hours after the attack in Kabul, a suicide bomber in a vehicle attacked a foreign military convoy in the southern province of Kandahar, killing 11 children studying in a nearby religious school, police said."These attacks caused untold human suffering to Afghan families," said Tadamichi Yamamoto, the top U.N. official in Afghanistan."I am furthermore outraged by the attack which appears to have deliberately targeted journalists," he said in a statement.The attacks in rapid succession were a grim reminder of the strength of both the Taliban and Islamic State's emerging Afghanistan branch to wreak violence despite stepped up US air attacks under Trump's new policy for the 16-year-old war.Taliban militants, fighting to restore their version of strict Islamic law to Afghanistan, announced their usual spring offensive last week and there has been heavy fighting in several areas of the country since.Islamic State claimed responsibility for the two blasts in the capital, which killed at least 26 people, including four police, and wounded 49 seriously, Hashmat Stanekzai, a senior police official, said.The Afghan Journalists Safety Committee (AFJSC) said nine journalists were killed in Kabul, the worst toll for media workers in a single attack in the country.Najib Danish, a spokesman for the interior ministry, said a suicide bomber appeared to have posed as a media worker and blew himself up where reporters and rescue workers had gathered."We know that a suicide bomber pretended to be a reporter. He showed his press card and stood among journalists before blowing himself up," Danish told Reuters.

                'Significant progress' in ending Afghan conflict
            </a>
            <p>
                Talks between the United States and the Taliban, aimed at ending the 18-year-old conflict in Afghanistan, have made "significant progress", but analyst said lasting peace could take years to accomplish.In a series of tweets, US special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, said on Saturday that the six days of talks in Qatar were "more productive than they have been in the past". Without giving details, he said he was on his way to Kabul to consult Afghan government officials on the result.According to local media, the Taliban also said progress had been made in the negotiations. However, a spokesman added that talks about "unsolved matters" would continue.Khalilzad also emphasized that talks with the Taliban would continue and nothing had been finalized currently.A US delegation headed by Khalilzad met Taliban representatives three times from November to December and the fourth round of talks between the two sides began on Jan 21, according to the Associate Press.While some experts said the series of talks shows how serious both sides are about trying to find a peaceful solution to the conflict, others slammed the talks, calling the absence of the Afghan government and other regional stakeholders, a "blunder". Critics believe that the talks will not deliver results unless the genuine interests of Afghanistan's neighboring countries are ensured and an agreement is reached with the Afghan government.In a Xinhua report, Afghanistan political analyst Dad Mohammad Anabi said the ongoing talks in Qatar won't yield results because the government of Afghanistan has been bypassed.According to AFP, the Taliban have so far refused to hold direct talks with Afghan officials, whom they dismiss as "puppets". They said they will only begin negotiations with the government once a firm date for the withdrawal of US troops has been agreed.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on social media on Saturday that Washington is "serious about pursuing peace", reiterating the objectives of preventing Afghanistan from being a space for international terrorism, as well as bringing US military home.A starting pointYe Hailin, an international relations researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said making a peace deal with the Taliban is a starting point to peace."It remains to be seen what progress would be made further in the region as currently there are more than 20 extremist and terrorist groups active in Afghanistan," he said.He noted there has been progress in discussions about the Taliban's key demand－US troop withdrawal, but the process of the withdrawal would be long, and so far no timetable or details have been given.According to Xinhua's report, there are about 14,000 US troops currently deployed in Afghanistan. The death toll of US service members in Afghanistan has surpassed 2,400.

                'Agreements in principle' with Taliban
            </a>
            <p>
                Negotiators from the United States and the Afghan Taliban have reached "agreements in principle" on key issues for a peace deal that would end 17 years of war in Afghanistan, the top US envoy said on Monday.In a statement, Zalmay Khalilzad, the US special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, said the two sides have agreed in principle to the framework of a deal in which the Taliban would guarantee that Afghan territory will never be used by terrorists, which the envoy said could "lead to a full pullout of US troops in return for larger concessions from the Taliban".Khalilzad said those concessions must include the Taliban's agreement to a cease-fire and to talk directly with the Afghan government, which the Taliban have persistently opposed in the past.In a New York Times interview, Khalilzad said: "We have a draft of the framework that has to be fleshed out before it becomes an agreement."There is a lot more work to be done before we can say we have succeeded in our efforts but I believe for the first time I can say that we have made significant progress."At the same time, Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani also called on the Taliban to give up fighting and engage in direct talks with the government to reach a negotiated settlement to the country's prolonged crisis, Xinhua News Agency reported."I am calling upon the Taliban to initiate serious talks in return for lasting peace in Afghanistan," Ghani said in a televised speech on Monday.He stressed that the US and other foreign forces are in Afghanistan because they are needed and if there is to be any downsizing or pullout, the Kabul government will have to play a role in the talks.According to Reuters, keeping Afghanistan from reverting to a "terrorist haven" used by al-Qaida to conduct the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States－the catalyst for the nearly two-decade-old war－has long been a primary demand by Washington.Although the Taliban have been distancing themselves from al-Qaida, they have never denounced the group. Taliban fighters still intermingle with militants from other groups in parts of Afghanistan and maintain relationships of coexistence with some of them, Reuters reported.After nine years of halting efforts to reach a peace deal with the Taliban, the draft framework, though preliminary, is the biggest tangible step toward ending a war that has cost tens of thousands of lives and profoundly changed US foreign policy, analysts said.A senior US official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss continuing negotiations, said the Taliban delegation had asked for time to confer with their leadership about Washington's requirements for the agreement to hold direct talks with the Afghan government and to a cease-fire.Another senior Taliban official with direct knowledge of the talks confirmed the draft agreement on the issue of troop withdrawal and the Taliban pledge that Afghan soil would not be used against others. He said "working groups" would iron out details on a timeline.

                Afghan peace deal hinges on Taliban
            </a>
            <p>
                KABUL - Any peace agreement with the Afghan Taliban depends on the declaration of a permanent cease-fire and a commitment to end the country's long war, Zalmay Khalilzad, the US special envoy for peace in Afghanistan, said on Sunday.In an interview with Afghanistan's largest private television station, Tolo News, Khalilzad said the Taliban's demands were focused on the withdrawal of US forces from the country."Our focus is on terrorism. No agreement will be done if we don't see a permanent cease-fire and a commitment to end the war," said Khalilzad. "We are seeking peace and (a) political settlement. ... We want peace to give us the possibility to withdraw."The Afghan-born US diplomat arrived in Kabul on Saturday to meet President Ashraf Ghani, part of a multicountry tour ahead of his next meeting with the Taliban in Qatar.The United States has about 14,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of a NATO-led mission, known as Resolute Support, that is training and assisting the Afghan government's security forces in their battle against Taliban fighters and extremist groups such as Islamic State and al-Qaida.US President Donald Trump wants to reach an agreement to end his country's longest-ever war, which dislodged the Taliban from power in Afghanistan following the Sept 11, 2001 attacks on the US.Intense fighting is still going on all over the country, and while the Taliban are negotiating, they now control and influence more territory than at any point since 2001.A plan to cut the number of staff at the US embassy in Kabul by up to half, starting late next month has alarmed some who fear such a move could undermine the fragile peace process.Before Khalilzad embarked on his tour, the US State Department said he will "press forward on negotiations with the Taliban to reach a consensus on core national security issues, and urge their participation in an inclusive intra-Afghan dialogue".But the Taliban still refuse to negotiate with Ghani's government.Khalilzad told Tolo news that he had tried in recent weeks to foster such a dialogue, adding there had been some progress "but not as much as I wanted".Hopes for a breakthrough were dashed earlier this month when planned talks in the Qatari capital Doha between the Taliban and 250 Afghan government representatives collapsed.Hoping to renew the push for direct talks with the Taliban, Ghani has convened a grand consultative assembly on Monday.Reuters

                Taliban kill 13 in attack as peace talks falter
            </a>
            <p>
                The Taliban stormed a police headquarters in northern Afghanistan on Sunday, killing 13 police and setting off a six-hour gunbattle, The Associated Press citied officials as saying.The Interior Ministry said the attack in Puli Khumri, the capital of Baghlan Province, began at noon with a suicide car bomber striking the entrance to the compound and eight gunmen rushing in after the explosion. It said 13 police were killed and another 55 people, including 20 civilians, were wounded before the attackers were all killed.A police official who was inside the compound during the attack said the attackers all wore suicide vests and that three of them detonated their payloads, while the other five were shot and killed. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters.Kalil Narmgo, a doctor at the main hospital in Puli Khumri, said more than 50 wounded people, both military and civilians, had been brought in, including "several" in critical condition.The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack shortly after the incident.In the capital, Kabul, a lawmaker was wounded and his wife was killed in a shooting attack late Saturday.Police said on Sunday it was unclear if the shooting inside Mohammad Afzal Shamil's home was due to a personal dispute or a targeted attack. Shamil is a member of the upper house of parliament representing northeastern Takhar province.Meanwhile, talks between the Taliban and the United States have become bogged down over the key issue of when foreign forces would leave Afghanistan, Agence France-Presse cited a Taliban spokesman as saying.The Taliban and US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad have met repeatedly in the Qatari capital Doha in recent months in a bid to finally end Afghanistan's grueling war.While Khalilzad in February sounded an optimistic tone, suggesting a deal was within reach by July, the two sides have hit a sticking point.Before the US agrees to a withdrawal, it is demanding the Taliban put in place security guarantees, a cease-fire and other commitments.But the Taliban insist they won't act until the US announces a withdrawal timeline.In an interview with AFP, Suhail Shaheen, the Taliban's political spokesman, said in Doha that the two sides are trying "to narrow the differences and have an agreement on a timetable which is acceptable to both sides"."That has not been achieved so far," Shaheen said.Asked if that meant nothing would move forward until the US announced a withdrawal timetable, Shaheen said: "In principle, yes", adding that the issue might not be resolved in this round of talks."If we are not able to finalize it in this round, then ... peace would be far away rather than being closer," Shaheen said.The US embassy in Kabul did not immediately comment, but Khalilzad has repeatedly stressed the troop withdrawal is only one issue in the talks.For things to progress, he said the Taliban must ensure Afghanistan is never again used as a terrorist safe haven, implement a cease-fire, and speak to Afghan representatives.Shaheen said the Taliban are ready to provide the US with the security guarantees it seeks.It was not clear if the talks were to continue on Monday.Agencies

                Pompeo: Taliban 'overreached' in attack that killed American
            </a>
            <p>
                WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that Taliban "overreached" with a car bomb attack in Kabul that killed an American soldier, leading President Donald Trump to call off closely-held Afghanistan peace talks planned for Camp David.Pompeo said the Trump administration has recalled envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who has been negotiating with Taliban leaders for months in Qatar, and it will be up to the insurgent group whether talks will resume.Critics denounced Trump's plan to hold the Camp David meeting just days before the 18th anniversary of the Sept 11 attacks, and they said Trump was giving legitimacy to extremists who are responsible for the deaths of more than 2,400 US service members in America's longest war.Pompeo said Trump wanted to look the Taliban leaders "in the eye" while Khalilzad worked to finalize an agreement that would allow the US to start withdrawing troops. Pompeo defended Trump's planned talks, saying the presidential retreat in Maryland was an "appropriate place", given that it had been the venue for Mideast peace negotiations and other diplomatic meetings.Trump tweeted Saturday night that he canceled negotiations with the Taliban in the wake of Thursday's car bombing that killed an American soldier, a Romanian service member and 10 civilians in a busy diplomatic area near the US Embassy in the Afghan capital. The bombing was one of many attacks by the Taliban in recent days. Sgt. 1st Class Elis A. Barreto Ortiz, 34, was the fourth US service member killed in the past two weeks in Afghanistan."They tried to use terror to improve their negotiating position," said Pompeo, who appeared on five Sunday TV talk shows. "The Taliban overreached."Pompeo said the agreement in principle that had been negotiated with the Taliban included their commitment to break with al-Qaida. The Taliban harbored al-Qaida before that group conducted the 9/11 attacks against the United States."And then the Taliban failed to live up to a series of commitments that they had made, and when that happened President Trump said, 'I'm not going to take that deal. I'm not going to work with someone that can't deliver on their commitments,'" Pompeo said.The Afghan government says it doesn't believe talks between the United States and Taliban will continue "at this stage." Taliban said Americans would be the ones who suffer from Trump's cancellation of the talks.Afghan presidential spokesman Sediq Sediqqi confirmed that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had wanted to go to Washington to speak with Trump about his concerns "but I am not able to go into the details of the particular trip." The details of the US-Taliban deal that had been shown to Ghani last week "were not convincing," Sediqqi said. "Let's see the future."The Taliban said canceling the talks damages "the credibility" of the US, but that they think the US will return to the negotiations.AP
