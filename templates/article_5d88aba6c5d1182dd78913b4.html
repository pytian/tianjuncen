                House formally rebukes Trump's 'racist' remarks
            </p>
            <p class="style-content">
                Votes 240-187, mostly along party lines, to condemn ‘go back’ tweets to ‘squad’The US House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a resolution condemning President Donald Trump's "racist" comments in which he told four minority congresswomen to "go back" and fix the "crime infested places" they "originally came from".The resolution said the House "strongly condemns President Donald Trump's racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color".The nonbinding resolution was approved by a vote of 240-187 in the Democrat-controlled chamber. The measure referred to the Republican president's comments as "racist" twice but did not call him prejudiced.Four Republican representatives — Susan Brooks of Indiana, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Will Hurd of Texas and Fred Upton of Michigan — along with independent Justin Amash of Michigan joined Democrats in voting for the resolution.The proceedings were dramatically delayed Tuesday afternoon after Republicans said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's opening remarks about Trump's comments violated House decorum rules, which call for lawmakers to avoid impugning the motives of their colleagues or the president."There's no excuse for any response to those words but a swift and strong, unified condemnation," Pelosi had said. "Every single member of this institution, Democratic and Republican, should join us in condemning the president's racist tweets."Representative Doug Collins of Georgia formally objected to the remarks.After a two-hour lull, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ruled that the speaker had violated the decorum rules. But an effort by Republicans to have her words stricken from the record failed along party lines.Many Democrats wanted a stronger resolution of censure.Representative Tom Malinowski, a Democrat from New Jersey and sponsor of the resolution, however, said: "Let's focus on these comments that the vast majority of Americans recognize to be divisive and racist, that the vast majority of my Republican colleagues in their hearts recognize to be divisive and racist."Trump ignited a firestorm on Sunday when he tweeted that progressive Democratic congresswomen — three of whom were born in the US – should go back to their countries and not tell him how to govern America."Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came …" he tweeted.While the president did not mention anyone by name in his tweets, the remarks were interpreted as referring to four representatives nicknamed the "squad" — Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.Tlaib, a Palestinian American, was born in Michigan; Ocasio-Cortez is of Puerto Rican descent and was born in New York; Pressley, an African American, was born in Cincinnati; and Omar, a Somali refugee, moved to the United States at age 12.High-profile members of the GOP were slow to openly criticize the president's remarks. Some, such as senators Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah, along with former senator Jeff Flake and Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said the comments were "shameful" and "racist".Others defended Trump. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California answered "no" when asked if the president's remarks were racist. He added that he would tell members to oppose the resolution.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also defended Trump, saying, "The president is not a racist."Trump urged Republicans to vote against the resolution on Tuesday, branding it a "Democrat con game".In a closed-door meeting of House Democrats on Tuesday, Pelosi called the congresswomen "our sisters"."The fact is, as offended as we are — and we are offended by what he said about our sisters — he says that about people every day, and they feel as hurt as we do about somebody in our family having this offense against them," Pelosi said."This is, I hope, one where we will get Republican support," she said. "If they can't support condemning the words of the president, well, that's a message in and of itself."On Tuesday morning, Trump fought back, tweeting that the freshman representatives "have been spewing some of the most vile, hateful, and disgusting things ever said by a politician in the House or Senate". He then asked why the House wasn't "voting to rebuke the filthy and hate laced things they have said?"Later that afternoon, he doubled down on his comments, saying in part "Those Tweets were NOT Racist. I don't have a Racist bone in my body!"The congresswomen held a joint news conference on Monday to denounce Trump's comments. Omar said Trump was promoting "the agenda of white nationalists".Reuters contributed to this story.

                    Africa looks to China for tourism boost
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                Upgraded offerings, nature attractions helping countries improve earningsTo view the animals he saw on TV as a child, Chen Bo visited Africa twice - in December last year and in May."I stayed there for 10 days during each of my visits," said Chen, 40. "I went to several places in Kenya, such as Masai Mara National Reserve, Meru National Park and Kenya National Park."He was amazed by the diversity of animals there and Africans' efforts to protect them."I don't have any problems when traveling there. People there are very hospitable," Chen said.Janet Kwamboka, a manager at a travel company in Nairobi, is buoyant about Africa's prospects of drawing more Chinese tourists in the near future.Unlike before, she said, Chinese tourists do not limit their preferences. "Besides visiting the famous Masai Mara National Reserve to view the wildebeest migration in July, their uptake on new offerings is high and brings them to Kenya all year round. This is a boost to the country's tourism sector."Kwamboka said Chinese visitors now want to see rare wildlife species such as the Grevy's zebra, Somali ostrich, reticulated giraffe, gerenuk, also known as the giraffe gazelle, and oryx."They request to stay in hotels with golf courses. In addition, Chinese tourists take a four-hour journey to visit tea farms to experience tea farming in Kenya," she said. Sporting activities such as mountain climbing, zip lining and river rafting are also popular choices.Kenya counted about 82,000 Chinese visitors in 2018, a 37.7 percent increase compared with the previous year, according to Kenyan government data. However, the East African country hopes to attract around 1 million Chinese tourists each year.Kenya is the third-largest tourism-driven economy in sub-Saharan Africa and contributed $7.9 billion, or about 8.8 percent, to the country's GDP. The tourism sector supported 1.1 million people last year.Other African countries also hope to improve on the relatively low number of Chinese visitors to the continent.While Europe received more than 12.4 million Chinese tourists in 2017, according to in-flight digital advertiser PXCom.media, Africa received only a fraction of the 130 million Chinese outbound tourists. The China Tourism Academy estimates that Africa had about 800,000 Chinese tourists in 2017.African countries with the largest number of Chinese tourists in 2017 were Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa, Mauritius and Zimbabwe, according to Dragon Trail, a China-based digital marketing agency.Observers and policymakers believe Chinese travelers can improve Africa's earnings.Najib Balala, Kenyan Cabinet secretary of tourism and wildlife, said: "For a long time we have been obsessed with traditional markets. Nevertheless, emerging markets, such as Asia and Eastern Europe, have numbers to reckon with. We need to upgrade our offerings to capture smart, well-traveled Chinese millennials. We need to up our game."Besides low competitiveness, the continent's tourism sector has been affected by instability, epidemics and security challenges.A 2018 report titled "Sovereigns - Africa, Closer Trade and Investment Ties With China" by ratings agency Moody's said 10 African countries - South Africa, Mauritius, Morocco, Egypt, Kenya, Namibia, Cape Verde, Botswana, Tunisia and Tanzania - are most likely to benefit from increased numbers of visitors from China. The view is backed by the 30 percent annual growth in the number of Chinese arrivals since 2012.In recent years, the number of Chinese visitors buying Africa tour packages has jumped, according to the Luxury Chinese Traveler 2018 Report.A report by China CYTS Tour Co said the number of Chinese travelers bound for Africa increased 40 percent per year in the past five years.Ctrip, an online travel agency based in Shanghai, said it saw a steady increase in travelers to Africa in the past three years.The increase in Chinese tourists going to Africa is due to improved Sino-African cooperation, according to Rajneesh Bhuee, an economist based in Kenya. She said Chinese have increasingly become aware of the continent's offerings, thanks to the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation."This is besides the high-level visits by both China's president and premier to the continent in the recent past. ... Notably, these events have not only put emphasis on political, economic and trade ties but people-to-people relationships, which have a direct impact on tourism."The China Outbound Tourism Research Institute expects about 180 million Chinese to travel abroad this year, compared with 149 million in 2018. It estimated that the figure will rise to 260 million by 2030.Africa can benefit from these numbers by prioritizing the Chinese market, observers said.In South Africa, the tourism industry is pursuing new strategies to further understand the needs of Chinese visitors. Industry analysts said Chinese tourism is vital to Africa's economic growth."It is important for tourism businesses in South Africa to realize the benefits of becoming China-ready," said Mansoor Mohamed, the Beijing-based head of the Asia-Pacific region for South African Tourism. "We are dissecting vital information on how to enter the lucrative Chinese outbound travel market."Early this year, South Africa announced that it had signed an agreement with China for 10-year multiple entry visas that will pave the way for an e-visa system.According to Moody's, an increasing number of Chinese tourists traveled to Mauritius, Morocco and Tunisia without a visa, while they got a visa on arrival in Egypt and Tanzania.Upgrading offerings is also seen as a way to increase the number of visitors to Africa."We can no longer sell outdated offerings to the Chinese millennial. Some businesses have already invested in upgrading their establishments. Language can no longer be the barrier if we are to inject more earnings into our economy," said Balala, the Kenyan Cabinet secretary.Kwamboka, the travel company manager in Nairobi, said the hospitality sector has been trying to provide authentic Chinese cuisine and employ Mandarin-speaking staff. It has also invested heavily in providing Mandarin-language signs in popular sites, she saidZhang Jie, director of Ctrip's theme-tour department, said that in-depth and ecology-related tour packages in Africa have been increasingly popular among Chinese travelers in the past few years."I've visited a travel service provider in Africa who offers field training courses and travel routes close to nature, such as picking leaves in forests and appreciating birds," she said. "The travelers followed their guides and some experts in nature research to primitive houses where no modern bathrooms are available, but the travelers were really happy to be one with nature."Zhang said about 200 Chinese tourists have participated in such programs so far. "Travelers in the program can get in very close touch with the nature of Africa. It's a very good choice for them to relieve pressure."Data from Lvmama, an online travel agency based in Shanghai, showed that its users' reservations for tour packages to Africa from April to June increased 43 percent year-on-year.Cai Hong contributed to this story.

                    Ambassador expects more Chinese to visit Somalia
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                A new type of insurance that covers extreme situations, Global Travel Accident Comprehensive Insurance, was released last month in Beijing. Somali Ambassador to China Awale Ali Kullane attended the press conference and during an interview, he expressed his expectation that more Chinese travelers will visit Somalia.The ambassador started by clearing up the misunderstanding that Somalia is a land of pirates."We can say that Somalia now is in a better state than it was seven or eight years ago. I know that so many people associate Somalia with piracy, but there has not been a pirate incident in Somalia for over five years. With this improvement, conditions in Somalia are getting better," the ambassador said.He further added that in mainland Africa, Somalia is the closest country to China. The exchanges between Somalia and China date back hundreds of years ago. Famed Chinese navigator Zheng He visited Somalia on his goodwill trips."It is our responsibility for Somalis and the Chinese people to re-establish and enhance this connection, to make our economic and social ties much closer," the ambassador said.Kullane was asked about his expectation on the number of Chinese visitors who will visit Somalia after the release of Global Travel Accident Comprehensive Insurance. He said that, although the number of Chinese travelers to Somalia has increased, “we want this number to increase more, we want the Chinese to not only to visit Somalia, but also the surrounding countries in Africa. So that they could be more informed of opportunities in this magnificent land, and they can have more connection with Somalis through business, social or people-to-people exchanges.”What makes the newly-released insurance product stand out is that it combines common overseas insurance with crisis management services. It covers not only conventional accidents and emergent medical conditions that outbound travelers might encounter but extends to rescue procedures in extreme situations, so it is fully committed to ensuring the security of Chinese citizens traveling abroad.

                    Two Chinese among injured in southern Somalia terror attack

            <p class="style-content">
                MOGADISHU - Two Chinese nationals were injured in the deadly terrorist attack in the southern Somalia city of Kismayo that has since claimed 26 lives, the state president said on Saturday.Addressing journalists as he announced the end of the siege, Jubbaland State president Ahmed Mohamed Madobe said those killed included two American citizens, one British, three Tanzanians, three Kenyans and one Canadian. Among those injured were two Chinese citizens.Madobe said the operation at Madina hotel came to an end after the security forces shot dead four al-Shabab militants inside the building, adding the number of the dead had climbed to 26."Our security forces managed to avoid massive deaths by bravely fighting the terrorists. Our forces killed three of the assailants while another was caught alive," said Madobe."We can confirm 26 people died in the attack and 56 others sustained injuries," Islam said.On Friday evening, armed men in police uniform stormed Madina Hotel in Kismayo and started shooting.Witnesses said the attack was horrific. "The armed men were knocking people's doors saying we are government soldiers, then they shoot the people on sight," Hani Omar, an eyewitness told Xinhua by phone.Somali president Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed has strongly condemned the attack and called on Somali people to unite to defeat the relentless terrorists."I strongly condemn the heinous act at the hotel in Kismayo. I convey my condolences to the relatives of those who died in the attack and wish speedy recovery to the injured ones," the president said in a statement.Al-Qaida allied group al-Shabab has claimed the responsibility for the attack, saying four of its fighters entered the building with a car laden with explosives and carried out the attack.

                    Somali forces end extremist siege of Kismayo hotel; 26 dead
                </p>
            </a>
            <p class="style-content">
                MOGADISHU, Somalia — Somali forces Saturday morning ended an all-night siege on a hotel in the southern port city of Kismayo, in which the death toll has risen to 26 people, including a prominent Canadian-Somali journalist and several foreigners, officials say.Those killed include three Kenyans, three Tanzanians, two Americans, one Canadian and one Briton, said Ahmed Madobe, the president of Jubbaland regional state which controls Kismayo. Fifty-six people, including two Chinese, were injured in the hotel attack, he told reporters.At least four al-Shabab assailants attacked the Asasey Hotel Friday evening, beginning with a suicide car bomb at the entrance gate and followed by an assault by gunmen who stormed the hotel, which is frequented by politicians, patrons and lawmakers.The attack lasted more than 14 hours before troops shot dead all attackers inside the hotel compound, Col. Abdiqadir Nur, a local police officer, told The Associated Press.Somalia's Islamic extremist rebels, al-Shabab, claimed responsibility for the attack. Al-Shabab, which is allied to al-Qaida, often uses car bombs to infiltrate heavily fortified targets like the hotel in Kismayo, which has been relatively quiet in recent years.The attack is a blow to the Somalia government's efforts to hold nation-wide, one-person one-vote elections next year.Security officials cordoned off the site of the attack and prevented journalists from taking photos or video of the damaged hotel and in some cases destroyed journalists' cameras. Government officials have not been available for further interviews.Canadian journalist Hodan Nalayeh and her husband, Farid Jama Suleiman, died in the attack, Mogadishu-based independent radio station Radio Dalsan confirmed to AP."I'm absolutely devastated by the news of the death of our dear sister Hodan Nalayeh and her husband in a terrorist attack in Somalia today. What a loss to us. Her beautiful spirit shined through her work and the way she treated people," Omar Suleiman, a Texas-based imam who knew the victim, wrote on social media.Nalayeh was born in Somalia in 1976, but spent most of her life in Canada, first in Alberta and then in Toronto. She founded Integration TV, an international web-based video production company aimed at Somali viewers around the world. She was the first Somali woman media owner in the world.Canadian Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Ahmed Hussen mourned Hodan Nalayeh's death on Twitter, saying she "highlighted the community's positive stories and contributions in Canada" through her work as a journalist. "We mourn her loss deeply, and all others killed in the #KismayoAttack," he wrote.Nalayeh's endless "positivity" and "love for people" was inspiring, said Canada's New Democratic Party leader Andrea Horwath on Twitter."In Ontario, Hodan launched @IntegrationTV to tell the beautiful stories of the Somali Diaspora, and took that same humanity and love to her reporting and storytelling in Somalia. My thoughts are with her family, and the victims of the #Kismayo attack during this horrific time."A top official of the African Union condemned the attack."This is an attack meant to derail progress in Somalia as the country rebuilds and consolidates the gains made on peace and security," said Francisco Madeira, special representative of the chairman of the African Union Commission. "Somalia has made tremendous progress in seizing territory and pushing out the terrorists from many places across the country."He said the African Union's multinational force in Somalia will continue to work to stabilize the country.AP

                MOGADISHU, Somalia - Twenty-six people were killed and 56 injured, including two Chinese, in an attack by Al-Shabaab jihadists on a popular hotel that ended early on Saturday in the southern Somali port city of Kismayo. The victims included a prominent Canadian-Somali journalist. Three Kenyans, three Tanzanians, two Americans and a Briton also were among the dead, said Ahmed Madobe, the president of Jubbaland regional state which controls Kismayo. "There are also two wounded Chinese citizens," he added. At least four al-Shabab assailants attacked the Asasey Hotel on Friday evening, beginning with a suicide car bomb at the entrance gate and followed by an assault by gunmen who stormed the hotel, which is frequented by politicians, patrons and lawmakers. The attack lasted more than 14 hours before troops shot dead all attackers inside the hotel compound, said Colonel Abdiqadir Nur, a local police officer. Somalia's Islamic extremist rebels, al-Shabab, claimed responsibility for the attack. Al-Shabab, which is allied to al-Qaida, often uses car bombs to infiltrate heavily fortified targets like the hotel in Kismayo, which has been relatively quiet in recent years. The attack is a blow to the Somalia government's efforts to hold nationwide, one-person one-vote elections next year. Security officials cordoned off the site of the attack and prevented journalists from taking photos or video of the damaged hotel and in some cases destroyed journalists' cameras. Government officials have not been available for further interviews. Canadian journalist Hodan Nalayeh and her husband, Farid Jama Suleiman, died in the attack, Mogadishu-based independent radio station Radio Dalsan confirmed to The Associated Press. "I'm absolutely devastated by the news of the death of our dear sister Hodan Nalayeh and her husband in a terrorist attack in Somalia today. What a loss to us. Her beautiful spirit shined through her work and the way she treated people," Omar Suleiman, a Texas-based imam who knew the victim, wrote on social media. Canadian Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Ahmed Hussen mourned Hodan Nalayeh's death on Twitter, saying she "highlighted the community's positive stories and contributions in Canada" through her work as a journalist. "We mourn her loss deeply, and all others killed in the #KismayoAttack," he wrote. A top official of the African Union condemned the attack. "This is an attack meant to derail progress in Somalia as the country rebuilds and consolidates the gains made on peace and security," said Francisco Madeira, special representative of the chairman of the African Union Commission. "Somalia has made tremendous progress in seizing territory and pushing out the terrorists from many places across the country." Agencies (China Daily Global 07/15/2019 page7)
